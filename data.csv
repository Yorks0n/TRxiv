Notably, both variants carry mutations, S31del of KP.3.1.1 and T22N of XEC, that could introduce new N-linked glycans on the Spike N-terminal domain (NTD), emphasizing the urgent need to assess their potential changes in viral characteristics. Here, we found that both KP.3.1.1 and XEC maintained the high ACE2-Spike binding affinity and pseudovirus infectivity of KP.3. Importantly, compared to KP.3, KP.3.1.1, and especially XEC, could further evade the neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma, even those elicited by KP.2-like breakthrough infections. Interestingly, both variants demonstrated increased resistance against monoclonal neutralizing antibodies targeting various epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD). These suggest that the additional NTD glycosylation of KP.3.1.1 and XEC could enhance immune evasion via allosteric effects, and supports the future prevalence of XEC.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

We estimated population-level immunity to SARS-CoV-2 for each of the fifty United States (U.S.) and the District of Columbia from January 2020 through December 2023.

MethodsWe updated a model of SARS-CoV-2 infections to align with the latest evidence on SARS-CoV-2 natural history and waning of immunity, and to integrate various data sources available throughout the pandemic. We used this model to produce population estimates of effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease.

ResultsOn December 30, 2023, 99.9% of the U.S. population had experienced immunological exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through infection and/or vaccination, with 99.4% (95% credible interval (CrI): 92.4-100%) having had at least one SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite this high exposure, the average population-level protection against infection was 53.6% (95% CrI: 38.7-71.5%). Population-level protection against severe disease was 82.6% (95% CrI: 71.5-91.7%).

DiscussionA new wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-associated hospitalizations began near the end of 2023, with the introduction of the JN.1 variant. This upturn suggests that the U.S. population remains at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease despite the high level of cumulative exposure in the United States. This decline in effective protection is likely due to both waning and continued viral evolution.","NA","medrxiv",1729980537065

In this study we describe a bacterial immune system comprising both a caspase-like protease and a TIR-domain protein. We found that the TIR protein, once it recognizes phage invasion, produces the previously unknown immune signaling molecule ADP-cyclo[N7:1'']-ribose (N7-cADPR). This molecule specifically activates the bacterial caspase-like protease which then indiscriminately degrades cellular proteins to halt phage replication. The TIR-caspase defense system, which we denote as type IV Thoeris, is abundant in bacteria and efficiently protects against phage propagation. Our study highlights the diversity of TIR-produced immune signaling molecules and demonstrates that cell death regulated by proteases of the caspase family is an ancient mechanism of innate immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Translational PerspectiveHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a significant and growing global health concern lacking disease-modifying therapeutic options, reflecting inadequate preclinical models of the disease. Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we created the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, demonstrated phenotypic disease characteristics of elevated stiffness and slowed kinetics, showed transcriptomic consistency with HFpEF patient data, identified SERCA2a as a key downregulated gene, performed dosing titration of SERCA2a gene therapy, and showed improvement of cardiac kinetics post-treatment.

HASTY (HST), a karyopherin protein, has been implicated in miRNA biogenesis and movement, though its role in non-cell-autonomous miRNA movement remains unclear. Through a genetic screen, we identified that mutations in the HAWAIIAN SKIRT (HWS) gene suppress the developmental defects of hst mutants by restoring miRNA movement. Our findings show that HWS interacts with nuclear transport factors and nuclear pore complex (NPC) components, including NUP1, positioning HWS as a regulator of miRNA nuclear export. Using microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we showed that pri-miRNA transcription, and likely their co-transcriptional processing, occurs at the nuclear pore. Notably, we uncovered an antagonistic relationship between HST and HWS in regulating MIRNA transcription at the NPC and AGO1 loading, which could explain the observed changes in miRNA movement. HST promotes the association of MIRNA loci with the NPC, likely facilitating co-transcriptional processing, while HWS negatively regulates this process by targeting MEDIATOR complex subunits to degradation detaching, consequently, the processing complex from the NPC. Furthermore, our data provides evidence of spatial coordination of miRNA transcription, biogenesis, and movement highlighting a novel role for the NPC in the miRNA pathway.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

While some satellite DNA types have well-established roles in centromere biology, other abundant satellite DNAs have poorly characterized functions. For example, Human Satellite 3 (HSat3), which makes up roughly 2% of the human genome, forms enormous arrays up to tens of megabases, but these arrays play no known roles in centromere function and were almost fully excluded from genome assemblies until recently. As a result, these massive genomic regions have remained relatively understudied, and the potential functional roles of HSat3 have remained largely unknown. To address this, we performed a systematic screen for novel HSat3 binding factors. Our work revealed HSat3 arrays contain high densities of transcription factor (TF) motifs that are bound by factors related to multiple, highly conserved signaling pathways. Unexpectedly, the most enriched TFs in HSat3 belong to the Hippo pathway transcription effector family TEAD. We found that TEAD recruits the co-activator YAP to HSat3 regions in a cell-state specific manner. Using RNA polymerase-I reporter assays, targeted repression of HSat3, inducible degradation of YAP, and super-resolution microscopy, we show that HSat3 arrays can localize YAP/TEAD inside the nucleolus, where YAP regulates RNA Polymerase-I activity. Beyond revealing a direct relationship between the Hippo pathway and ribosomal DNA regulation, this work demonstrates that satellite DNA can encode multiple transcription factor binding motifs, defining a new role for these enormous genomic elements.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

Here, we develop an experimentally-constrained biophysical network model of neocortical circuit motifs, focusing on layers 2-3 of the primary visual cortex (V1). We investigate the role of four major cortical interneuron classes in a competitive-cooperative computational primitive and validate these circuit motifs implemented soft winner-take-all (sWTA) computation for gain modulation, signal restoration, and context-dependent multistability. Using a novel parameter mapping technique, we configured IBMs TrueNorth (TN) chip to implement sWTA computations, mirroring biological neural dynamics. Retrospectively, we observed a strong correspondence between the biophysical model and the TN hardware parameters, particularly in the roles of four key inhibitory neuron classes: Parvalbumin (feedforward inhibition), Somatostatin (feedback inhibition), VIP (disinhibition), and LAMP5 (gain normalization). Moreover, the sparse coupling of this sWTA motif was also able to simulate a two-state neural state machine on the TN chip, replicating working memory dynamics essential for cognitive tasks. Additionally, integrating the sWTA computation as a preprocessing layer in the Vision Transformer (ViT) enhanced its performance on the MNIST digit classification task, demonstrating improved generalization to previously unseen data and suggesting a mechanism akin to zero-shot learning. Our approach provides a framework for translating brain-inspired computations to neuromorphic hardware, with potential applications on platforms like Intels Loihi2 and IBMs Northpole. By integrating biophysically accurate models with neuromorphic hardware and advanced machine learning techniques, we offer a comprehensive roadmap for embedding neural computation into NeuroAI systems.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 transmission from animals (e.g., white-tailed deer, mink, domestic cats, and others) back to humans has also been observed, documenting the potential of novel animal-derived variants to infect humans. We investigated SARS-CoV-2 evolution and host-specific adaptation during an outbreak in Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica), African lions (Panthera leo), and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) at Denver Zoo in late 2021. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from longitudinal samples collected from 16 individuals were evaluated for within-host variation and genomic signatures of selection. The outbreak was likely initiated by a single spillover of a rare Delta sublineage subsequently transmitted from tigers to lions to hyenas. Within-host virus populations rapidly expanded and diversified. We detected signatures of purifying and positive selection, including strong positive selection in hyenas and in the nucleocapsid (N) gene in all animals. Four candidate species-specific adaptive mutations were identified: N A254V in lions and hyenas, and ORF1a E1724D, spike T274I, and N P326L in hyenas.

Despite their importance, most of all current ecological theories have been formalized focusing on negative interactions such as competition or predation. The role of cooperation, or other types of positive interactions including facilitation and mutualism, has not been fully addressed, or, if so, always in combination with negative interactions. This fact limits our understanding of the unique features by which cooperation as opposed to competition promotes biodiversity. To address this gap, we introduce here cooperation into structural stability, a general framework to understand how species interactions and environmental variability determine the long-term persistence of species within communities. Compared to a pure competitive case, cooperation promotes three distinctive features. First, cooperation increases the opportunities for species to coexist. This feature increases the persistence of species with contrasted phylogenetic, functional, and demographic strategies that the environment would otherwise filter. Second, cooperation creates intertwined biodiversity where the existence of some species begets the presence of others. Third, cooperation promotes multistability by changing the dynamics of community assembly due to variations in environmental conditions. In conclusion, we present a fully operational framework to understand the unique ecological roles of cooperation in nature. It indicates that cooperation as opposed to competition maximizes the maintenance of biodiversity.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

Importantly, these novel lipids induced senolysis through ferroptosis, rather than apoptosis or necrosis, by exploiting elevated iron, cytosolic PUFAs and ROS levels in senescent cells. Mechanistic studies and computational analyses further revealed their key targets in the ferroptosis pathway, ACSL4, LPCAT3, and ALOX15, important for lipid-induced senolysis.

Male mosquitoes, on the other hand, are thought to rely exclusively on plant sugars for their energetic needs; indeed, this dichotomy is one of the central tenets of medical entomology. Here, we show that male Culex tarsalis and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes will readily take blood from a membrane feeder when reared under dehydration conditions with no toxic effects. Mosquitoes with impaired humidity detection do not increase their bloodfeeding rates when dehydrated compared to wild-type controls. While conventionally reared males ignore a human host, dehydrated males are attracted to and attempt to probe, with some success, although they cannot access host capillaries. However, they will take blood from a vertebrate host wound. When fed a blood meal containing West Nile virus, male mosquitoes can become infected with and orally transmit the pathogen at rates and titers equivalent to females. Finally, vertebrate DNA, likely from blood, was detected in wild-caught specimens of male Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes from Texas. These data suggest that under some circumstances male mosquitoes may be able to probe and/or ingest blood and transmit pathogens to vertebrate hosts, and that their role in maintaining pathogen transmission cycles should be re-examined.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

Alongside these introductions, inhabited and agricultural areas are spreading, and correspondingly most animal introductions occur in populated areas. Commensal species which can live alongside humans by making use of specific conditions, structures, or prey, have a significant advantage. Introduced mammal species often use anthropogenic features in their environment and demonstrate a higher tolerance of human disturbance, but their importance remains understudied in ectotherms. The Aesculapian snake (Zamenis longissimus) is an ectotherm which has been introduced beyond the northern extremities of its natural range. To understand their persistence, we radio-tracked snakes daily over two active seasons, including high-frequency tracking of a subset of males. We investigated snake home range size using Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimators (AKDE). Using AKDE-weighted Habitat Selection Functions we identified preferences for habitat features in a mosaic of habitats, and we used Integrated Step Selection Functions to further explore how these features influence movement. We revealed a particular preference for buildings in male snakes, while females preferred woodland. We demonstrate that the success of this ectothermic predator is likely tied to a willingness to use human features of the landscape.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

This review summarises reported contact- tracing data and evaluates the secondary attack rates (SAR) and factors associated with SARS- CoV-2 transmission in aircraft, to provide insight for future decision making in the context of future respiratory pandemics.

MethodsThis scoping literature review assessed studies published between December 2020 to November 2023 in Ovid Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. The inclusion criteria were based on the PCC framework (P-Population, C-Concept, C-Context). The study population was restricted to passengers and crew (population) to assess transmission (concept) in an aircraft setting (context).

ResultsThirty-one studies which assess SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 521 domestic and international flights were included in this systematic review. The SAR reported in the studies with an identified index case ranged from 0% to 16%. Significant variation in the reporting across studies was noted. Overall, the studies reported that using face masks or respirators by passengers and crew members during flight seemed to be a possible strategy for mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission while sitting within close proximity to index cases ([&le;]2 seats in every direction) was associated with a higher SAR.

ConclusionsOur results are consistent with sporadic clusters happening onboard aircraft. Close proximity to COVID-19 cases within the aircraft was associated with a higher SAR.

Investigating the spatiotemporal evolution of tumors can provide crucial insights into how intrinsic changes within cancer cells and extrinsic alterations in the microenvironment cooperate to drive different stages of tumor progression. Here, we integrate high-resolution spatial transcriptomics and evolving lineage tracing technologies to elucidate how tumor expansion, plasticity, and metastasis co-evolve with microenvironmental remodeling in a Kras;p53-driven mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. We find that rapid tumor expansion contributes to a hypoxic, immunosuppressive, and fibrotic microenvironment that is associated with the emergence of pro-metastatic cancer cell states. Furthermore, metastases arise from spatially-confined subclones of primary tumors and remodel the distant metastatic niche into a fibrotic, collagen-rich microenvironment. Together, we present a comprehensive dataset integrating spatial assays and lineage tracing to elucidate how sequential changes in cancer cell state and microenvironmental structures cooperate to promote tumor progression.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

Historically, fossils typically spent years in preparation to be freed from the enclosing rock. Now, X-ray and synchrotron tomography reveal structure that is otherwise invisible and data acquisition can be fast. However, manual segmentation of these 3D volumes can still take months to years. This is especially challenging for resource-poor teams, as scanning may be free, but the computing power and (AI-assisted) segmentation software required to handle the resulting large data sets are complex to use and expensive. Here we present a free, browser-based segmentation tool that reduces computational overhead by splitting volumes into small chunks, allowing processing on low-memory, inexpensive hardware. Our tool also speeds up collaborative ground-truth generation and 3D visualization, all in-browser. We developed and evaluated our pipeline on various open-data scans of differing contrast, resolution, textural complexity, and size. Our tool successfully isolated the Thrinaxodon and Broomistega pair from an Early Triassic burrow. It isolated cranial bones from the Cretaceous acipenseriform Parapsephurus willybemisi on both 45.53 m and 13.67 m resolution scanning data. We also isolated bones of the Middle Triassic sauropterygian Nothosaurus and a challenging scan of a squamate embryo inside an egg dating back to the Early Cretaceous. Our tool reliably reproduces expert-supervised segmentation at a fraction of the time and cost, offering greater accessibility than existing tools. Beyond the online tool, all our code is open source, enabling contributions from the palaeontology community to further this emerging machine learning ecosystem.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

However, cognitive abilities differ from one another in how they change with age: whereas executive functions, like working memory, show age-related decline, aspects of linguistic processing remain relatively preserved (Hartshorne et al., 2015). This heterogeneity of the cognitive-behavioral landscape in aging predicts differences among brain networks in whether and how they should change with age. To evaluate this prediction, we used individual-subject fMRI analyses (precision fMRI) to examine the language-selective network (Fedorenko et al., 2024) and the Multiple Demand (MD) network, which supports executive functions (Duncan et al., 2020), in older adults (n=77) relative to young controls (n=470). In line with past claims, relative to young adults, the MD network of older adults shows weaker and less spatially extensive activations during an executive function task and reduced within-network functional synchronization. However, in stark contrast to the MD network, we find remarkable preservation of the language network in older adults. Their language network responds to language as strongly and selectively as in younger adults, and is similarly lateralized and internally synchronized. In other words, the language network of older adults looks indistinguishable from that of younger adults. Our findings align with behavioral preservation of language skills in aging and suggest that some networks remain young-like, at least on standard measures of function and connectivity.

Significance StatementAll organs, including brains, change as we age. However, the brain is not a uniform structure: it comprises multiple distinct networks, each supporting a different aspect of perception, motor control, and cognition. We examine two cognitive brain networks using fMRI and--across two independent cohorts--find a clear dissociation: the so-called Multiple Demand network, which supports executive functions (e.g., working memory), shows clear age-related decline; however, the language-selective network, which supports comprehension and production, remains young-like on all measures of network function and connectivity, in line with the preservation of linguistic skills in older adults. These findings challenge the notion of generalized brain aging and highlight the importance of dissociable components in the brain and mind.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

Here, sampling healthy individuals, we profiled the kinetics and polyfunctionality of T cell immunity elicited by mRNA vaccination. Modeling of anti-spike T cell responses against ancestral and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that epitope immunodominance and cross-reactivity are major predictive determinants of T cell immunity. To identify immunodominant epitopes across the viral proteome, we generated a comprehensive map of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes within non-spike proteins that induced polyfunctional T cell responses in convalescent patients. We found that immunodominant epitopes mainly resided within regions that were minimally disrupted by mutations in emerging variants. Conservation analysis across historical human coronaviruses combined with in silico alanine scanning mutagenesis of non-spike proteins underscored the functional importance of mutationally-constrained immunodominant regions. Collectively, these findings identify immunodominant T cell epitopes across the mutationally-constrained SARS-CoV-2 proteome, potentially providing immune surveillance against emerging variants, and inform the design of next-generation vaccines targeting antigens throughout SARS-CoV-2 proteome for broader and more durable protection.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

Diversion of interferon IFN signaling was associated with increased expression of inflammatory markers, enhanced release of inflammatory cytokines, and delayed contraction of infection-induced CD4+ T cells.

Maternal urinary tract infection (UTI) during pregnancy increases risk for preterm birth; however, biological processes mediating UTI-associated preterm birth are not well-described. We established a murine maternal UTI model in which challenge with uropathogenic E. coli resulted in preterm birth in about half of dams. Dams experiencing preterm birth displayed excessive bladder inflammation and altered uteroplacental T cell polarization compared to non-laboring infected dams, with no differences in bacterial burdens. Additional factors associated with preterm birth included higher proportions of male fetuses and lower maternal serum IL-10. Furthermore, exogenous maternal IL-10 treatment absolved UTI-associated preterm birth but contributed to fetal growth restriction in this model. Using urine samples from a cohort of human pregnancies with or without UTI, we correlated urinary cytokines with birth outcomes and urine culture status.

The instability of all herpesvirus gBs have hindered biochemical and functional studies, thereby limiting our understanding of the infection mechanisms of these pathogens and preventing vaccine design.

The non-chromosomal inheritance of ecDNA during cell division is a major contributor to intratumoral genetic heterogeneity. At present, the spatial dynamics of ecDNA, and the impact on tumor evolutionary trajectories, are not well understood. Here, we investigate the spatial-temporal evolution of ecDNA and its clinical impact by analyzing tumor samples from 94 treatment-naive human IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients. We developed a spatial-temporal computational model of ecDNA positive tumors ('SPECIES') that integrates whole-genome sequencing, multi-region DNA FISH, and nascent RNAscope, to provide unique insight into the spatial dynamics of ecDNA evolution. Random segregation in combination with positive selection of ecDNAs induce large, predictable spatial patterns of cell-to-cell ecDNA copy number variation that are highly dependent on the oncogene encoded on the circular DNA. EGFR ecDNAs often reach high mean copy number (mean of 50 copies per tumor cell), are under strong positive selection (mean selection coefficient, s > 2) and do not co-amplify other oncogenes on the same ecDNA particles. In contrast, PDGFRA ecDNAs have lower mean copy number (mean of 15 copies per cell), are under weaker positive selection and frequently co-amplify other oncogenes on the same ecDNA. Evolutionary modeling suggests that EGFR ecDNAs often accumulate prior to clonal expansion. EGFR structural variants, including vIII and c-terminal deletions are under strong positive selection, are found exclusively on ecDNA, and are intermixed with wild-type EGFR ecDNAs. Simulations show EGFRvIII ecDNA likely arises after ecDNA formation in a cell with high wild-type EGFR copy number (> 10) before the onset of the most recent clonal expansion. This remains true even in cases of co-selection and co-amplification of multiple oncogenic ecDNA species in a subset of patients. Overall, our results suggest a potential time window in which early ecDNA detection may provide an opportunity for more effective intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

Recently, Transformer models have emerged as a powerful general-purpose architecture in machine learning, with potential to address these and other challenges. Accordingly, here we introduce the Genotype-to-Phenotype Transformer (G2PT), a framework for modeling hierarchical information flow among variants, genes, multigenic functions, and phenotypes. As proof-of-concept, we use G2PT to model the genetics of TG/HDL (triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), an indicator of metabolic health. G2PT learns to predict this trait via high attention to genetic variants underlying 24 functions, including immune response and cholesterol transport, with accuracy exceeding state-of-the-art. It implicates unexpected epistatic interactions, including those among APOC1 and CETP. This work positions Hierarchical Transformers as a general approach to functionally interpret polygenic risk.

However, the enzymes responsible for their turnover in plants remain largely unknown. Using a non-hydrolysable PP-InsP analog in a pull-down approach, we identified a family of Arabidopsis Nudix hydrolases (NUDTs) that group into two closely related subclades. Through in vitro assays, heterologous expression systems, and higher-order gene-edited mutants, we explored the substrate specificities and physiological roles of these hydrolases. Using a combination of strong anion exchange (SAX)-HPLC, PAGE, and capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS), we found that their PP-InsP pyrophosphatase activity is enantiomer-selective and Mg2+-dependent. Specifically, subclade I NUDTs preferentially hydrolyze 4-InsP7, while subclade II NUDTs target 3-InsP7, with minor activity against other PP-InsPs, including 5-InsP7. In higher-order mutants of subclade II NUDTs, we observed defects in both Pi and iron homeostasis, accompanied by increased levels of 1/3-InsP7 and 5-InsP7, with a markedly larger increase in 1/3-InsP7. Furthermore, ectopic expression of NUDTs from both subclades induced local Pi starvation responses (PSRs). However, RNA-seq analysis of WT and nudt12/13/16 plants suggests that these NUDTs have PSR-independent roles, potentially involving 1/3-InsP7 in the regulation of plant defense. Expanding beyond subclade II NUDTs, we demonstrated susceptibility of the 3PP-position of PP-InsPs to enzymatic activities unrelated to NUDTs, and found that such activities are conserved across plants and humans. Additionally, we found that NUDT effectors from pathogenic ascomycete fungi exhibit a substrate specificity similar to subclade I NUDTs.

Here, we discovered an unforeseen two-tier mechanism of neutrophil recruitment during infections, in which mechanosensing is key to initiating innate immunity. Leveraging a skin infection model and pathogenic bacteria and fungi, we demonstrate that the early recruitment of neutrophils is mainly danger-driven and partly reminiscent of sterile inflammation. Mechanistically, neutrophil recruitment is initiated by a mechanosensor-dependent pathway, involving the activation of PIEZO1 channels. This leads to LTB4 production, which, along with IL-1, induces the release of CXCL1, promoting neutrophil arrival to the site of infection. In contrast, later neutrophil recruitment is TLR- and CXCL2-dependent, highlighting a shift towards a pathogen-driven response to sustain inflammation. These findings advance our understanding of innate immunity by uncovering that mechanical and biochemical signals integrate into a circuit that initiates innate immune responses to microbial infections.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

While visual cortical areas did not show a significant preference, regions associated with spatial navigation were preferentially activated by visual objects. Electrophysiological recordings in the postsubiculum, the primary cortical area of the head direction (HD) system, further confirmed a preference for visual objects, which was present in both HD cells and fast-spiking interneurons. Finally, we found that visual objects dynamically modulate HD cells, selectively increasing firing rates for HD cells aligned with a visual landmarks direction, while suppressing activity in HD cells coding for other directions. These results reveal that visual objects refine population-level coding of head direction.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

We discovered a physical interaction between ULT1 and PRC2 components, particularly the SWINGER (SWN) enzymatic subunit. We further show that ULT1 significantly enhances PRC2SWN enzymatic activity in vitro, corroborating our epigenomic and developmental genetic data that reveal different ULT1 activity depending on the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex.

Liver damage has emerged as a notable feature, yet no systematic review or meta-analysis has comprehensively evaluated the biomarkers confirming liver injury in LC patients.

ObjectiveThe present study aims to examine blood-based biomarkers of liver damage in LC disease.

MethodsA search of PubMed, Google Scholar, SciFinder, and SCOPUS identified 61 eligible studies, including 7172 participants, with 3404 LC patients and 3768 controls.

ResultsOur analysis identified a significant increase in the liver damage index among LC patients, with a moderate effect size (standardized mean difference, SMD = 0.553; confidence intervals; 95% CI: 0.305-0.760) compared to normal controls. Additionally, LC patients exhibited marked elevations in alanine aminotransferase (SMD = 0.615; 95% CI: 0.351;0.878), aspartate aminotransferase (SMD = 0.352; 95% CI: 0.068;0.637), gamma-glutamyl transferase (SMD = 0.969; 95% CI: 0.194;1.745), and lactate dehydrogenase (SMD = 0.666; 95% CI: 0.332;0.999) activities. Moreover, significant reductions were observed in total protein (SMD = -0.326; 95% CI: -0.631; -0.021) and increases in prothrombin time (SMD = 0.633; 95% CI: 0.077;1.189), ferritin (SMD = 0.437; 95% CI: 0.069;0.805), D-dimer (SMD = 0.359; 95% CI: 0.144;0.573). Further studies are needed to confirm reductions in platelet count and elevations in fibrinogen levels

ConclusionThis study suggests that LC is associated with persistent liver damage and coagulopathy, highlighting the need to incorporate liver injury into treatment strategies to reduce potential risks.","NA","medrxiv",1729980537065

Mendelian randomisation (MR) using molecular traits as exposures is a particularly promising approach for identifying such risk factors. Despite early successes with the application of MR to biomarkers such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and C-reactive protein, recent studies have revealed a more nuanced picture, with widespread horizontal pleiotropy. Using data from the UK Biobank, we illustrate the issue of horizontal pleiotropy with two case studies, one involving glycolysis and the other involving vitamin D synthesis. We demonstrate that, although the measured metabolites (pyruvate or histidine, respectively) do not have a direct causal effect on the outcomes of interest (red blood cell count or vitamin D level), we can still use variant effects on these downstream metabolites to infer how they perturb protein function in different gene regions. This allows us to use variant effects on metabolite levels as proxy exposures in a cis-MR framework, thus rediscovering the causal roles of histidine ammonia lyase (HAL) in vitamin D synthesis and glycolysis pathway in red blood cell survival. We also highlight the assumptions that need to be satisfied for cis-MR with proxy exposures to yield valid inferences and discuss the practical challenges of meeting these assumptions.","NA","medrxiv",1729980537065

A body of work has identified the taxonomic profile of the female urinary microbiome associate with aging, menopause, and urinay disease. However, how this microbial community engages with the host niche, including the local biochemical environment of the urogenital tract, in health and disease is yet to be fully defined. This study directly assesses differences in the biochemical environment of the urine, or biochemical ecology, associated with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) and defines a microbe-metabolite association network of the female urinary microbiome. By integrating metagenomic and metabolomic data collected from a controlled cohort of women with rUTI, we find that distinct metabolites, such as methionine sulfoxide (Met-SO) and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), are associated with differences in urinary microbiome diversity. We observe associations between microbial and biochemical beta diversity and unique metabolic networks of uropathogenic Escherichia coli and uroprotective Lactobacillus species, highlighting potential metabolite-driven ecological shifts that may influence UTI susceptibility. We identify a urinary lipid signature of active rUTI that can accurately distinguish (AUC = 0.987) cases controls. Finally, using time-to-relapse data we identify deoxycholic acid (DCA) as a new prognostic indicator for rUTI recurrence. Together these findings suggest that systemic metabolic processes may influence susceptibility, opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention and the development of more accurate diagnostic and prognostic to improve patient outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

Also unexpectedly, FBF-2 interactions with partner proteins can compensate for loss of RNA-binding. FBF-2 only loses biological activity when its RNA-binding and partner interactions are both defective.

Chronic P. aeruginosa infections are difficult to treat, primarily owing to antibiotic treatment failure, which is often observed in the absence of antimicrobial resistance. In MADs, P. aeruginosa forms biofilm-like aggregates within the luminal mucus. While the contribution of mucin hyperconcentration towards antibiotic tolerance has been described, the mechanism for mucin driven antibiotic tolerance and the influence of aggregates have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the contribution of flagellar motility towards aggregate formation as it relates to the diseased mucus environment. We found that loss of flagellar motility resulted in increased P. aeruginosa aggregation and tolerance to multiple classes of antibiotics. Further, we observed differential roles in antimicrobial tolerance of the motAB and motCD stators, which power the flagellum. Additionally, we found that control of fliC expression was important for aggregate formation and antibiotic tolerance as a strain constitutively expressing fliC was unable to form aggregates and was highly susceptible to treatment. Lastly, we demonstrate that neutrophil elastase, an abundant immune mediator and biomarker of chronic lung infection, promotes aggregation and antibiotic tolerance by impairing flagellar motility. Collectively, these results highlight the key role of flagellar motility in aggregate formation and antibiotic tolerance and deepens our understanding of how the MADs lung environment promotes antibiotic tolerance of P. aeruginosa.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

MethodsHere, we studied the entire Norwegian population aged 10 to 40 between 2006 and 2018 (N = 2,468,503). By linking tax registries to administrative health registries, we describe prevalence rates by age, sex, and parental income rank. Next, we used kinship-based models with extended families of twins and siblings to distinguish direct effects of parents from shared genetic and environmental risk factors.

ResultsWe show that lower parental income rank was associated with more psychiatric disorders at all ages from age 10 to 40 (r between -.06 and -.15). The kinship-based models indicated that direct effects of parental income played a large role (38%) in explaining the parent-offspring correlation among adolescents, while shared risk factors accounted for the entire parent-offspring correlation among adults.

Rates of OA publications continue to grow, including for research carried out by pharmaceutical companies. To help drive more openness in the pharmaceutical industry, we aimed to compare the OA publication rates of pharmaceutical companies with those of academic institutions.

MethodsWe assessed OA publication rates from the 40 largest pharmaceutical companies by earnings and 40 comparator academic institutions that publish the largest number of medical research articles in their geographical region. Using the Lens, we built a live public dashboard that presents the OA publication rates for articles with authors affiliated to the pharmaceutical companies and comparator academic institutions of interest, detailed by OA model and licence, and by medical therapy area. We performed further analysis on data downloaded from the dashboard.

ResultsIn our primary analysis of articles 12-24 months since publication date, 76.6% of pharmaceutical company (pharma) and 69.5% of academic institution (academia) publications were OA. The most common OA models were gold (pharma, 37%; academia, 41%) and hybrid (pharma, 22%; academia, 11%). Oncology had lower rates of OA publications than other therapy areas. Growth in the OA publication rate was generally more rapid for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions, regardless of field.

ConclusionsThe OA publication rate was higher for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions and continues to increase. With the pharmaceutical industry focused on encouraging authors to publish OA and increasingly aware of the different types of OA licences, we expect and welcome further changes. Our new report provides data on pharmaceutical company and academic institution publications that are updated every 2 weeks. We encourage others to use this open resource and report their results.

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSOpen access (OA) publication rates for pharmaceutical companies have been steadily growing. However, previous methods for analysing pharmaceutical company OA publication rates have not been conducive to automation and have not facilitated easy comparison between pharmaceutical companies and other research-intensive environments, such as academic institutions.

What this study addsWe built an online dashboard that presents continually and automatically updated OA publication rates for articles with authors affiliated to several large pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. We found that the OA publication rate was higher for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions and that growth in OA publications was generally more rapid for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyOur dashboard allows ongoing monitoring, and we encourage the use of this free tool to capture evolving OA publishing behaviours and the disclosure of these results to help drive greater adoption of OA publishing practices.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIAs expected with large-scale bibliometrics sampling, there are various points at which error and/or information loss may have entered this analysis, for example, during the parsing of author affiliations or categorisation of topics and article types.
C_LIO_LIThe comparator set (a globally representative group of research-intensive academic institutions) may not represent academic institutions in general because it includes only the largest academic institutions (in terms of publication counts) from each global region.
C_LIO_LIThere is overlap between the pharmaceutical company and academic institution analysis sets because first, pharmaceutical company publications often include academic authors, and second, academic institution publications may include pharmaceutical company authors. Hence, some individual publications may have been included in both analysis sets.
C_LIO_LIThe analysis does not account for studies that are led by authors at academic institutions but funded by pharmaceutical companies. These investigator-sponsored studies typically do not have pharmaceutical company authors, and pharmaceutical companies have no influence over decisions relating to publications resulting from these studies, including target journal, OA status and license type.

Plain Language SummaryBiotechnology and pharmaceutical companies develop and deliver most of the worlds new medicines. To ensure important information about these medicines is shared transparently with audiences across the world, more and more often, pharmaceutical companies are choosing to publish their research open access. Open access publishing allows anyone to read and, in some cases, reuse the contents of research publications for free. In medical journals, an increasing proportion of articles are published open access every year. However, at the moment, we dont understand how the open access publication rates of medical publications from pharmaceutical companies compare with those of medical publications from academic institutions. Understanding this could help the scientific community assess how open access publication practices are changing over time.

We made an online platform that provides a free, live report of the open access publication rates for pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. We found that 77% of pharmaceutical company research publications and 70% of academic institution research publications were published open access. Open access publication rates increased each year for both pharmaceutical company and academic institution research publications, but the rates were increasing faster for pharmaceutical companies.

Our results are similar to those from other studies of open access publication rates. We encourage users to explore our free online live report and share their results publicly.

We demonstrate that Scalable MBR can search thousands of MS raw files in a few hours compared to days required for the original DIA-NN MBR procedure and demonstrate that the results are almost indistinguishable to those of DIA-NN native MBR. The method has been tested to scale to over 15,000 injections and is available for use in the Proteograph Analysis Suite.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

However, their use has been limited by the substantial computational resources required. In this work, we focus on improving the computational efficiency of protein language models (PLMs), specifically the Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM) family, to increase the accessibility of PLMs. By implementing optimizations such as FlashAttention and Partition-Attention, a novel technique designed to handle proteins of variable length, we achieved a 16-fold speedup in inference time and reduced memory usage by 3 to 14 times for long proteins. Additionally, 4-bit quantization applied to billion-parameter models led to a 2 to 3 times reduction in memory consumption with minimal performance loss in the missense variant effect prediction task. Training efficiency was also improved, with a 6-fold reduction in runtime achieved through activation checkpointing and the DeepSpeed Zero-Offload strategy. For fine-tuning, we employed parameter-efficient methods, enabling state-of-the-art predictions of protein properties and functions by training only the model head or a small fraction of adapter weights. For instance, we achieved a Spearman's correlation coefficient of 70% in melting point prediction and an 87% area under the precision-recall curve (AU-PRC) for transcription factor prediction. Our efficient ESM (ESME) implementation significantly lowers the barrier to using these powerful models, making them accessible to academic laboratories with limited computational resources. The ESME implementation is available on PyPI (pypi.org/project/esm-efficient) and GitHub (github.com/uci-cbcl/esm-efficient).","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

Tau pathology spreads cell-to-cell2 but the exact mechanisms of tau release and intercellular transmission remain poorly defined. Tau is released from neurons as free protein or in extracellular vesicles (EVs)3-5 but the role of these different release mechanisms in intercellular tau transmission is unclear. Here, we show that the neuronal gene Arc is critical for packaging tau into EVs. Brain EVs purified from human tau (hTau) transgenic rTg4510 mice (rTgWT) contain high levels of hTau that are capable of seeding tau pathology. In contrast, EVs purified from rTgWT crossed with Arc knock-out mice (rTgArc KO) have significantly less hTau and cannot seed tau aggregation. Arc facilitates the release of hTau in EVs produced via the I-BAR protein IRSp53, but not free tau. Arc protein directly binds hTau to form a fuzzy complex that we identified in both mouse and human brain tissue. We find that pathological intracellular hTau accumulates in neurons in rTgArc KO mice, which correlates with accelerated neuron loss in the hippocampus. Finally, we find that intercellular tau transmission is significantly abrogated in Arc KO mice. We conclude that Arc-dependent release of tau in EVs plays a significant role in intracellular tau elimination and intercellular tau transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

Still, the mechanisms for these headache types are unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess levels of amyloid related biomarkers in patients with persistent headache after COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

MethodsIn this prospective observational cohort, patients with severe headache as the dominating symptom after COVID-19 disease (n=29) and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (n=31), had neurological assessments with reassessments after 6 months. Plasma levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), pregnancy zone protein (PZP), cathepsin L1 (CTSL) and serum Amyloid A (SAA1) were measured by ELISA in relation to levels in healthy controls (n=16).

ResultsWe found a strong and persistent upregulation of APP in patients with headache after COVID-19 as compared to the two other groups. At both inclusion and after 6 months APP levels were also increased in those with accompanying cognitive symptoms. In contrast, plasma levels of PZP were elevated in both headache groups as compared to healthy controls at inclusion and after 6 months follow-up, but with no relation to cognitive symptoms. CTSL was only elevated in those with COVID-19 associated headache at baseline, whereas SAA1 showed levels comparable in all groups.

ConclusionAltered plasma levels of soluble markers potentially reflecting changes in amyloid processing was found in patients with persistent headache after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and particular in those with persistent headache after COVID-19 disease where we also found some association with cognitive symptoms.

An example of swift contextual generalization is observed in conditioning tasks, where performance is quickly generalized from one context to another. A key question in identifying the neural substrate underlying this ability is how the hippocampus (HPC) represents task-related stimuli across different environments, given that HPC cells exhibit place-specific activity that changes across contexts (remapping). In this study, we used calcium imaging to monitor hippocampal neuron activity as animals performed a conditioning task across multiple spatial contexts. We investigated whether hippocampal cells, which encode both spatial locations (place cells) and task-related information, could maintain their task representation even when their spatial encoding remapped in a new spatial context. To assess the consistency of task representations, we used advanced dimensionality reduction techniques combined with machine learning to develop manifold representations of population level HPC activity. The results showed that task-related neural representations remained stable even as place cell representations of spatial context changed, thus demonstrating similar embedding geometries of neural representations of the task across different spatial contexts. Notably, these patterns were not only consistent within the same animal across different contexts but also significantly similar across different animals, suggesting a standardized neural encoding or 'neural syntax' in the hippocampus. These findings bridge a critical gap between memory and navigation research, revealing how the hippocampus maintains cognitive consistency across different spatial environments. These findings also suggest that hippocampal function is governed by a neural framework shared between animals, an observation that may have broad implications for understanding memory, learning, and related cognitive processes. Looking ahead, this work opens new avenues for exploring the fundamental principles underlying hippocampal encoding strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

However, ISCs are particularly sensitive to various stressors and primary targets of overwhelming immune responses such as interferon-g (IFNg)-mediated killing. In mouse models of gut damage and biopsies from patients having undergone allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, we observed IFNg expression by intestinal Treg cells. Treg cells leverage combined IFNg and interleukin 10 (IL-10) stimulation of ISCs to nurture the growth of intestinal organoids through the activation of the mTORC1 and Myc pathways. Similarly, Treg cells or the combined addition of recombinant IFNg and IL-10 promote the regeneration of organoids after irradiation. Exposure of organoids to Wnt- or EGF-free culture conditions revealed distinct growth factor-like properties of IFNg and IL-10. While IFNg induced epithelial proliferation and differentiation, combined addition of IFNg and IL-10 led to balanced proliferation, ensuring ISC maintenance. Our results uncover a context-dependent role of inflammatory signaling in ISC, through which Treg cells promote epithelial repair.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

Despite its popularity among recreational users and distinct pharmacodynamics, the neural correlates of 2C-B remain unexplored. Using 7T resting-state functional MRI in 22 healthy volunteers, we mapped out the acute effects of matched doses of 20 mg 2C-B, 15 mg psilocybin and placebo across spatiotemporal benchmarks of functional brain organisation. In a within-subjects, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, we evaluated the neuropharmacological and neurobehavioural correlates of an array of connectivity measures - including static (sFC) and global connectivity (gFC), dynamic connectivity variability (dFC), and spontaneous brain complexity. Compared to placebo, 2C-B and psilocybin selectively reduced intra-network sFC, while broadly increasing between-network and subcortical-cortical connectivity. Compared to psilocybin, 2C-B exhibited less pronounced reductions in between-network FC but elicited elevations in transmodal sFC. Both compounds yielded spatially divergent increases in gFC yet produced similar increases in brain complexity. Using PET density modelling, the spatial distribution of neural effects aligned with documented differences in monoaminergic transporter and serotonergic receptor binding affinity beyond 5-HT2A, highlighting the role of pharmacology in shaping functional dynamics. Lastly, we show behavioural markers of psychedelic effects are non-linearly reflected by the desynchronisation of the transmodal axis of functional brain organisation.

However, the role of glial mitochondria in proper brain development is not well understood. We show that astrocyte mitochondria undergo extensive fission while populating astrocyte distal branches during postnatal cortical development. Loss of mitochondrial fission regulator, Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), decreases mitochondrial localization to distal astrocyte processes, and this mitochondrial mislocalization reduces astrocyte morphological complexity. Functionally, astrocyte-specific conditional deletion of Drp1 induces astrocyte reactivity and disrupts astrocyte organization in the cortex. These morphological and organizational deficits are accompanied by loss of astrocytic gap junction protein Connexin 43. These findings uncover a crucial role for mitochondrial fission in coordinating astrocytic morphogenesis and organization, revealing the regulation of astrocytic mitochondria dynamics as a critical step in neurodevelopment.

SummaryDuring cortical astrocyte morphogenesis, mitochondria decrease in size to populate distal astrocyte processes. Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission is necessary for peripheral astrocyte process formation. Astrocyte-specific Drp1 loss induces astrocyte reactivity, disrupts cortical astrocyte organization, and dysregulates gap-junction protein Connexin 43 abundance.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537065

Most organisms have a life cycle with unicellular bottlenecks during reproduction. However, some organisms like plants, fungi, or colonial animals can grow indefinitely, changing the manner in which mutations spread throughout both the individual and the population. Furthermore, clonally reproducing organisms may also achieve exceedingly long lifespans, making somatic mutation an important mechanism of creating heritable variation for Darwinian evolution by natural selection. Yet, little is known about intra-organism mutation rates and evolutionary trajectories in long-lived species. Here, we study the Pando aspen clone, the largest known quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) clone founded by a single seedling and thought to be one of the oldest studied organisms. Aspen reproduce vegetatively via new root-borne stems forming clonal patches, sometimes spanning several hectares. To study the evolutionary history of the Pando clone, we collected and sequenced over 500 samples from Pando and neighboring clones, as well as from various tissue types within Pando, including leaves, roots, and bark. We applied a series of filters to distinguish somatic mutations from the pool of both somatic and germline mutations, incorporating a technical replicate sequencing approach to account for uncertainty in somatic mutation detection. Despite root spreading being spatially constrained, we observed only a modest positive correlation between genetic and spatial distance, suggesting the presence of a mechanism preventing the accumulation and spread of mutations across units. Phylogenetic models estimate the age of the clone to between ~16,000-80,000 years. This age is generally corroborated by the near-continuous presence of aspen pollen in a lake sediment record collected from Fish Lake near Pando. Overall, this work enhances understanding of mutation accumulation and dispersal within and between ramets of long-lived, clonally-reproducing organisms.

Significance StatementThis study enhances our understanding of evolutionary processes in long-lived clonal organisms by investigating somatic mutation accumulation and dispersal patterns within the iconic Pando aspen clone. The authors estimated the clone to be between 10,000 and 80,000 years old and uncovered a modest spatial genetic structure in the 42.6-hectare clone, suggesting localized mutation build-up rather than dispersal along tissue lineages. This work sheds light on an ancient organism and how plants may evolve to preserve genetic integrity in meristems fueling indefinite growth, with implications for our comprehension of adaptive strategies in long-lived perennials.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

However, empirical studies on the evolutionary aspects of host-microbe relationships are rare. Here, we used experimental evolution on laboratory populations of D. melanogaster to understand how a host can evolve without its microbiome. For this, we compared replicate Drosophila populations reared without the microbes (labeled as MBL1-4, for ""Microbiota-less"") for 54 host generations with their corresponding controls (labeled as MB1-4), whose microbiome was reconstituted every generation. This comparison was done in two common-garden assay environments: with microbes and microbe-free. We found that contrary to what we expected, only modest adaptations were seen in the MBL populations. When looking at the phenotypic plasticity of MB-MBLs across with-microbe and microbe-free environments, we saw that MBLs had lesser plasticity than MBs. This might hint at MBLs reducing their dependence on microbes. We performed RNA-Seq on MBL1 and MB1 populations to see if there were changes in gene expression patterns. We found that a cluster of anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) was up-regulated, and another cluster of heat shock proteins (HSPs) was down-regulated in MBL1 compared to MB1.

To help achieve this, many bacteria utilise regulatory pathways that ensure DNA replication initiation only occurs once per cell cycle. When dysregulated, loss of DNA replication control can have severe consequences. In Escherichia coli it has been observed that hyper-initiation of DNA synthesis leads to pleiotropic genome instability and cell death. Therefore, targeting DNA replication initiation proteins to promote hyper-initiation may be an approach to generate novel antimicrobials. However, it is not clear whether DNA replication hyper-initiation generally inhibits bacterial proliferation, and if so, via which pathways. To address this question, we devised genetic systems to artificially induce hyper-initiation in the model organism Bacillus subtilis and the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. In both species, hyper-initiation elicited cellular degeneration culminating in growth inhibition by cell death. During this process in B. subtilis, temporal analyses revealed the early onset of the DNA damage response, followed by membrane depolarisation and cell lysis. This phenotype could be suppressed by removing pathways that repair damaged DNA, suggesting that cell death is a consequence of conflicts between DNA replication and repair. In S. aureus, cells quickly accumulated striking morphological changes associated with rapid loss of chromosomal DNA and death via a lysis-independent pathway. Moreover, inducing hyper-initiation in S. aureus was observed to decrease bacterial survival during infection of murine macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest that stimulating the initiation of bacterial DNA replication could be an alternative approach to inhibiting bacterial growth, particularly in combination with compounds that inhibit or poison DNA repair, akin to cancer therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

However, techniques to characterize these material properties and their underlying molecular interactions are scarce. Here, we introduce two optical techniques - Brillouin microscopy and quantitative phase imaging (QPI) - to address this scarcity. We establish Brillouin shift and linewidth as measures for average molecular interaction and dissipation strength, respectively, and we used QPI to obtain the protein concentration within the condensates. We monitored the response of condensates formed by FUS and by the low-complexity domain of hnRNPA1 (A1-LCD) to altering temperature and ion concentration. Conditions favoring phase separation increased Brillouin shift, linewidth, and protein concentration. In comparison to solidification by chemical crosslinking, the ion-dependent aging of FUS condensates had a small effect on the molecular interaction strength inside. Finally, we investigated how sequence variations of A1-LCD, that change the driving force for phase separation, alter the physical properties of the respective condensates. Our results provide a new experimental perspective on the material properties of protein condensates. Robust and quantitative experimental approaches such as the presented ones will be crucial for understanding how the physical properties of biological condensates determine their function and dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

The mechanistic basis for this specificity is poorly understood. Here we have developed an in vitro embryonic stem cell model system to dissect critical determinants of DNMT3B specificity. Our model faithfully recapitulates developmentally regulated CGI methylation and additionally provides novel insights into CpG methylation at cis-regulatory elements. Using genetic complementation, we show that DNMT3B specificity is attributable solely to the catalytic isoform DNMT3B1. Domain swap experiments demonstrate an important role both for the PWWP-ADD chromatin binding and unstructured N-terminal domains.

Norepinephrine (NE) release from the locus coeruleus (LC) has been shown to mediate learned behaviors such that in a task with graded stimulus uncertainty and performance, a high level of NE released after an unexpected outcome causes improvement in subsequent behavior. Yet, how the transient activity of LC-NE neurons, lasting tens of milliseconds, influences behavior several seconds later, is unclear. Here, we show that NE acts directly on cortical astrocytes via Adra1a adrenergic receptors to elicit sustained increases in intracellular calcium. Chemogenetic blockade of astrocytic calcium elevation prevents the improvement in behavioral performance. NE-activated calcium invokes purinergic pathways in cortical astrocytes that signal to neurons; pathway-specific astrocyte gene expression is altered in mice trained on the task, and blocking neuronal adenosine-sensitive A1 receptors also prevents post-reinforcement behavioral gain. Finally, blocking either astrocyte calcium dynamics or A1 receptors alters encoding of the task in prefrontal cortex neurons, preventing the post-reinforcement change in discriminability of rewarded and unrewarded stimuli underlying behavioral improvement. Together, these data demonstrate that astrocytes, rather than indirectly reflecting neuronal drive, play a direct, instrumental role in representing task-relevant information and signaling to neurons to mediate a fundamental component of learning in the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

ObjectiveThis study aimed to verify the association between SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of Stroke, based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, in order to assess the inclusion of the virus as a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases.

MethodsA metaumbrella was conducted, which included 34 systematic reviews, of which 4 were selected for the final analysis based on methodological quality and consistency. The analysis aggregated the results of 70 primary studies, considering different stroke subtypes and outcomes associated with COVID-19. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} index, and significance bias was verified using Eggers test.

ResultsThe analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 is significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 1.55 - 3.95), particularly for ischemic stroke (eOR = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.11 - 2.80) and hemorrhagic stroke (eOR = 3.86; 95%CI: 1.79 - 8.33). Additionally, patients with cerebrovascular comorbidities had higher mortality (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 2.48 - 19.63), as did those who had previously suffered a stroke (eOR = 6.08; 95%CI: 3.73 - 9.91).

ConclusionThe association between SARS-CoV-2 and stroke was consistent and significant, suggesting that COVID-19 should be considered a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. However, the high heterogeneity among the studies analyzed reinforces the need for further research to consolidate this relationship.","NA","medrxiv",1729980537066

Here, we isolated broad, subtype-neutralizing mAbs from human B cells targeting the H1 or H3 HA head as well as a unique mAb targeting the stem. The H1 mAbs target the previously defined lateral patch epitope on H1 HAs and recognize HAs from 1933 to 2021 in addition to a swine H1N1 virus with pandemic potential. Using directed evolution, we improved the neutralization potency of these H1 mAbs towards a contemporary H1 strain. Using deep mutational scanning of four antigenically distinct H1N1 viruses, we identified potential viral escape pathways. For the H3 mAbs we used cryo-EM to define the targeted epitopes: one mAb recognizes the side of the H3 head, accommodating the N133 glycan and a pocket underneath the receptor binding site. The other H3 mAb recognizes an epitope in the HA stem that overlaps with previously characterized mAbs, but with distinct antibody variable genes and mode of recognition.

Fundamental gene-function research often requires cloning and propagating DNA fragments, such as those from the iGEM Parts Registry or Addgene, typically distributed as circular plasmids. Addgene's repository alone offers around 150,000 plasmids. To ensure data integrity, cryptographic checksums can be calculated for the sequences. Each sequence has a unique checksum, making checksums useful for validation and quick lookups of associated annotations. For example, the SEGUID checksum, uniquely identifies protein sequences with a 27-character string. Objectives: The original SEGUID, while effective for protein sequences and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), is not suitable for circular and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) due to topological differences. Challenges include how to uniquely represent linear dsDNA, circular ssDNA, and circular dsDNA. To meet these needs, we propose SEGUID v2, which extends the original SEGUID to handle additional types of sequences. Conclusions: SEGUID v2 produces orientation and rotation invariant checksums for single-stranded, double-stranded, possibly staggered, linear, and circular DNA and RNA sequences. Customizable alphabets allow for other types of sequences. In contrast to the original SEGUID, which uses Base64, SEGUID v2 uses Base64url to encode the SHA-1 hash.

The metabolome of COVID-19 patients has been studied sparsely, with most research focusing on a limited number of plasma metabolites or small cohorts. This is the first study to test saliva metabolites in COVID-19 patients in a comprehensive way, revealing significant changes linked to disease severity and highlighting saliva is potential as a non-invasive diagnostic tool. Methods. We included 30 asymptomatic subjects with no prior COVID-19 infection or vaccination, 102 patients with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 61 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 status. Saliva samples were analyzed using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) in positive and negative ionization modes. Results. Significant changes in metabolites were identified in COVID-19 patients, with distinct patterns based on disease severity. Healthy individuals exhibited a well-regulated bacterial network, while severe cases showed disordered microbial networks. Elevated dipeptides such as Val-Glu and Met-Gln in moderate cases suggest specific protease activity related to SARS-CoV-2. Increased acetylated amino acids like N-Acetylserine and N-Acetylhistidine indicate potential biomarkers for stress and disease severity. Bacterial metabolites, including muramic acid and indole-3-carboxaldehyde, were higher in mild-moderate cases, indicating oral microbiota changes. In severe cases, polyamines and organ damage-related metabolites, such as N-acetylspermine and 3-methylcytidine, were significantly increased. Interestingly, metabolites reduced in moderate cases were elevated in severe cases. Conclusions.

To establish more comprehensive and accurate RNA structure-function relationships, new methods are needed to interrogate RNA and trap native conformations in cellular environments. Existing tools primarily rely on electrophiles that are constitutively ""on"" or triggered by UV light, often resulting in high background reactivity. We developed an alternative, chemically triggered approach to crosslink RNAs using bioorthogonal cyclopropenones (CpOs). These reagents selectively react with phosphines to provide ketenes--electrophiles that can trap neighboring nucleophiles to forge covalent crosslinks. As proof-of-concept, we synthesized a panel of CpOs and appended them to thiazole orange (TO-1). The TO-1 conjugates bound selectively to a model RNA aptamer (Mango) with nanomolar affinity, confirmed by fluorescence turn-on. After phosphine administration, covalent crosslinks were formed between the CpO probes and RNA. The degree of crosslinking was both time and dose-dependent. We further applied the chemically triggered tools to model RNAs in biologically relevant conditions. Collectively, this work expands the toolkit of probes for studying RNA and its native conformations.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

The Winter Covid Infection Study (WCIS) ran from the 14th of November 2023 to the 7th of March 2024, and enabled the UK Health Security Agency to publish fortnightly estimates of the incidence and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Testing was performed using Lateral Flow Devices (LFD), and a repeat testing design was used to estimate key epidemiological parameters of SARS-CoV-2. This facilitated the estimation of time-varying prevalence, incidence, and test sensitivity. A Bayesian multilevel regression and poststratification model was developed to produce representative and unbiased estimates. In England and Scotland, prevalence peaked at 4.54% (95% CI: 3.90 to 5.24), and incidence peaked at 498 (95% CrI: 429 to 585) new infections per 100,000 individuals per day. The average LFD test sensitivity in England and Scotland during the study was estimated to be 72.1% (95% CrI: 70.3, 74.0), though due to epidemic phase bias this varied from a minimum value of 68.6% (95% CrI: 66.4 to 70.7) to a maximum value of 77.2% (95% CrI: 75.3 to 79.2). The novel study design of WCIS addressed key survey design challenges faced by previous large-scale SARS-CoV-2 population prevalence studies. The study demonstrated the utility and cost-benefit of LFD tests in large community surveys of prevalence.","NA","medrxiv",1729980537066

We developed a miniature microscope for high resolution two-photon fluorescence imaging with patterned two-photon optogenetic stimulation.

One such behavior in male Drosophila melanogaster, courtship, is regulated by various sensory modalities, including olfaction. Here, we reveal how sexually dimorphic olfactory pathways in male flies converge at the third-order, onto lateral horn output neurons, to regulate courtship. To achieve this, we developed ds-Tango, a modified version of the monosynaptic tracing and manipulation tool trans-Tango. In ds-Tango, two distinct configurations of trans-Tango are positioned in series, thus providing selective genetic access not only to the monosynaptic partners of starter neurons but also to their disynaptic connections. Using ds-Tango, we identified a node of convergence for three sexually dimorphic olfactory pathways. Silencing this node results in deficits in sex recognition of potential partners. Our results identify lateral horn output neurons required for proper courtship behavior in male flies and establish ds-Tango as a tool for disynaptic circuit tracing.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

Cryo-EM structures of brain-derived tau filaments revealed that specific structures define different diseases, triggering a quest for the development of experimental model systems that replicate the structures of disease. Here, we describe twelve phosphomimetic, serine/threonine to aspartate, mutations in tau, which we termed PAD12, that collectively induce the in vitro assembly of full-length tau into filaments with the same structure as that of paired helical filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with Alzheimers disease. Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggests that phosphomimetic mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain of tau may facilitate filament formation by disrupting an intramolecular interaction between two IVYK motifs. PAD12 tau can be used for both nucleation-dependent and multiple rounds of seeded assembly in vitro, as well as for the seeding of tau biosensor cells. PAD12 tau can be assembled into paired helical filaments under various shaking conditions, with the resulting filaments being stable for extended periods of time. They can be labelled with fluorophores and biotin. Tau filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with Alzheimers disease brains have been known to be made of hyperphosphorylated and abnormally phosphorylated full-length tau, but it was not known if the presence of this post-translational modification is more than a mere correlation. Our findings suggest that hyperphosphorylation of tau may be sufficient for the formation of the Alzheimer tau fold.

However, the role of the motor cortex in controlling gait trajectories remains unclear. In animals, cortical neuromodulation allows for precise control of step height. We hypothesized that a similar control framework applies to humans, whereby cortical stimulation would primarily increase foot elevation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over the motor cortex to assess the involvement of the corticospinal tract over the limb trajectory during human walking. Eight healthy adults (aged 20-32 years) participated in treadmill walking at 1.5 km/h. TMS was applied over the left motor cortex at an intensity of 120% of the threshold to elicit a dorsiflexion of the right ankle during the swing phase of gait. Electromyographic (EMG) measurements and three-dimensional (3D) lower limb kinematics were collected. When delivered during the early swing phase, TMS led to a significant increase in the maximum height of the right toe by a mean of 40.7% +/- 14.9% (25.6mm +/- 9.4 mm, p = 0.0352) and knee height by 57.8%+/-16.8%; (32mm +/- 9.3 mm; p = 0.008) across participants.

Fission, in particular, depends on the accumulation of the mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) and subsequent recruitment of the dynamin-related protein Drp1. We used cryo-scanning transmission electron tomography (cryo-STET) to investigate mitochondrial morphologies in MFF mutant cells (MFF-/-) in ATP-depleting conditions that normally induce fission. The capability of cryo-STET to image through the cytoplasmic volume to a depth of 1 m provides visualization of mitochondria and their surroundings intact. We imaged changes in mitochondrial morphology and cristae structure and contacts with endoplasmic reticulum, degradative organelles, and cytoskeleton at stalled fission sites. We found disruption of the outer membrane at contact sites with endoplasmic reticulum and degradative organelles at sites of mitophagy. We identified fission sites where the inner mitochondrial membrane is already separated while the outer is still continuous. While MFF is a general fission factor, these observations demonstrate that mitochondrial fission can proceed to the final stage in its absence. The use of cryo-STET allays concerns about the loss of structures due to sample thinning required for cryo-TEM tomography.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

This study investigated the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations, clinical outcomes and patient demographics in the Sylhet region of Bangladesh. We looked at the full genome sequences of 37 SARS-CoV-2 samples that were collected between January and June 2020. Specifically, we looked at five major spike protein mutations: D614G, A570D, D1118H, A222V, and P681R. The D614G mutation was the most prevalent (94.6%), followed by A570D and D1118H (both 32.4%), A222V (29.7%), and P681R (13.5%). Despite their high prevalence, we found no statistically significant associations between these mutations and clinical outcomes or demographic variables, except for possible trends for the P681R mutation. We found that age played a decisive role in recovery from COVID-19, with older patients exhibiting slower recovery rates. In terms of predictors of outcome, gender differences were observed: clinical symptoms and viral genetic mutations were more influential for men, while age and disease progression were more important for women. Common nucleotide substitutions (A23403G, C3037T, and C14408T) associated with European strains were identified, suggesting possible routes of transmission. This study contributes to our understanding of the genetics, clinical manifestations and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the Sylhet region and emphasizes the need for continuous genomic surveillance and adaptive public health strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

Here, we bridge this gap by linking genome to proteome in 800 meiotic progeny from an intercross between two closely related Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates adapted to distinct niches. Modest genetic distance between the parents generated remarkable proteomic diversity that was amplified in the progeny and captured by 6,476 genotype-protein associations, over 1,600 of which we resolved to single variants. Proteomic adaptation emerged through the combined action of numerous cis- and trans-regulatory mutations, a regulatory architecture that was conserved across the species. Notably, trans-regulatory variants often arose in proteins not traditionally associated with gene regulation, such as enzymes. Moreover, the proteomic consequences of mutations predicted fitness under various stresses. Our study demonstrates that the collective action of natural genetic variants drives dramatic proteome diversification, with molecular consequences that forecast phenotypic outcomes.

Highlights- Proteome diversity arises from natural genetic variants, with divergent proteomes in closely related parents and progeny.
- Cis-regulatory elements had strong individual impacts, but coherent trans effects combined to dominate protein expression.
- Directional selection and frequent transgression suggest much of the proteome is under selective pressure.
- Many trans-regulators are enzymes or transporters, with fewer than 4% of pQTLs linking known interactors.
- Genome-to-proteome connections predicted the fitness impact of mutations under various stresses, including a strong but hidden causal variant in IRA2/NF1.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

Capturing this structure remains a significant scientific challenge. Using information theory, we apply Dynamical Independence (DI) to uncover the emergent dynamical structure in a minimal 5-node biophysical neural model, shaped by the interplay of two key aspects of brain organisation: integration and segregation. In our study, functional integration within the biophysical neural model is modulated by a global coupling parameter, while functional segregation is influenced by adding dynamical noise, which counteracts global coupling. DI defines a dimensionally-reduced macroscopic variable (e.g., a coarse-graining) as emergent to the extent that it behaves as an independent dynamical process, distinct from the micro-level dynamics. We measure dynamical dependence (a departure from dynamical independence) for macroscopic variables across spatial scales. Our results indicate that the degree of emergence of macroscopic variables is relatively minimised at balanced points of integration and segregation and maximised at the extremes. Additionally, our method identifies to which degree the macroscopic dynamics are localised across microlevel nodes, thereby elucidating the emergent dynamical structure through the relationship between microscopic and macroscopic processes. We find that deviation from a balanced point between integration and segregation results in a less localised, more distributed emergent dynamical structure as identified by DI. This finding suggests that a balance of functional integration and segregation is associated with lower levels of emergence (higher dynamical dependence), which may be crucial for sustaining coherent, localised emergent macroscopic dynamical structures. This work also provides a complete computational implementation for the identification of emergent neural dynamics that could be applied both in silico and in vivo.

Author summaryUnderstanding how complex neural systems give rise to emergent macroscopic patterns is a central challenge in neuroscience. Emergence, where macroscopic structures appear from underlying microscopic interactions, plays a crucial role in brain function, yet identifying the specific dynamics involved remains elusive. Traditionally, methods have quantified the extent of emergence but have struggled to pinpoint the emergent dynamical structure itself. In this study, we develop and apply a method, based on a quantity called Dynamical Independence (DI), which simultaneously captures the extent of emergence and reveals the underlying dynamical structure in neurophysiological data. Using a minimal 5-node biophysical neural model, we explore how a balance between functional integration and segregation--two key organisational principles in the brain--affects emergent macroscopic dynamics. Our results show that a finely balanced system produces highly localised, coherent macroscopic structures, while extreme deviations lead to more distributed, less localised dynamics. This work provides a computational framework for identifying emergent dynamical structure in both theoretical models and potentially in empirical brain data, advancing our understanding of the brains complex organisation across higher-order scales.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

We recently reported that mice with pre-existing immunity to A/Puerto Rico/08/1934 H1N1 virus were protected from lethal challenge from highly pathogenic clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 influenza virus. Here, we demonstrate that mice infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus strain A/California/04/2009 (Cal09) or vaccinated with a live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) were moderately-to-highly protected against a lethal A/bovine/Ohio/B24OSU-439/2024 H5N1 virus challenge. We also observed that ferrets with mixed pre-existing immunity--either from LAIV vaccination and/or from Cal09 infection--showed protection against a HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus isolated from a cat. Notably, this protection occurred independently of any detectable hemagglutination inhibition titers (HAIs) against the H5N1 virus. To explore factors that may contribute to protection, we conducted detailed T cell epitope mapping using previously published sequences from H1N1 strains. This analysis revealed a high conservation of amino acid sequences within the internal proteins of our bovine HPAI H5N1 virus strain. These data highlight the necessity to explore additional factors that contribute to protection against HPAI H5N1 viruses, such as memory T cell responses, in addition to HA-inhibition or neutralizing antibodies.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

Similarly, segregation of eye-specific inputs into the lateral geniculate nucleus proceeds normally in the absence of microglia.

We characterize genomic, phylogenetic, and morphological traits from these phages and argue for establishing four novel viral genera. We also search the genomes for anti-defense systems and investigate DNA modifications using Nanopore sequencing. In Pseudomonas phage Rembedalsseter we find evidence of 13 motif-associated single-stranded DNA breaks. A bioinformatics search revealed that 60 related Pseudomonas phages are enriched in the same motif, suggesting these single-stranded nicks may be widely distributed in this family of phages. Finally, we also search the Sequence Read Archive for similar phages in public metagenomes. We find close hits to the Erwinia jumbo-phage Kaldavass in a wide variety of plant, food, and wastewater metagenomes including a near-perfect hit from a Spanish spinach sample, illustrating how interconnected geographically distant phages can be.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

Here we tested whether these neural dynamics of speech encoding are altered for individuals with a language disorder. We recorded EEG responses from individuals with post-stroke aphasia and healthy age-matched controls (i.e., older adults) during 25 min of natural story listening. We estimated the duration of phonetic feature encoding, speed of evolution across neural populations, and the spatial location of encoding over EEG sensors. First, we establish that phonetic features are robustly encoded in EEG responses of healthy older adults. Second, when comparing individuals with aphasia to healthy controls, we find significantly decreased phonetic encoding in the aphasic group after shared initial processing pattern (0.08-0.25s after phoneme onset). Phonetic features were less strongly encoded over left-lateralized electrodes in the aphasia group compared to controls, with no difference in speed of neural pattern evolution. Finally, we observed that phonemes with high uncertainty about word identity were encoded longer in controls than in individuals with aphasia. This indicates that encoding phonetic information until word identity is resolved might be a crucial mechanism for successful speech comprehension. Together, our results suggest that aphasia may entail failure to maintain lower-order information long enough to recognize lexical items.

Significance statementThis study reveals robust phonetic decoding with EEG recordings in older adults, as well as decreased phonetic processing in individuals with a language disorder (aphasia) compared to healthy controls. This was most prominent over left-sided electrodes. Additionally, we observed that healthy controls, but not individuals with aphasia, encode phonetic features longer when uncertainty about word identity is high, indicating that this mechanism - encoding phonetic information until word identity is resolved - is crucial for successful language processing. These insights deepen our understanding of disrupted mechanisms in a language disorder, and show how the integration between language processing levels works in the healthy aging, neurotypical brain.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

Similar to AM symbiosis, multiple other intracellular symbiotic interactions have evolved in a variety of land plants. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis contrasts with these relationships as there is no intracellular accommodation of the symbiont inside the plant cell, but only intercellular colonization. This symbiotic relationship is common in a variety of seed plants, mostly trees and shrubs such as pines, willows and oaks.

Although it is known which plant lineages are involved in ECM symbiosis, there has been little investigation into the evolutionary origin of ECM symbiosis in these lineages. Furthermore, the genetic innovations and transcriptomic response related to this symbiosis have been studied largely in a genus or species-specific context, which hinders the study of their evolutionary origins. In this study, we reconstruct the origin of ECM in the rosid clade, showing at least 16 independent origins, resulting in the 17 known extant ECM rosid lineages. Moreover, comparative genomics of these lineages highlight genes involved in cell wall remodeling which underwent duplications in a convergent manner across ectomycorrhizal lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

Direct RNA nanopore sequencing offers a unique advantage by observing these modifications through characteristic alterations in ionic current signals. Various computational tools have been developed to detect RNA modifications, typically by comparing a sample of interest with a control lacking the target modification, often achieved through enzyme knockdown or knockout. We have developed a robust in vitro transcription protocol to generate a modification-free copy of any input RNA to detect all modifications that alter the raw ionic current signal relative to the canonical nucleotides during nanopore sequencing. We generated an in vitro transcribed sample from K562 cells and used Nanocompore to detect 26,619 modified RNA sites across 2,520 transcript isoforms from 1,742 genes. Of these, 56% are consistent with the well-characterized m6A modification. By inferring the identities of these modifications, we assessed differential usage and correlation patterns, revealing a significant co-occurrence between m6A and m5C modifications within the same transcripts. Additionally, some modifications were non-randomly associated with alternative splicing events. This study provides a comprehensive survey of RNA modifications across the transcriptome, demonstrating the utility of in vitro transcription coupled with direct RNA nanopore sequencing to simultaneously detect multiple modifications without the need for additional independent biochemical assays. The protocol is consistent in the future with more complex experimental designs, for example for differential modification usage between samples.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

A prime example is organ regeneration, whereby despite intrinsically stochastic damage, organs are rebuilt via controlled cellular proliferation. Here, we use a mathematical approach to understand how a cell decides to re-enter and exit mitosis during organ repair. Using empirical data from regenerating neuromasts in larval zebrafish, we identify a minimal model based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Remarkably, the ODEs model reproduces the regeneration kinetics by assuming a cell-proliferation switch that depends on the type and the number of the neuromast cells. Additionally, a two-dimensional Cellular Potts Model (CPM) predicts that cell proliferation is a delayed response to injury. The CPM recapitulates the experimental results qualitatively and quantitatively, showing that cell proliferation is locally controlled by a switch, where each cell division stops when the type-dependent number of neighbouring cells exceeds a deterministic critical value. An intriguing corollary of our results is that a local negative feedback loop among identical cells may be a general property of organ-level proportional homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

During entosis, one live and viable epithelial cell is completely internalised by another, then housed inside a large, single-membrane, endolysosomal vacuole in the host cytosol. The composition and maturation of this specialised, macroendocytic compartment has not been fully defined, but ultimately, the inner cell is killed and digested by host lysosomes. Here, we investigate the molecular characteristics and maturation profile of the entotic vacuole. Like phagosomes and macropinosomes, this vacuole undergoes a series of phospholipid modifications, but its maturation profile bears distinctive dynamics. While PI(4,5)P2 is lost rapidly during phagosome maturation, entosis yields an unusual, intracellular PI(4,5)P2-positive compartment, that can persist for hours, suggesting vacuole maturation is uncoupled from membrane scission. Loss of PI(4,5)P2 is eventually triggered, a requisite step for lysosomal killing of the internalised cell. More broadly, PI(4,5)P2-positive vacuoles also form during T-cell engulfment by thymic nurse cells, dependent on ROCK activity, suggesting this distinctive compartment represents a shared feature of entosis-like cell engulfments.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

We applied our method to stress-test a highly effective gene drive that has evaded resistance in all laboratory-contained releases to date, known as Ag(QFS)1. We showed that previously undetected resistant alleles can arise at low frequency, and discovered novel, partially resistant alleles that can perturb drive-invasion dynamics.

Our models predict that such gene drive designs could suppress large, natural populations of the malaria mosquito in the field.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

Combining spatio-temporal population genetic theory with population genomic data of 18 plant and animal species, we studied the dynamics of genetic diversity after habitat area losses. We show genetic diversity reacts slowly to habitat area and population declines, but lagged losses will continue for many decades even after habitats are fully protected. To understand the magnitude of this problem, we combined our predictive method with species habitat area and population monitoring reported in the Living Planet Index, the Red List, and new GBF indicators. We then project genetic diversity loss in 13,808 species with a short-term genetic diversity loss of 13-22% and long-term loss of 42-48% with substantial deviations depending on the level of habitat fragmentation. These results highlight that protection of only current habitats is insufficient to ensure the genetic health of species and that continuous genetic monitoring alone likely underestimates long term impacts.

These cellular interactions can be considered to be representative of evolutionary steps in plastid acquisition in eukaryotes, but the underlying cellular mechanisms and dynamics are not fully understood. Here, we studied a kleptoplastidic dinoflagellate (RSD: Ross Sea Dinoflagellate), which is known to steal plastids of the microalga Phaeocystis antarctica. We tracked the morphology and activity of stolen plastids over several months by combining multimodal subcellular imaging and photophysiology. Upon integration inside a host vacuole, the volume of plastids and pyrenoids significantly increased and photosynthetic activity was boosted along with carbon fixation and transfer to the host. This may be supported by the retention of a 50-fold larger algal nucleus for [~]1 week. Once the algal nucleus was lost, there was a decrease in plastid volume and photosynthesis, but plastids were still beneficial for the host after > 2 months. Unlike other kleptoplastidic interactions, we showed that the algal mitochondrion was also stolen and retained for several months, transforming into an extensive network in close proximity with plastids. This highlights a new strategy in plankton along the continuum of plastid symbioses where both the energy-producing plastid and mitochondrion of a microalga are hijacked for several months by a host. This symbiosis that we found to be widely-distributed in polar regions suggests that plastid-mitochondrion interaction may have played a role in the evolution of plastid acquisition.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

Furthermore, natural epivariants are enriched near genes and we uncovered a novel role for the Paf1 complex as a major facilitator of their prevalence. Conversely, related TE copies limit epiallelic variation, by producing the small RNAs that guide DNA methylation in trans. Crucially, natural epivariants mainly affect stress-responsive genes, making them unique targets for selection. Our findings therefore demonstrate that TEs are important mediators of transgenerational epigenetic variation in nature, with singular properties for plant adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

Crossovers are typically constrained to 1-3 events per chromosome pair, and their distribution is shaped by chromatin accessibility and DNA polymorphisms. Genome-wide crossover maps can be generated in plants by high-throughput short-read sequencing or linked-read sequencing. Here, we use long-read nanopore sequencing technology to develop a crossover mapping pipeline, COmapper, for high-resolution mapping of genome-wide crossovers from pooled DNA of F1 hybrid pollen and F2 recombinant seedlings derived from a cross between Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col and Ler. We validate the high accuracy of COmapper by applying nanopore long-read sequencing to pooled DNA of Arabidopsis F2 individuals with crossovers mapped by short-read sequencing. Using the COmapper, we constructed high-resolution genomic maps of crossovers using F1 hybrid pollen and F2 seedlings in wild type and crossover-elevated recq4a recq4b mutant, showing results comparable to short-read sequencing. Crossovers were enriched at gene-proximal promoters in wild type and increased but reshaped by high polymorphism density in recq4a recq4b. We propose that COmapper will be widely applicable for exploring the effects of genetic, epigenetic and environmental changes on the crossover patterns across diverse plant species.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537066

However, recent and heavily disputed debates on data quality have raised questions on the accuracy of demographic data at older ages. Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1729980537067

We describe this burden and compare it to the burden of influenza in the first two post-pandemic years in Denmark.

MethodsA cohort study including residents in Denmark from May 16, 2022, to June 7, 2024. Data were obtained from national registries, including information on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-positive COVID-19 and influenza admissions, mortality within 30 days of admission, sex, age, COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, comorbidity, and living in long-term care facility for elderly. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to compare rates of admissions between COVID-19 and influenza. To assess severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 30-day mortality between COVID-19 and influenza.

ResultsAmong 5,899,170 individuals, admissions with COVID-19 (n=24,687) were more frequent than admissions with influenza (n=8,682; aIRR 2.01, 95%CI 1.37-2.95), in particular during the first year (p=0.01), in the summer (p<0.001) and among people above 65 years of age (p<0.001). The number of deaths were also higher (COVID-19, n=2,393; influenza, n=522). Among patients, the risk of mortality of COVID-19 was higher than influenza in the 12-30 days following admission (0-11 days, aHR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.25; 12-30 days, aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.21-1.84), in particular among non-vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza (aHR 1.81, 95%CI 1.25-2.62), while it was similar to influenza among patients without comorbidities (aHR 1.07, 95%CI 0.63-1.80).

ConclusionCOVID-19 represented a greater disease burden than influenza, with more hospitalisations and deaths, and more severe disease primarily among non-vaccinated and comorbid patients. These results highlight the continued need for attention and public health efforts to mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2.","NA","medrxiv",1729980537067

The results indicate that Omicron BA.1.1 and its pure reverse mutants were widely distributed throughout the United States from the early days of their emergence, showing a statistically significant difference compared to other major variants, which spread from a small number of sources. The peak emergence of BA.1.1 and BA.1.1.18 pure reverse mutants occurred a few weeks before the peak of all collected samples, whereas the peak of pure reverse mutants in major BA.1 variants and BA.2 coincides with the overall sampling peak. Although the peaks of BA.1.x collections are not all synchronous, the peaks of pure reverse mutants in the BA.1 lineage completely overlap, with the number of such mutants declining abruptly after the peak. These regional and temporal anomalies in the Omicron BA.1 lineage, especially in the BA.1.1 lineage, are virtually impossible to explain by current theories of natural mutation and spread by human-to-human infection.","NA","medrxiv",1729980537067

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537067

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","10.1186/s40168-024-01916-8","biorxiv",1729980537067

Fluorescent HaloTag ligands employed in sequential labeling led to the discovery of distinct protein variants for histones, cohesins, and MCM complexes. Nonetheless, an efficient biochemical approach to separate the distinct protein variants to study their biological functions is missing. Principally being a gap in technology, the HaloTag toolbox lacks affinity ligands displaying good cell permeability and efficient affinity capture. Here, we describe the design, synthesis, and validation of a new cell-permeable Biotin-HaloTag ligand, which allows rapid labeling of Halo-tagged proteins in live cells and their efficient separation using streptavidin pull-down. Our work outlines how to use the herein-developed affinity ligand in sequential labeling to biochemically separate distinct protein variants and study their biological properties. The approach holds immense potential for addressing fundamental questions concerning essential cellular processes, including genome duplication and chromatin maintenance.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537067

However, high-fat diets are typically provided freely to animals in obesity experiments, so it remains unclear if high-fat diets would still cause obesity if they required more effort to obtain. We hypothesized that unrestricted and easy access is necessary for high-fat diet induced over-eating, and the corollary that requiring mice to perform small amounts of work to obtain high-fat diet would reduce high-fat diet intake and associated weight gain. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel home-cage based feeding device that either provided high-fat diet freely, or after mice poked their noses into a port one time, a simple action that is easy for them to do. We tested the effect of this intervention for six weeks, with mice receiving all daily calories from high-fat diet, modifying only how they accessed it. Requiring mice to nose-poke to access high-fat diet reduced intake and nearly completely prevented the development of obesity. In follow up experiments, we observed a similar phenomenon in mice responding for low-fat grain-based pellets that do not induce obesity, suggesting a general mechanism whereby animals engage with and consume more food when it is freely available vs. when it requires a simple action to obtain. We conclude that unrestricted access to food promotes overeating, and that a simple action such as a nose-poke can reduce over-eating and weight gain in mice. This may have implications for why over-eating and obesity are common in modern food environments, which are often characterized by easy access to low-cost unhealthy foods.","NA","biorxiv",1729980537067
