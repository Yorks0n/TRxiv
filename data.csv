MethodsThe intervention was designed such that the difficulty of the bicycle balance control task could be increased in a stepwise fashion, gradually approaching the difficulty of bicycle balance control on the public roads. The intervention lasted 11 weeks and involved three components: (1) training on an exercise bicycle, (2) balance control training on a bicycle simulator, and (3) cycling on the public roads with a safe start-and-stop technique that was practiced on the bicycle simulator. The intervention was administered to a group of community-dwelling senior citizens (N=23) that had quit cycling (N=19) or that were on the verge of doing so (N=4). The effectiveness of the intervention was evaluated by comparing balance control skill and confidence between a post-and a pre-intervention measurement. As a check for possible spontaneous recovery, the same comparison was also performed in a matched control group that did not participate in the intervention.

ResultsThis intervention produced a very large improvement (Cohens d = 1.5, t(16)=6.0, p<.001) in balance control skills and confidence on the public roads.

ConclusionBicycle balance control skills and confidence can be restored over a short period of time, but this does not rule out the importance of the slower process of acquiring a sufficient lower body strength.

Impact StatementIncreasing balance control skills and confidence is a realistic short-term target for rehabilitation interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1732745371135

Previously, we used in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to reveal the native thylakoid architecture of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [1] and then map the molecular organization of these thylakoids with single-molecule precision [2]. However, it remains to be shown how generalizable this green algal blueprint is to the thylakoids of vascular plants, which possess distinct membrane architecture subdivided into grana stacks interconnected by non-stacked stromal lamellae. Here, we continue our cryo-ET investigation to reveal the molecular architecture of thylakoids within intact chloroplasts isolated from spinach (Spinacia oleracea). We visualize the fine ultrastructural details of grana membranes, as well as interactions between thylakoids and plastoglobules. We apply and further develop AI-based computational approaches for automated membrane segmentation and membrane protein picking [3], enabling us to quantify the organization of photosynthetic complexes within the plane of the thylakoid membrane and across adjacent stacked membranes. Our analysis reveals that, despite different 3D architecture, the molecular organization of thylakoid membranes in vascular plants and green algae is strikingly similar. In contrast to isolated plant thylakoids, where semi-crystalline arrays of photosystem II (PSII) appear to hold some membranes together, we find in intact chloroplasts that PSII is non-crystalline and has uniform concentration both within the membrane plane and across stacked grana membranes. Similar to C. reinhardtii, we observe strict lateral heterogeneity of PSII and PSI at the boundary between appressed and non-appressed thylakoid domains, with no evidence for a distinct grana margin region where these complexes have been proposed to intermix. Based on these measurements, we support a simple two-domain model for the molecular organization of thylakoid membranes in both green algae and plants.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

RNN units are commonly modeled using various nonlinear activation functions, assuming these architectural differences do not affect emerging task solutions. Contrary to this view, we show that single-unit activation functions confer inductive biases that influence the geometry of neural population trajectories, single-unit selectivity, and fixed point configurations. Using a model distillation approach, we find that differences in neural representations and dynamics reflect qualitatively distinct circuit solutions to cognitive tasks emerging in RNNs with different activation functions, leading to disparate generalization behavior on out-of-distribution inputs. Our results show that seemingly minor architectural differences provide strong inductive biases for task solutions, raising a question about which RNN architectures better align with mechanisms of task execution in biological networks.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Here we show that antibody titers to historical and recent H5N1 strains are highest in older individuals and correlate more strongly with year of birth than with age, consistent with immune imprinting. After vaccination with an A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 vaccine, both younger and older humans produced H5-reactive antibodies to the vaccine strain and to a clade 2.3.4.4b isolate currently circulating in cattle, with higher seroconversion rates in young children who had lower levels of antibodies before vaccination.

Cell infection experiments demonstrated active virus replication in Tasmanian devil tumor cells, but not mosquito cells. The absence of viral replication in fibroblasts in cell culture and the lack of RNA detection in several organs suggested that replication was associated with tumor cells.

This spectrum includes clinical categories such as unresponsive wakefulness syndrome or minimally conscious state, where the behavioral assessment of consciousness can often be deceptive.

To bridge this dissociation, neuroimaging techniques are employed to look for the residual brain functions. Each neuroimaging modality imperfectly captures distinct aspects of brain preservation - functional, anatomical, or both. In this study, we adopt a comprehensive approach by integrating the neurophysiology and neuroimaging modalities available from the standard and advanced clinical assessment through interpretable machine learning (ML). The electrophysiological modalities included high-density electroencephalography (EEG) (resting state and task), whereas neuroimaging modalities included anatomical and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI, and 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET).

Our investigation reveals that specific modalities, such as functional assessments provide comprehensive insights into the currently evaluated state of consciousness - the diagnosis of the patients. Conversely, structural modalities offer valuable information about the patients evolution within the consciousness spectrum. We validate the proposed analysis with data coming from other centers with different acquisition parameters. Importantly, we show that there is an improved model performance with the increase in the number of modalities. We observe a higher inter-modality disagreement for MCS patients and those patients who improve. Lastly, we observe a difference in feature importances in diagnosis and prognosis.

This integrative multimodal and ML methodology presents a promising avenue for a more nuanced understanding of DoC, contributing to enhanced diagnostic precision and prognostic capabilities in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1732745371136

Whereas updated guidelines exist for how to interpret and report on variants that are identified from NGS using bioinformatics pipelines, there is a need for standardised bioinformatics practices for diagnostics to ensure clinical consensus, accuracy, reproducibility and comparability of the results. This article presents consensus recommendations developed by 13 clinical bioinformatics units taking part in the Nordic Alliance for Clinical Genomics (NACG), by expert bioinformaticians working in clinical production. The recommendations are based on clinical practice and focus on analysis types, test and validation, standardisation and accreditation, as well as core competencies and technical management required for clinical bioinformatics operations. Key recommendations include adopting the hg38 genome build as the reference and a standard set of recommended analyses, including the use of multiple tools for structural variant (SV) calling and in-house data sets for filtering recurrent calls. Clinical bioinformatics production should operate under the ISO 15189 standard, utilising off-grid clinical-grade high-performance computing systems, standardised file formats, and strict code version control. Containerized software containers or environment management systems are needed to ensure reproducibility. Pipelines should be rigorously documented and tested for accuracy and reproducibility, minimally covering unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. Standard truth sets such as GIAB and SEQC2 for germline and somatic variant calling, respectively, should be supplemented by recall testing of previously validated clinical cases. Data integrity must be verified using file hashing, and sample identity should be checked via sample fingerprinting and genetically inferred identification markers such as sex and relatedness. Finally, clinical bioinformatics teams should encompass diverse skills, including software development, data management, quality assurance, and domain expertise in human genetics. These recommendations provide a consensus framework for standardising bioinformatics practices across clinical WGS applications and can serve as a practical guide to facilities that are new to large-scale sequencing-based diagnostics, or as a reference for those who already run high-volume clinical production using NGS.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Three effectors, Hap1-3 (hypertrophy-associated proteins), were identified as virulence factors promoting hypertrophic mesophyll tumor cells (HTT). Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry revealed interactions among Hap effectors, suggesting potential effector complex formation. CRISPR-Cas9 triple knockout of hap1-3 demonstrated Hap1s role in HTT formation. Infection assays identified Hap1 as a key virulence factor interacting with maize Snf1-related kinase 1 (SnRK1), a central energy regulator. RNA-seq analysis showed that Hap1 promotes cell cycle and starch biosynthesis genes, while CR-hap1 induced defense-related WRKY transcription factors. Phosphoproteomics revealed increased phosphorylation of SnRK1 and metabolic enzymes during SG200 infection. Our findings support a model where U. maydis induces hypertrophy through Hap1, targeting the SnRK1 subunit to prevent SnRK1 inhibition by high trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), disrupting the antagonistic relationship between T6P and SnRK1. This reprograms host transcription to enhance starch metabolism and induce endoreduplication, leading to hypertrophy induction, while suppressing sugar-induced immune signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

However, methods to categorize paired NLRs remain limited, primarily relying on the presence of non-canonical domains in some sensor NLRs. Here, we propose that the AI system AlphaFold 3 can classify paired NLR proteins into sensor or helper categories based on predicted structural characteristics. Helper NLRs showed higher AlphaFold 3 confidence scores than sensors when modelled in oligomeric configurations. Furthermore, funnel-shaped structures--essential for activating immune responses--were reliably predicted in helpers but not in sensors. Applying this method to uncharacterized NLR pairs from rice, we found that AlphaFold 3 can differentiate between putative sensors and helpers even when both proteins lack non-canonical domain annotations. These findings suggest that AlphaFold 3 offers a new approach to categorize NLRs and enhances our understanding of the functional configurations in plant immune systems, even in the absence of non-canonical domain annotations.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Here we reveal a novel interaction between eosinophils and monocytes in the bone marrow, indirectly controlled by the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2. We demonstrate that ACKR2 maintains eosinophil levels within the bone marrow by scavenging CCL11. In the absence of ACKR2, elevated CCL11 leads to increased egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. As a result, eosinophil and monocyte interactions are reduced within the bone marrow niche, leading to changes in monocyte gene expression. Monocytes from ACKR2-/- mice are recruited to the tissues but are fundamentally altered in their ability to differentiate into macrophages, in the lung, peritoneal cavity and cavity wall. Bacterial elimination is impaired in ACKR2-/- mice during peritoneal infection. ACKR2 is therefore a key regulator of eosinophil-driven monocyte education in the bone marrow, required for full monocyte differentiation and macrophage function within the tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Here, we reveal that a dynamic feedback loop between evolving cell mechanics and cell-generated stresses shape the fusion of primary myoblasts in vitro. Applying principles from active nematics, we show that myoblast and myotube patterning follows physical rules similar to liquid crystal organization. Remarkably, fusion predominantly occurs at comet-shaped topological defects in cellular alignment, which we identified as regions of high compressive stress. We further find that this stress-driven organization depends on extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, which mirrors the nematic order of the cell population. Our integrated data, supported by active nematics-based mathematical modeling, accurately predict self-organization patterns and mechanical stresses that regulate myoblast fusion. By revealing the essential role of biomechanics and ECM interplay in myogenesis, this work establishes a foundational framework for understanding biomechanical principles in morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

These ALS saDMPs were enriched for transcription factor motifs such as ESR1 and REST. Moreover, we identified an additional 10 genes associated with ALS saDMPs through chromatin loop interactions, suggesting a potential regulatory role for these saDMPs on distant genes. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between DNA methylation at specific CpG sites and overall survival in ALS using Cox proportional hazards models. We identified two ALS saDMPs, cg14380013 and cg06729676, that showed significant associations with survival.

Perturb-DBiT allows for simultaneously evaluating the impact of each knockout on tumor initiation, development, metastasis, histopathology, and immune landscape. Ultimately, it not only broadens the scope of genetic inquiry, but also lays the groundwork for developing targeted therapeutic strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Despite its widespread use, a quantitative understanding of how DMS reactivity relates to specific RNA 3D structural features remains incomplete. To address this gap, we systematically analyzed DMS reactivity patterns with a massive library of 7,500 RNA constructs containing two-way junctions with known 3D structures. Our results reveal that DMS reactivity exists on a continuous spectrum rather than discrete high and low bins. Approximately 10% overlap in reactivity between WC and non-WC nucleotides demonstrates that simple thresholds cannot accurately determine base-pairing status. In flanking WC pairs, DMS reactivity correlates with base stacking strength and junction dynamics. For non-WC nucleotides, increased hydrogen bonding and decreased solvent accessibility led to WC-like DMS protection. Most significantly, we discover that DMS reactivity in non-canonical pairs strongly correlates with atomic distances and base pair geometry, enabling discrimination between different 3D conformations. These quantitative relationships establish novel metrics for evaluating RNA structural models and provide a new framework for incorporating DMS reactivity patterns into structure prediction algorithms.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Fluorescent protein tags have been extensively used to study the formation and the properties of condensates in vitro and in vivo, but there is evidence that tags may perturb the condensation properties of proteins. In this study, we carefully assess the effects of protein tags on the yeast DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1, a central regulator of processing bodies (P-bodies), which are biomolecular condensates involved in mRNA metabolism. We show that fluorescent tags as well as a poly-histidine tag greatly affect Dhh1 condensation in vitro and lead to condensates with different dynamic properties. Tagging of Dhh1 with various fluorescent proteins in vivo alters the number of P-bodies upon glucose starvation and some tags even show constitutive P-bodies in non-stressed cells.

ELS can permanently alter the brain, leading to cognitive impairment, increased sensitivity to future stressors, and mental health risks. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a key brain region implicated in the effects of ELS.

MethodsTo better understand the effects of ELS on the PFC, we ran a meta-analysis of publicly available transcriptional profiling datasets. We identified five datasets (GSE89692, GSE116416, GSE14720, GSE153043, GSE124387) that characterized the long-term effects of multi-day postnatal ELS paradigms (maternal separation, limited nesting/bedding) in male and female laboratory rodents (rats, mice). The outcome variable was gene expression in the PFC later in adulthood as measured by microarray or RNA-Seq. To conduct the meta-analysis, preprocessed gene expression data were extracted from the Gemma database. Following quality control, the final sample size was n=89: n=42 controls & n=47 ELS: GSE116416 n=23 (no outliers); GSE116416 n=44 (2 outliers); GSE14720 n=7 (no outliers); GSE153043 n=9 (1 outlier), and GSE124387 n=6 (no outliers). Differential expression was calculated using the limma pipeline followed by an empirical Bayes correction. For each gene, a random effects meta-analysis model was then fit to the ELS vs. Control effect sizes (Log2 Fold Changes) from each study.

ResultsOur meta-analysis yielded stable estimates for 11,885 genes, identifying five genes with differential expression following ELS (false discovery rate< 0.05): transforming growth factor alpha (Tgfa), IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 3 (Iqgap3), collagen, type XI, alpha 1 (Col11a1), claudin 11 (Cldn11) and myelin associated glycoprotein (Mag), all of which were downregulated.

Broadly, gene sets associated with oligodendrocyte differentiation, myelination, and brain development were downregulated following ELS. In contrast, genes previously shown to be upregulated in Major Depressive Disorder patients were upregulated following ELS.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that ELS during critical periods of development may produce long-term effects on the efficiency of transmission in the PFC and drive changes in gene expression similar to those underlying depression.

Plain Language SummaryEarly life stress refers to exposure to negative childhood experiences, such as neglect, disaster, and physical, mental, or emotional abuse. Early life stress can permanently alter the brain, including the prefrontal cortex, which can lead to cognitive and emotional dysfunction that lasts into adulthood. We performed a meta-analysis using five public datasets to identify consistent long-term effects of early life stress on gene expression (mRNA) in the prefrontal cortex of adult rodents. In these studies, rodents that had experienced early life stress consistently showed a decreased amount of mRNA for genes related to myelin. Myelin is the fatty layer that insulates the axons of neurons, allowing them to transmit electrical signals more efficiently. These gene expression changes may suggest long-term effects of early life stress on the efficiency of prefrontal neurotransmission, disrupting cognitive and emotional processing.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

However, understanding these immune heterogeneities and their links to various clinical complications, especially long COVID, remains a challenge. In this study, we performed unsupervised subtyping of longitudinal multi-omics immunophenotyping in over 1,000 hospitalized patients, identifying two critical subtypes linked to mortality or mechanical ventilation with prolonged hospital stay and three severe subtypes associated with timely acute recovery. We confirmed that unresolved systemic inflammation and T-cell dysfunctions were hallmarks of increased severity and further distinguished patients with similar acute respiratory severity by their distinct immune profiles, which correlated with differences in demographic and clinical complications. Notably, one critical subtype (SubF) was uniquely characterized by early excessive inflammation, insufficient anticoagulation, and fatty acid dysregulation, alongside higher incidences of hematologic, cardiac, and renal complications, and an elevated risk of long COVID. Among the severe subtypes, significant differences in viral clearance and early antiviral responses were observed, with one subtype (SubC) showing strong early T-cell cytotoxicity but a poor humoral response, slower viral clearance, and greater risks of chronic organ dysfunction and long COVID. These findings provide crucial insights into the complex and context-dependent nature of COVID-19 immune responses, highlighting the importance of personalized therapeutic strategies to improve both acute and long-term outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Compounds such as Tolvaptan (TVP) and Conivaptan are marketed drugs but their mechanisms of inhibition are not known. In addition, TVP presents unwanted side effects such as serious liver injury. Conivaptan also targets AVP V1a receptor subtype and thus is not selective to V2R. To develop novel molecules with less side effects and better selectivity, rational drug design based on experimental three-dimensional G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structures is a powerful and successful avenue. The lack of antagonist-bound V2R structures has however impaired this strategy for this GPCR. To fill this gap of knowledge, we solved here the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the vasopressin V2R in complex with two selective antagonists, the nonpeptide TVP and the green mamba snake Mambaquaretin toxin (MQ1). Both ligands, known to be competitive, bind into the orthosteric AVP binding site but with substantial differences. The small molecule binds deeper than MQ1, and directly contacts the toggle switch residue W2846.48 in the transmembrane domain 6 (TM6), whereas the peptide Kunitz- fold toxin presents more extensive contacts with the receptor through additional interactions with extracellular and transmembrane residues. As anticipated from the pharmacological properties of TVP and MQ1, both structures represent inactive conformations of the V2R. Their comparison with those of the active AVP-bound V2R reveals the molecular mechanisms modulating receptor activity. Finally, the structure of the V2R bound to a mini-protein such as MQ1 opens a new pharmacology era in the field of water homeostasis and renal diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Prior work has incorporated independent variation in susceptibility or transmissibility of individuals into epidemic compartmental models. Here, we develop and assess a mathematical framework that includes covariation in susceptibility and transmissibility. We show that uncorrelated variation in susceptibility and transmissibility leads to an effective transmissibility distribution that has a constant coefficient of variation such that the epidemic dynamics match those with variation in susceptibility alone, providing a baseline for comparison across different correlation structures. Increasing the correlation between susceptibility and transmissibility increases both the speed and strength of the outbreak - and is indicative of outbreaks which might be strongly structured by contact rate variation. In contrast, negative correlations between susceptibility and transmissibility lead to overall weaker outbreaks - with the caveat that the strength of effective transmission increases over time. In either case, correlations can shift the transmissibility distribution, thereby modifying the speed of the epidemic as the susceptible population is depleted. Overall, this work demonstrates how (often unaccounted) covariation in susceptibility and transmission can shape the course of outbreaks and final outbreak sizes.

Despite daily clinical use in thousands of patients, it remains fundamentally unknown how human neurons respond to intracranial stimulation. We address this question at a basic level by characterizing neuronal cell-type specific firing rate responses to single pulses of electrical stimulation of the human brain. We carried out broadly distributed stimulation in 30 patients undergoing neuromonitoring for epilepsy while recording from isolated neurons on microwires implanted into the medial temporal and frontal lobes. Out of a total of 228 recorded units, 16.2% (N = 191) were classified as interneurons and 83.8% (N = 37) were classified as principal cells, using a threshold clustering method, based on intrinsic waveshape characteristics. To see how stimulation affected neuronal activation for each cell type, we calculated firing rate change between a pre-stimulation and post-stimulation window and observed that 174 units were significantly modulated with the vast majority (91%) showing firing rate suppression. We then characterized stimulation-evoked changes in firing rate to gain insight into cell type-specific responses. Additionally, in a subset of the units, we observed that firing rate responses were modulated by stimulation distance, where local stimulation (within approximately 40 mm) could evoke instantaneous firing, whereas distant stimulation reliably suppressed firing in the same units. Finally, we analyzed a subset of units within the seizure onset zone, which exhibited unique waveform features and responses to stimulation. This study bridges a gap in the neuromodulation field by examining the single-unit firing rate response to direct electrical stimulation of the human brain and analyzing cell-type specific firing rate responses. We show that low frequency, single-pulse stimulation broadly elicits firing rate suppression, but parameters, such as distance from the unit, can have diverse effects on firing rate responses. This work informs the neuronal basis of CCEP generation and therefore has implications for clinical mapping and informs novel ""active probing"" strategies for precision diagnosis and neuromodulation of seizure pathophysiology in surgical cases.

While ROS inhibit the E3 ligase CUL3KEAP1 to stabilize NRF2 and elicit antioxidant gene expression, cells recovering from stress must rapidly reactivate CUL3KEAP1 to prevent reductive stress and oxeiptosis-dependent cell death. How cells restore efficient NRF2-degradation upon ROS clearance remains poorly understood. Here, we identify TRIP12, an E3 ligase dysregulated in Clark-Baraitser Syndrome and Parkinsons Disease, as a component of the oxidative stress response. TRIP12 is a ubiquitin chain elongation factor that cooperates with CUL3KEAP1 to ensure robust NRF2 degradation. In this manner, TRIP12 accelerates stress response silencing as ROS are being cleared, but limits NRF2 activation during stress. The need for dynamic control of NRF2-degradation therefore comes at the cost of diminished stress signaling, suggesting that TRIP12 inhibition could be used to treat degenerative pathologies characterized by ROS accumulation.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

We here derive a viable mechanism for ictogenesis driven by h- and m-channel overexpression from analysis of an in silico spiking neuronal microcircuit exhibiting spontaneous seizure-like events (SLEs). Such SLEs are dependent upon sufficiently strong gain in two adaptation terms phenomenologically modeling these channels' effects: voltage homeostasis (h-current) and spike-frequency adaptation (m-current). Excessive gain of these adaptation terms interferes with the circuit's processing of highly correlated input, promoting a sequence of network-level events that collectively provoke an SLE. Importantly, these changes do not cause increased excitability in isolated neurons, nor does this cascade require a change in the amplitude of external input to the circuit, suggesting an ictogenic pathway independent of classical changes to the E-I balance. The viability of this mechanism for SLE onset is strengthened by the host of experimentally-characterized features of seizure produced in this model reliant upon the presence of these adaptation terms, including the irregular initiation and termination of seizure-like events and time-varying peak frequency of oscillations during such events (i.e., chirps). Moreover, the cell-type dependent effects of changes in these adaptation terms, as delineated in our analyses, represent experimentally-testable predictions for future study of h- and m-channelopathies. These computational results provide vital new insights into the epileptogenic nature of h- and m-channel overexpression currently absent in the experimental literature.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Intratumor cellular heterogeneity related to neural differentiation has emerged as a defining characteristic that can explain its aggressive behavior. Although recurrent driver mutations are not typically observed in these tumors, Rho GTPases signaling genes have been identified as one of the most frequently mutated in aggressive NB cases. Rho GTPases are key regulators of cell morphology, migration, and differentiation, yet their role in NB remains underexplored. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the expression and clinical significance of Rho GTPase signaling networks in NB tumors.

MethodsWe analyzed the expression profiles of Rho GTPases, their regulators, and effectors, across multiple NB patient cohorts. Gene expression correlations with clinical parameters were assessed, and bioinformatics analyses were employed to identify gene expression patterns and interactions in tumors. Functional studies were performed in NB cell lines and in vivo models to validate the role of key Rho GTPases, including Cdc42, in NB progression and differentiation.

ResultsOur analysis revealed widespread dysregulation of Rho GTPase signaling in NB tumors. Specific GTPases, such as RHOA or RHOV, were upregulated in advanced disease stages, while others, including RHOB, RHOU and CDC42, were downregulated and associated with poor prognosis. A minimal Rho-related gene signature was identified as a strong predictor of NB patient survival. Functional validation highlighted Cdc42 as a key regulator of NB differentiation, where its downregulation was necessary for maintaining the malignant, undifferentiated phenotype of NB cells. We also identified ARHGAP31/CdGAP as a critical regulator of Cdc42 in NB progenitor cells, suggesting a mechanism for Cdc42 suppression in aggressive NB.

ConclusionsAn important role for Rho GTPase signaling in NB progression is revealed, providing a foundation for further exploration of Rho GTPase-targeted therapies in NB. In particular, Cdc42 signaling intervene in the balance between differentiation and stemness in NB cells, suggesting specific signaling events controlling the identity and plasticity of NB cells.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Our analysis reveals that 29% of genes have multiple mammalian-conserved alternative transcripts, with 31% of these genes showing tissue-specific switching of the major transcript isoforms. We uncover extensive conservation of coordinated splicing events, primarily driven by tissue-specific mutually associated exon splicing, particularly in neural tissues and cytoskeletal genes. At the epitranscriptome level, we find that 14.2% of m6A RNA modifications are conserved across mammals, with 39% of analysed genes containing a conserved m6A RNA modification.

We analyzed DNA sequence data, derived from the blood cells of >700,000 participants in UK Biobank and the All of Us Research Program, and developed new computational approaches to recognize, measure and learn from DNA-repeat instability at 15 highly polymorphic CAG-repeat loci. We found that expansion and contraction rates varied widely across these 15 loci, even for alleles of the same length; repeats at different loci also exhibited widely variable relative propensities to mutate in the germline versus the blood. The high somatic instability of TCF4 repeats enabled a genome-wide association analysis that identified seven loci at which inherited variants modulate TCF4 repeat instability in blood cells. Three of the implicated loci contained genes (MSH3, FAN1, and PMS2) that also modulate Huntington's disease age-at-onset as well as somatic instability of the HTT repeat in blood; however, the specific genetic variants and their effects (instability-increasing or -decreasing) appeared to be tissue-specific and repeat-specific, suggesting that somatic mutation in different tissues - or of different repeats in the same tissue - proceeds independently and under the control of substantially different genetic variation. Additional modifier loci included DNA damage response genes ATAD5 and GADD45A. Analyzing DNA repeat expansions together with clinical data showed that inherited repeats in the 5' UTR of the glutaminase (GLS) gene are associated with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (OR=14.0 [5.7-34.3]) and liver diseases (OR=3.0 [1.5-5.9]).

We describe this burden and compare it to the burden of influenza in the first two post-pandemic years in Denmark.

MethodsA cohort study including residents in Denmark from May 16, 2022, to June 7, 2024. Data were obtained from national registries, including information on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-positive COVID-19 and influenza admissions, mortality within 30 days of admission, sex, age, COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, comorbidity, and living in long-term care facility for elderly. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to compare rates of admissions between COVID-19 and influenza. To assess severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 30-day mortality between COVID-19 and influenza.

ResultsAmong 5,899,170 individuals, admissions with COVID-19 (n=24,687) were more frequent than admissions with influenza (n=8,682; aIRR 2.01, 95%CI 1.37-2.95), in particular during the first year (p=0.01), in the summer (p<0.001) and among people above 65 years of age (p<0.001). The number of deaths were also higher (COVID-19, n=2,393; influenza, n=522). Among patients, the risk of mortality of COVID-19 was higher than influenza in the 12-30 days following admission (0-11 days, aHR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.25; 12-30 days, aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.21-1.84), in particular among non-vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza (aHR 1.81, 95%CI 1.25-2.62), while it was similar to influenza among patients without comorbidities (aHR 1.07, 95%CI 0.63-1.80).

ConclusionCOVID-19 represented a greater disease burden than influenza, with more hospitalisations and deaths, and more severe disease primarily among non-vaccinated and comorbid patients.

A link between BEST1 and the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been proposed. The most appreciated receptors for extracellular GABA are the GABAB G-protein coupled receptors and the pentameric GABAA chloride channels, both of which have fundamental roles in the CNS. Here, we demonstrate that BEST1 is directly activated by GABA. Through functional studies and atomic-resolution structures of human and chicken BEST1, we identify a GABA binding site on the channels extracellular side and determine the mechanism by which GABA binding induces opening of the channels central gate. This same gate is activated by intracellular [Ca2+], indicating that BEST1 is controlled by ligands from both sides of the membrane. The studies demonstrate that BEST1, which shares no structural homology with GABAA, is a GABA-activated chloride channel. The physiological implications of this finding remain to be studied.

Significance Statement{gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Extracellular GABA is primarily sensed by GABAB G-protein coupled receptors, and GABAA pentameric chloride channels. We show that the chloride channel bestrophin-1 (BEST1) is also activated by extracellular GABA. The application of GABA, but not glycine or other endogenous molecules we tested, markedly potentiates chloride currents through the channel. Structural studies combined with electrophysiology and other functional studies reveal the mechanism of GABA activation. GABA binding within the outer entryway of the channel allosterically controls its gate,  the neck. Molecular interactions with GABA resemble those in GABAA receptors, despite a lack of homology between the channels. The physiological significance of GABA-activation in BEST1 remains to be studied.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Despite its fundamental nature, the manner through which sociability arises--whether it is innate or acquired and its neural mechanisms-- remains unknown. Here, we found that the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, produces a constellation of fearful reactions when it encounters another fly for the first time. However, these animals become sociable following several hours of exposure to conspecific (but not heterospecific) odors. Two large-scale neural silencing screens of 188 brain cell types revealed that both initial fearful reactions and learned sociability depend upon overlapping networks including circuits in the mushroom body, the principal center for associative learning and memory in the insect brain. Functional recordings of key mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) from this network over two hours of social interactions support a mechanistic model whereby fly odors modulate social valence by rebalancing MBON population activity, biasing action selection, and thereby driving sociable rather than fearful responses towards other flies. Thus, a center for learning and memory plays a fundamental role in establishing the basis for most social interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

While polyploid organisms are prevalent, ancient polyploidy (paleopolyploidy) is decisively rare. Numerous studies have revealed adaptive changes at the genomic, cellular, and physiological levels that confer evolutionary advantages to polyploids, but the factors contributing to their long-term success remain poorly understood. Here, we assembled a large angiosperm genome dataset encompassing 470 different angiosperm species. We reconstructed a highly concordant evolutionary timescale of angiosperms and conducted a large-scale study to identify and date WGDs across this set of species. We unveiled 132 independent ancient WGD events that do not seem randomly distributed in time, but clustered around periods of great environmental upheaval. We observed that a majority of paleopolyploidizations occurred between 50 and 75 mya, coinciding with the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum and the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary. A more recent wave of ancient WGDs can be observed between 25 and 40 mya, coinciding with periods of glaciation expansion, rapid shifts in sea surface temperatures, and a marked decrease in global mean surface temperature. Integrating different lines of evidence, we argue that polyploids have an increased chance of survival during times of great environmental turmoil.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

In this method, Phage Discovery by Co-culture (Phage DisCo), strains are isogenic except for fluorescent tags and one perturbation expected to impact phage infection.

We find that promoters generate differences in both the mRNA abundance and the effective translation rate of these transcripts. Stronger promoters not only transcribe more RNA but also show higher effective translation rates. While the strength of the promoter is largely preserved upon genome integration with identical elements, the choice of polyadenylation signal and coding sequence can generate large differences in the profiles of the mRNAs and proteins. We used long-read direct RNA sequencing to characterize full-length mRNA isoforms and observe remarkable uniformity of mRNA isoforms from the transgenic units. Together, our high-resolution profiling of transgenic mRNAs and proteins offers insight into the impact of common synthetic genetic components on transcriptional and translational mechanisms.

Indeed, we often not only choose to learn motor skills because of some external reward, but also because skilled movement, in and of itself, is satisfying. While dopamine is known to drive reward-based motor learning, it remains unclear whether dopamine is implicated in motor learning under conditions ostensibly driven by intrinsic rewards/motivation (i.e., in the absence of extrinsic feedback or reward). Here, we investigated the role of dopamine in motor skill learning guided by internally determined signals of performance success, using a task where learning occurred either in the absence or presence of feedback. We found that dopamine altered performance both in the presence and in the absence of information on task success. This provides direct causal evidence for a role of dopamine in motor learning driven by internal task goals.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Transcription factors (TFs) being key to genetic regulation, have been studied in the origins of eusociality in Hymenoptera (Bees, Ants and Wasps) but less so in Blattodea (Cockroaches and Termites). Here we show that the social transition in Blattodea, from cockroaches to termites, displays similar patterns of regulatory change to those found in Hymenoptera. Specifically, by analysing 3 cockroach and 5 termite genomes, we find more TF families with relaxed selection compared to intensified selection and lineage-specific gene family expansions in termites. We also find that genes under selection support neotenic caste determination. There are key differences in TF regulation in comparison with Hymenoptera with contractions in TF gene families and reduced diversity in enriched DNA binding motifs of TFs. Furthermore, we show that with increased social complexity TF activating domain diversity, one of the evolutionary and structural building blocks of TFs, decreases with gene family size while DNA binding domain diversity and number increases. This study highlights similarities in social transitions between Hymenoptera and Blattodea, with evidence of large changes in transcriptional regulation followed by lineage specific adaptations. We also show that phenotypic diversity in termites does not necessitate greater transcriptional complexity.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Here we show these signatures encode diverse anti-phage defence systems. Firstly, the WASA-1 prophage encodes a 2-gene abortive-infection system WonAB that renders the lineage resistant to the major predatory vibriophage ICP1, which alongside other phages, restricts cholera epidemics and has potential for use in prophylaxis. Secondly, the unique set of genes on Vibrio seventh pandemic island II encodes an unusual modification-dependent restriction system and a new type of the Shedu defence family. Taken together, we propose that these anti-phage defence systems have likely contributed to the success of a major epidemic lineage of the ongoing seventh cholera pandemic.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

The capability for producing custom-shape high-quality backbones for very large proteins would further expand the scope of protein design. To this end, here we introduce the AlphaFold2 (AF2) cycler (af2cycler) design pipeline. AF2cycler is used to refine draft protein backbone geometries of arbitrary shape created by the Chroma diffusion model or other methods, using a combination of AF2 and ProteinMPNN to achieve high designability with minimal deviations from the initial target structure. In silico testing on multiple protein designs (100-1000 amino acids) demonstrated improvements in structural integrity and designability after af2cycling confirmed by enhanced ESMFold repredictions. Experimental wet lab validation through the design of a variety of test proteins with distinct shapes, each comprising 1000 amino acids, showed structural agreement between in silico predictions and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, establishing the af2cyclers efficacy in translating designs into real-world results. Af2cycler provides a convenient and reliable protein design workflow, particularly for large proteins, with potential for expanding to applications in areas such as design of higher-order protein complexes and multi-state backbone optimization.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

To control the outbreak, public health officials began vaccination campaigns using the third-generation orthopoxvirus vaccine MVA-BN. Prior to this outbreak, the durability of MPXV-specific immunity induced by MVA-BN was poorly understood. In 2022, we launched the New York City Observational Study of Mpox Immunity (NYC OSMI, NCT05654883), a longitudinal study of 171 participants comprising MVA-BN vaccinees and mpox convalescent individuals. Peripheral blood sampling was performed at intervals including prior to vaccination, after one dose, and after the second dose. MVA-BN vaccinees with and without a history of smallpox vaccination demonstrated detectable mpox virus (MPXV)-specific memory B cells at one-year post-vaccination. Additionally, MVA-BN increased MPXV neutralizing titers in smallpox vaccine-naive vaccinees, with a comparable peak titer reached in naive and smallpox vaccine-experienced vaccinees. However, neutralizing titers returned to baseline within 5-7 months for naive individuals, while remaining elevated in those with prior smallpox vaccination. Both naive and experienced individuals generated robust, immunodominant IgG responses against MPXV H3 and A35, but naive vaccinees IgG responses showed lower avidity than experienced vaccinees. These data highlight a low avidity antibody response elicited by MVA-BN that is short-lived in naive vaccinees. This work supports the need for long-term studies on protection induced by MVA-BN including the potential need for booster doses as well as the development of next-generation orthopoxvirus vaccines.","NA","medrxiv",1732745371136

Here, we characterize the mechanisms that drive the formation of these structures and their function in gene regulation in a lymphoid-to-myeloid differentiation system. Based on analyses at base-pair resolution, we demonstrate a close correlation between binding of regulatory proteins, formation of chromatin interactions, and gene expression. Integration of single-allele topologies and computational modeling shows that tissue-specific gene loci are organized into chromatin hubs, characterized by cooperative interactions between multiple enhancers, promoters, and CTCF-binding sites. Depletion of CTCF strongly impairs the formation of these structures, but has mild effects on gene expression, which can be explained by rewired enhancer-promoter interactions. This demonstrates an instructive role for enhancer-promoter interactions in gene regulation that is independent of cooperative interactions in chromatin hubs. Together, these results contribute to a mechanistic understanding of the structure-function relationship of the genome during cellular differentiation.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Prior to testing whether aging biomarkers may be useful as surrogate endpoints, it is first necessary to determine whether they are responsive to interventions that target aging. Epigenetic clocks are aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation with prognostic value for many aging outcomes. Many individual studies are beginning to explore whether epigenetic clocks are responsive to interventions. However, the diversity of both interventions and epigenetic clocks in different studies make them difficult to compare systematically. Here, we curate TranslAGE-Response, a harmonized database of 51 public and private longitudinal interventional studies and calculate a consistent set of 16 prominent epigenetic clocks for each study, along with 95 other DNAm biomarkers that help explain changes in each clock. With this database, we discover patterns of responsiveness across a variety of interventions and DNAm biomarkers. For example, clocks trained to predict mortality or pace of aging have the strongest response across all interventions and show consistent agreement with each other, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions drive the strongest response from DNAm biomarkers, and study population and study duration are key factors in driving responsiveness of DNAm biomarkers in an intervention. Some classes of interventions such as TNF-alpha inhibitors have strong, consistent effects across multiple studies, while others such as senolytic drugs have inconsistent effects. Clocks with multiple sub-scores (i.e. ""explainable clocks"") provide specificity and greater mechanistic insight into responsiveness of interventions than single-score clocks. Our work can help the geroscience field design future clinical trials, by guiding the choice of interventions, specific subsets of epigenetic clocks to minimize multiple testing, study duration, study population, and sample size, with the eventual aim of determining whether epigenetic clocks can be used as surrogate endpoints.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

There are no vaccines available for protection and only one drug approved for treatment that has limited eKicacy. A major barrier to developing new therapeutics is a lack of foundational knowledge of Cryptosporidium biology, including which parasite genes are essential for survival and virulence. Here, we iteratively improve the tools for genetically manipulating Cryptosporidium and develop a targeted CRISPR-based screening method to rapidly assess how the loss of individual parasite genes influence survival in vivo. Using this method we examine the parasites pyrimidine salvage pathway and a set of leading Cryptosporidium vaccine candidates. From this latter group we determined the parasite gene known as Cp23 to be essential for survival, which was confirmed through inducible knockout in vitro and in vivo. Parasites deficient in Cp23 were able to replicate within and emerge from infected epithelial cells, yet unable to initiate gliding motility which is essential for the reinfection of neighbouring cells. The targeted screening method presented here is highly versatile and will enable researchers to more rapidly expand the knowledge base for Cryptosporidium infection biology, paving the way for new therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Here, we describe an optimized bioinformatical framework to enhance the confident identification of bacterial immunopeptides. Immunopeptidomics data of cell cultures infected with the foodborne model pathogen Listeria monocytogenes were searched by four different search engines, PEAKS, Comet, Sage and MSFragger, followed by data-driven rescoring with MS2Rescore. Compared to standard single search-engine results, this integrated workflow boosted the number of identified immunopeptides on average by 27% and led to the high confident detection of 18 additional bacterial peptides (+27%) matching 15 different Listeria proteins (+36%). Despite an overall large agreement between the search engines, a small number of conflicts (< 1%) in spectra-to-peptide assignments revealed ambiguous identifications that served as a quality filter. Finally, we show compatibility of our workflow with sensitive timsTOF data acquisition and find that rescoring, now with inclusion of ion mobility features, identifies 76% more peptides compared to orbitrap-based acquisition.

Treatment of TB requires prolonged administration of antibiotics, some of which target Mtb ribosomes, the protein synthesizing machine of the cell. We determined high-resolution cryo-EM structures of Mtb ribosomes obtained from biofilms under zinc-depleted conditions that are expected to induce ribosome hibernation. In these structures, in addition to finding the Mtb homolog of the hibernation promoting factor Mpy that binds to the decoding center in the small ribosomal subunit, we discovered an actinobacteria-specific protein, previously of unknown function, bound in the nascent polypeptide-exit tunnel (NPET) within the large ribosomal subunit. We refer to this NPET-bound protein as a actinobacteria-specific ribosome tunnel occlusion factor (RTOF). RTOF is found with vacant or E-tRNA-bound 70S ribosomes, but not in actively translating Mtb ribosomes, suggesting that its binding coincides with ribosome hibernation. RTOF makes strong interactions through the entire stretch of NPET extending up to the peptidyl-transferase center (PTC), such that it would block the passage of nascent polypeptide chain. The highly conserved FRRKSG motif of RTOF also interferes with accommodation of the formyl-methionyl moiety of initiator fMet-tRNA(fMet) in the conformation required for translation initiation. A molar excess of mRNA and initiator fMet-tRNA(fMet) displaces RTOF by triggering a significant alteration to the conformation of FRRKSG motif, which suggests how RTOF-bound hibernating ribosomes can be reactivated under optimal cellular conditions. The presence of RTOF would interfere with the binding of PTC-targeting drugs, such as macrolides, lincosamides, and oxazolidines, thereby maintaining a drug-free pool of hibernating Mtb ribosomes.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

In contrast with the dorso-ventrally flat Drosophila wing, its serial homolog the haltere adopts a globular shape thought to arise from a lack of matrix-mediated adhesion between its dorsal and ventral surfaces. Contradicting this model, however, matrix manipulations are known to deform halteres. To understand haltere morphogenesis, we characterized matrix behavior and monitored metamorphic development of the haltere. We found that, similar to the wing, correct haltere morphogenesis requires Collagen IV degradation, which we show is mediated by ecdysone-controlled expression of Matrix metalloprotease 2 in both wing and haltere. After Collagen IV is degraded, similar again to the wing, dorsal and ventral haltere surfaces establish Laminin-mediated contact through long cytoskeletal projections. Furthermore, time-lapse analysis of shape changes in wild type and mutant halteres indicates that these projections couple the two surfaces through a central tensor, ensuring load distribution across the whole organ to create a globular shape against tissue-wide deforming forces. Our findings reveal an unexpected role for matrix-mediated adhesion in haltere morphogenesis and describe a novel type of matrix-based tensor structure building 3D shape from 2D epithelia.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Electrical communication between qNSCs and neurons enables this precise spatial and temporal control of reactivation throughout the entire span of the CNS. Using single-cell RNA-seq we discovered that, remarkably, qNSCs switch on a host of neuronal genes while maintaining a stem cell identity.

Approximately 85% of vaginal births in the United Kingdom (UK) are affected by childbirth related perineal trauma, either spontaneously or due to episiotomy.

Incontinence also places a significant financial burden on the healthcare system. Previous estimates have shown that stress urinary incontinence alone costs the National Health Service (NHS) 177 million UK pounds per year.

The aim of this rapid review was to identify evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost- effectiveness of interventions for preventing continence issues resulting from birth trauma. Twenty-three studies, published between 2023 and 2024, were included in this review: 20 systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness and three economic evaluations. A number of key findings, research implications and evidence gaps were identified.

The findings support the use of exercise-based interventions including pelvic floor muscle training for prenatal and postnatal women to prevent urinary incontinence. However, there is limited evidence supporting their long-term effectiveness. Incontinence is a potential long- term burden as pregnancy and childbirth can weaken the pelvic floor, making women more susceptible to incontinence in later life. Menopause often exacerbates these issues due to hormonal changes and by further weakening the pelvic floor muscles. Non exercise-based interventions, such as prenatal perineal massage and vaginal devices were less represented in the available evidence base, especially for faecal incontinence outcomes. There was a paucity of economic evaluations assessing the cost-effectiveness of interventions for incontinence, however, the substantial economic burden of incontinence on the NHS necessitates investment in clinically effective, preventative options. Our findings present the case for investing in exercise-based interventions. Further research is needed to evaluate the maintenance and long-term effects of exercise-based therapy. More research is also needed that focus on alternative type interventions and the prevention of faecal incontinence. Future reviews need to consider qualitative findings of womens experiences and the acceptability and feasibility of rolling out interventions for the prevention of incontinence.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYO_ST_ABSWhat is a Rapid Review?C_ST_ABSOur rapid reviews use a variation of the systematic review approach, abbreviating or omitting some components to generate the evidence to inform stakeholders promptly whilst maintaining attention to bias.

Who is this Rapid Review for?This Rapid Review was conducted as part of the Health and Care Research Wales Evidence Centre Work Programme. The review question was suggested by representatives of the Womens Health Team of the Welsh Government. The intended audience is Womens Health and continence service commissioners and policy makers in Wales.

Background / Aim of Rapid ReviewUrinary and faecal incontinence, which are often linked to the stresses and strains of childbirth, particularly perineal trauma, are debilitating conditions that can significantly impact womens quality of life. Approximately 85% of vaginal births in the United Kingdom (UK) are affected by childbirth related perineal trauma, either spontaneously or due to episiotomy. Incontinence also places a significant financial burden on the healthcare system. Previous estimates have shown that stress urinary incontinence alone costs the National Health Service (NHS) {pound}177 million per year. The prevention of continence issues following childbirth through evidence-based interventions is essential for the health of women both short-term and later in life. The economic cost of incontinence on both individuals and the healthcare system is substantial and the implementation of effective interventions to prevent incontinence following birth trauma can prevent avoidable and costly care in future. The aim of this rapid review was to identify evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions for preventing continence issues resulting from birth trauma.

Results of the Rapid ReviewO_ST_ABSThe evidence baseC_ST_ABSO_LIThe review included evidence available up until June 2024 (when the searches were conducted). The included studies identified in this rapid review were published between 2003 and 2024. Twenty-three studies were included in this rapid review: 20 systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness and three economic evaluations.

Key findingsO_LITwelve systematic reviews of prenatal and/or postnatal pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and mixed exercise modes (with a PFMT element) were identified.
C_LIO_LIOf the eleven systematic reviews (five of which included meta-analyses) assessing prenatal PFMT and mixed exercise, eight reported findings to support PFMT and exercise for the prevention of urinary incontinence in the postnatal period (up to 6 months postpartum).
C_LIO_LIEvidence from two meta-analyses of longer-term outcomes did not support the effectiveness of prenatal PFMT to prevent urinary incontinence in the late postpartum period (defined as greater than 6-12 months) or after 5 years following childbirth. However, data on longer-term outcomes were combined from a diverse set of studies with varied prescription of the PFMT regimens and the reviews did not explicitly examine the impact of continuing PFMT postnatally.
C_LIO_LIOf the two systematic reviews that assessed postnatal PFMT one focused on existing incontinence and found no evidence on prevention, and the other found conflicting evidence on the prevention of urinary incontinence.
C_LIO_LIFive systematic reviews (of which, three included meta-analyses) explored the effectiveness of prenatal perineal massage. None of the meta-analyses found any significant differences in incidence of urinary incontinence (evidence from three meta-analyses) or faecal incontinence (evidence from two meta-analyses) following prenatal perineal massage. For the other two systematic reviews, one reported a reduction in faecal and gas incontinence but not urinary incontinence, while the other found no effect on any type of incontinence.
C_LIO_LITwo systematic reviews reported on the effectiveness of vaginal devices for existing incontinence but did not report on the prevention of incontinence.
C_LIO_LIIn a systematic review of pushing technique, results demonstrated a significant difference in urinary incontinence scores from baseline to postpartum in the spontaneous pushing group compared with the directed pushing group.
C_LIO_LIA cost-utility analysis (conducted to inform NICE guideline 210) utilising a decision analytic Markov model of supervised prenatal pelvic floor muscle training in a population of pregnant women found the intervention to be cost-effective for preventing urinary incontinence when compared to no intervention. The intervention was likely to be cost-effective for all willingness to pay thresholds over {pound}11,000 per QALY gained.
C_LIO_LIA cost-effectiveness analysis found that group-based pelvic floor muscle training was more cost-effective than individually supervised training for the prevention of urinary incontinence, at a cost of $14.53 per case of urinary incontinence prevented or cured if eight women attended a training session.
C_LIO_LIA RCT and cost-consequence analysis reported no significant difference in urinary or faecal incontinence between groups of nulliparous women adopting an upright or lying down birthing position; but the intervention was not specifically designed to prevent incontinence.
C_LI

Policy and Practice ImplicationsThis rapid review complements existing NICE guidance on the prevention and non-surgical management of pelvic floor dysfunction (NG210, 2021), and the management of faecal incontinence (CG49, 2007). The NICE 2021 guidance recommends pelvic floor muscle training for prenatal and postnatal women, and our rapid review also identified a large evidence base regarding exercise-based interventions to prevent urinary incontinence. However, the NICE guidance indicates limited evidence supporting the long-term effectiveness of PFMT, which also aligns with the findings of our review. We identified two meta-analyses that failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of PFMT in preventing incontinence in the long term, but the included studies varied in prescription of PFMT regimens and did not examine the impact of continuing PFMT postnatally. Incontinence is a potential long-term burden as pregnancy and childbirth can weaken the pelvic floor, making women more susceptible to incontinence in later life. Menopause often exacerbates these issues due to hormonal changes and by further weakening the pelvic floor muscles. Although our review considered a broader range of interventions than the NICE 2021 guidance, other interventions, such as prenatal perineal massage and vaginal devices were less represented in the available evidence base, especially for faecal incontinence outcomes. Despite a paucity of economic evaluations assessing the cost-effectiveness of interventions for incontinence, the substantial economic burden of incontinence on the NHS necessitates investment in clinically effective, preventative options. Our findings present the case for investing in exercise-based interventions. Future recommendations for policy and practice should also consider qualitative findings of womens experiences and the acceptability and feasibility of rolling out interventions for the prevention of incontinence.

Research Implications and Evidence GapsA significant evidence gap exists regarding the cost-effectiveness of interventions aimed at preventing incontinence resulting from birth trauma. Further research is needed for non-exercise interventions and maintenance interventions. Future studies adopting longer time horizons are also needed to assess any potential long-term outcomes such as incidence of incontinence during the menopause. Future evidence reviews need to consider qualitative research of the acceptability and feasibility of interventions to prevent continence issues.","NA","medrxiv",1732745371136

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells can persist indefinitely when delivered to patients with B cell cancers and can confer long-term remission. For patients with solid tumors, however, sustaining CAR T cell activity remains a major challenge. This has been attributed in part to the immune microenvironment within solid tumors, though the contribution of specific immune subsets to resistance to CAR T cells is not clear. Here we resolve how the immunology of irradiated tumors dramatically enhances persistence and efficacy of CAR T cells targeted to advanced lung metastases in a syngeneic mouse model. Remarkably, CAR T cell persistence depended critically on dendritic cells (DC) that underwent trogocytic ""antigen-dressing"" of tumor target antigens and stimulated CAR T cells through the chimeric receptor. Furthermore, tumor irradiation increased antigen-dressing onto DCs. In the absence of functional DCs, CAR T cell activity in irradiated tumor was short-lived and tumors relapsed. These findings establish a critical mechanism through which DCs maintain the CAR T cell pool in irradiated tumors, thus supporting translation of this approach to advance CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

This is particularly apparent during early development when many TEs become de-repressed. MERVL elements are highly yet transiently upregulated in mouse totipotent 2-cell (2C) embryos during major zygotic genome activation (ZGA), and in 2C-like cells in vitro. One of the most powerful activators of MERVL is the pioneer transcription factor, Dux. However, apparent differences lie in the requirement for Dux versus MERVL activation in embryos, for unclear reasons. Moreover, sustained Dux activation causes cell toxicity in multiple cell types, which may or may not be linked to MERVL activation. Using a CRISPR-activation, 2C-GFP reporter system, we have unpicked the relative role of Dux and MERVL in ZGA, totipotent-like characteristics and cell toxicity. We find that direct MERVL activation comprises only a portion of the Dux-dependent transcriptome, and which is sufficient for expanded fate potential, but not other totipotency features. Conversely, Dux-induced pathology is independent of MERVL activation and involves induction of the pro-apoptotic factor, Noxa. Our study highlights the complexity of the Dux-MERVL transcriptional network and uncovers a new player in Dux-driven pathology.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

A frequently encountered issue is that proteins adsorb to the air-water interface of the sample in a limited number of orientations. This makes it challenging to obtain high-resolution reconstructions or may even cause projects to fail altogether. We have previously observed that laser flash melting and revitrification of cryo samples reduces preferred orientation for large, symmetric particles. Here, we demonstrate that our method can in fact be used to scramble the orientation of proteins of a range of sizes and symmetries. The effect can be enhanced for some proteins by increasing the heating rate during flash melting or by depositing amorphous ice onto the sample prior to revitrification. This also allows us to shed light onto the underlying mechanism. Our experiments establish a set of tools for overcoming preferred orientation that can be easily integrated into existing workflows.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

To tackle these challenges, we proposed a machine-learning ""stacking"" approach that draws information from whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) across different modalities, from task-fMRI contrasts and functional connectivity during tasks and rest to structural measures, into one prediction model. We benchmarked the benefits of stacking, using the Human Connectome Projects: Young Adults (n=873, 22-35 years old) and Human Connectome Projects-Aging (n=504, 35-100 years old) and the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (Dunedin Study, n=754, 45 years old). For predictability, stacked models led to out-of-sample r[~].5-.6 when predicting cognitive abilities at the time of scanning, primarily driven by task-fMRI contrasts. Notably, using the Dunedin Study, we were able to predict participants cognitive abilities at ages 7, 9, and 11 using their multimodal MRI at age 45, with an out-of-sample r of 0.52. For test-retest reliability, stacked models reached an excellent level of reliability (ICC>.75), even when we stacked only task-fMRI contrasts together. For generalisability, a stacked model with non-task MRI built from one dataset significantly predicted cognitive abilities in other datasets. Altogether, stacking is a viable approach to undertake the three challenges of BWAS for cognitive abilities.

Significance statementFor decades, psychologists and neuroscientists have attempted to predict cognitive abilities from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data but have had limited success, casting doubt on the predictive ability of brain MRI. Here we proposed a machine learning method, called stacking, which allows us to draw information across different types of brain MRI. Using three large databases (n=2,131, 22-100 years old), we found stacking to make the prediction of cognitive abilities 1) closer to actual cognitive scores when applied to a new individual, not part of the modelling process, 2) reliable over times and 3) applicable to the data collected from different age groups and MRI scanners. Indeed, stacking, especially with fMRI task contrasts, allowed us to use MRI of people aged 45 to predict their childhood cognitive abilities reasonably well. Accordingly, stacking may help MRI realise its potential to predict cognitive abilities.

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with poor cognition, but it is unclear whether supplementation would provide benefit, particularly in individuals with mild/moderate deficiencies which do not have other clinical risks. The objective of this study was to establish the impact of daily vitamin D supplementation on cognition in older adults with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency.

Methods and FindingsTwo-arm parallel 24-month randomised controlled trial, with Vitamin D supplementation compared with a placebo. This was a remote trial, completed from home involving 620 adults 50 years or older with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency and early cognitive impairment. The primary outcome was executive function measured through Trail making B and other secondary measures of cognition, function and wellbeing.

Vitamin D supplementation conferred no significant benefit to executive function compared to placebo at follow-up on the primary outcome (between-group difference: 5770, 95% CI: -2189 to 13730) or cognition, function, or wellbeing. Secondary analyses in defined subgroups and a per-protocol analysis also showed no significant impact on any outcome measures.

ConclusionsVitamin D supplementation produced no measurable improvement in cognitive outcomes in older adults with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency. The remote trial methodology provides an innovative approach to large-scale trials.

The availability of massive scRNA-seq datasets and advanced machine learning techniques has recently driven the development of single-cell foundation models that provide informative and versatile cell representations based on expression profiles. However, to understand disease states, we need to consider entire tissue ecosystems, simultaneously considering many different interacting cells. Here, we tackle this challenge by generating patient-level representations derived from multi-cellular expression context measured with scRNA-seq of tissues. We develop PaSCient, a novel model that employs a multi-level representation learning paradigm and provides importance scores at the individual cell and gene levels for fine-grained analysis across multiple cell types and gene programs characteristic of a given disease. We apply PaSCient to learn a disease model across a large-scale scRNA-seq atlas of 24.3 million cells from over 5,000 patients. Comprehensive and rigorous benchmarking demonstrates the superiority of PaSCient in disease classification and its multiple downstream applications, including dimensionality reduction, gene/cell type prioritization, and patient subgroup discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

To control the infection with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron JN.1 subvariants, JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccines have been developed. Some previous reports showed that the JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccine of Pfizer/BioNTech (US/Germany) increased antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 subvariants and XEC. However, the efficacy of other available JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccines (e.g., Daiichi-Sankyo, Japan) remains unassessed. To validate the antiviral efficacy induced by JN.1 mRNA vaccines, sera were collected from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech JN.1 mRNA vaccine (N=15) or Daiichi-Sankyo JN.1 mRNA vaccine (N=19) before and 3-4 weeks after vaccination. We then performed a neutralization assay using these sera and pseudoviruses. Both Pfizer/BioNTech JN.1 vaccine (2.4-to 8.0-fold, P=0.0001) and Daiichi-Sankyo JN.1 vaccine (2.3-to 13-fold, P=0.0001) boosted antiviral humoral immunity against all variants tested with statistical significance. While the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine encodes the full-length JN.1 spike (S), the Daiichi-Sankyo mRNA vaccine encodes the receptor-binding domain of JN.1 S. Our data suggest that the receptor-binding domain of JN.1 S can effectively induce antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 subvariants and XEC comparable to the full-length JN.1 S. However, it should be considered that the sizes of our cohorts are relatively small (<20 donors per cohort), and donor characteristics, such as age, sex, underlying disease status, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, may critically affect the experimental results. Future investigations with larger cohorts will address this concern. When compared to vaccination with JN.1 mRNA vaccines, our previous investigations showed that the natural infection of JN.1 and KP.3.3 elicited poorer antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 and its subvariants. Our results suggest that the JN.1 mRNA vaccination more robustly induces antiviral humoral immunity against recent JN.1 subvariants than the natural infection of JN.1 subvariants regardless of manufacturer. Moreover, as we reported last year, the humoral immunity induced by XBB.1.5 monovalent mRNA vaccine against XBB.1.5 was weaker than that against ancestral B.1.1. However, in the case of JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccine, here we showed that the 50% neutralization titer against XBB.1.5 is greater than that against ancestral B.1.1. These observations imply that immune imprinting has shifted from that biased toward pre-Omicron to that biased toward Omicron, depending on the time and/or number of immune stimuli (e.g., infection and/or vaccination).","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Methods: Studies published up to July 2023 were searched independently across eight electronic databases to evaluate the risk of developing neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms more than 12 weeks post-infection between exposure and controls groups (excess weight vs. normal weight; obesity vs. non-obesity). Meta-analyses were conducted under a random-effects model. Results: Of the 10,122 abstracts screened, 18 studies (n = 139,091 adults) met the inclusion criteria and reported PCC symptoms according to nutritional status. These studies included 79,050 individuals with excess weight vs 57,926 normal-weight individuals and 30,694 individuals with obesity vs 107,612 non-obese individuals.

Obesity significantly increased the risk of headache (RR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.34- 1.49), smell disorder (RR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.09-1.21), taste disorder (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.07-1.36), and vertigo (RR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.35-1.53). Conclusions: Excess weight or obesity increases the risk of experiencing neuro-symptoms related to PCC. Individuals with these conditions urgently need enhanced personalized care management in current post-pandemic context.","NA","medrxiv",1732745371136

However, the specific mechanisms by which viral proteins influence cholesterol remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cholesterol sequestration within lysosomes, with the viral protein ORF3a identified as the primary driver of this effect. Mechanistically, we found that ORF3a interacts directly with the HOPS complex subunit VPS39 through a hydrophobic interface formed by residues W193 and Y184. A W193A mutation in ORF3a significantly rescues cholesterol egress and corrects the mislocalization of the lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC2, which is caused by defective trafficking of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) sorting receptor, the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). We further observed a marked reduction in bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a lipid essential for lysosomal cholesterol egress, in both SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and ORF3a-expressing cells, suggesting BMP reduction as an additional mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-caused cholesterol sequestration. Inhibition of lysosomal cholesterol egress using the compound U18666A significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting a potential viral strategy of manipulating lysosomal cholesterol to modulate host cell susceptibility. Our findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a disrupts cellular cholesterol transport by altering lysosomal protein trafficking and BMP levels, providing new insights into virus-host interactions that contribute to lipid dysregulation in infected cells.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Recent studies have suggested that SARS- CoV-2 infection can lead to reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), yet, the extent and impact of viral reactivation in COVID-19 and its effect on the host immune system remain incompletely understood.

Here we present a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of viral reactivation of all known chronically infecting viruses in 1,154 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study, who were followed prospectively for twelve months. We reveal significant reactivation of Herpesviridae, Enteroviridae, and Anelloviridae families during acute stage of COVID-19 (0-40 days post- hospitalization), each exhibiting distinct temporal dynamics. We also show that viral reactivation correlated with COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and clinical outcomes, including mortality. Integration of cytokine profiling, cellular immunophenotyping, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics demonstrated virus-specific host responses, including elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, CXCL10, and TNF), increased activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and upregulation of cellular replication genes, independent of COVID-19 severity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Notably, persistent Anelloviridae reactivation during convalescence ([&ge;]3 months post-hospitalization) was associated with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptoms, particularly physical function and fatigue.

Our findings highlight a remarkable prevalence and potential impact of chronic viral reactivation on host responses and clinical outcomes during acute COVID-19 and long term PASC sequelae.

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty. We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit. Based on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still undeniably demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1732745371136

DesignCohort study.

SettingElectronic health record data.

Participants2 528 916 singleton births from the UKs Clinical Practice Research Datalink (1996-2018), Norways Medical Birth Registry (2009-2020), and Swedens Medical Birth Register (2006-2020).

Main outcome measuresStillbirth, neonatal death, pre- and post-term delivery, small and large for gestational age, and low Apgar score five minutes post-delivery.

ResultsA total of 120 209 (4.8%) deliveries were exposed to maternal antidepressant use during pregnancy. Maternal antidepressant use during pregnancy was associated with increased odds of stillbirth (adjusted pooled OR (aOR) 1.16, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.28), preterm delivery (aOR 1.26, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.30), and Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.75 to 1.91). These findings persisted in the discordant sibling analysis, but with higher uncertainty. The adjusted predicted absolute risk for stillbirth was 0.34% (95% CI 0.33 to 0.35) among the unexposed and 0.40% (95% CI 0.36 to 0.44) in the antidepressant exposed. Restricting to women with depression or anxiety, the association between antidepressant exposure and stillbirth attenuated (aOR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.21). Paternal antidepressant use was modestly associated with preterm delivery and low Apgar score. Most antidepressants were associated with preterm delivery (except paroxetine) and Apgar score (except mirtazapine and amitriptyline).

ConclusionsMaternal antidepressant use during pregnancy may increase the risk of stillbirth, preterm delivery, and low Apgar score, although the absolute risks remained low. Confounding by severity of indication cannot be ruled out, as the severity of symptoms was not available. The modest association between paternal antidepressant use and both preterm delivery and low Apgar score suggests that residual confounding by familial environment cannot be ruled out.","NA","medrxiv",1732745371136

Representation learning methods summarize high-dimensional single-cell data into a manageable latent space in a typically nonlinear fashion, allowing cross-sample integration or generative modeling. However, these methods often produce entangled representations, limiting interpretability and downstream analyses. Existing disentanglement methods instead either require supervised information or impose sparsity and linearity, which may not capture the complexity of biological data. We, therefore, introduce Disentangled Representation Variational Inference (DRVI), an unsupervised deep generative model that learns nonlinear, disentangled representations of single-cell omics. This is achieved by combining recently introduced additive decoders with nonlinear pooling, for which we theoretically prove disentanglement under reasonable assumptions. We validate DRVIs disentanglement capabilities across diverse relevant biological problems, from development to perturbational studies and cell atlases, decomposing, for example, the Human Lung Cell Atlas into meaningful, interpretable latent dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that if applied to batch integration, DRVIs integration quality does not suffer from the disentanglement constraints and instead is on par with entangled integration methods. With its disentangled latent space, DRVI is inherently interpretable and facilitates the identification of rare cell types, provides novel insights into cellular heterogeneity beyond traditional cell types, and highlights developmental stages.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

However, within individual brain areas, neurons often exhibit very diverse and seemingly disorganized responses. A more careful analysis shows that these neurons can sometimes be grouped together into specialized subpopulations (categorical representations). Organization can also be found at the level of the representational geometry in the activity space, typically in the form of low-dimensional structures. It is still unclear how the geometry in the activity space and the structure of the response profiles of individual neurons are related. Here, we systematically analyzed the geometric and selectivity structure of the neural population from 40+ cortical regions in mice performing a decision-making task (IBL public Brainwide Map data set). We used a reduced-rank regression approach to quantify the selectivity profiles of single neurons and multiple measures of dimensionality to characterize the representational geometry of task variables. We then related these measures within single areas to the position of each area in the sensory-cognitive cortical hierarchy. Our findings reveal that only a few regions (in primary sensory areas) are categorical. When multiple brain areas are considered, we observe clustering that reflects the brains large-scale organization. The representational geometry of task variables also changed along the cortical hierarchy, with higher dimensionality in cognitive regions. These trends were explained by analytical computations linking the maximum dimensionality of representational geometry to the clustering of selectivity at the single neuron level. Finally, we computed the shattering dimensionality (SD), a measure of the linear separability of neural activity vectors; remarkably, the SD remained near maximal across all regions, suggesting that the observed variability in the selectivity profiles allows neural populations to maintain high computational flexibility. These results provide a new mathematical and empirical perspective on selectivity and representation geometry in the cortical neural code.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Biased compounds that selectively activate therapy-relevant pathways promise to be safer, more effective medications. The determinants of bias are poorly understood, however, and rationally-designed, G protein-subtype-selective compounds are lacking. Here, using the prototypical class A GPCR neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), we find that small molecules binding the intracellular GPCR-transducer interface change G protein coupling by subtype-specific and predictable mechanisms, enabling rational drug design. We demonstrate that the compound SBI-553 switches NTSR1 G protein preference by acting both as a molecular bumper and a molecular glue. Structurally, SBI-553 occludes G protein binding determinants on NTSR1, promoting association with select G protein subtypes for which an alternative, shallow-binding conformation is energetically favorable. Minor modifications to the SBI-553 scaffold produce allosteric modulators with distinct G protein subtype selectivity profiles. Selectivity profiles are probe-independent, conserved across species, and translate to differences in in vivo activity. These studies demonstrate that G protein selectivity can be tailored with small changes to a single chemical scaffold targeting the receptor-transducer interface and, as this pocket is broadly conserved, present a strategy for pathway-selective drug discovery applicable to the diverse GPCR superfamily.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

We outline a segmentation strategy termed AI-directed Voxel Extraction (AIVE), that combines AI predictions with image electron signals to confidently segment membrane boundaries irrespective of the AI model used. We demonstrate the precision conferred by AIVE by applying it to the quantitative analysis of organelle interactomes from multiple FIB-SEM datasets.

Although the ability of Stentor to habituate has been extensively documented, the mechanism of learning is currently not known. Here we take a bottom-up approach and investigate a simple biochemistry-based model based on prior electrophysiological measurements in Stentor along with general properties of receptor molecules. In this model, a mechanoreceptor senses the stimulus and leads to channel opening to change membrane potential, with a sufficient change in polarization triggering an action potential that drives contraction. Receptors that are activated can become internalized, after which they can either be degraded or recycled back to the cell surface. This activity-dependent internalization provides a potential means for the cell to learn. Stochastic simulations of this model confirm that it is capable of showing habituation similar to what is seen in actual Stentor cells, including the lack of dishabituation by strong stimuli and the apparently step-like response of individual cells during habituation. The model also can account for several habituation hallmarks that a previous two-state Markov model could not, namely, the dependence of habituation rate on stimulus magnitude, which had to be added onto the two state model but arises naturally in the receptor inactivation model; the rate of response recovery after cessation of stimulation; the ability of high frequency stimulus sequences to drive faster habituation that results in a lower response probability, and the potentiation of habituation by repeated rounds of training and recovery. The model makes the prediction that application of high force stimuli that do not normally habituate should drive habituation to weaker stimuli due to decrease in the receptor number, which serves as an internal hidden variable. We confirmed this prediction using two new sets of experiments involving alternation of weak and strong stimuli. Furthermore, the model predicts that training with high force stimuli delays response recovery to low force stimuli, which aligns with our new experimental data. The model also predicts subliminal accumulation, wherein continuation of training even after habituation has reached asymptotic levels should lead to delayed response recovery, which was also confirmed by new experiments. The model is unable to account for the phenomenon of rate sensitivity, in which habituation caused by higher frequency stimuli is more easily reversed leading to a frequency dependence of response recovery. Such rate sensitivity has not been reported in Stentor. Here we carried out a new set of experiments which are consistent with the models prediction of the lack of rate sensitivity. This work demonstrates how a simple model can suggest new ways to probe single-cell learning at an experimental level. Finally, we interpret the model in terms of a kernel estimator that the cell may use to guide its decisions about how to response to new stimuli as they arise based on information, or the lack thereof, from past stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

This longevity discrepancy also extends to health and aging-larger dogs show higher rates of age-related diseases. Despite this well-established phenomenon, we still know little about the biomarkers and molecular mechanisms that might underlie breed differences in aging and survival. To address this gap, we generated an epigenetic clock using DNA methylation from over 3 million CpG sites in a deeply phenotyped cohort of 864 companion dogs from the Dog Aging Project, including some dogs sampled annually for 2-3 years. We found that the largest breed size tends to have epigenomes that are, on average, 0.37 years older per chronological year compared to the smallest breed size. We also found that higher residual epigenetic age was significantly associated with increased mortality risk, with dogs experiencing a 34% higher risk of death for each year increase in residual epigenetic age. These findings not only broaden our understanding of how aging manifests within a diverse species but also highlight the significant role that demographic factors play in modulating the biological mechanisms underlying aging. Additionally, they highlight the utility of DNA methylation as both a biomarker for healthspan-extending interventions, a mortality predictor, and a mechanism for understanding inter-individual variation in aging in dogs.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

The ADMIXTURE software is a widely used model-based approach to account for population stratification, however, it struggles with convergence issues and does not scale to modern human datasets or the large number of variants in whole-genome sequencing data. Likelihood-free approaches optimize a least square objective and have gained popularity in recent years due to their scalability. However, this comes at the cost of accuracy in the ancestry estimates in more complex admixture scenarios. We present a new model-based approach, fastmixture, which adopts aspects from likelihood-free approaches for parameter initialization, followed by a mini-batch expectation-maximization procedure to model the standard likelihood. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that the model-based approaches of fastmixture and ADMIXTURE are significantly more accurate than recent and likelihood-free approaches. We further show that fastmixture runs approximately 30x faster than ADMIXTURE on both simulated and empirical data from the 1000 Genomes Project such that our model-based approach scales to much larger sample sizes than previously possible.

Human skin undergoes both chronological aging and environmental degradation, particularly UV-induced photoaging. Detrimental structural and physiological changes caused by aging include epidermal thinning due to stem cell depletion and dermal atrophy associated with decreased collagen production. Here, we present a comprehensive single-cell atlas of skin aging, analyzing samples from young, middle-aged, and elderly individuals, including both sun-exposed and sun-protected areas. This atlas reveals age-related cellular composition and function changes across various skin cell types, including epidermal stem cells, fibroblasts, hair follicles, and endothelial cells. Using our atlas, we have identified basal stem cells as a highly variable population across aging, more so than other skin cell populations such as fibroblasts. In basal stem cells, we identified ATF3 as a novel regulator of skin aging. ATF3 is a transcriptional factor for genes involved in the aging process, with its expression reduced by 20% during aging. Based on this discovery, we have developed an innovative mRNA-based treatment to mitigate the effects of skin aging. Cell senescence decreased 25% in skin cells treated with ATF3 mRNA, and we observed an over 20% increase in proliferation in treated basal stem cells. Importantly, we also found crosstalk between keratinocytes and fibroblasts as a critical component of therapeutic interventions, with ATF3 rescue of basal cells significantly enhancing fibroblast collagen production by approximately 200%. We conclude that ATF3-targeted mRNA treatment effectively reverses the effects of skin aging by modulating specific cellular mechanisms, offering a novel, targeted approach to human skin rejuvenation.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Barrier formation requires positioning of functional tight junctions (TJ) to the most suprabasal viable layer of the epidermis through a mechanical circuit that is driven by generation of high tension at adherens junctions. However, what allows the sensing of tension build-up at these adhesions and how this tension is balanced to match the requirements of tissue mechanical properties is unclear. Here we show that the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 is essential for the maturation of intercellular junctions into functional, continuous adhesions. Deletion of Piezo1 results in an imbalance of cell contractility and membrane tension, leading to a delay in adhesion maturation. Consequently, the requirement for Piezo1 activity can be bypassed by lowering contractility or elevating membrane tension. In vivo, Piezo1 function in adhesion integrity becomes essential only in aged mice where alterations in tissue mechanics lead to impaired TJs and barrier dysfunction. Collectively these studies reveal an essential function of Piezo1 in the timely establishment and maintenance of cell-cell junctions in the context of a mechanically tensed epidermis.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

While highly effective in tumors with high mutational burden, lowly mutated cancers, including pediatric malignancies, present low response rate and limited predictive biomarkers. Here, we present a framework for the identification and validation of tumor-reactive T cells as a biomarker to quantify ICI efficacy and as candidates for a personalized TCR-T cell therapy. Therefore, we profiled a pediatric malignant rhabdoid tumor patient with complete remission after ICI therapy using deep single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the peripheral blood. Specifically, we tracked T cell dynamics longitudinally from the tumor to cells in circulating over a time course of 12 months, revealing a systemic response and durable clonal expansion of tumor-resident and ICI-induced TCR clonotypes. We functionally validated tumor reactivity of TCRs identified from the TME and the blood by co-culturing patient-derived tumor cells with TCR-engineered autologous T cells. Here, we observed unexpectedly high frequencies of tumor-reactive TCR clonotypes in the TME and confirmed T cell dynamics in the blood post-ICI to predict tumor-reactivity. These findings strongly support spatio-temporal tracking of T cell activity in response to ICI to inform therapy efficacy and to serve as a source of tumor-reactive TCRs for personalized TCR-T designs.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

This includes the recent circulation of H5N1 in dairy cattle herds in the USA and a rise in associated human cases. In this study, we investigated differences in tissue tropism of two HPAI H5N1 strains, the isolate A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (VN1203) isolated from a fatal human case in 2004 and the bovine isolate A/Bovine/Ohio/B24osu-342/2024 (Bov342) isolated in 2024, in C57BL/6J mice. Infection with either HPAI H5N1 isolate was uniformly lethal in mice. However, tissue tropism differed significantly: while VN1203 replication was largely restricted to the respiratory tract, Bov342 successfully replicated in the respiratory tract as well as various regions of the brain. Bov342-challenged animals exhibited clinical signs consistent with central nervous system (CNS) infection, and infectious virus was detected in brain tissue. Correspondingly, cytokine profiles in the brain differed significantly between the isolates. Notably, in addition to abundant evidence of CNS infection in Bov342-challenged mice via immunohistochemistry, sporadic intranuclear and intracytoplasmic immunoreactivity was observed in other tissues in the head, including the choroid plexus, retina, and inner ear. This study demonstrates that while both HPAI H5N1 isolates are uniformly lethal in C57BL/6J mice upon aerosol exposure, significant differences exist in tissue tropism, with Bov342 resulting in respiratory disease as well as increased neurotropism and inflammation in the brain and nasal turbinates compared to VN1203, which predominantly induces respiratory disease.

Significance statementThe rise in HPAI H5N1 infections among mammals, including humans in the USA, highlights an emerging One Health concern. Understanding the phenotypic changes of HPAI H5N1 and associated increase in infection of mammalian hosts is critical. In this study, we investigated the tissue tropism in mice of a bovine HPAI H5N1 strain isolated in 2024 and compared it to a strain isolated from a human patient in 2004. Our findings reveal that the bovine isolate exhibits enhanced neurotropism, unlike the respiratory-restricted replication observed with the HPAI H5N1 isolate from 2004. This difference in tissue tropism, accompanied by distinct cytokine responses in the brain, underscores the potential for altered disease outcomes in other mammalian hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

A common objective in spatial transcriptomics data analysis is to identify spatially variable genes within predefined cell types or regions within the tissue. However, these regions are often implicitly one-dimensional, making standard two-dimensional coordinate-based methods less effective as they overlook the underlying tissue organization. Here we introduce a methodology grounded in spectral graph theory to elucidate a one-dimensional curve that effectively approximates the spatial coordinates of the examined sample. This curve is then used to establish a new coordinate system that better reflects tissue morphology. We then develop a generalized additive model (GAM) to detect genes with variable expression in the new morphologically relevant coordinate system. Our approach directly models gene counts, thereby eliminating the need for normalization or transformations to satisfy normality assumptions. We demonstrate improved performance relative to current methods based on hypothesis testing, while also accurately estimating gene expression patterns and precisely identifying spatial loci where deviations from constant expression are observed. We validate our approach through extensive simulations and by analyzing experimental data from multiple platforms such as Slide-seq and MERFISH.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b exhibits tropism for the mammary gland, with milk from infected cows containing high levels of viral RNA and infectious virus. The viruss ability to infect the mammary gland suggests potential risks of transmission to offspring through breastfeeding. Here, we show that mammary gland infection with bovine H5N1 influenza in lactating ferrets transmits virus and disease to suckling kits. Viral RNA titers significantly increased in milk over time and remained high in mammary gland tissue. Suckling kits had significantly increased viral RNA in the oral and nasal cavity, as well as in feces. However, viral detection in the dam nasal cavities was delayed, with only minimal virus present in the oral cavity. Lung viral RNA levels were low in dams but high in a sampled suckling kit. Additionally, we detected the expression of the H5N1 receptor, 2,3 sialic acid, in mammary tissue from both ferrets and humans.

Compared with 3 Tesla (3T) MRI, 7 Tesla (7T) MRI can detect more subtle injuries, including hippocampal subfield volume differences and additional standard biomarkers such as white matter lesions. 7T MRI could help with the interpretation of the various persistent post-acute and distal onset sequelae of COVID-19 infection.

ObjectiveTo investigate the differences in white matter hyperintensity (WMH), hippocampal subfields volumes, and cognition between patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and non-hospitalized participants in a multi-site/multi-national cohort.

DesignOriginal investigation of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between 5/2020 and 10/2022 in 3 USA and 1 UK medical centers with follow-up at hospital discharge.

ParticipantsA total of 179 participants without a history of dementia completed cognitive, mood and other assessments and MRI scans.

ExposureCOVID-19 severity, as measured by hospitalization vs no hospitalization

Main Outcomes and Measures7T MRI scans were acquired. All WMH and hippocampal subfield volumes were corrected for intracranial volumes to account for subject variability. Cognition was assessed using a comprehensive battery of tests. Pearson correlations and unpaired t-tests were performed to assess correlations and differences between hospitalized and non-hospitalized groups.

ResultsWe found similar WMH volume (4112 vs 3144mm3, p=0.2131), smaller hippocampal volume (11856 vs 12227mm3, p=0.0497) and lower cognitive and memory performance, especially the MoCA score (24.9 vs 26.4 pts, p=0.0084), duration completing trail making test B (97.6 vs 79.4 seconds, p=0.0285), Craft immediate recall (12.6 vs 16.4 pts, p<0.0001), Craft delay recall (12.0 vs 15.6 pts, p=0.0001), and Benson figure copy (15.2 vs 16.1 pts, p=0.0078) in 52 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (19[37%] female; mean[SD] age, 61.1[7.4] years) compared with 111 age-matched non-hospitalized participants (66[59%] female; mean[SD] age, 61.5[8.4] years).

Conclusions and RelevanceOur results indicate that hospitalized COVID-19 cases show lower hippocampal volume when compared to non-hospitalized participants. We also show that WMH and hippocampal volumes correlate with worse cognitive scores in hospitalized patients compared with non-hospitalized participants, potentially indicating recent lesions and atrophy.

Key PointsQuestion: Do white matter hyperintensity burden, hippocampal whole and subfield volumes, and cognition differ between patients hospitalized with COVID-19 versus participants without hospitalization?

Findings: We found no significant difference in white matter hyperintensity volume, but hippocampal volume was reduced, and cognitive and memory performance were worse in those hospitalized for COVID-19 compared with age-matched non-hospitalized group (either mild COVID-19 or no COVID-19 reported). In the hospitalized group, increased white matter hyperintensity and reduced hippocampal volumes are significantly higher correlated with worse cognitive and memory scores.

Meaning: Adults hospitalized for COVID-19 had lower hippocampal volumes and worse cognitive performance than adults with COVID-19 that did not lead to hospitalization or without reported COVID-19 infection.","NA","medrxiv",1732745371136

However, null space theory makes the counter-intuitive prediction that neurons often generate spikes not to cause behavior, but to prevent the effects that other neurons would have on behavior. What is missing is a direct way to test this theory in the brain. Here, we found that in the marmoset cerebellum, spike-triggered averaging identified a potent vector unique to each Purkinje cell (P-cell) along which the spikes of that cell displaced the eyes. Yet, the P-cells were active not just for saccades along their potent vector, but for all saccades. Simultaneous recordings revealed that two spikes in two different P-cells produced superposition of their potent vectors. The result was a population activity in which the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. But why was one neuron producing spikes that would be canceled by another neuron? To answer this question, we recorded from the mossy fiber inputs and the interneurons in the molecular layer. We found that the mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands as well as the sensory goal of the movement, then the interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P-cells as a population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped. Because this output had faster dynamics than was present in the individual neurons, the cerebellum placed the cells in subtractive competition with each other such that the downstream effects of spiking in one neuron were partially or completely eliminated because of the spiking in another neuron.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Translational PerspectiveHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a significant and growing global health concern lacking disease-modifying therapeutic options, reflecting inadequate preclinical models of the disease. Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we created the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, demonstrated phenotypic disease characteristics of elevated stiffness and slowed kinetics, showed transcriptomic consistency with HFpEF patient data, identified SERCA2a as a key downregulated gene, performed dosing titration of SERCA2a gene therapy, and showed improvement of cardiac kinetics post-treatment. The findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF.","NA","biorxiv",1732745371136

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US. It remains unclear, however, how medical and societal changes during this period affected national chronic pain prevalence, a key dimension of population health.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic and explore reasons driving the trends

MethodsWe use data from the 2019, 2021, and 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a multi-wave cross-sectional survey. Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian US population age 18 and older (n=88,469). Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; some models include additional 19 covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of COVID and long COVID. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP also increased from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019, to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023, after a decline to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021. The 2023 increases occurred in all examined body sites except for dental pain. COVID and long COVID had a modest role in the population-wide pain increases, the causes of which remain unclear.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before the pandemic but surged dramatically since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1732745371136
