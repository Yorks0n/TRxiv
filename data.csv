PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS","NA","medrxiv",1746569311190

Nasal anti-CD3 treats animal models of progressive MS by inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and lessen clinical disease.

MethodsTen patients with non-active secondary progressive MS (naSPMS) that continued to progress on B cell therapy were treated with nasal anti-CD3 (foralumab) for a minimum of six months in an open label study. Safety monitoring included otolaryngology evaluation and neurologic assessments including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC-4), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II) and Low Contract Visual Acuity (LCVA). MRI and microglial translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging with [F-18]PBR06 were conducted. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic biomarkers and single cell RNA sequencing of blood was performed to evaluate foralumab-induced immunomodulation. The endpoints of our study were safety, clinical effects, microglial signal and immune measures.

ResultsAll patients stabilized on EDSS scores and three of four patients treated continuously for 12 months had improvement on EDSS. Six of 10 patients had improvement in fatigue on the MFIS scale. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) or severe AEs and no new T2 lesions were observed on MRI. There was a reduction in TSPO-PET signal over six months (p<0.05). Changes in peripheral blood gene expression occurred as early as three months and affected antigen presentation, interferon responses and regulatory pathways in multiple cell types including FoxP3+ Tregs, CD4+ Tcm cells, CD8+ Tem cells, CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes and B cells. TGF{beta} expression was increased across cell multiple subsets.

InterpretationThese findings identify a novel, non-toxic immune based therapy for the treatment for PIRA that acts by the induction of a regulatory immune responses and dampens microglial inflammation. Double blind placebo-controlled trials are warranted to explore nasal foralumab for the treatment of naSPMS.","NA","medrxiv",1746569311190

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1746569311190

PFC often uses distinct subspaces to represent incoming sensory information and to maintain it in working memory. However, it's generally assumed that a subspace carries specific information within a specific time frame. Here, in two datasets, we show that neither assumption is correct. The same subspace used during initial encoding was later reactivated during the behavioral response. We also found that subspaces ostensibly dedicated to processing sensory information were recycled to represent behavioral response information later in a trial. We further found a consistent spatial mapping between the original subspace usage and its later recycling. These results demonstrate previously unknown flexibility of PFC subspace coding, both in the deployment of subspaces across time and in their multiplexing of information. This flexibility suggests that PFC subspaces function more like ""workspaces"" into which different types of information can be written.","NA","biorxiv",1746569311190

MM is preceded by an asymptomatic precursor monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Studies have identified several risk factors for the progression of MGUS to MM; however, the relative contributions of these remain unknown. Particularly, understanding the contribution among those modifiable factors may inform MM prevention.

METHODSThis study quantified these contributions by estimating the adjusted population attributable fractions (aPAF) of modifiable risk factors for MM among the Veteran population with MGUS.

RESULTSAmong all evaluated risk factors, excess body mass index (BMI [&ge;]25 kg/m2) was the leading factor (Black: aPAF=27.0%, 95% CI 19.3-33.9%; White: 27.1%, 95% CI 20.3-33.4%; All: aPAF=27.1%, 95% CI: 22.0-31.8%).

CONCLUSIONOur study highlights the potential for weight management as a key strategy in reducing the risk of progression to MM in Black and White patients diagnosed with MGUS.","NA","medrxiv",1746569311191

Gamete release is often synchronised with respect to the daily light changes at sunrise and sunset. In the hydrozoan jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica, morning spawning occurs when oocyte maturation and gamete release are induced by maturation-inducing hormone (MIH) neuropeptides released from opsin-expressing cells in the gonad directly upon light stimulus. Here, we characterise the distinct spawning cycle of a previously undescribed species Clytia sp. IZ-D identified on the Pacific coast of Japan, which releases gametes in the evening. Clytia sp. IZ-D jellyfish spawn 14 hours after light stimuli under a 24-hour light-dark cycle and exhibit autonomous and synchronised spawning cycles with a 20-hour interval under constant light. We found that the female spawning cycle reflects the growth and acquisition of maturation competence by oocytes, such that each day a new batch of growing oocytes becomes responsive to MIH at a time that correlates with the timing of actual spawning. We propose that the synchronised evening spawning in this species is controlled by an unusual circadian timing mechanism based on the progressive development of gamete competence to MIH and modulation of the opsin-controlled MIH signalling pathway. This mechanism may provide resilience to light cycle instability due to local climate variation and ensure reproductive isolation from other Clytia species by alternating the gamete release timing.","NA","biorxiv",1746569311191

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1746569311191

ADAPT-MS dynamically retrains simple, robust classifiers based on the proteins quantified in each sample, eliminating the need for imputation or fixed panels. Applied to plasma and cerebrospinal fluid datasets across diseases and clinical centers, it achieves high performance and generalizability using robust, transparent and generalizable statistical models. A single proteomic measurement can support multiple diagnostic questions via retrospective cohort matching, with each classification taking only seconds. As population-scale proteomics datasets grow, this approach lays the foundation for scalable, real-time, and personalized diagnostics directly from proteome-wide data.

A critical challenge in developing rationally designed therapeutics is understanding how these various factors converge to disrupt cellular networks in the human brain, ultimately contributing to SCZ. Towards this aim, we generated multimodal data, including SCZ-specific protein-protein interactions in stem-cell-derived neuronal models and adult postmortem cortex, integrated with genetic and transcriptomic datasets from individuals with psychiatric disorders. We identified three distinct neuron-specific SCZ protein networks, or modules, significantly enriched for genetic and transcriptional perturbations associated with SCZ. The relevance of these modules was validated through whole-cell proteomics in patient-derived neurons, revealing their disruption in 22q11.2 deletion carriers diagnosed with SCZ. We demonstrated their therapeutic potential by showing that these modules are targets of GSK3 inhibition using phosphoproteomics. Our findings present a foundational model that integrates genetic, transcriptional, and proteomic perturbations in SCZ. This model provides a cohesive framework for understanding how polygenic and multimodal perturbations affect neuronal pathways in the human brain, as well as a data-driven pathway resource for identifying potential drug targets to reverse disruptions observed in these neuronal networks.","NA","medrxiv",1746569311191

This is especially true in spatially structured environments, where the physical construction of habitat and the order of arrival of mutants can shape evolutionary outcomes. In static broth cultures, the air-liquid interface (ALI) provides a high-oxygen niche typically colonized by mat-forming mutants. In Pseudomonas fluorescens, a range of single mutations that upregulate cellulose production give rise to ""wrinkly spreader"" (WS) types, canonical niche specialists that out-compete ancestral types at the ALI. Yet we discover that this is a half-truth: WS mutants frequently fail to establish when introduced alone at low density, but co-culture with ancestral types rescues colonization. Microscopy and model simulations show that ancestors physically scaffold the ALI, enabling stable attachment and facilitating the in situ emergence of an array of genetically diverse WS mutants. Ancestors later disperse, vacate the niche and allow WS mutant expansion. This transient asymmetric interaction reveals that even strongly adaptive mutations may require ecological facilitation to succeed. More broadly, our findings challenge simple narratives of adaptive replacement and underscore how transient ecological dependencies can shape the trajectory of evolutionary change.","NA","biorxiv",1746569311191

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1746569311191

Changes in Dialister, Turicibacter and UBA1819 were correlated with several measures of objective sleep quality including wake duration, latency to persistent sleep and wake-after-sleep-onset. Four-weeks saffron supplementation improved both subjective and objective sleep quality in older adults with sleep complaints, while increasing gut bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids. These results pave the way for further randomised controlled trials exploring the links between sleep quality and gut health and may help devising new preventative strategies for age-related brain disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1746569311191
