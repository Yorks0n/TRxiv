Here, as proof of concept, we searched for viral remnants in sequencing reads of Neanderthal genome data by mapping to adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus, which are double stranded DNA viruses that may establish lifelong latency and can, produce persistent infections. The reconstructed ancient viral genomes of adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus revealed conserved segments, with nucleotide similarity to extant viral genomes, and variable regions in coding regions with substantial divergence to extant close relatives. Sequencing reads mapped to extant viral genomes showed deamination patterns of ancient DNA and that these ancient viral genomes showed divergence consistent with the age of these samples ({approx}50,000 years) and viral evolutionary rates (10-5 to 10-8 substitutions/site/year). Analysis of random effects shows that the Neanderthal mapping to genomes of extant persistent viruses is above the expected by random similarities of short reads. Also, negative control with a nonpersistent DNA virus does not yield statistically significant assemblies. This work demonstrates the feasibility of identifying viral genome remnants in archaeological samples with signal-to-noise assessment.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded. We report the value of wastewater sequencing to track avian influenza.","NA","medrxiv",1715897325308

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

However, if cellular environment is the only determinant of glycosylation, all sites should receive the same glycans on average. This template-free assertion is inconsistent with observations of microheterogeneity-wherein each site receives distinct and reproducible glycan structures. Here, we test the assumption of template-free glycan biosynthesis. Through structural analysis of site-specific glycosylation data, we find protein-sequence and structural features that predict specific glycan features. To quantify these relationships, we present a new amino acid substitution matrix that describes glycoimpact-how glycosylation varies with protein structure. High-glycoimpact amino acids co-evolve with glycosites, and glycoimpact is high when estimates of amino acid conservation and variant pathogenicity diverge. We report hundreds of disease variants near glycosites with high-glycoimpact, including several with known links to aberrant glycosylation (e.g., Oculocutaneous Albinism, Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker, and Gaucher's Disease). Finally, we validate glycoimpact quantification by studying oligomannose-complex glycan ratios on HIV ENV, differential sialylation on IgG3 Fc, differential glycosylation on SARS-CoV-2 Spike, and fucose-modulated function of a tuberculosis monoclonal antibody. In all, we show glycan biosynthesis is accurately guided by specific, genetically-encoded rules, and this presents a plausible refutation to the assumption of template-free glycosylation.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

ObjectiveTo evaluate febrile seizure risk following monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination among children aged 2-5 years.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThe primary analysis evaluated children who had a febrile seizure outcome in the 0-1 days following COVID-19 vaccination. A self-controlled case series analysis was performed in three commercial insurance databases to compare the risk of seizure in the risk interval (0-1 days) to a control interval (8-63 days).

ExposureReceipt of dose 1 and/or dose 2 of monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was febrile seizure (0-1 day risk interval).

AnalysisA conditional Poisson regression model was used to compare outcome rates in risk and control intervals and estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analyses were used to pool results across databases.

ResultsThe primary meta-analysis found a statistically significant increased incidence of febrile seizure, in the 0-1 days following mRNA-1273 vaccination compared to the control interval (IRR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.35 to 4.69, risk difference (RD)/100,000 doses = 3.22 (95%CI -0.31 to 6.75)). For the BNT162b2 vaccination, the IRR was elevated but not statistically significant (IRR: 1.41, 95%CI: 0.48 to 4.11, RD/100,000 doses = -0.25 (95%CI -2.75 to 2.24).

Conclusions and RelevanceAmong children aged 2-5 years, the analysis showed a small elevated incidence rate ratio of febrile seizures in the 0-1 days following the mRNA-1273 vaccination. Based on the current body of scientific evidence, the safety profile of the monovalent mRNA vaccines remains favorable for use in young children.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAmong children aged 2-5 years, is the risk of febrile seizure elevated immediately following monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination compared with a later period after vaccination?

FindingsIn this self-controlled case series that included participants aged 2-5 years from three commercial insurance databases, the incidence rate ratio of febrile seizures was significantly elevated in the 0-1 days following mRNA-1273 administration. Absolute risk was small.

MeaningThe incidence of febrile seizures was elevated immediately following vaccination with the monovalent mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 2-5 years. Based on the current body of evidence, the safety profile of monovalent mRNA vaccines remains favorable for use in young children.","NA","medrxiv",1715897325308

Traditionally, ER moves by either sliding along stable microtubules via molecular motors or attaching to the plus ends of dynamic microtubules through tip attachment complexes (TAC). A recently discovered third process, hitchhiking, involves motile vesicles pulling ER tubules along microtubules. Previous research showed that ER hitchhikes on Rab5- and Rab7-marked endosomes, but it is uncertain if other Rab-vesicles can do the same. In U2OS cells, we screened Rabs for their ability to cotransport with ER tubules and found that ER hitchhikes on post-Golgi vesicles marked by Rab6 (isoforms a and b). Rab6-ER hitchhiking occurs independently of ER-endolysosome contacts and TAC-mediated ER movement. Disrupting either Rab6 or the motility of Rab6-vesicles reduces overall ER movement. Conversely, relocating these vesicles to the cell periphery causes peripheral ER accumulation, indicating that Rab6-vesicle motility is crucial for a subset of ER movements. Proximal post-Golgi vesicles marked by TGN46 are involved in Rab6-ER hitchhiking, while other post-Golgi vesicles (Rabs 8/10/11/13/14) are not essential for ER movement. Our further analysis finds that ER to Golgi vesicles marked by Rab1 are also capable of driving a subset of ER movements. Taken together, our findings suggest that ER hitchhiking on Rab-vesicles is a significant mode of ER movement.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

To explain this early apparent equipotentiality of the two hemispheres for language, some have proposed that the language system is bilateral during early development and only becomes left-lateralized with age. We examined language lateralization using functional magnetic resonance imaging with two large pediatric cohorts (total n=273 children ages 4-16; n=107 adults). Strong, adult-level left-hemispheric lateralization (in activation volume and response magnitude) was evident by age 4. Thus, although the right hemisphere can take over language function in some cases of early brain damage, and although some features of the language system do show protracted development (magnitude of language response and strength of inter-regional correlations in the language network), the left-hemisphere bias for language is robustly present by 4 years of age.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

Upon DNA-binding, cGAS generates cGAMP, which binds to STING, ultimately driving inflammatory signalling. Although normally silenced on self-DNA, cGAS can be activated during genotoxic stress. A universal by-product of these conditions are micronuclei, which accumulate cGAS, and which are therefore thought to be major cGAS activators. However, due to the inability to visualise cGAS activation in single cells, this hypothesis remains largely untested. Here we solve this question with an improved intracellular cGAMP reporter, which is compatible with microscopy, flow-cytometry and plate reader setups. Surprisingly, cGAS activation in response to multiple types of genotoxic stress is limited to a subfraction of cells and does not correlate with cGAS enrichment in micronuclei. Overall, our findings suggest a revised model of innate immune signalling in response to genotoxic stress, and introduce a novel and flexible tool with which to examine this model in future.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

Here we investigated whether macrophages sense tissue acidification to adjust inflammatory responses. We found that acidic pH restructured the inflammatory response of macrophages in a gene-specific manner. We identified mammalian BRD4 as a novel intracellular pH sensor. Acidic pH disrupts the transcription condensates containing BRD4 and MED1, via histidine-enriched intrinsically disordered regions. Crucially, decrease in macrophage intracellular pH is necessary and sufficient to regulate transcriptional condensates in vitro and in vivo, acting as negative feedback to regulate the inflammatory response.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Whole-blood DNAm levels were assayed by the EPIC/450K Illumina array (9 studies, Nexposed = 661, Nunexposed= 9,575) alongside MBD-Seq in NESDA (Nexposed= 398, Nunexposed= 414). Antidepressant exposure was measured by self- report and/or antidepressant prescriptions.

ResultsThe self-report MWAS (N = 16,536, Nexposed = 1,508, mean age = 48, 59% female) and the prescription-derived MWAS (N = 7,951, Nexposed = 861, mean age = 47, 59% female), found hypermethylation at seven and four DNAm sites (p < 9.42x10-8), respectively. The top locus was cg26277237 (KANK1, pself-report= 9.3x10-13, pprescription = 6.1x10-3). The self-report MWAS found a differentially methylated region, mapping to DGUOK-AS1 (padj = 5.0x10-3) alongside significant enrichment for genes expressed in the amygdala, the ""synaptic vesicle membrane"" gene ontology and the top 1% of CpGs from the NESDA MWAS (OR = 1.39, p < 0.042). The MPS was associated with antidepressant exposure in meta-analysed data from external cohorts (Nstudies= 9, N = 10,236, Nexposed = 661, f3 = 0.196, p < 1x10-4).

Conclusions and RelevanceAntidepressant exposure is associated with changes in DNAm across different cohorts. Further investigation into these changes could inform on new targets for antidepressant treatments.

3 Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs antidepressant exposure associated with differential whole blood DNA methylation?

FindingsIn this methylome-wide association study of 16,536 adults across Scotland, antidepressant exposure was significantly associated with hypermethylation at CpGs mapping to KANK1 and DGUOK-AS1. A methylation profile score trained on this sample was significantly associated with antidepressant exposure (pooled f3 [95%CI]=0.196 [0.105, 0.288], p < 1x10-4) in a meta-analysis of external datasets.

MeaningAntidepressant exposure is associated with hypermethylation at KANK1 and DGUOK-AS1, which have roles in mitochondrial metabolism and neurite outgrowth. If replicated in future studies, targeting these genes could inform the design of more effective and better tolerated treatments for depression.","NA","medrxiv",1715897325308

As a substrate receptor of the CULLIN3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, KBTBD4 is recurrently mutated in medulloblastoma (MB), the most common embryonal brain tumor in children, and pineoblastoma. These mutations impart gain-of-function to KBTBD4 to induce aberrant degradation of the transcriptional corepressor CoREST. However, their mechanism of action remains unresolved. Here, we elucidate the mechanistic basis by which KBTBD4 mutations promote CoREST degradation through engaging HDAC1/2, the direct neomorphic target of the substrate receptor. Using deep mutational scanning, we systematically map the mutational landscape of the KBTBD4 cancer hotspot, revealing distinct preferences by which insertions and substitutions can promote gain-of-function and the critical residues involved in the hotspot interaction. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of two distinct KBTBD4 cancer mutants bound to LSD1-HDAC1-CoREST reveals that a KBTBD4 homodimer asymmetrically engages HDAC1 with two KELCH-repeat propeller domains. The interface between HDAC1 and one of the KBTBD4 propellers is stabilized by the MB mutations, which directly insert a bulky side chain into the active site pocket of HDAC1. Our structural and mutational analyses inform how this hotspot E3-neo-substrate interface can be chemically modulated. First, our results unveil a converging shape complementarity-based mechanism between gain-of-function E3 mutations and a molecular glue degrader, UM171. Second, we demonstrate that HDAC1/2 inhibitors can block the mutant KBTBD4-HDAC1 interface, the aberrant degradation of CoREST, and the growth of KBTBD4-mutant MB models. Altogether, our work reveals the structural and mechanistic basis of cancer mutation-driven neomorphic protein-protein interactions and pharmacological strategies to modulate their action for therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

Here, we tested unrefined AF2 models prospectively, comparing experimental hit-rates and affinities from large library docking against AF2 models vs the same screens targeting experimental structures of the same receptors. In retrospective docking screens against the {sigma}2 and the 5-HT2A receptors, the AF2 structures struggled to recapitulate ligands that we had previously found docking against the receptors experimental structures, consistent with published results. Prospective large library docking against the AF2 models, however, yielded similar hit rates for both receptors versus docking against experimentally-derived structures; hundreds of molecules were prioritized and tested against each model and each structure of each receptor. The success of the AF2 models was achieved despite differences in orthosteric pocket residue conformations for both targets versus the experimental structures. Intriguingly, against the 5-HT2A receptor the most potent, subtype-selective agonists were discovered via docking against the AF2 model, not the experimental structure.

Current hypotheses for the pathogenesis of Long Covid include persistent SARS-CoV-2, activation of other viruses, tissue damage, autoimmunity, endocrine insufficiency, immune dysfunction, and complement activation. We evaluated 142 participants, including uninfected controls (N=35), acutely infected individuals (N=54), convalescent controls (N=25), and Long Covid patients (N=28), by comprehensive immunologic, virologic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses. Long Covid was characterized by persistent inflammatory pathways compared with convalescent controls and uninfected controls, including upregulation of IL-6 and JAK-STAT pathways as well as activation of coagulation, complement, metabolism, and T cell exhaustion pathways. Moreover, robust activation of these pathways during acute COVID-19 infection correlated with the subsequent development of Long Covid. In an independent validation cohort (N=47), Long Covid patients had higher levels of plasma IL-6R compared with convalescent controls and uninfected controls. These data demonstrate that Long Covid is characterized by persistent activation of chronic inflammatory pathways, suggesting novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers of disease.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

Relying only on conventional E. coli strains with native ribosomes, we develop a novel plasmid-based codon compression strategy that minimizes context dependence and improves ncAA incorporation at quadruplet codons. We confirm that this strategy is compatible with all known genetic code expansion resources, which allows us to identify 12 mutually orthogonal tRNA-synthetase pairs.

Spatial-omics technologies can simultaneously measure information from three complementary domains related to this task: expression levels of a panel of molecular biomarkers at single-cell resolution, relative positions of cells, and images of tissue sections, but existing computational methods for performing this task on single-cell spatial-omics datasets often relinquish information from one or more domains. The additional reliance on the availability of ""atlas"" training or reference datasets limits cell type discovery to well-defined but limited cell population labels, thus posing major challenges for using these methods in practice. Successful integration of all three domains presents an opportunity for uncovering cell populations that are functionally stratified by their spatial contexts at cellular and tissue levels: the key motivation for employing spatial-omics technologies in the first place. In this work, we introduce Cell Spatio- and Neighborhood-informed Annotation and Patterning (CellSNAP), a self-supervised computational method that learns a representation vector for each cell in tissue samples measured by spatial-omics technologies at the single-cell or finer resolution. The learned representation vector fuses information about the corresponding cell across all three aforementioned domains. By applying CellSNAP to datasets spanning both spatial proteomic and spatial transcriptomic modalities, and across different tissue types and disease settings, we show that CellSNAP markedly enhances de novo discovery of biologically relevant cell populations at fine granularity, beyond current approaches, by fully integrating cells' molecular profiles with cellular neighborhood and tissue image information.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

Despite their overwhelming success, extinct taxa outside of the living radiation-stem teleosts-remain poorly understood. Dorsetichthys bechei is an Early Jurassic stem teleost of historic importance. Although D. bechei is well described, its proximity to the teleost crown and relationships with other stem teleosts is challenging due to previous associations with the wastebasket assemblage known as 'pholidophorids'. Here we present a new, three-dimensionally preserved specimen of Dorsetichthys bechei from the Blue Lias Formation (Sinemurian) Lyme Regis, UK. High-resolution CT scanning of this specimen plus additional material reveals previously unknown internal morphological information, including of the jaw and palate, hyoid arch, and gill skeleton. Importantly, this previously undescribed articulated specimen permits description of the external dermal skeleton and internal endoskeleton for the same individual, clarifying past accounts drawing on composite descriptions of two- and three-dimensionally preserved specimens. We confirm the presence of important teleost synapomorphies such as a mobile premaxilla and quadratojugal process. However, contrasting previous accounts, we find no evidence for dorsal and ventral hypohyals or a postarticular process of the lower jaw. We also confirm the presence of a prearticular. The presence of a mobile upper jaw, elaborate gill rakers and reduced dentition also support a possible facultative filter feeding ecology. These new anatomical data support removal of D. bechei from Pholidophoridae and Pholidophoriformes as currently defined but indicate that finer-scale patterns of relationships among more crownward members of the teleost stem are some way from being resolved.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

As a first effort, we studied the antiviral potency of combinations of antivirals. To that end, we made use of primary human airway epithelial cell (HAEC) cultures grown at the air-liquid interface that were infected with the beta coronavirus OC43.

In line with its adaptability, P. aeruginosa produces various exoproducts crucial for survival and virulence, several of which regulated through quorum sensing (QS). These factors are also regulated in response to environmental cues, such as temperature changes. As a pathogen, P. aeruginosa is generally thought to activate its virulence factors at temperatures akin to warm-blooded hosts rather than environmental temperatures. Recent studies elucidated the functional structure of the QS transcriptional regulator RhlR, which depends on the stabilizing effects of its cognate autoinducing ligand, N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL), and of the moonlighting chaperone PqsE. Given the influence of temperature on biomolecular dynamics, we investigated how it affects RhlR activity using the RhlR-regulated phzA1 promoter as a proxy. Unexpectedly, we found that RhlR activity is higher at 25{degrees}C than at 37{degrees}C. This temperature-dependent regulation likely stems from altered RhlR turnover, with the presence of PqsE extending RhlR activity tenfold from its basal level at 37{degrees}C to that observed at 25{degrees}C. This lower, environmental-like temperature promotes increased affinity between RhlR and C4-HSL, a trait significantly compromised in the absence of PqsE. These results suggest that this response depends on the structural integrity of the complex, indicating that temperature functions as an additional regulating and stabilizing factor of RhlR function. Accordingly, lower growth temperature fails to increase the activity of a structurally stabilized version of RhlR. The thermoregulation aspect of RhlR activity and signalling impacts the virulence profile of a mutant unable to produce C4-HSL, underscoring its significance in bacterial behaviours and potentially conferring an evolutionary advantage.

Author SummaryPseudomonas aeruginosa is recognized for its capacity to colonize vastly different environments, thereby encountering a range of temperatures. The bacteriums ability to adapt to these settings necessitates finely regulated gene expression. Within this regulatory framework lies quorum sensing (QS), the intercellular communication system used by P. aeruginosa to orchestrate the expression of genes responsible for producing diverse exoproducts, including the blue phenazine pyocyanin. RhlR primarily governs the expression of genes required for pyocyanin production, including the phz1 operon. Unlike other QS regulators, RhlR possesses a distinctive characteristic - in addition to its cognate signalling ligand C4-HSL, it depends on the presence of the chaperone-like protein PqsE for stability and activity. This intrinsic instability implies that RhlR may be susceptible to external influences that can modulate its function. Indeed, a lower culture temperature, akin to an environmental-like condition, induces the transcription of the phz1 operon, used as a proxy for RhlR activity. Using a combination of genetic approaches, we present evidence that this thermoregulation is due to an impact on the stability of the RhlR/C4-HSL/PqsE complex. We further show the biological effect of this regulation mechanism in an infection setting, which could underscore a relevant role for other bacterial behaviours.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

In eukaryotes, loop-extruding SMC complexes form topologically associating domains (TADs) by being stalled by roadblock proteins. It remains unclear whether a similar mechanism of domain formation exists in prokaryotes. Using high-resolution chromosome conformation capture sequencing, we show that an archaeal homolog of the bacterial Smc-ScpAB complex organizes the genome of Thermococcus kodakarensis into TAD-like domains. We also find that TrmBL2, a nucleoid-associated protein that forms a stiff nucleoprotein filament, stalls the T. kodakarensis SMC complex and establishes a boundary at the site-specific recombination site dif. TrmBL2 stalls the SMC complex at tens of additional non-boundary loci with lower efficiency. Intriguingly, the stalling efficiency is correlated with structural properties of underlying DNA sequences. Our study illuminates not only a eukaryotic-like mechanism of domain formation in archaea, but also an unforeseen role of intrinsic DNA structure in large-scale genome organization.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

This neurodevelopmental trajectory is shaped by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. While common genetic variants account for a large proportion of inherited genetic risk, rare genetic variations, particularly copy number variants (CNVs), play a significant role in the genetic architecture of neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite their importance, the relevance of CNVs to child psychopathology and cognitive function in the general population remains underexplored. Objective: Investigating CNV associations with dimensions of child psychopathology and cognitive functions. Design, Setting, and Participants: ABCD study focuses on a cohort of over 11,875 youth aged 9 to 10, recruited from 21 sites in the US, aiming to investigate the role of various factors, including brain, environment, and genetic factors, in the etiology of mental and physical health from middle childhood through early adulthood. Data analysis occurred from April 2023 to April 2024. Main Outcomes and Measures: In this study, we utilized PennCNV and QuantiSNP algorithms to identify duplications and deletions larger than 50Kb across a cohort of 11,088 individuals from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. CNVs meeting quality control standards were subjected to a genome-wide association scan to identify regions associated with quantitative measures of broad psychiatric symptom domains and cognitive outcomes. Additionally, a CNV risk score, reflecting the aggregated burden of genetic intolerance to inactivation and dosage sensitivity, was calculated to assess its impact on variability in overall and dimensional child psychiatric and cognitive phenotypes. Results: In a final sample of 8,564 individuals (mean age=9.9 years, 4,532 males) passing quality control, we identified 4,111 individuals carrying 5,760 autosomal CNVs. Our results revealed significant associations between specific CNVs and our phenotypes of interest, psychopathology and cognitive function. For instance, a duplication at 10q26.3 was associated with overall psychopathology, and somatic complaints in particular. Additionally, deletions at 1q12.1, along with duplications at 14q11.2 and 10q26.3, were linked to overall cognitive function, with particular contributions from fluid intelligence (14q11.2), working memory (10q26.3), and reading ability (14q11.2). Moreover, individuals carrying CNVs previously associated with neurodevelopmental disorders exhibited greater impairment in social functioning and cognitive performance across multiple domains, in particular working memory. Notably, a higher deletion CNV risk score was significantly correlated with increased overall psychopathology (especially in dimensions of social functioning, thought disorder, and attention) as well as cognitive impairment across various domains. Conclusions and Relevance: In summary, our findings shed light on the contributions of CNVs to interindividual variability in complex traits related to neurocognitive development and child psychopathology.","NA","medrxiv",1715897325308

We show that spaced learning increases the similarity of human ventromedial prefrontal cortex representations across stimulus encounters and, critically, these increases parallel and predict the behavioral benefits of spacing. Additionally, we show that these spacing benefits critically depend on remembering and, in turn, 're-encoding' past experience. Collectively, our findings provide fundamental insight into how spaced learning influences neural representations and why spacing is beneficial.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

However, adding new variables, such as sediment, can create methodological biases, such as artificial anatomical character loss during exhumation. Non-invasive in situ imaging techniques such as X-ray computed tomography (XCT scanning) could mitigate this, but the consequences of exposing carcasses to X-rays are not fully understood, and evidence regarding the impact of X-rays on internal microbial faunas that drive decay is conflicting. Here, we test whether XCT scanning impacts the decay of Danio rerio carcasses within a substrate. Our control experiments show that quartz sand sediment physically stabilises the carcass throughout decay and the sequence of anatomical character loss remains constant, however, both the onset and rate of decay of soft tissues are initially accelerated. Our XCT data show that exposure to X-rays does not cause a deviation from the normal sequence of decay, validating XCT as a non-destructive visualisation method for decay experiments. Furthermore, when accompanied with traditional exhumation and dissection, XCT provides decay data with higher accuracy of character analysis than traditional methods, and allows novel quantitative techniques to monitor physical changes in the decaying carcass (e.g., total volume, build-up of gases, collapse of the body cavity etc.). We also underline limitations with the technique, but our experiment acts as an important 'stepping stone' for progression toward non-invasive designs of decay experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

However 3D cell segmentation, which requires dense annotation of 2D slices still poses significant challenges. Labelling every cell in every 2D slice is prohibitive. Moreover it is ambiguous, necessitating cross-referencing with other orthoviews. Lastly, there is limited ability to unambiguously record and visualize 1000s of annotated cells.

Since selection acts over multiple generations, many approaches have been developed to detect and quantify selection using genetic data sampled at multiple points in time. Such time series genetic data is commonly analyzed using Hidden Markov Models, but in most cases, under the assumption of additive selection. However, many examples of genetic variation exhibiting non-additive mechanisms exist, making it critical to develop methods that can characterize selection in more general scenarios. Thus, we extend a previously introduced expectation-maximization algorithm for the inference of additive selection coefficients to the case of general diploid selection, in which heterozygote and homozygote fitnesses are parameterized independently. We furthermore introduce a framework to identify bespoke modes of diploid selection from given data, as well as a procedure for aggregating data across linked loci to increase power and robustness. Using extensive simulation studies, we find that our method accurately and efficiently estimates selection coefficients for different modes of diploid selection across a wide range of scenarios; however, power to classify the mode of selection is low unless selection is very strong. We apply our method to ancient DNA samples from Great Britain in the last 4,450 years, and detect evidence for selection in six genomic regions, including the well-characterized LCT locus. Our work is the first genome-wide scan characterizing signals of general diploid selection.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

To study this, we combined a genetically engineered mouse model of mammary carcinoma with syngeneic transplantation and primary tumour resection to generate isogenic cells from primary tumours and their corresponding lung micrometastases. Metabolic analyses indicated that micrometastatic cells increase proline production at the expense of glutathione synthesis leading to a reduction in total glutathione levels. Micrometastatic cells also have altered sphingomyelin metabolism leading to increased intracellular levels of specific ceramides. The combination of these two metabolic adaptations alters small extracellular vesicle (sEV) production to drive generation of an invasive microenvironment. Indeed, micrometastatic cells shut-down Rab27-dependent production of sEVs and, instead, switch-on neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSM2)-dependent sEV release. sEVs released in a nSM2-dependent manner from micrometastatic cells, in turn, influence the ability of fibroblasts to deposit extracellular matrix which promotes cancer cell invasiveness. These data provide evidence that metabolic rewiring drives invasive processes in metastasis by influencing sEV release.

This evolutionary radiation has been accompanied by substantial dietary shifts, often characterized by phenotypic modifications encompassing morphological, metabolic and behavioral changes. Hence, these endemic spiders represent an excellent model for understanding the evolutionary drivers and to pinpoint the genomic determinants underlying adaptive radiations. Recently, we achieved the first chromosome-level genome assembly of one of the endemic species, D. silvatica, providing a high-quality reference sequence for evolutionary genomics studies. Here, we conducted a low-coverage based resequencing study of a natural population of D. silvatica from La Gomera island. Taking advantage of the new high-quality genome, we characterized genome-wide levels of nucleotide polymorphism, divergence, and linkage disequilibrium, and inferred the demographic history of this population. We also performed comprehensive genome-wide scans for recent positive selection. Our findings uncovered exceptionally high levels of nucleotide diversity and recombination in this geographically restricted endemic species, indicative of large historical effective population sizes. Furthermore, we identified genomic regions potentially under positive selection, shedding light on relevant biological processes, such as vision and nitrogen extraction as possible targets of adaptation and eventually, as drivers of the species diversification.

While molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have the potential to fully characterise the proline cis and trans sub-ensembles, they are limited by the slow timescales of isomerisation and force field inaccuracies. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can report on ensemble-averaged observables for both the cis and trans proline states, but a full atomistic characterisation of these sub-ensembles is challenging. Given the importance of proline cis/trans isomerisation for influencing the conformational sampling of disordered proteins, we employed a combination of all-atom MD simulations with enhanced sampling (metadynamics), NMR, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to characterise the two sub-ensembles of the ORF6 C-terminal region (ORF6CTR) from SARS-CoV-2 corresponding to the proline-57 (P57) cis and trans states. We performed MD simulations in three distinct force fields: AMBER03ws, AMBER99SB-disp, and CHARMM36m, which are all optimised for disordered proteins. Each simulation was run for an accumulated time of 180-220 s until convergence was reached, as assessed by blocking analysis. A good agreement between the cis-P57 populations predicted from metadynamics simulations in AMBER03ws was observed with populations obtained from experimental NMR data. Moreover, we observed good agreement between the radius of gyration predicted from the metadynamics simulations in AMBER03ws and that measured using SAXS. Our findings suggest that both the cis-P57 and trans-P57 conformations of ORF6CTR are extremely dynamic and that interdisciplinary approaches combining both multi-scale computations and experiments offer avenues to explore highly dynamic states that cannot be reliably characterised by either approach in isolation.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

However, the process by which soluble cytoskeletal monomers maneuver through the cytoplasm's ever-changing environment to reach their destinations without using these pathways remains unknown. 4-6 Here, we show that actin cytoskeletal treadmilling leads to the formation of a semi-permeable actin-myosin barrier, creating a specialized compartment separated from the rest of the cell body that directs proteins toward the cell edge by advection, diffusion facilitated by fluid flow. Contraction at this barrier generates a molecularly non-specific fluid flow that transports actin, actin-binding proteins, adhesion proteins, and even inert proteins forward. The local curvature of the barrier specifically targets these proteins toward protruding edges of the leading edge, sites of new filament growth, effectively coordinating protein distribution with cellular dynamics. Outside this compartment, diffusion remains the primary mode of protein transport, contrasting sharply with the directed advection within. This discovery reveals a novel protein transport mechanism that redefines the front of the cell as a pseudo-organelle, actively orchestrating protein mobilization for cellular front activities such as protrusion and adhesion. By elucidating a new model of protein dynamics at the cellular front, this work contributes a critical piece to the puzzle of how cells adapt their internal structures for targeted and rapid response to extracellular cues. The findings challenge the current understanding of intracellular transport, suggesting that cells possess highly specialized and previously unrecognized organizational strategies for managing protein distribution efficiently, providing a new framework for understanding the cellular architecture's role in rapid response and adaptation to environmental changes.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, .1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

How somatic and germ cells interact to develop and maintain fertility is not well understood. Here, using grafting experiments and transgenic reporter animals, we find that a specific part of the gonad-the germinal zone-acts as a sexual organizer to induce and maintain de novo germ cells and somatic gonads in non-sexual tissue in the cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. We further show that germ cells express a novel member of the BMP family (Gonadless, Gls) that induces somatic gonad morphogenesis. Loss of Gls resulted in animals lacking somatic gonadal structures but having few, non-proliferative germ cells. We propose a model according to which a small number of primary germ cells drive gonad development though Gls morphogen secretion. The germinal zone in the newly formed gonad, in turn, provides positive feedback to induce secondary germ cells by activating Tfap2 (the master regulator of germ cell fate) in resident pluripotent stem cells. De novo induction of germ cells by gonads in adult life is absent in bilaterians with a sequestered germline. However, the contribution of germ cell signaling to the patterning of somatic gonadal tissue, as observed in Hydractinia, may be a general animal feature.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

Osteoclastogenesis involves several steps of actin-driven rearrangements that participate not only in the cell-cell fusion process, but also in the formation of the sealing zone, the adhesive structure determining the resorption area. Despite the importance of these actin cytoskeleton-based processes, their precise mechanisms of regulation are still poorly characterized. Here, we found that moesin, a member of the Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin (ERM) protein family, is activated during osteoclast maturation and plays an instrumental role for both osteoclast fusion and function. In mouse and human osteoclast precursors, moesin is negatively regulated to potentiate their ability to fuse and degrade bone. Accordingly, we demonstrated that moesin depletion decreases membrane-to-cortex attachment and enhances formation of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), F-actin-containing intercellular bridges that we revealed to trigger osteoclast fusion. In addition, via Beta3-integrin/RhoA/SLK pathway and independently of its role in fusion, moesin regulates the number and organization of sealing zones in mature osteoclast, and thus participates in the control of bone resorption. Supporting these findings, we found that moesin-deficient mice are osteopenic with a reduced density of trabecular bones and increased osteoclast abundance and activity. These findings provide a better understanding of the regulation of osteoclast biology, and open new opportunities to specifically target osteoclast activity in bone disease therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

This work shows that synaptic pruning facilitates efficient statistical structure learning. We extend previously established canonical neural networks to derive a synaptic pruning scheme that is formally equivalent to an online Bayesian model selection. The proposed scheme, termed Bayesian synaptic model pruning (BSyMP), utilizes connectivity parameters to switch between the presence (ON) and absence (OFF) of synaptic connections. Mathematical analyses reveal that these parameters converge to zero for uninformative connections, thus providing reliable and efficient model reduction. This enables the identification of a plausible structure for the environmental model, particularly when the environment is characterized by sparse likelihood and transition matrices. Through causal inference and rule learning simulations, we demonstrate that BSyMP achieves model reduction more efficiently than the conventional Bayesian model reduction scheme. These findings indicate that synaptic pruning could be a neuronal substrate underlying structure learning and generalizability in the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

We therefore implemented a novel method for repeated imaging of the cerebellum in awake, chronically epileptic animals. We found widespread changes in cerebellar calcium signals during behavioral seizures and during hippocampal seizures that remained electrographic only, arguing against cerebellar modulation simply reflecting motor components. Moreover, even brief interictal spikes produced widespread alterations in cerebellar activity. Changes were noted in the anterior and posterior cerebellum, along the midline, and both ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the seizure focus. Remarkably, changes in the cerebellum also occurred prior to any noticeable change in the hippocampal electrographic recordings, suggesting a special relationship between the cerebellum and hippocampal epileptiform activity. Together these results underscore the importance of the cerebellum in epilepsy, warranting a more consistent consideration of the cerebellum when evaluating epilepsy patients.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

However, this approach can produce variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice appeared to habituate more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in withdrawal behavior. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdalar neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map pain sensation and affect.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

This paper aimed to assess a multitude of cardiac signs, symptoms, and conditions, as well as focused on patients with and without congenital heart defects (CHDs), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the post-acute cardiovascular outcomes among children and adolescents after COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 19 US children?s hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and September 2023. Every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry. Absolute risks of incident post-acute COVID-19 sequelae were reported. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by contrasting COVID-19-positive with COVID-19-negative groups using a Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through propensity scoring stratification. Results: A total of 1,213,322 individuals under 21 years old (mean[SD] age, 7.75[6.11] years; 623,806 male [51.4%]) were included. The absolute rate of any post-acute cardiovascular outcome in this study was 2.32% in COVID-19 positive and 1.38% in negative groups. Patients with CHD post-SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks of any cardiovascular outcome (RR, 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-1.80), including increased risks of 11 of 18 post-acute sequelae in hypertension, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias), myocarditis, other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest), thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain and palpitations). Those without CHDs also experienced heightened cardiovascular risks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57-1.69), covering 14 of 18 conditions in hypertension, arrhythmias (ventricular arrhythmias and premature atrial or ventricular contractions), inflammatory heart disease (pericarditis and myocarditis), other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock), thrombotic disorders (pulmonary embolism and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and syncope). Conclusions: Both children with and without CHDs showed increased risks for a variety of cardiovascular outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the need for targeted monitoring and management in the post-acute phase.","NA","medrxiv",1715897325308

The timing of these alterations remains uncertain, though preliminary evidence suggests that observable changes may already be present at diagnosis. It is also not yet known how these morphological changes are linked to the coherence of white matter pathways throughout the brain, or to neuropsychological function often compromised before anti-seizure medication treatment. This study investigates localised atrophy in subcortical regions using surface shape analysis in individuals with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy (NDfE) and assesses their implications on brain connectivity and cognitive function.

MethodsWe collected structural (T1w) and diffusion weighted MRI, as well as neuropsychological data from 104 patients with NDfE and 45 healthy controls (HC) matched for age, sex and education. A vertex-based shape analysis was performed on subcortical structures to compare patients with NDfE and HC, adjusting for age, sex and intracranial volume. The mean deformation of significance areas (pcor < 0.05) was used to identify white matter pathways associated with overall shape alterations in patients relative to controls using correlational tractography. Additionally, the relationship between significant subcortical shape values and neuropsychological outcomes was evaluated using a generalised canonical correlation approach.

ResultsShape analysis revealed bilateral focal inward deformation (a proxy for localised atrophy) in anterior areas of the right and left thalamus and right pallidum in patients with NDfE compared to HC (FWE corrected). No structures showed areas of outward deformation in patients. The connectometry analysis revealed that fractional anisotropy (FA) was positively correlated with thalamic and pallidal shape deformation, i.e., reduced FA was associated with inward deformation in tracts proximal to and or connecting with the thalamus including the fornix, frontal, parahippocampal and corticothalamic pathways. Thalamic and pallidal shape changes were also related to with increased depression and anxiety, and reduced memory and cognitive function.

DiscussionThese findings suggest that atrophy of the thalamus, which has previously been associated with the generation and maintenance of focal seizures, may present at epilepsy diagnosis and relate to alterations in both white matter connectivity and cognitive performance. We suggest that at least some alterations in brain structure and consequent impact on cognitive and affective processes are the result of early epileptogenic processes rather than exclusively due to the chronicity of longstanding epilepsy, recurrent seizures, and treatment with anti-seizure medication.","NA","medrxiv",1715897325308

The soft coral was identified as a xeniid octocoral (species undetermined), resembling the octocoral Unomia stolonifera, which has invaded and overgrown reefs in Venezuela in recent years. To conclusively characterize the species of the invading xeniid, we employed multilocus barcoding targeting four genes (ND2, mtMutS, COI, and 28S) of three separate colonies across three locations in southwest Puerto Rico. Sequence comparisons with xeniid sequences from GenBank, including those from the genera Xenia and Unomia, indicated a 100% sequence identity (>3,000 bp combined) with the species Xenia umbellata (Octocorallia : Malacalcyonacea : Xeniidae). Xenia umbellata is native to the Red Sea and to our knowledge, this represents the first confirmed case of this species as an invader on Caribbean reefs. Similar to U. stolonifera, X. umbellata is well known for its ability to rapidly overgrow substrate as well as tolerate environmental extremes. In addition, X. umbellata has recently been proposed as a model system for tissue regeneration having the ability to regenerate completely from a single tentacle. These characteristics greatly amplify X. umbellatas potential to adversely affect any reef it invades.

This modification plays a pivotal role in the regulation of diverse biological processes, including epigenetics, transcriptional control, and cellular signaling. Although less studied in prokaryotes, recent research has begun to reveal the potential role of methylation in modulating bacterial immune evasion and adherence to host cells. In this study, we analyzed the cell surface proteins of the toluene-degrading bacterium Acinetobacter sp. Tol 5 by label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and found that the lysine residues of its trimeric autotransporter adhesin (TAA), AtaA, are methylated. Over 130 lysine residues of AtaA, consisting of 3,630 amino acids and containing 232 lysine residues, were methylated. We identified the outer membrane protein lysine methyltransferase (OM PKMT) of Tol 5, KmtA, which specifically methylates the lysine residues of AtaA. In the KmtA-deficient mutant, most lysine methylations on AtaA were absent, indicating that KmtA is responsible for the methylation of multiple lysine residues throughout AtaA. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the OM PKMT genes were widely distributed among gram-negative bacteria, including pathogens with TAAs that promote infectivity, such as Burkholderia mallei and Haemophilus influenzae. Although KmtA has sequence similarities to the OM PKMTs of Rickettsia involved in infectivity, KmtA-like PKMTs formed a distinct cluster from those of the Rickettsia type according to the clustering analysis, suggesting that they are new types of PKMTs. Furthermore, the deletion of Tol 5 KmtA led to an increase in AtaA on the cell surface and enhanced bacterial adhesion, resulting in slower growth.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

However, most cis regulatory elements (CREs) are highly divergent, which makes orthology tracing based on sequence similarity difficult, especially at larger evolutionary distances. Some evidence suggests functional conservation of CREs despite sequence divergence. However, it remains unclear how widespread such functional conservation might be. Here, we address this question by profiling the regulatory genome in the embryonic hearts of chicken and mouse at equivalent developmental stages. Gene expression and 3D chromatin structure show remarkable similiarity, while the majority of CREs are non-alignable between the two species. To identify orthologous CREs independent of sequence alignability, we introduce a synteny-based strategy called Interspecies Point Projection (IPP). Compared to alignment-based approaches, IPP identifies up to 5-fold more putative orthologs in chicken, and up to 9-fold across distantly related vertebrates. We term these sequence-diverged orthologs indirectly conserved and characterize their functional conservation compared to sequence-alignable, directly conserved CREs. Indirectly and directly conserved elements show similar enrichment of functional chromatin signatures and cell-type specific enhancer sequence composition. Yet, shared transcription factor binding sites between orthologs are more heavily rearranged in indirectly conserved elements. Finally, we validate functional conservation of indirectly conserved chicken enhancers in mouse using in vivo reporter assays. Taken together, by overcoming the limitations of alignment-based methods our results reveal functional conservation of CREs across large evolutionary distances is more widespread than previously recognized.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1715897325308

We therefore assessed and compared the feasibility of testing wastewater from inbound aircraft and airport terminals for 18 pathogens including SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore, a popular travel hub in Asia.

MethodsWastewater samples collected from inbound medium- and long-haul flights and airport terminals were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was carried out on positive samples to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants. Airport and aircraft samples were further tested for 17 other pathogens through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).

ResultsThe proportion of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples and the average virus load was higher for wastewater samples from aircraft as compared to airport terminals. Cross-correlation analyses indicated that viral load trends from airport wastewater led local COVID-19 case trends by two to five days. A total of ten variants (44 sub-lineages) were successfully identified from aircraft wastewater and airport terminals, and four variants of interest (VOIs) and one variant under monitoring (VUM) were detected in aircraft and airport wastewater 18-31 days prior to detection in local clinical cases. The detection of five respiratory and four enteric viruses in aircraft wastewater samples further underscores the potential to expand aircraft wastewater to monitoring pathogens beyond SARS-CoV-2.

ConclusionOur findings demonstrate the feasibility of aircraft wastewater testing for monitoring infectious diseases threats, potentially detecting signals before clinical cases are reported. The triangulation of similar datapoints from aircraft wastewater of international travel nodes could therefore serve as a useful early warning system for global health threats.","NA","medrxiv",1715897325308

Cryo-EM has revolutionized structure determination of large proteins and their complexes1, but a vast majority of proteins that underlie human diseases are small (< 50 kDa) and usually beyond its reach due to low signal-to-noise images and difficulties in particle alignment2. Current strategies to overcome this problem increase the overall size of small protein targets using scaffold proteins that bind to the target, but are limited by inherent flexibility and not being bound to their targets in a rigid manner, resulting in the target being poorly resolved compared to the scaffolds3-11. Here we present an iteratively engineered molecular design for transforming Fabs (antibody fragments), into conformationally rigid scaffolds (Rigid-Fabs) that, when bound to small proteins ([~]20 kDa), can enable high-resolution structure determination using cryo-EM. This design introduces multiple disulfide bonds at strategic locations, generates a well-folded Fab constrained into a rigid conformation and can be applied to Fabs from various species, isotypes and chimeric Fabs. We present examples of the Rigid Fab design enabling high-resolution (2.3-2.5 [A]) structures of small proteins, Ang2 (26 kDa) and KRAS (21 kDa) by cryo-EM. The strategies for designing disulfide constrained Rigid Fabs in our work thus establish a general approach to overcome the target size limitation of single particle cryo-EM.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

DesignNationwide cohort studies, using target trial emulation.

SettingDenmark, Finland, and Sweden, from 1 October 2023 to 29 February 2024.

ParticipantsIndividuals aged [&ge;]65 years who had previously received at least four covid-19 vaccine doses. Main outcome measures: Cumulative incidences of covid-19 hospital admission and death for 12 weeks after immunisation (defined as 1 week after vaccination) among recipients of an XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk differences.

ResultsDuring autumn and winter 2023-2024, a total of 1,867,448 1:1 matched pairs of XBB-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and non-recipients were included (mean age 75.4 years, standard deviation 7.4 years). The comparative vaccine effectiveness was 60.6% (95% confidence interval, 46.1% to 75.1%) against covid-19 hospital admission (930 v 2,551 events) and 77.9% (69.2% to 86.7%) against covid-19 related death (301 v 1,326 events) at 12 weeks of follow-up. This corresponded to 191.1 (95% confidence interval, 50.2 to 332.1) covid-19 hospital admissions and 109.2 (100.2 to 118.1) deaths prevented per 100,000 individuals vaccinated with an XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.

As the synaptic and transcriptional changes that follow an acute cocaine exposure are mostly resolved within a few days4,5, the molecular changes that encode the long-term cellular memory of the exposure within DNs remain unknown. To investigate whether a single cocaine exposure induces long-term changes in the 3D genome structure of DNs, we applied Genome Architecture Mapping and single nucleus transcriptomic analyses in the mouse midbrain. We found extensive rewiring of 3D genome architecture at 24 hours past exposure which remains or worsens by 14 days, outlasting transcriptional responses. The cocaine-induced chromatin rewiring occurs at all genomic scales and affects genes with major roles in cocaine-induced synaptic changes. A single cocaine exposure triggers extensive long-lasting changes in chromatin condensation in post-synaptic and post-transcriptional regulatory genes, for example the unfolding of Rbfox1 which becomes most prominent 14 days post exposure. Finally, structurally remodeled genes are most expressed in a specific DN sub-type characterized by low expression of the dopamine auto-receptor Drd2, a key feature of highly cocaine-sensitive cells. These results reveal an important role for long-lasting 3D genome remodelling in the cellular memory of a single cocaine exposure, providing new hypotheses for understanding the inception of drug addiction and 3D genome plasticity.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

Inspired by the eukaryotic ubiquitination cascade, we developed an ATP-driven platform for C-terminal activation and peptide ligation based on E. coli MccB, a bacterial ancestor of ubiquitin-activating (E1) enzymes that natively catalyzes C-terminal phosphoramidate bond formation. We show that MccB can act on non-native substrates to generate an O-AMPylated electrophile that can react with exogenous nucleophiles to form diverse C-terminal functional groups including thioesters, a versatile class of biological intermediates that have been exploited for protein semisynthesis. To direct this activity towards specific proteins of interest, we developed the Thioesterification C-terminal Handle (TeCH)-tag, a sequence that enables high-yield, ATP-driven protein bioconjugation via a thioester intermediate. By mining the natural diversity of the MccB family, we developed two additional MccB/TeCH-tag pairs that are mutually orthogonal to each other and to the E. coli system, facilitating the synthesis of more complex bioconjugates. Our method mimics the chemical logic of peptide bond synthesis that is widespread in biology for high-yield in vitro manipulation of protein structure with molecular precision.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

Here we performed such rescues with a panel of receptor variants and promoters, in combination with tissue-specific transgene knockouts. Our experiments demonstrate that brassinosteroid receptor expression in several tissues is necessary but not sufficient for rescue. Moreover, complementation with tissue-specific promoters requires the genuine BRI1 gene body sequence, which confers ubiquitous expression of trace receptor amounts that are sufficient to promote brassinosteroid-dependent root growth. Our data, therefore, argue for a largely cell-autonomous action of brassinosteroid receptors.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

Here, we demonstrate that the macaque is capable of synchronizing taps to a subjective beat in real music, and even spontaneously chooses to do so over alternative strategies. This contradicts the influential ""vocal learning hypothesis"" that musical beat synchronization is only possible in species with complex vocalizations such as humans and some songbirds.

Six-week-old mice lacking either Pnma1 or Pnma4 are indistinguishable from wild-type littermates, but by six months the mutant mice become prematurely subfertile, with precipitous drops in sex hormone levels, gonadal atrophy, and abdominal obesity; overall they produce markedly fewer offspring than controls. Analysis of donated human ovaries shows that expression of both genes declines normally with aging, while several PNMA1 and PNMA4 variants identified in genome-wide association studies are causally associated with low testosterone, altered puberty onset, or obesity.

Variant effect predictors (VEPs) play a vital role in deciphering this complex relationship, yet evaluating their performance remains challenging due to data circularity, where the same or related data is used for training and assessment. High-throughput experimental strategies like deep mutational scanning (DMS) offer a promising solution. In this study, we extend upon our previous benchmarking approach, assessing the performance of 84 different VEPs and DMS experiments from 36 different human proteins. In addition, a new pairwise, VEP-centric ranking method reduces the impact of VEP score availability on the overall ranking. We observe a remarkably high correspondence between VEP performance in DMS-based benchmarks and clinical variant classification, especially for predictors that have not been directly trained on human clinical variants. Our results suggest that comparing VEP performance against diverse functional assays represents a reliable strategy for assessing their relative performance in clinical variant classification. However, major challenges in clinical interpretation of VEP scores persist, highlighting the need for further research to fully leverage computational predictors for genetic diagnosis. We also address practical considerations for end users in terms of choice of methodology.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

Here we identify molecular players orchestrating this metabolic balance, and uncover a signaling molecule that mediates energy homeostasis during fat depletion. We show tissue-specific depletion of fatty acyl-CoA synthase FASN1 in the Drosophila fat body (FB) causes near complete fat loss and metabolic remodeling that dramatically elevates carbohydrate metabolism, leading to a striking ~20-fold increase in glycogen storage. Proteomics and metabolomics identify key factors necessary for rewiring including glycolysis enzymes and target-of-brain-insulin (tobi). FASN1-deficient flies are viable but starvation sensitive, oxidatively stressed, and infertile. We also identify CG10824/cDIP as upregulated in FASN1-depleted Drosophila. cDIP is a leucine-rich-repeat protein with homology to secreted adipokines that fine-tune energy signaling. We find FB-specific cDIP loss promotes Drosophila adult obesity, and is required for development in the absence of FASN1-dependent lipid storage. Collectively, we show fat-depleted Drosophila rewire their metabolism to complete development, and identify cDIP as a putative new cytokine that signals fat insufficiency and may regulate energy homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

Here, we explored a large number of publicly available human microbiome datasets and retrieved a total of 829 anellovirus genomes, substantially expanding the known diversity of these viruses. The majority of new genomes fall within the three major human anellovirus genera: Alphatorquevirus, Betatorquevirus and Gammatorquevirus, while we also present one new genome of the under-sampled Hetorquevirus genus. The phylogeny reconstructed from the conserved ORF1 gene reveals three additional, previously undescribed, human anellovirus clades. We performed recombination analysis and show evidence of extensive recombination across all human anelloviruses. Interestingly, more than 95% of the detected events are between members of the same clade and only 15 inter-clade recombination events were detected. The breakpoints of recombination cluster in hotspots at the ends and outside of the ORF1 gene, while a recombination coldspot was detected within the gene. Our analysis suggests that anellovirus evolution is governed by homologous recombination, however events between distant viruses or ones producing chimaeric ORF1s likely lead to non-viable recombinants. The large number of genomes further allowed us to examine how essential genomic features vary across anelloviruses. These include functional domains in the ORF1 protein and the nucleotide motif of the replication loop region, required for the viruses' rolling-circle replication. A subset of the genomes assembled in both this and previous studies are completely lacking these essential elements, opening up the possibility that anellovirus intracellular populations contain defective virus genomes (DVGs). Overall, our study highlights key features of anellovirus genomics and evolution, a largely understudied group of viruses whose potential in virus-based therapeutics is recently being explored.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

The genetics, biophysics and evolution of hydrophobic cores are not well understood, in part because of a lack of systematic experimental data on sequence combinations that do - and do not - constitute stable and functional cores. Here we randomize protein hydrophobic cores and evaluate their stability and function at scale. The data show that vast numbers of amino acid combinations can constitute stable protein cores but that these alternative cores frequently disrupt protein function because of allosteric effects. These strong allosteric effects are not due to complicated, highly epistatic fitness landscapes but rather, to the pervasive nature of allostery, with many individually small energy changes combining to disrupt function. Indeed both protein stability and ligand binding can be accurately predicted over very large evolutionary distances using additive energy models with a small contribution from pairwise energetic couplings. As a result, energy models trained on one protein can accurately predict core stability across hundreds of millions of years of protein evolution, with only rare energetic couplings that we experimentally identify limiting the transplantation of cores between highly diverged proteins. Our results reveal the simple energetic architecture of protein hydrophobic cores and suggest that allostery is a major constraint on sequence evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

However, most existing externally triggered delivery systems are based on complex micromachines that are controlled with electromagnetic waves and require custom external instrumentation. Here we present a drug delivery platform comprising a simple protein-containing hydrogel that can be both imaged and triggered to release drugs at specific locations using widely available ultrasound imaging devices. This technology is based on the addition of air-filled protein nanostructures called gas vesicles (GVs) to hydrogel delivery vehicles. While intact, GVs sterically block the release of drug payloads and allow the vehicle to be imaged with ultrasound. An increase in ultrasound pressure causes the collapse of GVs within hydrogels present at the desired anatomical location, instantly creating percolation channels and triggering rapid drug release. Both the imaging and release are performed using a common diagnostic ultrasound probe. We implement this concept by establishing ultrasound-controlled drug diffusion and release from hydrogels in vitro and demonstrating targeted image-guided protein delivery in vivo following oral administration. We use this approach to deliver anti-inflammatory antibodies to treat gastrointestinal inflammation in a rat model of colitis. Targeted acoustic percolation switches (TAPS) open a conduit for local, image-guided drug delivery with a simple formulation and commonplace ultrasound equipment.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

But the exact role of pupil size in visual perception is still poorly understood. We recorded pupil size and electrical activity from the retina and brain while healthy human participants viewed full-screen flashes. We found that early retinal responses, which peaked around 25 ms after stimulus onset and predicted subsequent activity over visual cortex, were strongly affected by stimulus intensity. Importantly, pupil size, at least within the range of naturally occurring fluctuations, did not affect the amplitude of these early retinal responses, despite resulting in substantial changes in retinal light exposure. However, the direction of pupil-size change at the moment of stimulus presentation did modulate the amplitude of early retinal responses, which were enhanced during phases of dilation as compared to constriction. Based on these results, we suggest that fast-acting adaptation processes may normalize early retinal responses with respect to changes in retinal light exposure that result from spontaneous changes in pupil size: an initial form of brightness constancy. These results shed new light on, and raise important and previously unasked questions about, the role of pupil size in visual perception.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

MP20 forms tetramers each of which contain 4 transmembrane alpha-helices that are packed against one another forming a helical bundle. Both the N- and C- termini of MP20 are cytoplasmic. We found that each MP20 tetramer formed adhesive interactions with an opposing tetramer in a head-to-head fashion. These interactions were mediated by the extracellular loops of the protein. The dimensions of the MP20 adhesive junctions are consistent with the 11 nm thin lens junctions. Investigation of MP20 localization in human lenses indicated that in young fiber cells MP20 was stored intracellularly in vesicles and upon fiber cell maturation MP20 inserted into the plasma membrane and restricted the extracellular space.

Above the optimal plants growth range, plant immunity and in particular immune responses induced by nucleotide-binding leucine rich repeat receptors (NLRs) are dampened, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remains elusive. NLRs usually contain an N-terminal signaling domain, such as Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which is self-sufficient to trigger immune signaling. By using inducible Arabidopsis transgenic lines expressing TIR-containing NLRs (TNLs) or corresponding isolated TIR domains from Arabidopsis RPS4 and flax L6 NLRs, we showed that immune signaling induced downstream of TNL activation is not affected by an elevation of temperature. Conditional activation of TNL- and isolated TIR-mediated immune responses follow the same signaling route at permissive temperature (EDS1/RNLs requirement and activation of the salicylic acid sector). Yet, this signaling pathway is maintained under elevated temperature (30{degrees}C) when induced by isolated TIRs, but not full-length TNLs. This work underlines the need to further study how NLRs are impacted by an increase of temperature, which is particularly important to improve the resilience of plant disease resistance in a warming climate.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

Recently, single-cell genomic approaches have revealed in unprecedented resolution the orchestrated cellular responses driving cardiac fibrosis. Yet, the fibrosis-causing phenotypes that emerge in the heart following non-ischemic cardiac stress, and the transcriptional circuits that govern cell identity and drive fibrosis, are not well understood. Applying a paired multiomic approach, we reveal key transcriptional circuits, in mouse and human hearts, which are associated with fibrosis development following non-ischemic cardiac insults, independent of disease model, species or biological sex. Strikingly, we find the key regulatory events driving fibrosis are reversible at the single-cell transcriptional and epigenomic level, further pointing to key factors regulating fibrosis development and resolution. The transcriptional regulators identified in this study represent promising targets to ameliorate the development of fibrosis in the context of chronic stressors such as aging and hypertension.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

Proteins from the SMAX1- and SMXL78-clades of this family are targeted for degradation after karrikin or strigolactone perception, triggering downstream responses. We investigated how SMXL proteins control development. SMXL7 can partially replicate SMAX1 function in seeds and seedlings, but SMAX1 cannot replace SMXL7 in shoot branching control. Therefore, the distinct roles of these genes arise from differences in protein activity more than expression. Analysis of chimeras and domain deletions of SMAX1 and SMXL7 proteins revealed that an N-terminal domain is necessary and sufficient to specify developmental functions. We screened 158 transcription factors for interactions with SMAX1. The N-terminal domain is necessary and/or sufficient for the majority of candidate interactions. These discoveries enable cross-wiring of karrikin and strigolactone control of plant development and lay a foundation for understanding how SMXL proteins evolved functional differences.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

This timekeeping phenomenon triggers adaptive responses in higher organisms such as gonadal growth/regression, flowering, and hibernation. Unexpectedly, we discovered this capability in cyanobacteria, unicellular prokaryotes with generation times of only 5-6 h. Cyanobacteria in short winter-like days develop enhanced resistance to cold that involves desaturation of membrane lipids and differential programs of gene transcription, including stress response pathways. As in eukaryotes, this photoperiodic timekeeping requires an intact circadian clockwork and develops over multiple cycles. Therefore, photoperiodic timekeeping evolved in much simpler organisms than previously appreciated, and involved genetic responses to stresses that recur seasonally.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

We developed an automation workflow that enables the generation, handling, and analysis of thousands of transplastomic strains in parallel, expanded the repertoire of selection markers for chloroplast transformation, established new reporter genes, and characterized over 140 regulatory parts, including native and synthetic promoters, UTRs, and intercistronic expression elements. We integrated the system within the Phytobrick cloning standard and demonstrate several applications, including a library-based approach to develop synthetic promoter designs in plastids. Finally, we provide a proof-of-concept for prototyping novel traits in plastids by introducing a chloroplast-based synthetic photorespiration pathway and demonstrating a twofold increase in biomass production. Overall, our study advances chloroplast engineering, and provides a promising platform to rapidly prototype chloroplast manipulations before their transfer into higher plants and crops.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

To estimate the eco-evolutionary forces shaping tails, we conducted phylogenetically-informed linear regressions. We built a well-sampled, time-calibrated phylogeny of the entirely tailed moth group (Actias + Argema) and performed ancestral state reconstruction and biogeographical analyses. To generate metrics of evolutionary pressures, we developed estimates of bat predator abundance and estimated environmental conditions associated with individual moth wing measurements. This integrative approach reveals evidence for positive selection on hindwing tails and body size by bats and negative selective pressure from environmental factors. Our study provides insight into the tradeoffs between strong biotic selective pressures and abiotic constraints that shape elaborate traits across the tree-of-life.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

In mature root regions, endodermal cells coat their cell surface in a hydrophobic polymer termed suberin, which blocks solute transport across the plasma membrane. Intriguingly, specific cells adjacent to the water-conducting xylem remain unsuberized. These are termed ""passage cells"" based on the assumption that they create a ""passage"" for nutrient influx into vasculature in the otherwise sealed-off root regions. The identity and function of passage cells remain unknown, but their presence proposes the existence of individual identities within the endodermis. In this study, we probe this by performing an in-depth investigation of passage cells and endodermal suberization in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Our work identifies the transcription factor MYB68 as a key regulator of suberization and endodermal lineage-specification related to passage cell formation. Through transcriptional profiling of myb68 mutants, we unravel genes with passage cell-associated expression that suggest a function in cation homeostasis. Collectively, our findings create a framework for a deeper understanding of radial cell identities within the endodermis and highlight that dynamic spatiotemporal patterning is an important physiological feature of root ground tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

To localize the ancestral and geographical origins of the Yamnaya among the diverse Eneolithic people that preceded them, we studied ancient DNA data from 428 individuals of which 299 are reported for the first time, demonstrating three previously unknown Eneolithic genetic clines. First, a ""Caucasus-Lower Volga"" (CLV) Cline suffused with Caucasus hunter-gatherer (CHG) ancestry extended between a Caucasus Neolithic southern end in Neolithic Armenia, and a steppe northern end in Berezhnovka in the Lower Volga. Bidirectional gene flow across the CLV cline created admixed intermediate populations in both the north Caucasus, such as the Maikop people, and on the steppe, such as those at the site of Remontnoye north of the Manych depression. CLV people also helped form two major riverine clines by admixing with distinct groups of European hunter-gatherers. A ""Volga Cline"" was formed as Lower Volga people mixed with upriver populations that had more Eastern hunter-gatherer (EHG) ancestry, creating genetically hyper-variable populations as at Khvalynsk in the Middle Volga. A ""Dnipro Cline"" was formed as CLV people bearing both Caucasus Neolithic and Lower Volga ancestry moved west and acquired Ukraine Neolithic hunter-gatherer (UNHG) ancestry to establish the population of the Serednii Stih culture from which the direct ancestors of the Yamnaya themselves were formed around 4000BCE. This population grew rapidly after 3750-3350BCE, precipitating the expansion of people of the Yamnaya culture who totally displaced previous groups on the Volga and further east, while admixing with more sedentary groups in the west. CLV cline people with Lower Volga ancestry contributed four fifths of the ancestry of the Yamnaya, but also, entering Anatolia from the east, contributed at least a tenth of the ancestry of Bronze Age Central Anatolians, where the Hittite language, related to the Indo-European languages spread by the Yamnaya, was spoken. We thus propose that the final unity of the speakers of the ""Proto-Indo-Anatolian"" ancestral language of both Anatolian and Indo-European languages can be traced to CLV cline people sometime between 4400-4000 BCE.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022).

Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms.

Timely identification of the fetal red blood cell antigen genotype for the antigen to which the pregnant person is alloimmunized is vital for determining fetal risk for HDFN and guiding management. Presently in the US, recommended care is to determine fetal antigen genotype with reproductive partner testing and/or amniocentesis. This approach has many limitations, including availability of reproductive partner testing, risk of nonpaternity, and low uptake of invasive testing such as amniocentesis. These barriers to obtaining fetal antigen genotype information lead to pregnancies not at risk for HDFN undergoing burdensome monitoring and, in some cases, unnecessary intervention. PCR-based qualitative cfDNA analysis for fetal antigen genotyping is available in Europe, however, it is offered at later gestational ages, may require a repeat sample, has a higher frequency of inconclusive results for individuals of non-European ancestry, and entails logistical challenges related to shipping and insurance coverage for patients in the US. The availability of a NGS-based quantitative cfDNA analysis for fetal antigen genotyping in the US that is robust for diverse populations and applicable for singleton and twin pregnancies starting at 10 weeks gestation presents an opportunity to assess performance.

MethodsPatients with alloimmunized pregnancies undergoing clinical fetal antigen cfDNA analysis were recruited to the study along with the neonates resulting from the pregnancies. The laboratory issued the results prospectively as a part of clinical care. After delivery, neonatal buccal swabs were sent to an outside laboratory, blinded to the fetal cfDNA results, for antigen genotyping, and the results were compared. Concordance was reported for the fetal antigen cfDNA analysis for antigens to which the pregnant person was alloimmunized as well as for all antigens for which the pregnant person was genotype negative.

ResultsWe observed complete concordance between the fetal antigen cfDNA analysis result and neonatal genotypes for 503 calls, for 100% sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV across a racial and ethnically diverse cohort.

ConclusionThis study demonstrates that cfDNA analysis for determining fetal antigen genotype is more accurate than real-life application of the current recommendations, ie., partner testing and amniocentesis, in a diverse US population. In addition, this noninvasive approach reduces barriers to obtaining timely, accurate information about fetal antigen genotype. These results support the routine implementation of fetal antigen cfDNA analysis to guide care of alloimmunized pregnancies in the US.","NA","medrxiv",1715897325308

Methods: We use a probabilistic framework to estimate the likelihood that novel influenza virus cases would be detected through testing in different community and healthcare settings (urgent care, emergency department, hospital, and intensive care unit (ICU)) while at low frequencies in the United States. Parameters were informed by data on seasonal influenza virus activity and existing testing practices. Results: In a baseline scenario reflecting the presence of 100 novel virus infections with similar severity to seasonal influenza viruses, the median probability of detecting at least one infection per month was highest in urgent care settings (72%) and when community testing was conducted at random among the general population (77%). However, urgent care testing was over 15 times more efficient (estimated as the number of cases detected per 100,000 tests) due to the larger number of tests required for community testing. In scenarios that assumed increased clinical severity of novel virus infection, median detection probabilities increased across all healthcare settings, particularly in hospitals and ICUs (up to 100%) where testing also became more efficient. Conclusions: Our results suggest that novel influenza virus circulation is likely to be detected through existing healthcare surveillance, with the most efficient testing setting impacted by the disease severity profile. These analyses can help inform future testing strategies to maximize the likelihood of novel influenza detection.","NA","medrxiv",1715897325308

While RdRp is the target of several viral inhibitors, the active site has several pitfalls when translating in vitro inhibitors to the clinic. The highly polar residues within the active site often necessitate the use of highly polar or charged compounds, especially when designing nucleoside analog inhibitors, posing significant challenges in optimizing drug-likeness and membrane permeability for clinical efficacy. Here, we investigated the broad-spectrum potential of the allosteric Thumb-1 cryptic site of the RdRp, which to date has only been adequately studied in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). To explore this potential antiviral target, we used a suite of bioinformatics techniques, including homology modeling and multiple sequence alignments, to reveal the conserved landscape of the Thumb-1 site across +ssRNA viruses. We then used ChemPrint, our Mol-GDL (Molecular-Geometric Deep Learning) machine learning model to predict drug inhibition of the Thumb-1 site in RdRp across +ssRNA viruses. Here, we identify MDL-001 as a promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidate with favorable properties that enable oral and once-a-day dosing. We also show how the cryptic nature of the Thumb-1 site masks itself to conventional virtual screening techniques, like docking, where activity prediction is heavily based on solving or predicting an accurate structure of the open pocket. This study demonstrates the utility of this approach in drug discovery for broad-spectrum antivirals that target the Thumb-1 site.

Lay SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThis paper addresses the challenge of developing broad-spectrum antivirals against +ssRNA viruses, which include pathogens like HCV and SARS-CoV-2. The highly conserved RdRp Thumb-1 site across these viruses is identified as a potential target for broad spectrum antiviral drugs, which would be vital tools in prophylactic and therapeutic responses to future viral threats.

This study introduces our GALILEO AI drug discovery platform and its foundational ChemPrint model, designed to improve the efficiency of drug discovery. Addressing the challenges of low hit rates and the difficulty in exploring novel chemical spaces, this platform adopts adaptive molecular embeddings and stringent model training environments to enhance predictive capabilities and navigate uncharted molecular territories. We validate this approach through a case study targeting the AXL and BRD4 oncology targets, where ChemPrint achieved a 45.5% in vitro hit rate and identified 20 novel acting compounds. These compounds exhibited substantial chemical novelty, with an average Tanimoto similarity score of 0.32 to their training set, significantly diverging from known compounds and demonstrating ChemPrints capability to extrapolate, surpassing traditional benchmarks and industry standards. This underscores the platforms ability to bridge the gap between the potential of AI and its practical application in therapeutic discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

DesignThis case series study analyzed adverse event (AE) reports submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database following RSVPreF immunization from September 1, 2023, to February 23, 2024.

SettingVAERS, as a national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system, provides insights into the safety profile of the RSVPreF vaccine in a real-world setting.

ParticipantsSurveillance data included all AE reports submitted to VAERS for pregnant individuals following vaccination.

ExposureReceipt of RSVPreF vaccine among pregnant individuals in the U.S.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresDescriptive statistics assessed all AE reports with RSVPreF, including frequency, gestational age at vaccination, time to AE onset, and serious report proportions. The Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) was utilized, estimating the information component (IC) to identify disproportionate reporting of RSVPreF-event pairs.

ResultsVAERS received 77 reports pertained to RSVPreF vaccination in pregnant individuals, with 42 (54.55%) classified as serious. The most reported non-pregnancy-specific AEs were headache, injection site erythema, and injection site pain. Preterm birth was the most frequently reported pregnancy-specific AE, followed by preterm premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, cervical dilatation, and hemorrhage during pregnancy. The median time from immunization to reported preterm birth was 3 days, with two-thirds of cases within a week. Disproportionality analysis indicated a significant signal for various AEs, particularly highlighting preterm birth with an IC of 2.18 (95%CI, 1.54-2.63), suggesting that reports of preterm birth associated with RSVPreF vaccination occurred more frequently than statistically expected.

ConclusionsWhile reported AEs were generally consistent with the safety profile observed in prelicensure studies, this study highlights ongoing concern about preterm birth among pregnant individuals following RSVPreF vaccination. Comprehensive longitudinal follow-up, including prospective pregnancy registries and infant follow-up studies is urgently required.","NA","medrxiv",1715897325308

Here, we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), a genome editing system that combines the programmability and precision of CRISPR/Cas9 with the RNA-mediated gene insertion capabilities of the human LINE1 (L1) element. CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1715897325308

Recent research has highlighted the therapeutic potential of psychoactive substances and especially 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), in alleviating trauma symptoms in chronic patients. However, little is known regarding the consequences of trauma that is acutely experienced under the influence of psychoactive substances. Here we investigated the acute experiences and peritraumatic processing of 657 survivors from the high-casualty terror attack at the Supernova music festival in Israel on October 7th, 2023. Data were collected four to twelve weeks following the TE. Approximately two-thirds of survivors were under the influence of psychoactive substances at the time of the TE, offering a tragic and unique natural experiment on the impact of psychoactive compounds on TE processing. Our findings reveal that individuals who experienced the trauma while under the influence of MDMA demonstrated significantly improved intermediate outcomes compared to those who were under the influence of other substances or no substances at all. Specifically, the MDMA group reported increased feelings of social support, more social interactions and enhanced quality of sleep during the peritraumatic period, yielding reduced levels of mental distress and reduced PTSD symptom severity. These novel findings suggest that the influence of MDMA during the TE may carry protective effects into the peritraumatic period, possibly mediated through the known effects of MDMA in reducing negative emotions and elevating prosociality. These protective effects in turn may mitigate the development of early psychopathology-related symptoms. Current preliminary results underscore the need for further understanding of the cognitive and physiological processes by which psychedelic substances intersect with trauma recovery processes.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

We investigated the association between long-term exposure to wildfire smoke PM2.5 and all-cause mortality and mortality from a wide range of specific causes in all 3,108 counties in the contiguous U.S., 2007-2020. Monthly county-level mortality data were collected from the National Center for Health Statistics. Wildfire smoke PM2.5 concentration was derived from a 10x10 km2 resolution spatiotemporal model. Controlling for non-smoke PM2.5, air temperature, and unmeasured spatial and temporal confounders, we found a non-linear association between 12-month moving average concentration of smoke PM2.5 and monthly all-cause mortality rate. Relative to a month with the long-term smoke PM2.5 exposure below 0.1 g/m3, all-cause mortality increased by 0.40-1.54 and 3.65 deaths per 100,000 people per month when the 12-month moving average of PM2.5 concentration was of 0.1-5 and 5+ g/m3, respectively. Cardiovascular, ischemic heart disease, digestive, endocrine, diabetes, mental, suicide, and chronic kidney disease mortality were all found to be associated with long-term wildfire smoke PM2.5 exposure. Smoke PM2.5 contributed to approximately 30,180 all-cause deaths/year (95% CI: 21,449, 38,910) in the contiguous U.S. Higher smoke PM2.5-related increases in mortality rates were found for people aged 65 above and racial minority populations. Positive interaction effects with extreme heat were also observed. Our study identified the detrimental effects of long-term exposure to wildfire smoke PM2.5 on a wide range of mortality outcomes, underscoring the need for public health actions and communication to prepare communities and individuals to mitigate smoke exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1715897325308

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

These viruses have spread across the Americas causing morbidity and mortality in both wild and domestic birds as well as some mammalian species, including cattle. Many surveillance programs in wildlife as well as commercial poultry operations have detected these viruses. Here we conducted surveillance of avian species in the urban environment in New York City. We detected highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in six samples from four different bird species and performed full genome sequencing. Sequence analysis showed the presence of multiple different genotypes. Our work highlights that the interface between animals and humans that may give rise to zoonotic infections or even pandemics is not limited to rural environments and commercial poultry operations but extends into the heart of our urban centers.

ImportanceWhile surveillance for avian influenza viruses is often focused on migratory routes and their associated stop-over locations, or commercial poultry operations, many bird species - including migratory birds - frequent or live in urban green spaces and wetlands. This brings them into contact with a highly dense population of humans and pets providing an extensive urban animal-human interface in which the general public may have little awareness of circulating infectious diseases. This study focuses on virus surveillance at this interface, combined with culturally responsive science education and community outreach.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

We report genome-wide data from 78 prehistoric North Pontic individuals to understand the genetic makeup of the people involved in these migrations and discover the reasons for their success. First, we show that native North Pontic foragers had ancestry not only from Balkan and Eastern hunter-gatherers6 but also from European farmers and, occasionally, Caucasus hunter-gatherers. More dramatic inflows ensued during the Eneolithic, when migrants from the Caucasus-Lower Volga area7 moved westward, bypassing the local foragers to mix with Trypillian farmers advancing eastward. People of the Usatove archaeological group in the Northwest Pontic were formed ca. 4500 BCE with an equal measure of ancestry from the two expanding groups. A different Caucasus-Lower Volga group, moving westward in a distinct but temporally overlapping wave, avoided the farmers altogether, and blended with the foragers instead to form the people of the Serednii Stih archaeological complex7. A third wave of expansion occurred when Yamna descendants of the Serednii Stih forming ca. 4000 BCE expanded during the Early Bronze Age (3300 BCE). The temporal gap between Serednii Stih and the Yamna expansion is bridged by a genetically Yamna individual from Mykhailivka in Ukraine (3635-3383 BCE), a site of uninterrupted archaeological continuity across the Eneolithic-Bronze Age transition, and the likely epicenter of Yamna formation. Each of these three waves propagated distinctive ancestries while also incorporating outsiders during its advance, a flexible strategy forged in the North Pontic region that may explain its peoples outsized success in spreading their genes and culture across Eurasia3-5,8-10.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308

Stress-induced exposure of ribosome-free mRNA following translational shutoff is thought to cause condensation by allowing new multivalent RNA-dependent interactions, with RNA length and associated interaction capacity driving increased condensation. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all mRNA species condense in response to multiple unrelated stresses in budding yeast, length plays a minor role, and instead, stress-induced transcripts are preferentially excluded from condensates, enabling their selective translation. Using both endogenous genes and reporter constructs, we show that translation initiation blockade, rather than resulting ribosome-free RNA, causes condensation. These translation initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are biochemically detectable even when stress granules, defined as microscopically visible foci, are absent or blocked. TIICs occur in unstressed yeast cells, and, during stress, grow before the appearance of visible stress granules. Stress-induced transcripts are excluded from TIICs primarily due to the timing of their expression, rather than their sequence features. Together, our results reveal a simple system by which cells redirect translational activity to newly synthesized transcripts during stress, with broad implications for cellular regulation in changing conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1715897325308
