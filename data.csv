However, existing profiling tools are typically tailored to specific use cases, have limited scalability for large datasets, and lack robust methods to aggregate or summarize traits at internal tree nodes. Here, we present TreeProfiler, a tool for automated annotation and interactive exploration of hundreds of features along large gene and species trees, with seamless summarization of mapped traits at internal nodes. TreeProfiler supports the profiling of custom continuous and discrete traits, as well as ancestral character reconstruction and phylogenetic signal tests. It also integrates commonly used genomic features, including multiple sequence alignments, protein domain architectures, and functional annotations. We demonstrate TreeProfilers utility beyond traditional phylogenetic profiling by analyzing functional diversification and domain architectures within the pyruvate flavodoxin/ferredoxin oxidoreductase gene family (13,297 genes), and by profiling the relative abundance of 124,295 bacterial and archaeal species across 51 biomes.

The rapid emergence of macrolide resistant strains led the WHO in 2024 to designate S.pneumoniae as a priority pathogen, underscoring the need for alternative strategies such as anti-virulence therapy. Here, we repurposed the FDA approved cancer drug, sorafenib identified by in silico screening of compounds targeting the bacterial Serine/Threonine kinase protein StkP, an essential regulator of cell division and peptidoglycan synthesis conserved across many bacterial pathogens. Sorafenib interacts with the StkP-kinase domain and exhibited broad spectrum activity against diverse pneumococcal serotypes including multi drug resistant clinical isolates. Ectopic expression of StkP in both wild type and isogenic mutant strains conferred partial resistance to sorafenib, confirming on target activity. Scanning electron microscopy revealed aberrant cell wall morphology, and differential viability staining demonstrated increased membrane permeability. Consistently, sorafenib treated bacteria showed significantly higher complement C3 deposition and consequent killing in human serum. In human lung epithelial cells, sorafenib reduced bacterial adherence and invasion without detectable host cytotoxicity. Serial passaging at sub-microbicidal concentrations indicated a low propensity for resistance development in vitro. In vivo, sorafenib administration reduced mortality and lung bacterial load in a mouse model of pneumonia. Taken together, our data identify StkP as target of sorafenib in S. pneumoniae and justify its continued preclinical development for therapeutic intervention.","[{""name"":""Department of Science and Technology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0101xrq71"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DST/INSPIRE/04/2019/002238;""},{""name"":""Department of Biotechnology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03tjsyq23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BT/RLF/Re-entry/46/2020;""},{""name"":""Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05sdqd547"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Thematic institutional intrmural funding;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

In humans, the cytosolic (hMDH1) and mitochondrial (hMDH2) isoforms operate in distinct compartments, suggesting potential differences in regulation. Here, we present a comparative analysis of hMDH1 and hMDH2 under physiologically relevant conditions, integrating enzymatic assays, ligand binding studies, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and molecular modeling. Our findings reveal that hMDH2 activity is inhibited by -ketoglutarate, glutamate, NAD+, ATP, and citrate at concentrations consistent with mitochondrial metabolic states characterized by elevated amino acid catabolism or redox stress. Conversely, hMDH1 exhibits minimal impact by these metabolites, with only modest inhibition observed in the presence of ATP and ADP. SAXS analyses confirm that both isoforms maintain stable dimeric structures upon ligand binding, indicating that regulation is not mediated by global conformational changes. Structural modeling and normal mode analyses identify increased flexibility in hMDH1, particularly within the active site loop, thumb loop, and a partially disordered C-terminal helix. In contrast, hMDH2 displays a more rigid architecture and a more electropositive active site environment, correlating with its heightened sensitivity to anionic metabolites. Fluorescence quenching experiments further support these distinctions, demonstrating stronger binding affinities for nucleotide-based ligands in hMDH2 compared to hMDH1. Collectively, these results suggest that isoform-specific regulation of human MDH arises from differences in local structural dynamics and electrostatics, rather than large-scale structural rearrangements. hMDH2 appears adapted to integrate mitochondrial metabolic signals, modulating malate oxidation in response to cellular conditions, while hMDH1 maintains consistent cytosolic function across diverse metabolic states.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MCB RUI-2322867;CHE REU-2150091;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

Migrants typically minimize flights over barriers in opposing winds, while crossing the same barriers directly in supportive winds. Nevertheless, even in supportive conditions, barrier-crossings likely involve a number of risk-mitigating behaviors, including the use of stepping stones. We aimed to understand how seasonal ocean-crossings of Eleonora's falcons (Falco eleonorae) compare in terms of wind support and flight effort, and whether falcons use islands to cross safely in variable wind conditions. To do this we combined GPS-tracking data from 19 individuals over a decade (2012-2022) with wind data from an atmospheric reanalysis model. Despite major differences in wind support, falcons achieved similar ground speeds in both seasons. That is because falcons reduce instantaneous flight effort by flying at lower airspeeds in supportive spring winds (31.5 {+/-} 6.0 km h-1) than in adverse autumn winds (47.4 {+/-} 9.3 km h-1). Overall, it took falcons twice as many flight hours to complete the spring crossings that were 40% greater in terms of air distance compared to autumn crossings. Islands were more frequently used during spring crossings (57.9% individuals in spring vs 21.1% in autumn), and the probability of a falcon using an island significantly increased with weaker wind support in spring (but not in autumn). While wind support partially offsets the extra distance flown over the ocean in spring, isolated islands offer emergency stop-over opportunities when Eleonora's falcons experience relatively weak wind support during protracted ocean crossings.","[{""name"":""Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in Spatial Sciences-Island Sustainability"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101050349;""},{""name"":""Cabildo de Lanzarote"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""20145859;155354;170503;181116;196273;207319;""},{""name"":""Gobierno de Canarias"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CNS2022-135873;""},{""name"":""Spanish National Research Agency – Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PID2023-148806NB-I00;""},{""name"":""European Commission – Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""747729 &#34;EcoEvoClim&#34;;""},{""name"":""European Union – MSCA project RELOAD"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101059418;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

A wealth of studies indicate that dopamine activity encodes discrepancy between actual and predicted reward, leading to the reward prediction error (RPE) hypothesis. Specifically, it has been claimed that mesolimbic dopamine activity conforms to temporal-difference reward prediction error (TD RPE), a teaching signal in machine learning algorithms. Recently, there is growing evidence suggesting that dopamine is also involved in learning during aversive situations. However, the fundamental computation of dopamine activity in aversive situations is still unknown. A plausible but untested hypothesis is that dopamine activity in aversive situations also encodes TD RPE. Here, we tested this hypothesis by using mice in virtual reality. Mice were trained to avoid electrical tail shocks by running out of a virtual shock zone. Using probe conditions with speed manipulation or teleportation, we revealed that the dopamine signal in the ventral striatum follows the temporal derivative form of a value function. Delivering a reward at the end of the track enabled us to observe the integration of aversion and reward in a derivative form. Moreover, the value functions unbiasedly estimated from the recorded signal is consistent with the initial hypothetical form, with a realistic reflection of a received shock distribution. Taken together, our results show that mesolimbic dopamine activity can operate as a unified teaching signal in natural situations with positive and negative valences.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

In enteric species, the OM is covered by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) decorated with varying lengths of O-antigen (O-Ag) polysaccharide that protect bacteria against mammalian host defenses. Studies of lab-adapted Escherichia coli K-12 strains have proven instrumental in unravelling the essential processes of LPS synthesis, transport, and assembly into the OM. However, O-Ag synthesis was inactivated in K-12 strains during their lab adaption, and these cells produce a non-native, truncated LPS form. Surprisingly, we found that re-activating O-Ag synthesis in K-12 permeabilizes the OM to diverse antibiotics, causing susceptibility. The O-Ag that modifies LPS is directly responsible for the compromised OM barrier. Lengthening the O-Ag polysaccharide worsens antibiotic sensitivity; while shortening it, or removing it entirely, improves antibiotic resistance in both E. coli and the human pathogen, Shigella flexneri. Our data show that OM antibiotic barrier integrity is maintaining by a balanced production of long and short LPS forms, and that this balance is dysfunctional in model E. coli K-12 strains. Our findings reveal that long O-Ag polysaccharides are a double-edged sword: while well-recognized as critical for protection against external host assaults, their transport and assembly onto the surface comes at the inherent price of compromising the OM barrier. Hence, LPS production balances between competing needs in host defense and OM integrity. Moreover, we identify an inherent advantage for species that produce O-Ag-lacking lipooligosaccharide (LOS), rather than LPS.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

Astrocytes integrate metabolic and hormonal cues and sustain cell-autonomous rhythms, implicating them as candidate links between energy state and central circadian control. Here we show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in hypothalamic astrocytes exhibits intrinsic, calcium-dependent rhythmicity that persists under constant darkness and without feeding cues. This glial rhythm sustains time-of-day phosphorylation programmes in the hypothalamus and stabilises the clock protein PER2 via phosphorylation at a conserved serine residue, thereby linking metabolic state to period control beyond the canonical transcription-translation feedback loops. In the ventromedial hypothalamus, astrocytic AMPK-PER2 signalling is required for food-anticipatory activity, identifying a glial node within the food-entrainable timing system. Disrupting astrocytic AMPK rhythmicity alters circadian behaviour and energy homeostasis and shortens lifespan in a sex-dependent manner. These findings recast AMPK as a metabolically adaptive glial timekeeper that connects calcium signalling and phosphorylation rhythms to behaviour and metabolism. They also reveal a phosphorylation-based timing layer in central metabolic circuits, with implications for circadian-metabolic misalignment in contexts such as shift work and metabolic disorders.","[{""name"":""Xunta de Galicia"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0181xnw06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ED431F 2020/009;ED431C 2023/28;ED431G/05, 2020-2023;""},{""name"":""Agencia Estatal de Investigación"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PID2019-109556RB-I00;PID2022-138436OB-I00;PID2021-128145NB-I00;PDC2022-133958-I00;""},{""name"":""La Caixa Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LCF/PR/HR19/52160022;LCF/PR/HR20/52400013;LCF/PR/HR21/52410024;""},{""name"":""Fundación AECC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PRYGN234908LOPE;""},{""name"":""Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CEECINST/00018/2021;UIDB/50026/2020;UIDP/50026/2020;LA/P/0050/2020;""},{""name"":""BIAL Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""156/24;""},{""name"":""Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PRE2020-093614;PID2022-138436OB-I00;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

Functional redundancy, the capacity of different microbes to perform the same function, is considered a key mechanism underpinning the stability and resilience of the ocean microbiome. Although the extent of functional redundancy remains debated, investigating its manifestation in environmentally similar and interconnected microbial communities may provide critical insights into its role in shaping microbial community dynamics. We hypothesized that examining the long-term synchrony and rhythmicity of temperate microbial communities in such locations could provide insight into the role of functional redundancy. High functional redundancy at the community level would manifest as rhythmic and synchronous metabolic functions across sites, even in the absence of synchrony or rhythmicity at finer organizational levels, such as individual genes or taxa, thereby contributing to community resilience. Conversely, low functional redundancy would imply that synchrony and rhythmicity extend to both the contributing genes and taxa, suggesting a greater vulnerability of the community to environmental variability. To test this framework, we analyzed the long-term synchrony and rhythmicity of two marine-coastal microbiomes in the Mediterranean Sea, separated by approximately 150 km and connected by a dominant southwest current. Monthly collected metagenomes from a seven-year period were examined at the levels of metabolic functions (e.g., KEGG pathways), predicted genes (open reading frames), and taxa. We found functions, genes, and taxa exhibiting high, low, or anti-synchrony, as well as displaying rhythmic or non-rhythmic patterns. Although rhythmic behavior was observed on average across all organizational levels, consistent with the seasonal dynamics expected in temperate Mediterranean waters, average synchrony across microbiomes remained low. Focusing specifically on 45 markers of key biogeochemical functions, we revealed that several functions exhibited high synchrony and rhythmicity, in sharp contrast to the low synchrony and rhythmicity among the most abundant genes and taxa contributing to those functions. This suggests that functional redundancy and complementary dynamics at lower organizational levels, with distinct taxa contributing to key metabolic functions at different times, lead to rhythmic and synchronous dynamics at higher levels through emergent self-organization. Together, our results highlight functional redundancy and emergent self-organized dynamics as key mechanisms supporting the stability and resilience of marine microbiomes under environmental change.","[{""name"":""Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PID2019-105775RB-I00;PID2022-136281NB-I00;PID2023-146919NB-C22;""},{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GA#101059915 - BIOcean5D;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

Its speed is due to (a) a carefully engineered architecture involving only cache-coherent MSD radix sorts and merges, (b) a novel algorithm for finding adaptive seed hits in a linear merge of sorted k-mer tables, and (c) a variant of the Myers adaptive wave algorithm [1] to find alignments around a chain of seed hits that detects alignments with up to 25-30% variation. It further does not require pre-masking of repetitive sequence, and stores millions of alignments in a fraction of the space of a conventional CIGAR-string [2] using a trace-point encoding that is further compressed by the ONEcode data system [3] introduced here.

As an example, two bat genomes of size 2.2Gbp and 2.5Gbp can be compared in a little over 2 minutes using 8 threads on an Apple M4 Max laptop using 5.7GB of memory and producing 1.05 million alignments totaling 1.63Gbp of aligned sequence that cover about 60% of each genome. The output ""ALN""-formatted file occupies 66MB. This file can be converted to a PAF file with CIGAR strings in 6 seconds, where the PAF representation is a significantly larger 1.03GB file.

FastGA is freely available at github: http://www.github.com/thegenemyers/FASTGA along with utilities for viewing inputs, intermediate files, and outputs and transforming outputs into other common formats. Specifically, FastGA can, in addition to its highly efficient ONEcode representation, output PSL-formatted alignments, or PAF-formatted alignments with or without CIGAR strings explicitly encoding the alignments. There is also a utility to chain FastGAs alignments and display them in a dot-plot like view in Postscript files, and an interactive viewer is in development.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""207492;226458;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

One prominent example is Phylogenetic Diversity (PD), which, on a dated phylogenetic tree, measures evolutionary history by summing the branch lengths measured in time required to connect a set of species. PD may also capture other biodiversity measures by proxy such as the richness of biological features and their potential benefits for humanity, known as future options. The total global PD is known for some well-studied groups, such as most vertebrates, but PD estimates are lacking for the majority of the tree of life. Here, we characterize the distribution of PD across the complete tree of life with over 2.2 million species. To do this we use data from the Open Tree of Life and a smoothing method to interpolate between nodes without date information. We estimate that the PD represented by all described species together is between 30 and 33 trillion years (95% confidence interval). We characterize the distribution of evolutionary distinctiveness, a measure of the fair share of PD captured by individual species, across all life and within selected clades. This Evolutionary Distinctiveness metric has previously been used as the basis for conservation prioritization schemes such as EDGE (Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered) which synthesizes phylogenetic tree data with extinction risk data from the IUCN Red List of threatened species. We use our results to estimate EDGE scores for over 130,000 species. We also estimate the amount of threatened phylogenetic diversity across the complete tree of life. We hope this work will pave the way for more complete and automated analyses of PD, Evolutionary Distinctiveness, threatened evolutionary history, and EDGE scores across the complete tree of life.","[{""name"":""The Leverhulme Trust"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

While much of the existing research has focused on reward-based learning, the contribution of reward-independent learning processes to this imbalance remains unclear. To address this gap, the present study investigated the interaction between statistical learning (SL), a form of reward-free learning, and cognitive flexibility, a key goal-directed function, in a non-clinical population. By adopting a dimensional approach to obsessive-compulsive (OC) tendencies, this work aims to overcome the limitations of categorical diagnoses and better capture the continuous, nuanced variability of symptoms, while clarifying how specific neurocognitive processes relate to OC tendencies. A total of 402 participants from the non-clinical population completed an online study involving the Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task to assess SL and a Card Sorting Task to measure cognitive flexibility. Our findings revealed a competitive relationship between SL and cognitive flexibility. Critically, this inverse association weakened as OC tendencies increased, suggesting that even at non-clinical levels, OC tendencies may interfere with the typical interplay between automatic and goal-directed processes. Notably, SL performance remained intact, and the observed effects were not attributable to reward sensitivity, as learning occurred without external feedback. These findings emphasize the value of examining non-clinical OC tendencies and highlight the importance of investigating neurocognitive system interactions, rather than isolated functions, in advancing our understanding of OCD.","[{""name"":""French National Grant Agency"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-22-CPJ1-0042-01;ANR-24-CE37-5807;""},{""name"":""National Brain Research Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NAP2022-I-2/2022;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

Caloric restriction (CR), a well-established intervention, extends longevity in diverse species primarily through inhibition of the TOR signaling pathway. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), a classic serotonergic psychedelic with emerging therapeutic applications, remains largely unexplored in the context of aging. Here, we show that LSD treatment significantly extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans and reduces age-associated lipofuscin accumulation, indicative of delayed cellular aging. LSD reproduces several CR-like phenotypes, including decreased reproductive output and increased nuclear localization of the transcription factor PHA-4/FOXA, without affecting food intake. Moreover, LSD treatment reduces lipid stores and downregulates global protein synthesis, both hallmark signatures of TOR inhibition. These findings establish LSD as a modulator of evolutionarily conserved longevity pathways and suggest that psychedelic signaling can mimic a caloric restriction-like metabolic state, paving the way for the development of novel geroprotective strategies.","[{""name"":""D’Or Institute for Research and Education"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""IDOR/Pioneer Science Initiative"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Coordenação de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

We find that this variant disrupts the activity of a previously unstudied antisense long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) located between HOXA7 and HOXA9, which we have named HOTSCRAMBL. The HOTSCRAMBL variant disrupts lncRNA function and reduces human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal.

Given the critical role of HOXA gene expression in some blood cancers, we also demonstrate that HOTSCRAMBL variation or deletion compromises HOXA-dependent acute myeloid leukemias.

Transported nucleotide-sugars serve as donors in post-translational modification of proteins/ lipids, and donate sugar moiety to growing carbohydrate chain on nascent protein/lipid molecule, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme glycosyltransferase.
C_LIO_LIHere we reported that a mutation in the Arabidopsis thaliana gene At3g11320 coding for NST protein causes defects in male gametophyte development including collapsed, nonviable pollen. This mutation also caused impairment in the female gametophyte progression by arresting it at the functional megaspore (FM) stage.

This study shed further light on the role of such nucleotide sugar transporters in plant reproductive development processes, at least in Arabidopsis.

The aim of the current work is to test the hypothesis that the expression of DAM3 and DAM4 correlates negatively with vegetative growth during dormancy induction and breaking. The expression of DAM3 and DAM4 as well as plant morphology and physiology were analyzed during a period of semi-dormancy induction and breaking. Furthermore, DAM3 and DAM4 expression was compared between cultivars with different chill requirements. Lastly, the DAM1, DAM2, DAM3, and DAM4 expression of concurrently growing summer and winter leaves was compared at multiple stages of dormancy-breaking. DAM3 and DAM4 expression negatively correlated with leaf area and petiole length. We conclude that DAM3 and DAM4 expression patterns are consistent with that of regulators of semi-dormancy. DAM4 expression in particular correlates strongly with vegetative growth during semi-dormancy breaking. DAM3 or DAM4 expression were not found to correlate with the cultivar-specific chill requirements.

While generally thought to be a vertebrate-specific innovation, homologous placodes are proposed to exist in non-vertebrate chordates as well. In Ciona robusta, a solitary tunicate, the adult mouth (the oral siphon) is derived from one such ""cranial-like"" placode in the larva, which we term the oral siphon placode (OSP). At embryonic and larval stages, the OSP consists of a small rosette of cells that forms from the neuropore at the anteriormost extent of neural tube closure. While the morphogenesis of the OSP and its physical separation from other surface ectoderm structures have been described in detail, how this is regulated at the molecular level is currently unknown. Here we show the involvement of protocadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in the segregation and structural cohesiveness of the OSP. Protocadherin.e (Pcdhe.e) is expressed specifically in the OSP but not in other surface ectoderm cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of Pcdh.e in these cells results in loss of OSP structural integrity and ability to physically separate from other structures derived from the same cell lineage. Overexpression of Pcdh.e throughout the anterior surface ectoderm results in similar loss of a physically separate and distinct OSP territory. Furthermore, we show that Pcdh.e expession in the OSP depends on oral placode-specific transcription factors such as Six1/2 and Pitx. Our results suggest that OSP integrity and morphogenesis require precise regulation of a homotypic cell-cell adhesion molecule, which might reflect a conserved mechanism for placode formation in chordates.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM158421;""},{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD104825;""},{""name"":""Division of Integrative Organismal Systems"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01rvays47"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1940743;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

In this study, we develop a conditional knock-in mouse model expressing a mitochondrially targeted variant of the bacterial toxin DarT (mitoAtDarT), which induces mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage without affecting the nuclear genome. Ubiquitous expression of mitoAtDarT leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, evidenced by reduced membrane potential and mitochondrial mass, resulting in early embryonic lethality. Employing high-resolution microCT and molecular markers, we demonstrate that mitoAtDarT-expressing embryos fail to undergo normal gastrulation, exhibiting disrupted mesodermal patterning and a complete absence of allantois formation. Surprisingly, defects in lineage specification were evident even earlier, during preimplantation development. Blastocysts expressing mitoAtDarT exhibited reduced total cell numbers, altered trophectoderm-to-inner cell mass ratios, and a striking increase in cells co-expressing lineage markers, indicating a failure in the first cell fate decision. Our findings demonstrate that mitochondrial integrity is essential not only for energy metabolism but also for the precise coordination of cell fate specification and morphogenesis.

To understand how this robust coordination occurs, we use the loss of robustness mutant development related myb-like1 (drmy1), which exhibits variable sepal initiation and growth, causing failure of the sepals to close the flower bud. Specifically, drmy1 has overgrown outer (abaxial) sepals and undergrown inner (adaxial) sepals, leading to a large discrepancy in the sizes of different sepals within individual flower buds. Using single cell and spatial RNA-seq, we found changes in expression of key genes related to brassinosteroid (BR) signaling in drmy1, particularly in cell types important to young flower bud development such as epidermal cells, boundary cells, and meristematic cells. Confocal imaging of a BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1 (BES1) ratiometric reporter confirms that BR signaling is upregulated and more variable in young drmy1 sepals. Subsequently, we found that altering BR signaling in drmy1 by crossing with BR mutants or adding brassinolide (a potent brassinosteroid) or brassinazole (a brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor) can partially rescue this elongation defect by differentially altering the relative growth of the inner and outer sepals. Increasing BR signaling rescues by increasing the growth of the inner sepal but not the outer sepal, while decreasing BR signaling rescues by decreasing the growth of the outer sepal but not the inner sepal. These results suggest that brassinosteroids mediate the robust coordination of the growth rates between inner and outer sepals during early development, ensuring proper flower bud closure.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EF-2222434;DGE-2139899;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM134037;S10OD032251;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

In the primate embryo, the amnion rather than the trophectoderm is directly juxtaposed to the epiblast and may play this role. To model the interactions between the amnion and epiblast, we differentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to amnion-like cells (AMLCs) and juxtaposed them in a controlled manner with undifferentiated hPSCs, which represent the epiblast. We found that juxtaposition between these cell types is sufficient to initiate a range of cell behaviors associated with gastrulation including organized differentiation to primitive streak and downstream mesendodermal cell fates and directed cell migration out of the primitive streak region. Performing knockout experiments specifically in either the epiblast or amnion compartment revealed intricate crosstalk that is required to properly initiate gastrulation. In particularly, using knockouts of NODAL we show that Nodal signaling in both the amnion and epiblast is required for gastrulation patterning. Finally, we show that inductive ability is a transient property acquired during amnion differentiation, and that cells that differentiate from this inductive state acquire an extraembryonic mesenchyme identity.

Many PA enzymes are regulated post-transcriptionally, making traditional transcript-based methods ineffective in determining their abundance, highlighting the need for alternative approaches to study PA homeostasis. Here, we refined a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based method to simultaneously quantify activities of two key PA synthesizing enzymes - arginine decarboxylase (ADC) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) - from plant tissues using stable isotope substrates. By optimizing substrate concentrations, we increased assay sensitivity >10-fold in tomato leaf tissue. We further adapted this protocol for Nicotiana benthamiana, a model plant widely used for transient recombinant protein expression. Expression of epitope-tagged ADCs in this system revealed a direct correlation between protein abundance and enzymatic activity, demonstrating that ADC activity can infer its protein abundance in native tissues. Proof-of-principle experiments with the N. benthamiana expression system, confirm substrate specificity of tomato ADC and ODC enzymes and essential catalytic residues of tomato ADCs. Beyond enzymatic activities, our LCMS-based method also permits quantification of 11 PA network metabolite concentrations from the same LCMS sample. Visualizing this data as a heatmap pathway diagram, alongside ADC/ODC activities provides a comprehensive overview of PA metabolism in plant tissues. We also studied tomato CRISPR-Cas9-induced mutants deficient in ADC or ODC, complemented by phenotypic analysis. LC-MS analysis of an adc1/adc2 double mutant - an embryo lethal genotype in Arabidopsis - had no detectable agmatine, the product of ADCs. Additionally, despite a reduction in putrescine, no impact on the downstream PAs, spermidine and spermine, was found. The adc1/adc2 double mutant showed severe developmental abnormalities, including complete flower loss, demonstrating the indispensable role of ADCs in flower development. In summary, our optimized LC-MS approach for simultaneous quantification of ADC/ODC enzyme activity and PA-pathway metabolites, the ability to transiently express and functionally analyze recombinant ADC/ODC proteins in planta, and a collection of tomato CRISPR mutants deficient in these enzymes collectively establish a versatile new experimental toolkit to dissect PA homeostasis and PA-dependent developmental processes in plants.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LA 1338/15-1;LA 1338/ 17-1;TRR356 (project number: 690 491090170, subproject B03);442641014;""},{""name"":""National Natural Science Foundation of China"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h0zpd94"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""32372485;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

This is in stark contrast to the largely unexplored situation in the human gut, where the underlying mechanisms and stimuli that induce regeneration are poorly understood. Here, we developed genetic strategies to characterize fluorescently labelled LGR5+ stem cells in normal human colon organoids. In parallel, we made diphtheria toxin-mediated cell type ablation compatible with human cells, thereby enabling in-depth interrogation of the sequence of events during depletion and reappearance of stem cells. Following LGR5+ stem cell depletion, most of the remaining epithelial cells entered a regenerative state characterized by fetal-like expression programs. Strikingly, this regenerative response was already initiated before stem cell loss, indicative of active communication between functional stem cells and progeny during homeostasis. We identified inactivation of retinoid X receptor (RXR) as a crucial trigger to initiate the regenerative response in colonocytes, with human colon stem cells being the producer of the RXR stimulus retinoic acid. Thus, stem cell-derived retinoic acid actively suppresses the regenerative state in colonocytes, explaining how surviving cells sense stem cell loss.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""803608;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of apomixis and sexuality in P. cattleyanum among heptaploid and octoploid accessions, and to analyze the maternal and paternal contribution to endosperm formation. Flow cytometry was employed on mature seeds obtained from hand-pollinated crosses between two octoploid and two heptaploid accessions to determine the ploidy levels of embryo and endosperm. Within the 492 analyzed seeds the ploidy balance of embryo:endosperm ranged from the expected 2:5 (64.2%, pseudogamous apomixis) and 2:3 (4.7%, sexuality involving reduced gametophytes), to unexpected values, including 1:3 (0.4%),), 2:6 (2.4%), 2:7 (0.2%), 3:5 (8.8%), 2:3:5 (18.5%) and 2:4:6 (0.8%), associated with polyhaploid parthenogenesis, pseudogamous apomixis involving reduced and unreduced gametophytes, and female gametophytes with two or three polar nuclei in the central cell.

Here, we analysed the impact of ASD mutations in CEP41 using human corticogenesis. CEP41 encodes a centrosomal protein located at the basal body and the ciliary axoneme and is mutated in ASD individuals and in Joubert syndrome, a ciliopathy with high incidence of ASD. To gain insights into CEP41s role in ASD aetiology, we characterised human cortical organoids carrying the CEP41 R242H point mutations found in ASD individuals. This mutation did not interfere with CEP41s ciliary localisation but cilia were shorter and had lower levels of tubulin polyglutamylation, which is indicative of altered cilia stability and signalling. Moreover, scRNAseq analyses revealed that the expression of several transcription factors with critical roles in interneuron development was altered in mutant interneurons and their progenitors. The CEP41 mutation also caused decreased cortical progenitor proliferation and an augmented formation of upper layer cortical neurons. Taken together, these findings indicate that CEP41 controls excitatory and inhibitory neuron differentiation, alterations in which might lead to an excitation/inhibition imbalance that is widely recognized as a convergent mechanism underlying neurodevelopmental disorders.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""529085;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219542/Z/19/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

Scarb1 is expressed in multiple cell types, including osteoblasts and macrophages. PC-OxPLs, present on OxLDL and apoptotic cells, adversely affect bone metabolism. Overexpression of E06 IgM - a natural antibody that recognizes PC-OxPLs- increases cancellous and cortical bone at 6 months of age in both sexes and protects against age- and high fat diet- induced bone loss, by increasing bone formation. We have reported that SCARB1 is the most abundant scavenger receptor for OxPLs in osteoblastic cells, and osteoblasts derived from Scarb1 knockout mice (Scarb1 KO) are protected from the pro-apoptotic and anti-differentiating effects of OxLDL. Skeletal analysis of Scarb1 KO mice produced contradictory results, with some studies reporting elevated bone mass and others reporting low bone mass. To clarify if Scarb1 mediates the negative effects of PC-OxPLs in bone, we deleted it in osteoblast lineage cells using Osx1-Cre transgenic mice. Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements and micro-CT analysis of cancellous and cortical bone at 6 months of age did not reveal any differences between Scarb1{Delta}OSX-l mice and their wild-type (WT), Osx1-Cre, or Scarb1fl/fl littermate controls. We then investigated whether PC-OxPLs could exert their anti-osteogenic effects via activation of SCARB1 in myeloid cells by deleting Scarb1 in LysM-Cre expressing cells. BMD measurements and micro-CT analysis at 6 months of age did not show any differences between Scarb1{Delta}LysM mice and their WT, LysM-Cre, or Scarb1fl/fl controls.

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B “Meiosis”;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

Prioritizing causal variants within these loci is critical for characterizing trait biology. Statistical fine mapping identifies causal variants at trait-associated loci, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited GWAS sample sizes prevent the resolution of many associations. Functionally informed approaches augment fine mapping by estimating variant prior causal probabilities based on overlap with trait-relevant functional annotations. However, functional enrichment provides only an indirect proxy for variant functional impact. Sequence-to-function models directly estimate variant effects on molecular phenotypes from underlying sequence context. Borzoi is a long-context model that predicts sequence determinants of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation across diverse tissues and cell types. Here we present Sniff, a Borzoi-informed fine-mapping approach that integrates broad genomic functional annotations with Borzoi-predicted variant effects via PolyFun to estimate variant prior causal probabilities. Applied to 15 UK Biobank traits, Sniff identifies 9.45% additional fine-mapped variants compared to PolyFun-Baseline at posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 0.8. Sniff-prioritized variants exhibit allele-specific activity in reporter assays and are predicted to have tissue-specific activity in trait-relevant tissues. For most traits, genes nominated by Sniff receive higher scores from the orthogonal gene prioritization method PoPS compared to genes nominated using functional annotations alone. Because differentially prioritized variants are driven by Borzoi predictions, we leverage attribution techniques to characterize sequence features underlying fine mapping and generate mechanistic hypotheses for GWAS associations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour l’Education et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function.

MethodsPlacental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD091218-04S1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

The components differ in their representational attributes and plasticity, with evidence for sparser, more decorrelated activity and faster plasticity in regions higher up in the hierarchy. How and why did the brain arrive at this organization? We explore the principles that allow such an organization to emerge by simulating a hierarchy of learning subsystems in artificial neural networks (ANNs) using a meta-learning approach. As ANNs optimized weights for a series of tasks, they concurrently meta-learned layer-wise plasticity and sparsity parameters. This approach enhanced the computational efficiency of ANNs, promoting hidden activation sparsity while benefitting task performance. Meta-learning also gave rise to a brain-like hierarchical organization, with higher layers displaying faster plasticity and a sparser, more pattern-separated neural code than lower layers. Early layers peaked early in their plasticity and stabilized, whereas higher layers continued to develop and maintained elevated plasticity over time, mirroring empirical developmental trajectories. Moreover, when trained on dual tasks imposing competing demands for item discrimination and categorization, ANNs with parallel pathways developed distinct representational and plasticity profiles, convergent with the distinct properties observed empirically across intra-hippocampal pathways. These results suggest that the macroscale organization and development of heterogeneous learning subsystems in the brain may emerge in part from optimizing biological variables that govern plasticity and sparsity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

How does the brain use such error signals for learning? While global error signals can be useful, their ability to learn complex computation at the scale observed in the brain is lacking. In comparison, more local, neuron-specific error signals enable superior performance, but their computation and propagation remain unclear. Motivated by the breakthrough of deep learning, this has inspired the  backpropagation and the brain hypothesis, i.e. that the brain implements a form of the error backpropagation algorithm.

In this work, we introduce a biologically motivated, multi-area cortical microcircuit model, implementing error backpropagation under consideration of recent physiological evidence. We model populations of cortical pyramidal cells acting as representation and error neurons, with bio-plausible local and inter-area connectivity, guided by experimental observations of connectivity of the primate visual cortex. In our model, all information transfer is biologically motivated, inference and learning occur without phases, and network dynamics demonstrably approximate those of error backpropagation.

We show the capabilities of our model on a wide range of benchmarks, and compare to other models, such as dendritic hierarchical predictive coding. In particular, our model addresses shortcomings of other theories in terms of scalability to many cortical areas. Finally, we make concrete predictions, which differentiate it from other theories, and which can be tested in experiment.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""225643;""},{""name"":""Volkswagen Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03bsmfz84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

Despite these limitations, phytoplasmas, which are parasitic, insect-transmitted plant pathogens maintain a diverse arsenal of secreted effectors that manipulate both plant and insect hosts to promote infection and transmission. These effectors can suppress immunity and reprogram plant development, including witchs broom and leaf-like flowers, through ubiquitin-independent degradation of key transcription factors. However, how phytoplasmas diversify and maintain these effectors in the absence of frequent genetic exchange remains unclear. To address this, we analysed the effectoromes of 239 phytoplasma genomes and identified a diverse set of secreted proteins, which we designated as Phytoplasma-Associated Molecular Effectors (PhAMEs). We found that PhAMEs targeting evolutionarily conserved and structurally constrained surfaces of host proteins are widespread across phytoplasmas. These effectors adopt compact, efficient folds. They often function as molecular scaffolds with dual interaction surfaces capable of linking host proteins or integrating signalling pathways. Such scaffolding PhAMEs have evolved multiple times independently, providing clear evidence of convergent evolution. Despite severe genomic constrains imposed by genome reduction and limited HGT, gene duplications, interface variations, domain fusions, and repeat expansions have helped the shaping effector fold and diversity. While the overall effector repertoire of phytoplasmas appeared largely unique, some PhAME domains share similarities with proteins from other mollicutes and pathogens. Collectively, our findings shed light on how genome-reduced bacteria innovate molecular functions and offer insights into phytoplasma biology, effector evolution, and host-pathogen dynamics. They also lay the groundwork for protein engineering approaches aimed at discovering or designing novel biomolecules with biotechnological potential.","[{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) EPSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X024415/1;""},{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) BBSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BBS/E/J/000PR9797;""},{""name"":""John Innes Centre"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""John Innes Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04kg99k11"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Gatsby Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

A previous study identified a population of cells in the proventriculus which incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of DNA synthesis, and proposed that these cycling cells are multipotent stem cells that replace dying cells elsewhere in the tissue. Here, we re-investigate these cycling cells and find that they do not undergo mitosis, do not generate clonal lineages, and do not proliferate in response to tissue damage, and are therefore not stem cells. Instead, we find that these cells continually endoreplicate throughout the flys life, increasing their ploidy and cell volume, while at the same time nearby cells are lost into the gut lumen in an age-dependent process. These cells play a critical role in the synthesis of peritrophic membrane components, and we show that when endocycling in these cells is experimentally increased or decreased, nuclear and cellular volume as well as peritrophic membrane synthesis is concomitantly enhanced or reduced. Further, we show that blocking endocycling in these cells leads to functional defects in the peritrophic membrane, ultimately leading to increased susceptibility to orally infectious bacteria. Altogether, we show that continual endocycling of these cells is critical for maintaining tissue size and function over the course of the adult lifespan.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R24 OD031952;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

Upon activation, they oligomerize into inflammasome-like resistosomes to initiate immune signaling, yet the dynamics of resistosome assembly remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the virulence effector AVRcap1b from the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans suppresses immune activation by directly engaging oligomerization intermediates of the tomato helper NLR SlNRC3. Cryo-EM structures of SlNRC3 in AVRcap1b-bound and unbound states reveal that AVRcap1b bridges multiple protomers, stabilizing a stalled intermediate and preventing formation of a functional resistosome. Leveraging AVRcap1b as a molecular tool, we also capture an additional SlNRC3 resistosome intermediate showing that assembly proceeds in a stepwise manner from dissociated monomers. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized vulnerability in NLR activation and reveal a pathogen strategy that disrupts immune complex assembly. This work advances mechanistic understanding of resistosome formation and uncovers a previously unrecognized facet of pathogen-plant coevolution.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/V002937/1;BB/Y002997/1;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/Y032187/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

Flowering shoot (inflorescence) architecture varies significantly across plant families and is a key target of genetic engineering efforts in many crops1-4. Asteraceae (sunflower family), comprising 10% of flowering plants, all have capitula, a novel inflorescence that mimics a single flower5,6. Asteraceae capitula are highly diverse but are thought to have evolved once via unknown mechanisms7,8. During capitulum development, shoot stem cells undergo prolonged proliferation to accommodate the formation of intersecting spirals of flowers (florets) along the disk-shaped head9,10. Here we show that capitulum evolution paralleled decreases in CLAVATA3 (CLV3) peptide signaling, a conserved repressor of stem cell proliferation. We trace this to novel amino acid changes in the mature CLV3 peptide which decrease receptor binding and downstream transcriptional outputs. Using genetically tractable Asteraceae models, we show that reversion of CLV3 to a more active form impairs Asteraceae stem cell regulation and capitulum development. Additionally, we trace the evolution of CLV3 and its receptors across the Asterales allowing inferences on capitulum evolution within this lineage. Our findings reveal novel mechanisms driving evolutionary innovation in plant reproduction and suggest new approaches for genetic engineering in crop species.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM119614;""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IOS-1546837;IOS-1906389;IOS-2214473;IOS-2214472;DBI-2319905;""},{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_204526;""},{""name"":""Research Council of Finland"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""341774;""},{""name"":""Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03vxy9y38"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799

Globally, these viruses have caused mass mortalities in captive and wild avian and mammalian populations, including terrestrial and marine mammals. H5N1 has been the dominant subtype, and whilst incursions have overlapped temporally, occurrences have often been spatially distinct. Here, we report the detection of a mortality event in wild birds on the Norfolk coastline in the east of England, where H5N1 HPAIV was detected in five Great Black-backed Gulls (Larus marinus) and a Northern Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis). Interestingly, at the same site, and as part of the same mortality event, a total of 17 Great Black-backed Gulls, one Herring Gull (Larus argentatus), one Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula arctica) and one Northern Fulmar tested positive for H5N5 HPAIV. Additionally, H5N5 was also detected in 17 co-located Grey Seal carcases (Halichoerus grypus). The H5N1 HPAIV from an infected bird belonged to genotype DI.2, closely related to contemporaneous detections in GB wild birds and poultry. In contrast, all H5N5 HPAIVs from birds and seals were genotype I with a 22-amino acid stalk deletion in NA and the 627K polymorphism in PB2. This represents the first recorded instance in GB of two subtypes being detected within the same avian population at the same location. It is also the first mass detection of HPAIV H5N5 in mammals within GB. Potential infection mechanisms are discussed.","[{""name"":""DEFRA"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SE2230, SV3032, SV3400, SE2227, OMO402;""},{""name"":""BBSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/Y007271/1;""},{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101084171;""},{""name"":""NERC Environmental Bioinformatics Centre"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03rjhjc18"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NE/Y006194/1;""},{""name"":""UKRI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/W009404/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755468551799
