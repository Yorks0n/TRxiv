Low education is frequently pointed to as a potential key factor, due to its robust relationship with dementia risk. Impact of education is notoriously difficult to assess, however, because of associations with multiple other risk and protective factors, and large population-representative samples are required to tease the relationships apart. Here, we studied 207,814 Norwegian men born between 1950 and 1959 who underwent compulsory cognitive testing during military conscription as young adults, to systematically test associations of education, cognition, and other potentially important factors. While low education was associated with increased risk for dementia diagnosis (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.37, CI: 1.17-1.60), this association was fully explained by earlier cognitive test scores (HR = 1.08, CI: .91-1.28). In contrast, low cognitive score was associated with double risk of later dementia diagnosis, even when taking education into account (HR = 2.00, CI: 1.65-2.42). This relationship survived controlling for early-life socioeconomic status and was replicated within pairs of brothers. The latter finding suggests that genetic and environmental factors shared within families, such as common genetics, parental education, childhood socioeconomic status, or other shared experiences, cannot account for the association. Rather, independent, non-familial factors are more important. In contrast, within-family factors accounted for the relationship between low education and diagnosis risk. In conclusion, implementing measures to increase cognitive function in childhood and adolescence appears to be a more promising strategy for reducing dementia burden.","NA","medrxiv",1718748331323

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1718748331323

During foraging as well as during sleep, population activity drifted continuously and unidirectionally along a one-dimensional manifold. Boundaries between events were associated with discrete shifts in state space, suggesting that LEC dynamics directly reflect event segmentation. During tasks with a recurring temporal structure, activity traveled additionally in directions orthogonal to the flow of drift, enabling the LEC population to multiplex event information across different timescales. Taken together, these results identify a hierarchically organized neural coding scheme for segmenting and organizing events in time.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1718748331323

While protein localization in the thermophilic model archaeon S. acidocaldarius has been achieved using antibodies with fluorescent probes in fixed cells, the use of thermostable fluorescent proteins in thermophilic archaea has so far been unsuccessful. Given the significance of live protein localization in the field of archaeal cell biology, we aimed to identify fluorescent proteins for use in S. acidocaldarius. To achieve this, we expressed various previously published and optimized thermostable fluorescent proteins along with fusion proteins of interest and analyzed the cells using flow cytometry and (thermo-) fluorescent microscopy. Of the tested proteins, Thermal Green Protein (TGP) exhibited the brightest fluorescence when expressed in Sulfolobus cells. By optimizing the linker between TGP and a protein of interest, we could additionally successfully fuse proteins with minimal loss of fluorescence. TGP-CdvB and TGP-PCNA1 fusions displayed localization patterns consistent with previous immunolocalization experiments. These initial results in protein localization in S. acidocaldarius at high temperatures, combined with recent advancements in thermomicroscopy, open new avenues in the field of archaeal cell biology. This progress finally enables localization experiments in thermophilic archaea, which have so far been limited to mesophilic organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

The power to detect a trait-associated variant in GWAS is a function of frequency and effect size --- but for traits under selection, the effect size of a variant determines the strength of selection against it, constraining its frequency. To account for GWAS ascertainment, we propose studying the joint distribution of allele frequencies across populations, conditional on the frequencies in the GWAS cohort. Before considering these conditional frequency spectra, we first characterized the impact of selection and non-equilibrium demography on allele frequency dynamics forwards and backwards in time. We then used these results to understand conditional frequency spectra under realistic human demography. Finally, we investigated empirical conditional frequency spectra for GWAS variants associated with 106 complex traits, finding compelling evidence for either stabilizing or purifying selection. Our results provide insight into polygenic score portability and other properties of variants ascertained with GWAS, highlighting the utility of conditional frequency spectra.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

Therefore, the abundance variation of regulatory proteins across unstimulated single cells can be associatively linked with their response to stimulation. Here we developed an approach that leverages this association across individual cells and nuclei to systematically identify potential regulators of biological processes, followed by targeted validation. Specifically, we applied this approach to identify regulators of nucleocytoplasmic protein transport in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To this end, we quantified the proteomes of 3,412 individual nuclei, sampling the dynamic response to LPS treatment, and linking functional variability to proteomic variability. Minutes after the stimulation, the protein transport in individual nuclei correlated strongly with the abundance of known protein transport regulators, thus revealing the impact of natural protein variability on functional cellular response. We found that simple biophysical constraints, such as the quantity of nuclear pores, partially explain the variability in LPS-induced nucleocytoplasmic transport. Among the many proteins newly identified to be associated with the response, we selected 16 for targeted validation by knockdown. The knockdown phenotypes confirmed the inferences derived from natural protein and functional variation of single nuclei, thus demonstrating the potential of (sub-)single-cell proteomics to infer functional regulation. We expect this approach to generalize to broad applications and enhance the functional interpretability of single-cell omics data.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

Obtaining targets at sufficient purity and scale typically requires the screening of several protein variants and expression hosts. Existing cloning strategies allow to produce constructs for co-expression of proteins, but are often time-consuming, labour-intensive, host-specific, or involving error-prone assembly steps. Here we present a unique set of vectors together with a novel assembly strategy designed to overcome these limitations. It allows for the generation of expression constructs for multi-subunit protein complexes for various hosts in a single cloning step. Its modular nature allows the system to be easily extended to target additional expression hosts or to include new tags or regulatory sequences. As a proof of principle, we present the parallel construction of expression vectors for several Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes, allowing us to devise strategies for the recombinant production of these targets in bacteria, insect cells, and human cells, respectively.

While the molecular and cellular effects arising from experience with drugs like cocaine are increasingly well understood, the mechanisms that sculpt NAc ensemble participation are largely unknown. Here, we leveraged unbiased single-nucleus transcriptional profiling to identify expression of the secreted glycoprotein Reelin (encoded by the Reln gene) as a marker of cocaine-activated neuronal ensembles within the rat NAc. Multiplexed in situ detection confirmed selective expression of the immediate early gene Fos in Reln+ neurons after cocaine experience, and also revealed enrichment of Reln mRNA in Drd1+ medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in both the rat and human brain. Using a novel CRISPR interference strategy enabling selective Reln knockdown in the adult NAc, we observed altered expression of genes linked to calcium signaling, emergence of a transcriptional trajectory consistent with loss of cocaine sensitivity, and a striking decrease in MSN intrinsic excitability. At the behavioral level, loss of Reln prevented cocaine locomotor sensitization, abolished cocaine place preference memory, and decreased cocaine self-administration behavior. Together, these results identify Reelin as a critical mechanistic link between ensemble participation and cocaine-induced behavioral adaptations.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

Here, we identify a unique molecular battle between the classical biotype of Vibrio cholerae and virulent phages ICP1, ICP2, and ICP3. We show that classical biotype strains resist almost all isolates of these phages due to a 25-kb genomic island harboring several putative anti-phage systems. We observed that one of these systems, Nezha, encoding SIR2-like and helicase proteins, inhibited the replication of all three phages. Bacterial SIR2-like enzymes degrade the essential metabolic coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), thereby preventing replication of the invading phage. In support of this mechanism, we identified one phage isolate, ICP1_2001, which circumvents Nezha by encoding two putative NAD+ regeneration enzymes. By restoring the NAD+ pool, we hypothesize that this system antagonizes Nezha without directly interacting with either protein and should be able to antagonize other anti-phage systems that deplete NAD+.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

One molecule consistently referenced as a delineator of a putative immunosuppressive M2 state is the surface protein CD206. We thus made a novel conditional CD206 (Mrc1) knock-in mouse to specifically visualize and/or deplete CD206+ M2-like TAMs and assess their correspondence with pro-tumoral immunity. Early, but not late depletion of CD206+ macrophages and monocytes (here, Mono/Macs) led to an indirect loss of a key anti-tumor network of NK cells, conventional type I dendritic cells (cDC1) and CD8 T cells. Among myeloid cells, we found that the CD206+ TAMs are the primary producers of CXCL9, and able to differentially attract activated CD8 T cells. In contrast, a population of stress-responsive TAMs (Hypoxic or Spp1+) and immature monocytes, which lack CD206 expression and become prominent following early depletion, expressed markedly diminished levels of CXCL9. Those NK and CD8 T cells which enter CD206-depleted tumors express vastly reduced levels of the corresponding receptor Cxcr3, the cDC1-attracting chemokine Xcl1 and cDC1 growth factor Flt3l transcripts. Consistent with the loss of this critical network, early CD206+ TAM depletion decreased tumor control by antigen specific CD8 T cells in mice. Likewise, in humans, the CD206Replete, but not the CD206Depleted Mono/Mac gene signature correlated robustly with CD8 T cell, NK cell and stimulatory cDC1 gene signatures and transcriptomic signatures skewed towards CD206Replete Mono/Macs associated with better survival. Together, these findings negate the unqualified classification of CD206+ M2-like macrophages as immunosuppressive by illuminating contexts for their role in organizing a critical tumor-reactive archetype of immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

Control of gene expression by GPCRs has been studied almost exclusively at the transcriptional level, neglecting an extensive amount of regulation that takes place translationally. Hence, little is known about the nature and mechanisms of gene-specific post-transcriptional regulation downstream of receptor activation. Here, we apply an unbiased multiomics approach to delineate an extensive translational regulatory program initiated by the prototypical beta2-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2-AR) and provide mechanistic insights into how these processes are orchestrated. Using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), we identify nearly 120 novel gene targets of adrenergic receptor activity which expression is exclusively regulated at the level of translation. We next show that all translational changes are induced selectively by endosomal {beta}2-ARs. We further report that this proceeds through activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Specifically, within the set of translational GPCR targets we discover significant enrichment of genes with 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, a gene class classically known to be translationally regulated by mTOR. We then demonstrate that endosomal {beta}2-ARs are required for mTOR activation and subsequent mTOR-dependent TOP mRNA translation. Together, this comprehensive analysis of drug-induced translational regulation establishes a critical role for location-biased GPCR signaling in fine-tuning the cellular protein landscape.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

The mitotic spindle, the self-organized microtubule structure driving chromosome segregation, scales in size with the available cytoplasm. Yet, the relationship between spindle size and chromosome movement remains poorly understood. Here, we address how the movement of chromosomes changes during the cleavage divisions of the Drosophila blastoderm. We show that the speed of chromosome separation gradually decreases during the 4 nuclear divisions of the blastoderm. This reduction in speed is accompanied by a similar reduction in the length of the spindle, thus ensuring that these two quantities are tightly linked. Using a combination of genetic and quantitative imaging approaches, we find that two processes contribute to controlling the speed at which chromosomes move at mitotic exit: the activity of molecular motors important for microtubule depolymerization and the cell cycle oscillator. Specifically, we found that the levels of Klp10A, Klp67A, and Klp59C, three kinesin-like proteins important for microtubule depolymerization, contribute to setting the speed of chromosome separation. This observation is supported by quantification of microtubule dynamics indicating that poleward flux rate scales with the length of the spindle. Perturbations of the cell cycle oscillator using heterozygous mutants of mitotic kinases and phosphatases revealed that the duration of anaphase increases during the blastoderm cycles and is the major regulator of chromosome velocity. Thus, our work suggests a potential link between the biochemical rate of mitotic exit and the forces exerted by the spindle.

Research on host-pathogen interactions and host immunity in various leafy greens benefits from advanced biotechnological tools. The absence of specialised tools for spinach, however, constrains our understanding of spinach immunity. Here, we explored the potential of Type III Secretion System (T3SS)-mediated delivery to study the activity of pathogen effectors in spinach. We identified the Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (DC3000) polymutant D36E, which lacks 36 known T3SS effectors (T3Es), as a promising T3SS-dependent effector delivery system in spinach. Unlike DC3000, which causes visual disease symptoms on spinach, D36E did not induce visible disease symptoms. Using D36E effector delivery, we screened 28 known DC3000 T3Es individually on spinach for effects on disease symptom development, bacterial proliferation reflecting bacterial virulence, and ROS bursts as a proxy for early immune responses. All three assays identified T3Es AvrE1 and HopM1 as crucial determinants of DC3000-like infection on spinach. Additionally, we observed that the T3E HopAD1 strongly suppressed ROS production in spinach. We present the first experimental evidence of plant pathogen effector activities in spinach. By establishing the D36E-effector delivery system in spinach, we pave the way for high-throughput effector studies on spinach. This system provides a critical link between genomics-based effector predictions in spinach pathogens and experimental validation, which is a crucial step for knowledge-driven resistance breeding in non-model crops like spinach.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

Despite years of study, however, how Notch induces the transcription of its target genes remains unclear. Here, we comprehensively examined the response to human Notch1 across a time course of activation using genomic assays of nascent RNA and chromatin accessibility. These data revealed that Notch induces target gene transcription primarily by releasing paused RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), in contrast to prevailing models suggesting that Notch acts by promoting chromatin accessibility. Indeed, we found that open chromatin is established at Notch-responsive regulatory elements prior to Notch signaling, through SWI/SNF-mediated remodeling. Notch activation, however, elicited no further chromatin opening at these loci. Together, these studies reveal that the nuclear response to Notch signaling is dictated by the pre-existing chromatin state and RNAPII distribution at time of signal activation.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

Responses to sub-lethal abiotic stress combinations are complex and often distinct from responses to individual stresses and remain poorly understood. Investigating traits and molecular factors mediating acclimation to stress combinations is essential for the development of climate change-resilient field crops. Here, we studied the morphological, physiological, and molecular responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to i) co-occurring high temperature and drought and ii) flooding sequentially followed by drought, both of which have increased in frequency due to climate change. A set of 15 physiological and morphological traits were assessed during single and combined stresses. By combining these comprehensive trait analyses with transcriptome characterization, we established the generally additive effects of simultaneous or sequential stresses on plant morphology and physiology compared to the corresponding individual stresses. Although drought had a mild effect in both stress combinations, a unique transcriptome signature emerged upon combination with high temperature simultaneously or flooding sequentially. Molecular processes identified as important for multi-stress resilience included plastid-nucleus communication, ABA signaling and photo-acclimation. Based on the RNA-seq data, a set of 39 genes was identified as potential multi-stress response regulators. Mutants were tested to validate their contribution to plant survival and phenotypic acclimation under combined stress. We confirmed the involvement of several genes in regulating phenotypic acclimation traits. Among the novel identified factors are EARLY FLOWERING 6 (ELF6) and ARABIDOPSIS TOXICOS EN LEVADURA (ATL80), with significant effects on plant growth, leaf development and plant survival (wilting) during high-temperature drought and post-submergence drought respectively.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

To reconcile this discrepancy, we investigated the 3D structure and properties of the nuclear interior using experiments and computer simulations. We reveal a novel mechanism where newly synthesized RNA interacts with SAF-A (scaffold attachment factor A, or HNRNPU), forming interconnected microgels degraded by the exonuclease XRN2, leading to dynamic cycles of gelation and fluidization. This emergent microgel network depends on transcription, and is disrupted by SAF-A depletion. It also decreases protein mobility and regulates chromatin compaction by modulating microphase separation, thereby opening transcriptionally active regions. This tunable intranuclear network exhibits scale-dependent fluid- and solid-like features, that we suggest may regulate transcription by controlling access to regulatory proteins and polymerases.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

Subgroup analysis based on user gene panels enhances comparisons. BiomiX implements MOFA automatically, selecting the optimal MOFA model to discriminate the two cohorts being compared while providing interpretation tools for the discriminant MOFA factors. The interpretation relies on innovative bibliography research on Pubmed, which provides the articles most related to the discriminant factor contributors. The interpretation is also supported by clinical data correlation with the discriminant MOFA factors and pathways analyses of the top factor contributors. The integration of single and multi-omics analysis in a standalone tool, together with the implementation of MOFA and its interpretability by literature, constitute a step forward in the multi-omics landscape in line with the FAIR data principles.

It has recently been found that odour representations in the piriform cortex (PCx) can also contain information about their spatial context. However, the precise origins of this information within the brain and its subsequent integration into the microcircuitry of the PCx remains unknown. In this study, we focus on the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) as a candidate for carrying spatial contextual information to the PCx, to investigate how it affects the PCx microcircuit and its response to olfactory inputs. Utilising mice brain slices, we performed patch clamp recordings targeting both superficial (SP) and deep (DP) pyramidal neurons, as well as parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) inhibitory interneurons. Concurrently, we optogenetically stimulated excitatory LEC projections to study their impact on PCx activity. We found that LEC inputs are heterogeneously distributed in the PCx microcircuit, evoking larger excitatory currents in SP and PV neurons compared to DP and SOM neurons, respectively, due to their higher monosynaptic connectivity. Moreover, LEC inputs exert a differential effect on the inhibitory circuits, activating PV while suppressing SOM interneurons. We further studied the interaction among LEC inputs and the sensory afferent signals originating from the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) onto the PCx. Our findings demonstrated that both SP and DP neurons show a general increase in their spiking response when LEC and LOT are simultaneously activated. Notably, DP neurons exhibit a sharpening of their response attributable to LEC-induced inhibition that effectively suppresses the delayed spikes evoked by LOT stimulation. These observations suggest a regulatory mechanism whereby LEC inputs inhibit recurrent activity by activating PV interneurons. Our results show that LEC afferents reconfigure PCx activity and contribute to the understanding of how odour objects are formed within the PCx integrating both olfactory and contextual information.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

Here we examined the degree to which NRC proteins from multiple Solanaceae species are sensitive to suppression by SS15 and tested hypotheses about adaptive evolution of the binding interface between the SS15 inhibitor and NRC proteins. Whereas all tested orthologs of NRC2 were inhibited by SS15, some natural variants of NRC1 and NRC3 are insensitive to SS15 suppression. Ancestral sequence reconstruction combined with functional assays revealed that NRC3 transitioned from an ancestral suppressed form to an insensitive one over 19 million years ago. Our analyses revealed the evolutionary trajectory of coevolution between a parasite inhibitor and its NLR immune receptor target, identifying key evolutionary transitions in helper NLRs that counteract this inhibition. This work reveals a distinct type of gene-for-gene interaction between parasite or pathogen immunosuppressors and host immune receptors that contrasts with the coevolution between AVR effectors and immune receptors.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

Here, we used a whole genome alignment between two maize genotypes to identify polymorphic structural variants and then genotyped a large maize diversity panel for these variants using short-read sequencing data. We characterized variation of SVs within the panel and identified SV polymorphisms that are associated with life history traits and genotype-by-environment interactions. While most of the SVs associated with traits contained TEs, only one of the SV's boundaries clearly matched TE breakpoints indicative of a TE insertion, whereas the other polymorphisms were likely caused by deletions.

Muscle biopsies were collected from the rested and the exercised leg before, immediately after, as well as 60 and 180 minutes after EAA intake. Muscle samples were analyzed for amino acid concentrations, muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and associated anabolic signaling. Following exercise, peak plasma levels of EAA and leucine were similar between groups, but the area under the curve was ~11% and ~28% lower in Young (p<0.01).

Here, we employed genome-wide association studies through pooled template sequencing to compare four eco-geographically different populations of the major vector, Anopheles funestus, across a South North transect in Cameroon, aiming to identify genomic signatures of adaptive responses to insecticides. Our analysis revealed limited population structure within Northern and Central regions (FST<0.02), suggesting extensive gene flow, while populations from the Littoral/Coastal region exhibited more distinct genetic patterns (FST>0.049). Greater genetic differentiation was observed at known resistance-associated loci, resistance-to-pyrethroids 1 (rp1) (2R chromosome) and CYP9 (X chromosome), with varying signatures of positive selection across populations. Allelic variation between variants underscores the pervasive impact of selection pressures, with rp1 variants more prevalent in Central and Northern populations (FST>0.3), and the CYP9 associated variants more pronounced in the Littoral/Coastal region (FST =0.29). Evidence of selective sweeps was supported by negative Tajimas D and reduced genetic diversity in all populations, particularly in Central (Elende) and Northern (Tibati) regions. Genomic variant analysis identified novel missense mutations and signatures of complex genomic alterations such as duplications, deletions, transposable element (TE) insertions, and chromosomal inversions, all associated with selective sweeps.

However, to be included in national NCS inventories, governments must first quantify the kelp-derived carbon stocks and fluxes leading to carbon sequestration. Here, we present a blueprint for assessing the national carbon sequestration capacity of kelp forests in which data synthesis and Bayesian hierarchical modelling enable estimates of kelp forest carbon production, storage, and export capacity from limited data. Applying this blueprint to Canadas extensive coastline, we find kelp forests store an estimated 1.4 Tg C in short-term biomass and produce 3.1 Tg C yr-1 with modest carbon fluxes to the deep ocean. Arctic kelps had the highest carbon stocks and production capacity, while Pacific kelps had greater carbon fluxes overall due to their higher productivity and export rates. Our transparent, reproducible blueprint represents an important step towards accurate carbon accounting for kelp forests.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

Different ligands/agonists upon binding to the same GPCR can invoke contrasting behavioral effects. Key examples are the divergent signaling signatures evoked by hallucinogenic versus non-hallucinogenic agonists at the serotonin2A (5-HT2A) receptor.7 We asked whether probing PI(4,5)P2 dynamics could uncover the earliest of differences in signaling that arise upon distinct ligands binding to the 5-HT2A receptor. The challenge was to track rapid < 1 min PI(4,5)P2 dynamics in living systems.8 Here we report a computationally-designed, rapid-response, reversible, photo-stable, fluorescent probe that permeates living cells, neurons, and a multicellular organism within few min of direct incubation and distinctly visualizes PI(4,5)P2 pools, in an optical imaging setup. This novel probe facilitates rapid tracking of seconds to sub-minute PI(4,5)P2 dynamics that arise from ligand-binding at the serotonergic receptor. Our results reveal that a hallucinogenic ligand at the 5-HT2A receptor leads to a slower rate of PI(4,5)P2 depletion when compared to a non-hallucinogenic ligand, but has a sustained longer effect. The ability of our designer chemical probe in timing early seconds-minute timescale lipid dynamics in living cells opens avenues for tracking early time-point molecular events in neuronal response to chemical and physical stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

One promising avenue to resolve the genetic basis of complex traits is through evolve-and-resequence experiments, in which laboratory populations are exposed to some selective pressure and trait-contributing loci are identified by extreme frequency changes over the course of the experiment. However, small laboratory populations will experience substantial random genetic drift, and it is difficult to determine whether selection played a roll in a given allele frequency change. Predicting how much allele frequencies change under drift and selection had remained an open problem well into the 21st century, even those contributing to simple, monogenic traits. Recently, there have been efforts to apply the path integral, a method borrowed from physics, to solve this problem. So far, this approach has been limited to genic selection, and is therefore inadequate to capture the complexity of quantitative, highly polygenic traits that are commonly studied. Here we extend one of these path integral methods, the perturbation approximation, to selection scenarios that are of interest to quantitative genetics. In particular, we derive analytic expressions for the transition probability (i.e., the probability that an allele will change in frequency from x, to y in time t) of an allele contributing to a trait subject to stabilizing selection, as well as that of an allele contributing to a trait rapidly adapting to a new phenotypic optimum. We use these expressions to characterize the use of allele frequency change to test for selection, as well as explore optimal design choices for evolve-and-resequence experiments to uncover the genetic architecture of polygenic traits under selection.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

Bacteria carry defence systems which defend them against genetic parasites, but how effective these are against plasmid conjugation is poorly understood. Here, we study to what extent Restriction-Modification (RM) systems (by far the most prevalent bacterial defence systems) act as a barrier against plasmids. Using 10 different RM systems and 13 natural plasmids conferring antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli, we uncovered variation in defence efficiency ranging from none to 105-fold protection. Further analysis revealed genetic features of plasmids that explain the observed variation in defence levels. First, the number of RM recognition sites present on the plasmids generally correlates with defence levels, with higher numbers of sites being associated with stronger defence. Secondly, some plasmids encode methylases that protect against restriction activity. Finally, we show that a high number of plasmids in our collection encode anti-restriction genes that provide protection against several types of RM systems. Overall, our results show that it is common for plasmids to encode anti-RM strategies, and that, as a consequence, RM systems form only a weak barrier for plasmid transfer by conjugation.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

Two congeners each have 8 haploid chromosomes, results of two independent fusion events from the karyotype of their most recent common ancestor. The largest number of novel fusions is in the supposedly most plesiomorphic clade Lepidopleurida, and the chitonid Liolophura japonica has a partial genome duplication, extending the known occurrence of large-scale gene duplication within Mollusca.

These interactions can be characterized as being either redundancy or synergy-dominated by the heuristic O-information [1]. Though the O-information can be decomposed into local values to measure the synergy-redundancy dominance at each point in a time series [2] no such analysis of fMRI dynamics has been carried out. Here we analyze the moment-to-moment synergy and redundancy dominance of the fMRI BOLD signal during rest for 95 unrelated subjects. We present results from several interaction sizes. The whole brain is rarely synergy-dominated, with some subjects never experiencing a whole-brain synergistic moment. Randomly sampled subsets of many sizes reveal that subsets that are the most redundancy dominated on average exhibit both the most synergistic and most redundant time points. Exhaustive calculation of the optimally synergistic and optimally redundant triads further emphasizes this finding, with recurrent nodes frequently belonging to a single coherent functional system. We find that when a triad is momentarily synergistic, it is often split between two instantaneously co-fluctuating communities, but is collectively co-fluctuating when it is momentarily redundant. After optimizing for synergy and redundancy in subsets of size five to seventy-five, we show that this effect is consistent across interaction sizes. Additionally, we find notable temporal structure in all optimized redundant and synergistic subsets: higher order redundant and synergistic interactions change smoothly in time and recur more than expected by chance.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

It is a dynamic structure that assembles and disassembles in response to intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli while maintaining remarkable stability and tightly controlled length. Although cilium assembly is well-understood, less is known about the molecular players and pathways governing their stability, length and disassembly. Here, we elucidated the function of Ccdc66, a microtubule-associated protein linked to ciliopathies, in cilium maintenance and disassembly in mouse epithelial cells. We found that Ccdc66 depletion disrupts cilium disassembly, length and stability, but does not affect assembly in these cells. Live imaging of these processes revealed that cilia in Ccdc66-depleted cells frequently fluctuate in length and exhibit increased ectocytosis from the cilium tip. Phenotypic rescue experiments and in vitro microtubule stabilization assays showed that Ccdc66 mediates these functions via regulating the stability of microtubules. Temporal proximity mapping of CCDC66 identified potential new regulators and molecular pathways involved in cilium disassembly. Additionally, depletion of CCDC66 compromised Hedgehog and Wnt pathway activation and disrupted epithelial cell organization and polarity in two-dimensional and three-dimensional cultures.

Although numerous studies have isolated beneficial root bacteria, few have combined bacterial metabarcoding with culture-based techniques to identify novel biofertiliser candidates. In a two-pronged approach, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to define the core root microbiome of the model cereal plant, Brachypodium distachyon, grown in four distinct soils. From 7,042 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) detected in root fractions, only 40 ASVs were common at a prevalence of 80%.

Females are 2-3 times more likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis while males' progression is faster with greater severity. We investigate the potential molecular mechanisms underlying these sex-differential clinical traits analysing transcriptomic data at single cell resolution. 48,919 central nervous system and 336,934 peripheral immune cells, covering the multiple sclerosis spectrum, enabled us to provide the comprehensive landscape of sex differences by cell type.

Complete results can be explored in the user-friendly interactive webtool https://bioinfo.cipf.es/cbl-atlas-ms/.

In the inflammatory-predominant forms, female immune cells present an inflammatory core driven by the AP-1 transcription factor, while male adaptive immune cells exhibit higher mitochondrial impairment. Conversely, larger differences are reported in CD8+ T cells, with females displaying homeostasis recovery patterns and males exhibiting cytolytic profiles.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

To investigate how this specificity arises within topologically associated domains (TAD), we performed allele-specific genome editing of sequences surrounding the Lefty1 and Lefty2 paralogs in mouse embryonic stem cells. The Lefty genes arose from a tandem duplication event and these genes interact with each other in chromosome conformation capture assays which place these genes within the same TAD. Despite their physical proximity, we demonstrate that the two Lefty genes are primarily regulated by separate enhancer elements. Through CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletions to remove the intervening chromatin between the Lefty genes, we reveal a distance-dependent dosage effect of the Lefty2 enhancer on Lefty1 expression. These findings indicate a role for both discrete CTCF bound regions of the genome and chromatin distance in insulating gene expression domains in the Lefty locus in the absence of architectural insulation.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

Although the exact mechanisms underlying its maturation remain elusive, spontaneous activity patterns in the retina, known as retinal waves, have been shown to contribute to this developmental process. Retinal waves exhibit complex spatio-temporal statistics and contribute to the establishment of circuit connectivity and function in the visual system, including the formation of retinotopic maps and the refinement of receptive fields in downstream areas such as the thalamus and visual cortex. Recent work in mice has shown that retinal waves have statistical features matching those of natural visual stimuli, such as optic flow, suggesting that they could prime the visual system for motion processing upon vision onset. Motivated by these findings, we examined whether artificial neural network (ANN) models trained on natural movies show improved performance if pre-trained with retinal waves. We employed the spatio-temporally complex task of next-frame prediction, in which the ANN was trained to predict the next frame based on preceding input frames of a movie. We found that pre-training ANNs with retinal waves enhances the processing of real-world visual stimuli and accelerates learning. Strikingly, even when matching the total training time by merely replacing initial training epochs on naturalistic stimuli with exposure to retinal waves, an ANN trained on retinal waves temporarily outperforms one trained solely on natural movies. Similar to observations made in biological systems, we also found that pre-training with spontaneous activity refines the receptive field of ANN neurons. Overall, our work sheds light on the functional role of spatio-temporally patterned spontaneous activity in the processing of motion in natural scenes, suggesting it acts as a training signal to prepare the developing visual system for adult visual processing.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

Three rationally engineered shortened versions of protocadherin-15 (mini-PCDH15s) amenable for gene therapy have been used to rescue function in USH1F mouse models. Two can successfully or partially rescue hearing, while another one fails. Here we show that despite varying levels of hearing rescue, all three mini-PCDH15 versions can rescue hair-cell mechanotransduction. Negative-stain electron microscopy shows that all three versions form dimers like the wild-type protein, while crystal structures of some engineered fragments show that these can properly fold and bind calcium ions essential for function.

These chromosomes are delayed in congression to the metaphase plate and prone to segregation errors. Yet, their mechanism of congression remains elusive. By using stimulated emission depletion (STED) and lattice light-sheet (LLS) microscopy, here we show that polar chromosomes require a unique congression step to transit across the spindle pole. This step occurs independently of the known congression drivers, including CENP-E, kinetochore dynein, chromokinesins, and actomyosin. Instead, it relies on the pivoting of chromosome-carrying astral microtubules around the centrosome towards the spindle surface. During pivoting, polar chromosomes form complex attachments with astral microtubules that persist throughout the process. By altering the kinesin-5 Eg5/KIF11 activity to reverse, restore, or block spindle elongation, we show that spindle elongation drives the pivoting and dictates its direction and magnitude. We reveal impaired spindle elongation as a major cause of congression defects and segregation errors of polar chromosomes in RPE1 cells after Mps1 kinase inhibition, and in the high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma OVSAHO cells. Increasing spindle elongation efficiency by depleting the kinesin-4 KIF4A rescued polar chromosomes in OVSAHO cells, supporting the causal relationship between spindle elongation and resolution of polar chromosomes. We conclude that polar chromosomes depend on spindle elongation to propel the pivoting of their astral microtubules, enabling their contact with the spindle surface, congression, and proper segregation. In the context of disease, our findings suggest that altering spindle elongation has the potential to modify mitotic errors in certain cancer cells.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

Despite their diversity, different defense pathways share a modular organization, where numerous specificity factors identify diverse targets and common effectors silence them. In the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, which controls selfish elements in the metazoan germline, diverse target RNAs are first identified by complementary base pairing with piRNAs and then silenced by PIWI-clade nucleases via enzymatic cleavage1,3. Such a binary architecture allows the defense systems to be readily adaptable, where new targets can be captured via the innovation of new specificity factors4,5. Thus, our current understanding of genome defense against lineage-specific selfish genes has been largely limited to the evolution of specificity factors, while it remains poorly understood whether other types of innovations are required. Here, we describe a new type of innovation, which escalates the defense capacity of the piRNA pathway to control a recently expanded selfish gene in Drosophila melanogaster. Through an in vivo RNAi screen for repressors of Stellate--a recently evolved and expanded selfish meiotic driver6-8--we discovered a novel defense factor, Trailblazer. Trailblazer is a transcription factor that promotes the expression of two PIWI-clade nucleases, Aub and AGO3, to match Stellate in abundance. Recent innovation in the DNA-binding domain of Trailblazer enabled it to drastically elevate Aub and AGO3 expression in the D. melanogaster lineage, thereby escalating the silencing capacity of the piRNA pathway to control expanded Stellate and safeguard fertility. As copy-number expansion is a recurrent feature of diverse selfish genes across the tree of life9-12, we envision that augmenting the defense capacity to quantitatively match selfish genes is likely a repeatedly employed defense strategy in evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331323

Recent studies have highlighted that bacteria possess a large, rapidly changing arsenal of defense genes and that viruses can neutralize at least some of these genes with matching anti-defenses. However, a broadly applicable approach for discovering the genetic underpinnings of such interactions is missing since typically used methods such as comparative genomics are limited by the rampant horizontal gene transfer and poor annotation of viral and bacterial genes. Here we show that genes that allow the viruses to overcome bacterial defenses can be systematically identified using an interpretable machine-learning approach even when using diverse bacteria-virus infection data. To verify the predictions, we experimentally characterized eight previously unknown anti-defense proteins in viruses specific for Vibrio bacteria and showed that they counteract a wide range of bacterial immune systems, including AbiH, AbiU, Septu, DRT, CBASS, and Retron. The power of our computational approach is highlighted by the identification of anti-defense proteins that inhibit non-homologous defense systems, which we verify for Retron and AbiH. We suggest that the computational prediction based on experimental interactions offers a promising avenue to unravel the genetic mechanisms of co-evolution between bacteria and their viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

However, the precise mechanisms underlying these benefits in the context of Alzheimer disease (AD) remain poorly understood. METHODS: To investigate muscle-to-brain axis signaling in response to amyloid {beta} (A{beta})-induced toxicity, we generated 5xFAD transgenic female mice with enhanced skeletal muscle function (5xFAD;cTFEB;HSACre) at prodromal (4-months old) and late (8-months old) symptomatic stages. RESULTS: Skeletal muscle TFEB overexpression reduced A{beta} plaque accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus at both ages and rescued behavioral neurocognitive deficits in 8-months-old 5xFAD mice. These changes were associated with transcriptional and protein remodeling of neurotrophic signaling and synaptic integrity, partially due to the CNS-targeting myokine prosaposin (PSAP). DISCUSSION: Our findings implicate the muscle-to-brain axis as a novel neuroprotective pathway against amyloid pathogenesis in AD.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

However, such highly dynamic, viscoelastic, mesoscopic, intracellular membraneless bodies can undergo aberrant liquid-to-solid transitions into a range of amyloid-like species. The formation of such pathological assemblies necessitates their clearance by the cellular protein quality control machinery comprising molecular chaperones. Nonetheless, the mechanism underlying the chaperone-mediated regulation of protein homeostasis within biomolecular condensates remains elusive. Here, we present a unique case demonstrating that a heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40), Ydj1, promotes the heterotypic phase separation of intrinsically disordered tau via intermolecular electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Through a diverse array of tools involving high-resolution fluorescence imaging, single-droplet steady-state and picosecond time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, and single-molecule FRET (Forster resonance energy transfer), we elucidate the diverse structural conformations of tau present within phase-separated heterotypic condensates that are otherwise predisposed to aggregation. Our vibrational Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy data show that the presence of Ydj1 in tau-Ydj1 condensates abolishes the formation of amyloid fibrils, unlike tau-only droplets. By sequentially deleting segments, we identify amyloidogenic hexapeptide motifs located in the hydrophobic microtubule-binding region of tau that foster contacts with the peptide-binding regions of Ydj1, promoting the formation of tau-Ydj1 binary condensates. Additionally, we show that the underlying network of interactions governing these condensates can be further tuned by RNA. Our results underscore an intriguing interplay of molecular drivers that govern chaperone-associated phase separation, with broader implications for the chaperoning of a wide range of intrinsically disordered proteins involved in physiology and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

However, it is still not well-known what role spatial and temporal variation in natural selection play in the maintenance of naturally occurring hybrid zones. To identify whether hybridization is adaptive between two closely related monkeyflower species, Mimulus guttatus and Mimulus laciniatus, we performed repeated reciprocal transplants between natural hybrid and pure species populations. We planted parental genotypes along with multiple experimental hybrid generations in a dry (2021) and extremely wet (2023) year in the Sierra Nevada, CA. By taking fine scale environmental measurements, we found that the environment of the hybrid zone is more similar to M. laciniatuss seasonally dry rocky outcrop habitat than M. guttatuss moist meadows. In our transplants hybridization does not appear to be maintained by a consistent fitness advantage of hybrids over parental species in hybrid zones, but rather a lack of strong selection against hybrids. We also found higher fitness of the drought adapted species, M. laciniatus, than M. guttatus in both species habitats, as well as phenotypic selection for M. laciniatus-like traits in the hybrid habitat in the dry year of our experiment. These findings suggest that in this system hybridization might function to introduce drought-adapted traits and genes from M. laciniatus into M. guttatus, specifically in years with limited soil moisture. However, we also find evidence of genetic incompatibilities in second generation hybrids in the wetter year, which may balance a selective advantage of M. laciniatus introgression. Therefore, we find that hybridization in this system is both potentially adaptive and costly, and that the interaction of positive and negative selection likely determines patterns of gene flow between these Mimulus species.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

Employing GSEA, we obtained supporting evidence that HL-60/S4 macrophages are senescent, probably a consequence of enriched TGF{beta} and NOTCH signaling transcripts. There appears to be a reduction of transcripts for heterochromatin, nucleosome formation, and chromatin remodeling phenotypes. In addition, despite upregulated oxidative stress gene transcription, we observed a reduction of DNA damage and repair transcripts. GSEA indicated that transcripts for autophagy, extracellular matrix, and inflammation/inflammasomes are enriched. We also observed that the HL-60/S4 macrophage is enriched for apoptosis gene transcripts, which may promote necrotic death by pyroptosis. The long-term goal of this research direction is to see whether this complex multifaceted phenotypic pattern is shared with other types of macrophages and to determine what mechanisms might exist to coordinate these phenotypic facets within a single cell.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

We aimed to gain deep mechanistic insight into the disease process using bulk and spatial RNA sequencing on tibial and sural nerves recovered from lower leg amputations in a mostly diabetic population. First, our approach comparing mixed sensory and motor tibial and purely sensory sural nerves shows key pathway differences in affected nerves, with distinct immunological features observed in sural nerves. Second, spatial transcriptomics analysis of sural nerves reveals substantial shifts in endothelial and immune cell types associated with severe axonal loss. We also find clear evidence of neuronal gene transcript changes, like PRPH, in nerves with axonal loss suggesting perturbed RNA transport into distal sensory axons. This motivated further investigation into neuronal mRNA localization in peripheral nerve axons generating clear evidence of robust localization of mRNAs such as SCN9A and TRPV1 in human sensory axons. Our work gives new insight into the altered cellular and transcriptomic profiles in human nerves in DPN and highlights the importance of sensory axon mRNA transport as an unappreciated potential contributor to peripheral nerve degeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

However, information about the complex link between vicarious pain and pleasure, observer's perspective taking, and cerebral activity is scarce. To address this knowledge gap, we asked twenty-four, VR-immersed healthy participants to report about pleasant, painful, and neutral stimuli delivered to a virtual hand seen from either a first-person perspective (1PP) or third-person perspective (3PP) while undergoing time and time-frequency EEG recording. Participants experienced a stronger sense of ownership over a virtual hand when they viewed it from a 1PP compared to a 3PP. Furthermore, participants rated pain-inducing and pleasure-inducing stimuli as most unpleasant and pleasant, and as more intense. We observed distinct EEG patterns in early (N2, early posterior negativity- EPN) and late (late positive potential-LPP) event-related potentials, as well as in EEG power. The N2 and EPN components showed higher amplitudes for pain and pleasure stimuli compared to neutral stimuli particularly when seen from a 1PP. Conversely, the LPP component exhibited a smaller amplitude for pleasure stimuli compared to both pain and neutral stimuli. We also found that theta-band power increased and alpha power decreased for pain and pleasure stimuli viewed from a 1PP vs a 3PP perspective. Also, in the ultra-late time-window, we observed a decrease in theta, alpha, and beta-band power specifically associated with pleasure stimuli. Our study provides novel evidence on how perspective taking influences the temporal dynamics of vicarious sensations and on distinct electrocortical markers of observed pain and pleasure.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

Here we show that the future head region in regenerating tissue fragments undergoes multiple instances of extensive stretching and rupture events from the onset of regeneration. These recurring localized tissue deformations arise due to transient contractions of the supracellular ectodermal actomyosin fibers that focus mechanical strain at defect sites. We further show that stabilization of aster-shaped defects is disrupted by perturbations of the Wnt signaling pathway. We propose a closed-loop feedback mechanism promoting head organizer formation, and develop a biophysical model of regenerating Hydra tissues that incorporates a morphogen source activated by mechanical strain and an alignment interaction directing fibers along morphogen gradients. We suggest that this positive feedback loop leads to mechanical strain focusing at defect sites, enhancing local morphogen production and promoting robust organizer formation.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

Polyamines are an abundant class of aliphatic molecules that play essential roles in fundamental cellular processes across the tree of life. Surprisingly, the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to polyamines encountered during infection, and acquisition of a polyamine resistance locus has been implicated in spread of the prominent USA300 methicillin-resistant S. aureus lineage. At present, alternative pathways of polyamine resistance in staphylococci are largely unknown. Here we applied experimental evolution to identify novel mechanisms and consequences of S. aureus adaption when exposed to increasing concentrations of the polyamine spermine. Evolved populations of S. aureus exhibited striking evidence of parallel adaptation, accumulating independent mutations in the potassium transporter genes ktrA and ktrD. Mutations in either ktrA or ktrD are sufficient to confer polyamine resistance and function in an additive manner. Moreover, we find that ktr mutations provide increased resistance to multiple classes of unrelated cationic antibiotics, suggesting a common mechanism of resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis, ktr mutants exhibit alterations in cell surface charge indicative of reduced affinity and uptake of cationic molecules. Finally, we observe that laboratory-evolved ktr mutations are also present in diverse natural S. aureus isolates, suggesting these mutations may contribute to antimicrobial resistance during human infections. Collectively this study identifies a new role for potassium transport in S. aureus polyamine resistance with consequences for susceptibility to both host-derived and clinically-used antimicrobials.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

Wolbachia strains transferred from other insects to mosquitoes can be released to combat dengue transmission by blocking virus replication and spreading through populations, but host fitness costs imposed by Wolbachia, particularly under some environments, can impede spread. We therefore assessed the impact of two Wolbachia strains being released for dengue control (wAlbB and wMelM) on fecundity and egg viability following extended egg retention (12 or 18 d) under laboratory conditions. Egg viability decreased to a greater extent in females carrying wMelM compared to uninfected or wAlbB females. Fertility fully recovered in uninfected females following a second blood meal after laying retained eggs, while wMelM females experienced only partial recovery. Effects of wMelM on egg retention were similar regardless of whether females were crossed to uninfected or wMelM males, suggesting that fitness costs were triggered by Wolbachia presence in females. The fecundity and hatch proportions of eggs of wMelM females declined with age, regardless of whether females used stored sperm or were recently inseminated. Costs of some Wolbachia strains during egg retention may affect the invasion and persistence of Wolbachia in release sites where larval habitats are scarce and/or intermittent.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

FACT also interacts with a specialized centromeric nucleosome containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A and with CENP-TW, two subunits of CCAN, a 16-protein complex associated with CENP-A. The significance of these interactions remains elusive. Here, we show that FACT has multiple additional binding sites on CCAN. The interaction with CCAN is strongly stimulated by casein kinase II (CK2) phosphorylation of FACT. Mitotic localization of FACT to kinetochores is strictly dependent on specific CCAN subcomplexes. Unexpectedly, we also find that DNA readily displaces FACT from CCAN, suggesting that FACT becomes recruited through a pool of CCAN that is not stably integrated into chromatin. Collectively, our results point to a potential role of FACT in chaperoning CCAN during transcription or in the stabilization of CCAN at the centromere during the cell cycle.

Given the paucity of approved therapeutic strategies for this lifestyle disorder, dietary interventions may prove effective. We evaluated how green jackfruit flour (JF) prevents MASH and progression to HCC and its underlying mechanisms. The study utilized two murine models that mimicked human MASLD disease: (i) a diet-induced MASH model; (ii) a MASH-HCC model induced by diet and a very low dose of CCl4. C57Bl/6 mice were fed with chow (CD) or western diet (WD) with normal (NW) or sugar water (SW) for 12 weeks, then randomized to receive either 5 kcal% green jackfruit flour (JF) or an equal volume of placebo flour (PB). The biochemical, histological, and molecular analyses were assessed. JF significantly reduced body weight, liver injury, insulin resistance, and alleviated obesity, steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor development in WDSW or WDSW/CCl4 mice compared to placebo groups. Furthermore, JF activated AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and inhibited MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways in MASH and MASH-HCC experimental models, respectively. This was supported by sodium propionate treatment, the primary short-chain fatty acid entering the liver from JFs soluble fiber microbial fermentation, which also regulated AMPK and MAPK signaling in cellular models of MASH and HCC, respectively. Hence, our findings present strong evidence of JFs therapeutic potential in the prevention of MASH and MASH-HCC, warranting further investigation of JFs efficacy as a dietary intervention in clinical trials.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

Inland regions exhibit higher proportions of Khoe-San ancestry, eastern regions show more Bantu-speaker/West African ancestry, and western/coastal areas, particularly around Cape Town, display increased Asian ancestry. These patterns reflect historical migrations and settlement patterns. Additionally, sex-biased admixture ratios show male-biased admixture from East Africans and Europeans, and female-biased admixture from Khoe-San populations, which is supported by mitochondrial and Y-chromosome data.

Here, we show that long-read RNA-seq, combined with our new method isoLASER, enables a clear segregation of cis- and trans-directed splicing events for individual samples. The genetic linkage of splicing is largely individual-specific, in stark contrast to the tissue-specific pattern of splicing profiles.

The recurrent evolution of this adaptation is achieved through changes in the expression and localisation of several enzymes and transporters that are conventionally used in non-photosynthetic metabolism. These alterations result in the establishment of a biochemical CO2 pump that increases the concentration of CO2 around rubisco in a cellular environment where rubisco is protected from oxygen thus preventing the occurrence of photorespiration. A key step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis is the change in subcellular localisation of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity from the mesophyll cell chloroplast to the cytosol, where it catalyzes the first biochemical step of the C4 pathway. Here, we achieve this key step in C4 evolution in the C3 plant Oryza sativa (rice) using genome editing. We show that editing the chloroplast transit peptide of the primary CA isoform in the leaf results in relocalisation of leaf CA activity from the chloroplast to the cytosol. Through analysis of fluorescence induction kinetics in these CA relocalisation lines we uncover a role a new role for chloroplast CA in photosynthetic induction. We also reveal that relocalisation of CA activity to the cytosol causes no detectable perturbation to plant growth or leaf-level CO2 assimilation. Collectively, this work uncovers a novel role for chloroplast CA in C3 plants, and demonstrates that it is possible to achieve a key step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis by genome editing.

Significance statementC4 photosynthesis is a highly efficient adaptation to photosynthesis that fuels the worlds most productive crop plants. It evolved from conventional C3 photosynthesis through a series of changes in leaf biochemistry and anatomy. Here we achieve a key evolutionary step on the path to C4 photosynthesis in rice using genome editing. Specifically, we alter the primary location of carbonic anhydrase activity in the rice leaf from the chloroplast to the cytosol. In doing so, we uncover a novel role for carbonic anhydrase in facilitating the rapid induction kinetics of photosystem II, and initiate a new era of C4 engineering using precision breeding techniques.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

In this study, we investigated the post-transcriptional modifications in chloroplast tRNAs and rRNAs of Arabidopsis thaliana using tRNA sequencing, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, targeted rRNA sequencing, and analysis of public data. Our results revealed similarities between chloroplast non-coding RNAs and bacterial systems (e.g., Escherichia coli), such as modification patterns at the anticodon-adjacent position and the variable loop of tRNAs, along with conserved modifications in the small subunit rRNA. Additionally, we identified features shared with eukaryotic systems that likely contribute to the correct three-dimensional structure of chloroplast tRNAs. Unique modifications were also discovered, including a potential novel modification at wobble position in tRNA-IleCAU, which may be crucial for distinguishing isoleucine codons from methionine codons, and chloroplast-specific rRNA modifications that likely compensate for altered ribosome structure. These findings suggest that the chloroplast translation machinery, through co-evolution with its eukaryotic host, has adopted features beyond those typically found in bacteria, reflecting a blend of ancestral and acquired characteristics.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic.

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1718748331324

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

SummaryAmong 47561 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine was 23% effective against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1718748331324

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3, which convergently acquired S protein substitutions such as S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Furthermore, JN.1 subvariants such as LB.1 and KP.2.3, which convergently acquired S:S31del in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. Here we investigated the virological properties of KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

The central biological question about HD pathogenesis has been how the disease-causing DNA repeat expansion (CAGn) in the huntingtin (HTT) gene leads to neurodegeneration after decades of apparent latency. Inherited HTT alleles with a longer CAG repeat hasten disease onset; the length of this repeat also changes over time, generating somatic mosaicism, and genes that regulate DNA-repeat stability can influence HD age-at-onset. To understand the relationship between a cells CAG-repeat length and its biological state, we developed a single-cell method for measuring CAG-repeat length together with genome-wide RNA expression. We found that the HTT CAG repeat expands from 40-45 CAGs to 100-500+ CAGs in HD-vulnerable SPNs but not in other striatal cell types, with these long DNA-repeat expansions acquired at different times by individual SPNs. Surprisingly, somatic expansion from 40 to 150 CAGs had no apparent effect upon gene expression - but neurons with 150-500+ CAGs shared profound gene-expression changes. These expression changes involved hundreds of genes, escalated alongside further CAG-repeat expansion, eroded positive and then negative features of neuronal identity, and culminated in expression of senescence/apoptosis genes. Rates of striatal neuron loss across HD stages reflected the rates at which neurons entered this biologically distorted state. Our results suggest that HTT CAG repeats in striatal neurons undergo decades of biologically quiet expansion, then, as they asynchronously cross a high threshold, cause SPNs to degenerate quickly and asynchronously. We conclude that, at any moment in the course of HD, most neurons have an innocuous (but unstable) huntingtin gene, and that HD pathogenesis is a DNA process for almost all of a neurons life.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1718748331324

These ruminants were presumed not to be hosts for IAVs. Previously, IAV-positive mammalian species were hunters and scavengers, possibly getting infected while feeding on infected birds. It is now presumed that H5N1 viruses that circulate in US dairy cattle transmit through a mammary gland route, in contrast to transmission by aerosols via the respiratory tract, although the latter cannot be excluded. The receptor display in the mammary and respiratory tract in cows for IAVs is unknown. Here, we used recombinant HA proteins representing current circulating and classical H5 viruses to determine the distribution of IAV receptors in the respiratory and mammary tract tissues of cows and goats. Most of the sialome of the cow and goat respiratory tract is lined with sialic acid modifications such as N-glycolyl and O-acetyl, which are not bound by IAV. Interestingly, the H5 protein representing the cow isolates bound significantly in the mammary gland, whereas classical H5 proteins failed to do so. Furthermore, whereas the 9-O-acetyl modification is prominent in all tissues tested, the 5-N-glycolyl modification is not, resulting in the display of receptors for avian IAV hemagglutinins. This could explain the high levels of virus found in these tissues and milk, adding supporting data to this possible virus transmission route.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

This is a case of sound-symbolism, known as the Bouba-Kiki effect. Studies on four-months infants suggest that this effect might constitute a predisposed perceptual mechanism. However, these studies suffered from the impossibility of ruling out a fast experience-driven origin of the effect resulting from infants speed of learning, their sensitivity to environmental regularities, and the large number of sound-symbolic associations to which they are precociously exposed when interacting with adults. To better describe its ontogeny and fill in this gap, we tested the Bouba-Kiki effect in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus). Being a precocial species, chicks can be tested on the very early days of life, allowing for a virtually total control of their experience before test. Three-day-old chicks (n=42) first learned to circumnavigate a panel to obtain a food reward. Then, they were presented with two identical panels, one depicting a spiky shape, and one depicting a round shape, while hearing either the sound  Bouba or  Kiki. We recorded which panel chicks chose with either sound, in a total of 24 trials. Chicks preferred the panel with the spiky shape when hearing the  Kiki sound, and that with the round shape when hearing the  Bouba sound. Results from naive baby chicks hint at a predisposed mechanism for matching the two dimensions of shape and sound that may be widespread across species.","NA","biorxiv",1718748331324

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.
