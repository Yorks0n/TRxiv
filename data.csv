Objective: This SLR summarizes the evidence across studies among predominately adults that report an adjusted measure of association for the relationship between vaccination and PCC, by timing of vaccination relative to infection or PCC onset and across different study characteristics. Evidence review: A comprehensive search strategy was developed within the OVID platform across EMBASE, MEDLINE and Evidence Based Medicine reviews, and supplemented with WHO COVID library and Google Scholar searches, to collate evidence on vaccination and PCC published or posted as pre prints between January 1st, 2020 and July 18th, 2023. JBI Critical Appraisal Checklists were used to assess each study's risk of bias. Findings: This review included 97 studies and synthesized results from 56 studies with low risk of bias that reported adjusted measures for the association between vaccination and PCC. Overall, 77% of pre infection adjusted VE (aVE) estimates (vs. unvaccinated) were statistically significant (range: 7% to 95%), 80% of estimates reflecting a mix of those vaccinated before and after infection were statistically significant (range: 62% to 73%), one of five estimates reflecting vaccination after PCC onset was statistically significant (aVE=41%), 43% of post infection vaccination estimates were statistically significant (two were protective [range: 28% to 40%] and one was not [aVE= minus 47%]), and 46% of estimates not specifying vaccination timing were statistically significant (23 were protective [range: 29% to 75%] and one was not [aVE= minus 132%]). Statistically significant pre-infection aVE estimates were slightly higher for mRNA (range: 14% to 84%) than non mRNA vaccines (range: 16% to 38%) and aVE ranges during (4 studies; range: 10% to 70%) and before Omicron predominance (10 studies; range: 7% to 50%) overlapped. Pre-infection vaccination was protective regardless of vaccine type, number of doses received, PCC definition, predominant variant, and severity of acute infections included. Conclusions and Relevance: Collectively our findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination received prior to SARS CoV 2 infection reduces the subsequent risk of developing PCC regardless of the predominant variant circulating.","NA","medrxiv",1728338966288

These functions are underpinned by specific structural sub-elements whose functions have been under investigation since many years. The A-C linker structure, connecting adjacent microtubule triplets in the proximal region, has remained unexplored due to its unknown composition. Here, using ultrastructure expansion microscopy, we characterized two recently identified A-C linker proteins, CCDC77 and WDR67, along with a newly discovered protein, MIIP. Our findings reveal that these proteins localize between microtubule triplets at the A-C linker, forming a complex. Depletion of A-C linker components disrupt microtubule triplet cohesion, leading to breakage at the proximal end. Co-removal of the A-C linker and the inner scaffold demonstrates their joint role in maintaining centriole architecture. Moreover, we uncover an unexpected function of the A-C linker in centriole duplication through torus regulation, underscoring the interplay between these protein modules.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Here, we investigate the longstanding question of how, and indeed whether, G3BPs and SGs shape the stress translation response. We find that SGs are enriched for mRNAs that are resistant to the stress-induced translation shutdown. Although the accurate recruitment of these stress-resistant mRNAs does require the context of stress, a combination of optogenetic tools and spike-normalized ribosome profiling demonstrates that G3BPs and SGs are necessary and sufficient to both help prioritize the translation of their enriched mRNAs and help suppress cytosolic translation. Together these results support a model in which G3BPs and SGs reinforce the stress translation program by prioritizing the translation of their resident mRNAs.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

We find that the combined area condition BNG metric does not capture the value of arable farmland and grassland sites for invertebrate biodiversity: invertebrate communities were highly variable across sites that had the same type and condition under the BNG metric.

Here, we engineered pluripotent stem cells in which cohesin loop extrusion can be inducibly disrupted without causing confounding cell cycle defects. While evident, transcriptional dysregulation was cell-type specific, and not all loci with distal enhancers depend equally on cohesin extrusion. Using comparative genome editing, we demonstrate that enhancer-promoter communication across as little as 20 kilobases can rely on cohesin. However, promoter-proximal regulatory elements can support long-range, cohesin-independent enhancer action - either upon disabling extrusion or across strong CTCF insulators. Finally, transcriptional dynamics and the emergence of new embryonic cell types in response to differentiation cues remained largely robust to disrupting cohesin extrusion. Beyond establishing novel experimental strategies to study cohesin functions in enhancer biology, our work provides mechanistic insight accounting for both cell type- and genomic context-specificity.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

This study evaluates the value of using Google Trends indices of dengue-related keywords to complement official dengue data for nowcasting dengue in Brazil, a country frequently affected by this disease. We compare various nowcasting approaches that incorporate autoregressive features from official dengue cases, Google Trends data, and a combination of both, using a naive approach as a baseline.

Error measures and 95% coverage probabilities reveal that models incorporating Google Trends data enhance the accuracy of weekly nowcasts across states and offer valuable insights into dengue activity levels. To support real-time decision-making, we also present Dengue Tracker, a website that displays weekly dengue nowcasts and trends to inform both decision-makers and the public, improving situational awareness of dengue activity.

Author summaryDengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that poses significant public health challenges in tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide. Surveillance systems are crucial for dengue prevention and control. Unfortunately, traditional systems often rely on delayed data, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, nowcasting methods are needed to estimate underreported cases, enabling more timely decision-making. This study evaluates how Google Trends indices of dengue-related keywords can complement official dengue data to improve nowcasting of dengue in Brazil, a country frequently affected by this disease. We compare the performance of various nowcasting approaches that incorporate Google Trends data with other approaches that rely solely on official reported cases data, assessing their accuracy and uncertainty in nowcasting weekly dengue cases from March to June 2024 across Brazilian states. To support real-time decision-making, we also present Dengue Tracker, a website that displays weekly dengue nowcasts offering valuable insights into dengue activity levels.

To address these issues, we present a computationally efficient pre-processing pipeline for subcellular signal detection, movement artifact identification, and ROI grouping. For subcellular signal detection, we capture the frequency profile of calcium transient dynamics by applying Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on smoothed time-series calcium traces collected from axon ROIs. We then apply band-pass filtering methods (e.g. 0.05 to 0.12 Hz) to select ROIs that contain frequencies that match the power band of transients. To remove motion artifacts from z-plane movement, we apply Principal Component Analysis on all calcium traces and use a Bottom-Up Segmentation change-point detection model on the first principal component. After removing movement artifacts, we further identify calcium transients from noise by analyzing their prominence and duration. Finally, ROIs with high activity correlation are grouped using hierarchical or k-means clustering. Using axon ROIs in the CA1 region, we confirm that both clustering methods effectively determine the optimal number of clusters in pairwise correlation matrices, yielding similar groupings to ""ground truth"" data. Our approach provides a guideline for standardizing the extraction of physiological signals from subcellular compartments during behavior with 2-photon calcium imaging.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

These phenotypes are heterogeneous, dependent on the cell type arrested and the insult inciting arrest. Because a universal biomarker for CS has yet to be identified, combinations of senescence-associated biomarkers linked to various biological stress responses including lysosomal activity ({beta}-galactosidase staining), inflammation (senescence-associated secretory phenotypes, SASPs), and apoptosis (senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways) are used to identify senescent cells. Using in vitro human bulk RNA-seq datasets, we find that senescent states enrich for various stress responses in a cell-type, temporal, and insult-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that various gene signatures used to identify senescent cells in the literature also enrich for stress responses, and are inadequate for universally and exclusively identifying senescent samples. Genes regulating stress responses - including transcription factors and genes controlling chromatin accessibility - are contextually differentially expressed, along with key enzymes involved in metabolism across arrest phenotypes. Additionally, significant numbers of SASP proteins can be predicted from senescent cell transcriptomes and also heterogeneously enrich for various stress responses in a context-dependent manner. We propose that 'senescence' cannot be meaningfully defined due to the lack of underlying preserved biology across senescent states, and CS is instead a mosaic of stress-induced phenotypes regulated by various factors, including metabolism, TFs, and chromatin accessibility. We introduce the concept of Stress Response Modules, clusters of genes modulating stress responses, and present a new model of CS and CQ induction conceptualised as the differential activation of these clusters.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations provide atomically detailed conformational ensembles of IDPs, but their accuracy is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying physical models, or force fields, used. Integrative methods that combine experimental data with computational models offer a promising approach to address force field limitations and generate accurate conformational ensembles of IDPs, shedding light on their functional mechanisms. Here, we present a simple and robust maximum entropy reweighting procedure to refine atomic resolution conformational ensembles of IDPs with large experimental datasets consisting of several different types of data. We apply this approach to refine structural ensembles obtained from long timescale MD simulations and generate IDP ensembles with substantially improved agreement with a variety of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. We ask if reweighted IDP ensembles derived from MD simulations run with different force fields converge to similar conformational distributions when extensive experimental datasets are used for refinement. We find that in favorable cases IDP ensembles derived from different force fields become highly similar after reweighting with experimental data. The maximum entropy reweighting procedure presented here enables the integration of atomic resolution MD simulations with extensive experimental datasets and can facilitate the elucidation of accurate, force field independent conformational ensembles of IDPs.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

The ultimate goal of this process is to produce neural dynamics that enable the rich repertoire of behaviors we perform with our limbs. What begins as a series of ""babbles"" coalesces into skilled motor output as the brain rapidly learns to control the body. However, the nature of the teaching signal underlying this normative learning process remains elusive. Here, we test two well-established and biologically plausible theories-supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL)-that could explain how neural circuits develop the capacity for skilled movements. We trained recurrent neural networks to control a biomechanical model of a primate arm using either SL or RL and compared the resulting neural dynamics to populations of neurons recorded from the motor cortex of monkeys performing the same movements. Intriguingly, only RL-trained networks produced neural activity that matched their biological counterparts in terms of both the geometry and dynamics of population activity. We show that the similarity between RL-trained networks and biological brains depends critically on matching biomechanical properties of the limb. We then demonstrated that monkeys and RL-trained networks, but not SL-trained networks, show a strikingly similar capacity for robust short-term behavioral adaptation to a movement perturbation, indicating a fundamental and general commonality in the neural control policy. Together, our results support the hypothesis that neural dynamics for behavioral control emerge through a process akin to reinforcement learning. The resulting neural circuits offer numerous advantages for adaptable behavioral control over simpler and more efficient learning rules and expand our understanding of how developmental processes shape neural dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Moreover, loss or gain of PTEN function in animal models leads to aberrant cellular morphology, function, and metabolic regulation. However, despite the important role of PTEN signaling, there is currently no method to dynamically monitor its activity with cellular specificity within intact biological systems. Here, we describe the development of a novel PTEN biosensor, optimized for two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (2pFLIM).

Our approach is based on monitoring FRET-dependent changes in PTEN conformation, which serves as a proxy for the activity state in living cells. We identify a point mutation that allow us to express this biosensor with minimal interference to endogenous PTEN signaling and cellular function. We demonstrate the utility of imaging PTEN signaling in cell lines, developing C. elegans, and in the living mouse brain. To complement this approach, we developed a red-shifted PTEN sensor variant that permits simultaneous imaging with GFP-based sensors. Finally, we use in vivo PTEN imaging in the mouse brain to identify cell-type specific dynamics of PTEN activity in excitatory and inhibitory cortical cells. In summary, our approach enables dynamic imaging of PTEN activity in vivo with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

The budding yeast S. cerevisiae has been successfully used as a model to gain insights into eukaryotic cell size control. Multiple regulators of cell size in steady-state conditions have been identified, such as the G1/S transition activators Cln3 and Bck2 and the inhibitor Whi5. Individual deletions of these regulators result in populations with altered mean cell volumes. However, size homeostasis remains largely intact. Here, we show that although the roles of Bck2 and Cln3 for cell size regulation appear largely redundant in steady-state, a switch from fermentable to non-fermentable growth media reveals a unique role for Bck2 in cell size adaptation to changing nutrients. We use live-cell microscopy and machine learning-assisted image analysis to track single cells and their progeny through the nutrient switch. We find that after the switch, bck2del cells experience longer cell cycle arrests and more arrest associated enlargement than wild-type, whi5del or cln3del cells, indicating that Bck2 becomes the critical G1/S activator in changing nutrients. Our work demonstrates that studying size regulation during nutrient shifts to mimic the dynamic environments of free-growing microorganisms can resolve apparent redundancies observed in steady-state size regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Biomolecular condensates, which have emerged as key principles of cellular organization, are suggested to provide robustness to cells, yet they can also respond sensitively to small changes in environmental conditions - or tagging of their components, as our findings suggest. Here, we investigated the effects of sixteen widely used tags on condensate formation in various model organisms, in vitro, in cells and by computational modelling. We find that tagging strongly influenced condensation for some proteins, while others remained unaffected. Effects varied, with some tags enhancing and others decreasing condensation, and depended on the protein being tagged. Coarse-grained simulations suggest that the charge of the fluorescent protein tags is a critical factor modulating condensation behavior. Together, our results underscore the importance of rigorous experimental design and interpretation in condensate experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects.

This study aims to determine the viral load of HIV in colostrum from postpartum women using qRT-PCR, following participant selection based on informed consent criteria. The research includes monitoring participants prenatal routine, collecting, storing, and processing colostrum, as well as automated RNA extraction and viral RNA quantification via qRT-PCR. Thirteen participants were recruited, 13 samples of colostrum were subsequently collected, meeting eligibility criteria and signing informed consent. These samples were processed and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Six of nine samples analyzed were undetectable, and three were below the detection limit. We observed that patients with undetectable colostrum had been on ART before conception, while those with colostrum samples detectable had a detectable serum viral load at some point during pregnancy. The immunological, biochemical, and socioeconomic impact of non-breastfeeding on maternal-child health is significant, and analyzing the transmissibility potential of colostrum raises questions about possible breastfeeding with reduced risks of HIV transmission. We think that achieving undetectable or below detection limit levels in colostrum of women on ART is feasible, but further research is needed on the condition of breast milk from women living with HIV under current antiretroviral therapies used in Brazil.","NA","medrxiv",1728338966288

To address this, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR screens on two breast cancer cell lines with distinct dormancy properties: 4T1 (short-term dormancy) and 4T07 (prolonged dormancy). We discovered that loss of class-III PI3K, Pik3c3, revealed a unique vulnerability in 4T07 cells. Surprisingly, dormancy-prone 4T07 cells exhibited higher mTORC1 activity than 4T1 cells, due to lysosome-dependent signaling occurring at the cell periphery. Pharmacological inhibition of Pik3c3 counteracted this phenotype in 4T07 cells, and selectively reduced metastasis burden only in the 4T07 dormancy-prone model. This mechanism was also detected in human breast cancer cell lines in addition to a breast cancer patient-derived xenograft supporting that it may be relevant in humans. Our findings suggest dormant cancer cell-initiated metastasis may be prevented in patients carrying tumor cells that display PIK3C3-peripheral lysosomal signaling to mTORC1.

Statement of SignificanceWe reveal that dormancy-prone breast cancer cells depend on the class III PI3K to mediate a constant peripheral lysosomal positioning and mTORC1 hyperactivity. Targeting this pathway might blunt breast cancer metastasis.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

This isolation, combined with substantial Denisovan ancestry, contributes to the unique genetic makeup of the Papua New Guinean population. Previous research suggested the possibility of admixture with an early diverged modern human population, but the extent of this contribution remains debated. This study re-examines the demographic history of the Papua New Guinean population using newly published samples and advanced analytical methods. Our findings demonstrate that the observed shifts in relative cross coalescent rate curves are unlikely to result from technical artefacts or contributions from an earlier out of Africa population. Instead, they are likely due to a significant bottleneck and slower population growth rate within the Papua New Guinean population. Our analysis positions the Papua New Guinean population as a sister group to other Asian populations, challenging the notion of Papua New Guinean as an outgroup to both European and Asian populations. This study provides new insights into the complex demographic history of the Papua New Guinean population and underscores the importance of considering population-specific demographic events in interpreting relative cross coalescent rate curves.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Epidemiological investigations consistently demonstrate an overrepresentation of the elderly in COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatalities. Despite this, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms explaining how old age constitutes a critical risk factor remains elusive. To unravel this, we designed an animal study, juxtaposing the course of COVID-19 in young adults (2 months) and geriatric (15-22 months) mice. Both groups of K18(hACE2) mice were intranasally exposed to 500 TCID50 of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with a variety of outcomes assessed on days 3, 5, and 7 post-infections (DPI). Analyses included pulmonary cytokines, RNA, viral loads, lipidomic profiles, and histological assessments, with a concurrent evaluation of the percentage of mice reaching humane endpoints. The findings unveiled notable distinctions between the two groups, with aged mice exhibiting impaired viral clearance at 7 DPI, correlating with diminished survival rates together with an absence of weight loss recovery at 6-7 DPI. Additionally, elderly-infected mice exhibited a deficient Th1 response characterized by diminished productions of IFNg, CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL9 relative to younger mice. Furthermore, mass-spectrometry analysis of the lung lipidome indicated altered expression of several lipids with immunomodulatory and pro-resolution effects in aged mice such as Resolvin, HOTrEs, and NeuroP, but also DiHOMEs-related ARDS. Collectively, disease severity implies a dysregulation of the antiviral response in elderly-infected mice relative to younger mice, resulting in compromised viral clearance and a more unfavorable prognosis. This underscores the potential efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments for elderly subjects experiencing symptoms of severe COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Little is known about how microglial activity differs across the life-stages of early development, adulthood, and aging. Using two-photon live imaging, we show that microglia in the adult cerebral cortex exhibit highly ramified processes and relatively immobile somata under basal conditions. Their responses to injury occur over minutes and are highly coordinated neighboring microglia. In neonates, microglia are denser and more mobile but less morphologically complex. Their responses to focal laser-induced injuries of capillaries or parenchymal tissue are uncoordinated, delayed and persistent over days. In the aged brain, microglia somata remain immobile under basal conditions but their processes become less ramified. Their responses to focal injuries remain coordinated but are slower and less sensitive. These studies confirm that microglia undergo significant changes in their morphology, distribution, dynamics and response to injury across the lifespan.

Plasmids are as diverse as their hosts and exhibit a broad range of replication and mobility strategies, genetic repertoires, host ranges, sizes, and copies per cell. While most of these features have been extensively characterized, the determinants of plasmid copy number (PCN) remain poorly understood. Here, we leveraged extensive DNA sequencing data to comprehensively analyze the copy number of thousands of diverse bacterial plasmids. We found that the copy number of natural plasmids is highly variable, spanning nearly three orders of magnitude, and that it is intrinsically robust against changes in genomic context. We further show that PCN variability is tightly associated with plasmid lifestyles and develop the concept of replicon dominance to explain interactions in widespread multi-replicon plasmids. Finally, we uncover a universal scaling law that links copy number and plasmid size across phylogenetic boundaries, indicating that pervasive constraints orchestrate the PCN-size trade-off. Altogether, our work pioneers large-scale analyses of PCN while uncovering the fundamental rules that govern plasmid biology.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Intersectional vulnerabilities among individuals with SCD in the United States (US) raise historically and socially contingent questions about tubal sterilization in individuals with SCD. However immediate postpartum tubal sterilization (TS) rates among individuals with SCD in the US are unknown.

ObjectiveTo compare rates of TS in deliveries to people with SCD and without SCD, and to determine the modifying effect of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) on the odds of TS.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis repeated cross-sectional study used the 2012-2019 National Inpatient Sample to estimate the rate of TS among delivery hospitalizations to people with SCD, without SCD (non-SCD), Black people with and without SCD, and people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Logistic regression models estimated the odds of TS between SCD and non-SCD deliveries, SCD and non-SCD deliveries with Black race, and SCD and CF deliveries. We examined whether SMM modified the association between TS and SCD in interaction analyses.

ExposureSCD, CF

ResultsAmong 29,822,518 deliveries, 6.7% underwent TS. Among 18,860 SCD deliveries, 8.8% underwent TS. Among 2,945 CF deliveries, 6.6% underwent TS. After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, SCD had higher odds of TS compared to non-SCD deliveries (aOR= 1.38 [1.06,1.79]) and in a stratified analysis of deliveries coded with Black race (aOR= 1.42 [1.06,1.90]). After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, there was no difference in the odds of TS between SCD or CF deliveries (aOR=1.0 [0.51,2.24]). SMM more than doubled the odds of TS in SCD deliveries (interaction: aOR=2.34 [1.57,3.47]; aOR= 2.14 [1.40,3.24] in deliveries coded with Black race).

ConclusionEven after accounting for patient and hospital characteristics, people with SCD have higher odds of immediate postpartum TS compared to control groups. SMM at delivery increased the odds of TS in SCD compared to all non-SCD deliveries and compared to CF deliveries. Possibly SMM severity, patient preference, or clinician recommendations inform this finding. SMM is 3-7 times more common in SCD than non-SCD pregnancies and may be a modifiable risk factor for TS in SCD deliveries.

KEY POINTS

QuestionWhat are the national rates and associations of postpartum tubal sterilization (TS) among deliveries to people with sickle cell disease (SCD) compared to deliveries to people without SCD (non-SCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF)?

FindingsFrom 2012-2019, the TS rate was significantly higher in SCD deliveries (88 per 1,000 deliveries) vs non-SCD (67 per 1,000 deliveries) and CF deliveries (66 per 1,000 deliveries). SCD was positively associated with TS. SMM modified the association between TS and SCD by two-fold.

MeaningPostpartum TS rate in people with SCD is high; SMM during SCD deliveries significantly increases the odds of postpartum TS.","NA","medrxiv",1728338966288

Discrete populations of serotonergic (5-HT) neurons target circuits in the brainstem and spinal cord, but their role in the control of motor behavior is unclear. Here we define the pre- and post-synaptic organization of the spinal-projecting serotonergic system and define a role in locomotor control. We show that while forebrain-targeting 5-HT neurons decrease their activity during locomotion, subpopulations of spinal projecting neurons increase their activity in a context-dependent manner. Optogenetic activation of ventrally projecting 5-HT neurons does not trigger initiation of movement, but rather enhances the speed and duration of ongoing locomotion over extended time scales. These findings indicate that the descending serotonergic system potentiates locomotor output and demonstrate a role for serotonergic neurons in modulating the temporal dynamics of motor circuits.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex carries out viral genome replication and transcription and is therefore an attractive drug target. However, to date no structural data is available on the NiV RdRp complex. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of NiV RdRp in the apo and in an early elongation state with RNA and incoming substrate bound. The structure of the apo enzyme reveals the architecture of the NiV RdRp complex, which shows a high degree of similarity to other nsNSV RdRps. The structure of the RNA-bound NiV RdRp shows how the enzyme interacts with template and product RNA during early replication and how nucleoside triphosphates are bound in the active site. Comparisons show that RNA binding leads to rearrangements of key elements in the RdRp core and to ordering of the flexible C-terminal domains of NiV L required for RNA capping. Taken together, these results reveal the first structural snapshots of an actively replicating nsNSV RdRp and provide insights into the mechanisms of genome replication and transcription by NiV and related viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

However, optimal subcortical targets for therapeutic stimulation are not well established. Here, we leveraged 7 Tesla resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data from 168 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project to map the subcortical connectivity of six canonical cortical networks that modulate higher-order cognition and function: the default mode, executive control, salience, dorsal attention, visual, and somatomotor networks. Based on spatiotemporally overlapped networks generated by the Nadam-Accelerated SCAlable and Robust (NASCAR) tensor decomposition method, our goal was to identify subcortical hubs that are functionally connected to multiple cortical networks. We found that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain and the central lateral (CL) and parafascicular (Pf) nuclei of the thalamus - regions that have historically been targeted by neuromodulatory therapies to restore consciousness - are subcortical hubs widely connected to multiple cortical networks. Further, we identified a subcortical hub in the pontomesencephalic tegmentum that overlapped with multiple reticular and extrareticular arousal nuclei and that encompassed a well-established ""hot spot"" for coma-causing brainstem lesions. Multiple hubs within the brainstem arousal nuclei and thalamic intralaminar nuclei were functionally connected to both the DMN and SN, emphasizing the importance of these cortical networks in integrative subcortico-cortical signaling. Additional subcortical connectivity hubs were observed within the caudate head, putamen, amygdala, hippocampus, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, regions classically associated with modulation of cognition, behavior, and sensorimotor function. Collectively, these results suggest that multiple subcortical hubs in the brainstem tegmentum, thalamus, basal ganglia, and medial temporal lobe modulate cortical function in the human brain. Our findings strengthen the evidence for targeting subcortical hubs in the ventral tegmental area, central lateral thalamus, and pontomesencephalic tegmentum to restore consciousness in patients with DoC. We release all subcortical connectivity maps to support ongoing efforts at therapeutic neuromodulation of consciousness.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Here, we develop an experimentally-constrained biophysical network model of neocortical circuit motifs, focusing on layers 2-3 of the primary visual cortex (V1). We investigate the role of four major cortical interneuron classes in a competitive-cooperative computational primitive and validate these circuit motifs implemented soft winner-take-all (sWTA) computation for gain modulation, signal restoration, and context-dependent multistability. Using a novel parameter mapping technique, we configured IBM's TrueNorth (TN) chip to implement sWTA computations, mirroring biological neural dynamics. Retrospectively, we observed a strong correspondence between the biophysical model and the TN hardware parameters, particularly in the roles of four key inhibitory neuron classes: Parvalbumin (feedforward inhibition), Somatostatin (feedback inhibition), VIP (disinhibition), and LAMP5 (gain normalization). Moreover, the sparse coupling of this sWTA motif was also able to simulate a two-state neural state machine on the TN chip, replicating working memory dynamics essential for cognitive tasks. Additionally, integrating the sWTA computation as a pre-processing layer in the Vision Transformer (ViT) enhanced its performance on the MNIST digit classification task, demonstrating improved generalization to previously unseen data and suggesting a mechanism akin to zero-shot learning. Our approach provides a framework for translating brain-inspired computations to neuromorphic hardware, with potential applications on platforms like Intel's Loihi2 and IBM's Northpole. By integrating biophysically accurate models with neuromorphic hardware and advanced machine learning techniques, we offer a comprehensive roadmap for embedding neural computation into NeuroAI systems.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Such adverse effects on immunity might increase with ageing, worsening disease conditions later in life. Furthermore, malnutrition may persist across generations, imposing strong natural selection to survive the nutrient shortage. However, it is unclear how the evolutionary history of ancestral generations with chronic malnutrition could influence pathogen resistance and infection susceptibility, as well as their age-specific changes in extant generations. To address this, we used Drosophila melanogaster populations adapted against chronic juvenile malnutrition and exposed them to a bacterial pathogen, Providencia rettgeri, during their early and late adulthood. Surprisingly, we observed that in populations adapted to chronic malnutrition, young flies survived infection better by tolerating the infection, while control flies displayed higher infection susceptibility despite carrying a similar pathogen load. However, this pattern in post-infection survival is reversed with ageing. There was no change in pathogen resistance, but evolved flies succumbed more to infection than control flies regardless of the input infection doses. Our study thus revealed new evolutionary insights into the development of contrasting early vs late-life immune strategies and age-specific vulnerabilities to infection as a function of early-life malnutrition.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

In recent years, genome-wide studies have used catalogs ranging in size from fewer than 200,000 to over 7 million loci. Where these catalogs overlapped, they often disagreed on locus boundaries, hindering the comparison and reuse of results across studies. Now, with multiple groups developing public databases of TR variation in large population cohorts, there is a risk that, without sufficient consensus in the choice of locus definitions, the use of divergent repeat catalogs will lead to confusion, fragmentation, and incompatibility across future resources. In this paper, we compare existing TR catalogs and discuss desirable features of a comprehensive genome-wide catalog. We then present a new, richly annotated catalog designed for large-scale analyses and population databases. Our catalog stratifies TRs into two groups: 1) isolated TRs suitable for repeat copy number analysis using short read or long read data and 2) so-called variation clusters that contain TRs within wider polymorphic regions that are best studied through sequence-level analysis. To define variation clusters, we present a novel algorithm that leverages long-read HiFi sequencing data to group repeats with surrounding polymorphisms. We show that the human genome contains at least 25,000 complex variation clusters, most of which span over 120 bp and contain five or more TRs. Resolving the sequence of entire variation clusters instead of individually genotyping constituent TRs leads to a more accurate analysis of these regions and enables us to profile variation that would have been missed otherwise.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

In particular, the relationship between neuronal cell types, networks and function has been difficult to establish. Here, we propose principles by which functions arise primarily from spatial features of the cord. First, we suggest that distinct cell types with dissimilar length of projection constitute an asymmetrical ""Mexican hat"" topology, i.e. local excitation and surrounding inhibition, along the rostro-caudal axis. Second, the transversal segregation of cell types conveniently allows synapses to form with appropriate targets. We demonstrate these principles in a model of the mouse spinal cord, where networks are constructed by probabilistic sampling of synaptic connections from cell-specific projection patterns, which are gleaned from literature. The cell-type distributions are derived from single-cell RNA sequencing combined with spatial transcriptomics. We find that essential aspects of locomotion are recapitulated and easily controlled, and several experimental observations can now be explained mechanistically. Further, two main features are predicted: propagating bumps of neural activity and asymmetric neuronal projections with local excitation and wider inhibition. Besides linking cell types, structure and function, our approach provides a unifying framework for understanding motor activity across limbed and undulatory species.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

To maintain the infection cycle, soil phages must travel from one suitable host to the next. However, traversing the soil matrix presents a dangerous journey for phages, which need to encounter the right hosts in this spatially complex habitat, but are not capable of active motion and can adsorb to soil particles. Here, we tested the hypothesis that bacterial-feeding nematodes (roundworms) present a reliable vehicle of soil transport for phages. First, we demonstrated that the bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans vectored the laboratory model phage T7 as well as the soil phage {Phi} Ppu-W11 on agar. Sorption assays carried out with paralyzed and non-paralyzed nematodes showed that phage transport can occur via both external cuticular attachment and ingestion, and that the presence of host bacteria is not required for phage vectoring. Finally, we designed a microcosm to test phage transfer in compost and sandy soil using C. elegans and its sister species, C. remanei, respectively. This experiment confirmed that nematodes also enable phage movement through complex spatial habitats. This novel mechanism of phage vectoring extends our understanding of virus transmission in soil, revealing new multitrophic interactions that may influence soil functioning.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

One way in which this requirement can be met is if each of these cognitive functions occur as part of a repeated cycle. Here, we studied the temporal evolution of large-scale cortical networks, and show that while network dynamics are stochastic, the overall ordering of their activity forms a robust cyclical pattern. This cyclical structure groups states with similar function and spectral content at specific phases of the cycle and occurs at timescales of (300-1000 ms). These results are reproduced in five large magnetoencephalography (MEG) datasets. Moreover, we show that metrics that characterize the cycle strength and speed are heritable, and relate to age, cognition, and behavioural performance.

Potassium channels combine high efficiency (K+ ions permeation rates ~100 pS) and exquisite K+/Na+ selectivity by a conserved selectivity filter (SF) with four adjacent potassium-binding sites. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations can, in principle, provide a detailed, atomistic mechanism of this sophisticated ion permeation. However, currently there are clear inconsistencies between computational and experimental predictions. Firstly, the ion occupancy of the SF in simulations is lower than expected (~2.5 in MD compared to ~4 in X-ray crystallography). Secondly, in many reported MD simulations of K+ channels, K+ conductance is typically an order of magnitude lower than experimental values from single-channel electrophysiology. This discrepancy is in part because the force fields used in MD simulations of potassium channels do not account for explicit electronic polarization. One of the proposed solutions is the Electronic Continuum Correction (ECC), a force field modification that scales down formal atomic charges, to introduce the polarization in a mean-field way. In this work, we apply the ECC to MD simulations of K+ channels under applied voltage. When the ECC is used in conjunction with the Charmm36m force field, the simulated K+ conductance increases 13-fold, whereas applying the ECC to Amber14 seemingly has no major effect. Following the analysis of ion occupancy states using Hamiltonian Replica Exchange (HRE) simulations, we propose a new parameter set for Amber14sb, that leads to a similar increase in conductance. These two force fields are then used to compute, for the first time, the full current-voltage (I-V) curves from MD simulations, approaching quantitative agreement with experiments at all voltages tested, for three K+ channels. In all simulated systems, the direct knock-on permeation mechanism with near-full K+ ion occupancy of the SF is consistently observed. In general, our ECC-enabled simulations are in excellent agreement with experimental data, in terms of ion occupancy, conductance, current-voltage response, and K+/Na+ selectivity. These simulations thus form a robust basis to study structure-function relations in K+ channels on the atomistic level with unprecedented accuracy, as exemplified by deciphering the rectification mechanism of the MthK channel.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Seed dormancy and germination are key traits which respond strongly to temperature during seed development and here we show that progeny adaptation to seasonal climate is inherited from the mother plant. Loss of maternal LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (LHP1) causes an inability of progeny seeds to sense temperature and this is linked mechanistically to reduced ABA levels in seeds and activation of the primary nitrate response. At the single cell level, small changes in temperature activate nitrate signalling specifically in the mother, and ABA biosensor imaging reveals temperature-dependent fluxes of ABA into seeds necessary for dormancy induction. Thus, we reveal that progeny seeds inherit the climate adaptation of mother plants via active hormone transport during seed set.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

In this study, we examined the molecular, cellular, and radiological changes in the articular cartilage (AC) of the C57BL/6J wild-type mice from postnatal day 15 to 3 years of age. In juvenile mice, AC, while all the layers express the BMPR1A receptor, only a thin layer of cells in the deep zone of AC express BMP ligands, and chondrocyte hypertrophy ensues first in this layer. With age, the BMP ligand expression domain expands throughout the AC, leading to BMP signaling activation and resultant chondrocyte hypertrophy. Further, exposure to healthy AC with BMP ligands was sufficient to induce premature OA-like changes in the young adult mice, suggesting BMP signaling is the limiting factor behind age-induced OA. We found that activation of BMP signaling upregulates ICAT expression, a known inhibitor of the canonical Wnt pathway in the AC. Our results suggest that with aging, the spread of BMP signaling throughout the cartilage is a certainty and the underlying cause for age-induced OA.

Imaging from these neurons during virtual odor-guided navigation reveals a bump of activity that is activated by odor, but can outlast the odor stimulus by several seconds. Persistent bump activity is associated with persistent movement in the direction adopted during odor, arguing that these neurons represent a directional working memory. When the fly navigates a virtual odor plume, bump activity slowly ramps up with successive odor encounters, indicating that it integrates odor information over time. We do not observe these dynamics in a set of neighboring local neurons, although both populations show slow modulation correlated with engagement in the task.

In the follicular epithelium of Drosophila ovaries, tricellular junctions (TCJs) open transiently in a process termed patency to allow passage of externally produced yolk proteins for uptake by the oocyte. Here we show that modulation of actomyosin contractility at cell vertices controls TCJ permeability. Before patency, circumferential actomyosin bundles are anchored at apical follicle cell vertices, where tension-sensing junctional proteins, Rho-associated kinase (Rok), and active Myosin II accumulate and maintain vertices closed. TCJ opening is initiated by redistribution of Myosin II from circumferential bundles to a medial pool, accompanied by decreasing tension on vertices. This transition requires activation of Cofilin-dependent F-actin disassembly by the phosphatase Slingshot and Myosin II inactivation by Myosin light chain phosphatase, and is counteracted by Rok. Accordingly, constitutive activation of Myosin or of Rho signaling prevent vertex opening, whereas reduced Myosin II or Rok activity cause excessive and premature vertex opening. Thus, opening of intercellular gaps in the follicular epithelium does not require actomyosin-based forces, but relies on a reduction of actomyosin contractility. Conversely, F-actin assembly is required for closing intercellular gaps after patency. Our findings are consistent with a force transduction model in which TCJ integrity is maintained by vertex-anchored contractile actomyosin. We propose that the cell-type-specific organization of actomyosin at cell vertices determines the mode of contractility-dependent regulation of epithelial permeability.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Progress towards reproducible pipelines is limited by a lack of benchmarks such as gold standard brain segmentations. Addressing this core limitation, we constructed the Baby Open Brains (BOBs) Repository, an open source resource comprising manually curated and expert-reviewed infant brain segmentations. Markers and expert reviewers manually segmented anatomical MRI data from 71 infant imaging visits across 51 participants, using both T1w and T2w images per visit. Anatomical images showed dramatic differences in myelination and intensities across the 1 to 9 month age range, emphasizing the need for densely sampled gold standard manual segmentations in these ages. The BOBs repository is publicly available through the Masonic Institute for the Developing Brain (MIDB) Open Data Initiative, which links S3 storage, Datalad for version control, and BrainBox for visualization. This repository represents an open-source paradigm, where new additions and changes can be added, enabling a community-driven resource that will improve over time and extend into new ages and protocols. These manual segmentations and the ongoing repository provide a benchmark for evaluating and improving pipelines dependent upon segmentations in the youngest populations.

The Pi exporter, XPR1/SLC53A1, is critical for maintaining cellular Pi homeostasis. When intercellular Pi is high, cells synthesize inositol pyrophosphate (1,5-InsP8) - a signaling molecule that is required for XPR1 function. Inactivating mutations of XPR1 lead to brain calcifications causing neurological symptoms that include migraine, movements disorders, psychosis, and dementia. Distinct cryo-electron microscopy structures of dimeric XPR1 and functional characterization define the substrate translocation pathway and delineate how binding of InsP8 initiates the transport cycle. InsP8 binding rigidifies the intracellular SPX domains with InsP8 acting as a bridge between dimers and the SPX and transmembrane domains. When locked in this state, the C-terminal tail is sequestered revealing the entrance to the transport pathway, thus explaining the obligate roles of the SPX domain and InsP8. Together, these findings advance our understanding of XPR1 transport activity and expand opportunities for rationalizing disease mechanisms and therapeutic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

PC states that the brain computes internal models of expected events and responds robustly to unexpected stimuli with prediction errors that feed forward. This can be studied using oddball tasks. A repetitive sequence interrupted by a novel stimulus is a ""local"" oddball. ""Global"" oddballs defy expectations while repeating the local context. This dissociates expectation-driven neuronal prediction error responses vs. merely stimulus-history-driven release from adaptation. We recorded neuron spiking activity across the visual hierarchy in mice and monkeys viewing these oddballs. Local oddball responses largely followed PC hypotheses. They were robust, emerged early in layers 2/3, and fed forward. Global oddball responses challenged PC. They were weak, absent in most visual areas, more robust in prefrontal cortex, and emerged in non-granular layers. Contrary to the most popular PC models that emphasize prediction error computations occurring in early sensory areas and feeding forward, this implies that genuine predictive coding computations take place in more cognitive, higher-order areas.

HighlightsO_LICore principles of Predictive Coding hold for local, but not global oddballs
C_LIO_LIGlobal oddballs are sparsely encoded in visual cortex and do not engage feedforward mechanisms
C_LIO_LIParvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons do not support sensory global oddball detection
C_LIO_LIGlobal oddballs are earliest and most robustly encoded in prefrontal brain areas

SignificanceGlobal oddballs defy our expectations without defying their local context. Whether they are encoded in sensory brain areas was uncertain. Through multiarea neurophysiological recordings in mice and monkeys, Westerberg et al. show that these oddballs are sparsely encoded in sensory cortex, but their mechanism does not emerge from classical Predictive Coding.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

ObjectiveThis study aimed to verify the association between SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of Stroke, based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, in order to assess the inclusion of the virus as a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases.

MethodsA metaumbrella was conducted, which included 34 systematic reviews, of which 4 were selected for the final analysis based on methodological quality and consistency. The analysis aggregated the results of 70 primary studies, considering different stroke subtypes and outcomes associated with COVID-19. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} index, and significance bias was verified using Eggers test.

ResultsThe analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 is significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 1.55 - 3.95), particularly for ischemic stroke (eOR = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.11 - 2.80) and hemorrhagic stroke (eOR = 3.86; 95%CI: 1.79 - 8.33). Additionally, patients with cerebrovascular comorbidities had higher mortality (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 2.48 - 19.63), as did those who had previously suffered a stroke (eOR = 6.08; 95%CI: 3.73 - 9.91).

ConclusionThe association between SARS-CoV-2 and stroke was consistent and significant, suggesting that COVID-19 should be considered a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. However, the high heterogeneity among the studies analyzed reinforces the need for further research to consolidate this relationship.","NA","medrxiv",1728338966288

These data structures are computationally and storage efficient, but are not interchangeable with existing data structures used for many population genetic inference methodologies such as the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to population genetic alignments. To better utilize these new data structures we propose and implement a graph convolutional network (GCN) to directly learn from tree sequence topology and node data, allowing for the use of neural network applications without an intermediate step of converting tree sequences to population genetic alignment format. We then compare our approach to standard CNN approaches on a set of previously defined benchmarking tasks including recombination rate estimation, positive selection detection, introgression detection, and demographic model parameter inference. We show that tree sequences can be directly learned from using a GCN approach and can be used to perform well on these common population genetics inference tasks with accuracies roughly matching or even exceeding that of a CNN-based method.

They are then silenced by the production of piRNA cognate to the TE. Under this model, one would expect that TEs might evolve to avoid piRNA clusters. Yet empirical observations show that some TEs, such as the P-element, insert into piRNA clusters preferentially. We were thus wondering if such a bias could be beneficial for the TE, for example by minimizing harm to the host while still being able to selfishly spread in populations. We decided to model insertion bias to determine if there was ever a situation in which insertion bias was beneficial to the TE. We performed extensive forward simulations of TE invasions with differing insertion biases into piRNA clusters. We found that insertion bias significantly altered the invasion dynamics of TEs, primarily by changing the copy number of the TE in individuals prior to silencing. Insertion into a piRNA cluster reduced the deleterious effects of TEs to the host population, but we found that TEs avoiding piRNA clusters out-compete TEs with a bias towards cluster insertions. Insertion bias was only beneficial to the TE when there was negative selection against TEs and a lack of recombination. Different TEs show different insertion biases into piRNA clusters suggesting they are an attribute of the TE not the host, yet scenarios in which this is beneficial to the TE are quite limited. This opens up an interesting area of future research into the dynamics of insertion bias during TE invasions.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

While identifying the genotype-associated changes at the single-cell level is fundamental to understanding disease pathophysiology, this remains technically challenging in human tissue samples with existing methods. Here, we performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) of 20 focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) samples removed surgically for treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy, and 10 non-FCD controls, and we developed a new approach, Genotyping Of Transcriptomes Enhanced with Nanopore sequencing (GO-TEN), that combines targeted complementary (c)DNA sequencing with snRNA-seq to perform concurrent single-nucleus genotyping and transcriptional analysis. We find that mosaic pathogenic variants in FCD do not produce a detectable novel cell identity, but instead we observe conserved cell types present both in FCD cases and non-FCD control specimens. Similarly, GO-TEN analysis shows that most pathogenic variant-carrying cells have well-differentiated neuronal or glial identities and are enriched for layer II-III excitatory neurons. We identify cell-intrinsic disruption of glutamate and GABA-A signaling pathways in variant-carrying neurons and altered intercellular signaling, making potential mechanisms for epileptogenesis in FCD.

However, in such experiments high-fat diet is typically provided freely to animals, so it remains unclear how increasing dietary fat would impact body weight if the high-fat diet required more effort to obtain. Here, we hypothesized that unrestricted access is necessary for mice to overeat high-fat diets, and the corollary that requiring mice to perform small amounts of work to obtain high-fat diets would reduce food intake and weight gain in a high-fat diet model of obesity. To test this hypothesis, we utilized home-cage based feeding devices that either provided food freely or required mice to briefly poke their noses into a port - a simple action that is easy for them to do - to receive food. With both low-fat and high-fat diets, requiring mice to nose-poke just one time to access food strongly reduced food intake, and in the case of high-fat diet prevented the development of obesity. We conclude that unrestricted access to food promotes overeating in mice, and that making mice perform a simple action such as a nose-poke to access food reduces over-eating and weight gain. We posit that ubiquitous access to low-cost food is a critical contributor to the human obesity epidemic, and that changes in the availability of unhealthy food may be part of the solution for addressing the obesity epidemic.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Stamping cells in suspension onto imaging slides, STAMP supports single-modal (RNA or protein) and multimodal (RNA and protein) profiling and flexible, ultra-high-throughput formats. STAMP allows the analysis of a single or multiple samples within the same experiment, enhancing experimental flexibility, throughput and scale. We tested STAMP with diverse sample types, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), dissociated cancer cells and differentiated embryonic stem cell cultures, as well as whole cells and nuclei. Combining RNA and protein profiling, we applied immuno-phenotyping of millions of blood cells simultaneously. We also used STAMP to identify ultra-rare cell populations, simulating clinical applications to identify circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Performing in vitro differentiation studies, we further showed its potential for large-scale perturbation studies. Together, STAMP establishes a new standard for cost-effective, scalable single-cell analysis. Without the need for sequencing, STAMP makes high-resolution profiling more affordable and accessible. Designed to meet the needs of research labs, diagnostic cores and pharmaceutical companies, STAMP holds the promise to transform our capacity to map human biology, diagnose diseases and drug discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

However, the limited fraction of proteins with known biological process and molecular functions presents a major bottleneck. In prokaryotes and viruses, evolution favors keeping genes participating in the same biological processes co-localized as conserved gene clusters. Conversely, conservation of gene neighborhood indicates functional association. Spacedust is a tool for systematic, de novo discovery of conserved gene clusters. To find homologous protein matches it uses fast and sensitive structure comparison with Foldseek. Partially conserved clusters are detected using novel clustering and order conservation P-values. We demonstrate Spacedusts sensitivity with an all-vs-all analysis of 1 308 bacterial genomes, identifying 72 843 conserved gene clusters containing 58% of the 4.2 million genes. It recovered recover 95% of antiviral defense system clusters annotated by a specialized tool. Spacedusts high sensitivity and speed will facilitate the large-scale annotation of the huge numbers of sequenced bacterial, archaeal and viral genomes.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Compared to chemical inducers, light-dependent control of gene expression by optogenetics achieves a higher spatial and temporal resolution. This could also prove decisive beyond basic research for manufacturing difficult-to-express proteins in pharmaceutical bioproduction. However, current optogenetic gene-expression systems limit this application in mammalian cells as expression levels and fold induction upon light stimulation are not sufficient. To overcome this limitation, we designed a photoswitch by fusing the blue light-activated light-oxygen-voltage receptor EL222 from Erythrobacter litoralis to the three tandem transcriptional activator domains VP64, p65, and Rta. The resultant photoswitch, dubbed DEL-VPR, allows an up to 400-fold induction of target gene expression by blue light, achieving expression levels that surpass those for strong constitutive promoters. Here, we utilized DEL-VPR to enable light-induced expression of complex monoclonal and bispecific antibodies with reduced byproduct expression, increasing the yield of functional protein complexes. Our approach offers temporally controlled yet strong gene expression and applies to both academic and industrial settings.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

The capacity of a plasmid to express genes is constrained by two parameters: length and copy number. However, the interplay between these parameters and their constraints on plasmid evolution have remained elusive due to the absence of comprehensive quantitative analyses. To address this gap, we developed Probabilistic Iterative Read Assignment (PIRA), a new computational method that overcomes previous computational bottlenecks, enabling rapid and accurate determination of plasmid copy numbers at an unprecedented scale. Applying PIRA to all microbial genomes in the NCBI RefSeq database with linked short-read sequencing data in the Sequencing Read Archive (SRA), we analyzed 4,317 bacterial and archaeal genomes encompassing 11,338 plasmids, spanning the microbial tree of life. Our analysis reveals three scaling laws of plasmids: first, an inverse power-law correlation between plasmid copy number and plasmid length; second, a positive linear correlation between protein-coding genes and plasmid length; and third, a positive correlation between metabolic genes per plasmid and plasmid length, particularly for large plasmids. These scaling laws imply fundamental constraints on plasmid evolution and functional organization, indicating that as plasmids increase in length, they converge toward chromosomal characteristics in copy number and functional content. Our findings not only advance the understanding of plasmid dynamics but also have implications for microbial evolution, biotechnology, and the design of synthetic plasmids.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

These rich datasets revealed positional niches and cellular heterogeneity along the proximal-distal axis, including the identification of a unique population of TP63+ basal cells, the primary stem cell of the airway, marked by expression of LGR5 and LGR6. Analysis of the LGR5+ basal cell niche and functional experiments with primary organoid models suggest a tonic level of WNT pathway activity in LGR5+ basal cells that is potentiated by mesenchyme-derived R-SPONDIN. We found that basal cell self-renewal is enhanced by WNT activity, suggesting that the WNT pathway plays a previously unappreciated but critical role in airway stem cell maintenance during human development. These results enhance our fundamental understanding of the positional and cellular heterogeneity in the developing human lungs and begin to reveal unique niches that maintain homeostasis throughout the lung.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

However, the methylation state of a genomic region can also be characterized by a mixture of patterns (epialleles) with variable frequencies, and the relative proportions of such patterns can provide insights into its mechanisms of formation. Traditional methods based on bisulfite conversion and NGS, due to the read size (150 bp), allow epiallele frequency analysis only in high-CpG-density regions, limiting differential methylation studies to just 50% of the human methylome. Nanopore sequencing, with its long reads, enables the analysis of epiallele frequency across both high- and low-CpG-density regions.

However, selection of host communities across ecological gradients and co-evolutionary processes may influence both the distribution of phages and the susceptibility of individual hosts through virus interactions and local adaptation within distinct ecological niches. Metagenomic-based analyses have revealed that soil pH selects for distinct populations and community structures for both phage and hosts at local and global scales. However, whether contrasting soil pH represents a selective barrier for phages capable of infecting an individual host is unknown. To examine the influence of pH on individual host-virus interactions, two closely related Bacillus strains were isolated and characterized from pH 7.5 soil associated with a long-term contiguous pH gradient (pH 4.5 to 7.5). Phages infecting each strain were subsequently enriched from soils across the pH gradient (pH 4.5, 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5), enumerated using a plaque assay, and characterized via metagenomic analysis. Phages infecting each strain were cultivated from all soils but their community composition and abundance varied with pH. Phage populations infecting each of the two strains were distinct despite the close relatedness of the two hosts, indicating relatively narrow host ranges for each virus. These results suggest that while phage community structures vary substantially across an ecological gradient, soil pH alone does not represent a barrier for the distribution of phages capable of infecting an individual host.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Canopy architecture is determined by several component traits, including leaf length, width, number, angle, and phyllotaxy. Phyllotaxy may be among the most difficult of the leaf canopy traits to measure accurately across large numbers of individual plants. As a result, in simulations of the leaf canopies of grain crops such as maize and sorghum, this trait is frequently approximated as alternating 180{degrees} angles between sequential leaves. We explore the feasibility of extracting direct measurements of the phyllotaxy of sequential leaves from 3D reconstructions of individual sorghum plants generated from 2D calibrated images and test the assumption of consistently alternating phyllotaxy across a diverse set of sorghum genotypes. Using a voxel-carving-based approach, we generate 3D reconstructions from multiple calibrated 2D images of 366 sorghum plants representing 236 sorghum genotypes from the sorghum association panel. The correlation between automated and manual measurements of phyllotaxy is only modestly lower than the correlation between manual measurements of phyllotaxy generated by two different individuals. Automated phyllotaxy measurements exhibited a repeatability of R2 = 0.41 across imaging timepoints separated by a period of two days. A resampling based genome wide association study (GWAS) identified several putative genetic associations with lower-canopy phyllotaxy in sorghum. This study demonstrates the potential of 3D reconstruction to enable both quantitative genetic investigation and breeding for phyllotaxy in sorghum and other grain crops with similar plant architectures.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Forecasting epidemics requires a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving spore dispersal. Many studies have either employed field data for purely correlative approaches without incorporating established knowledge on physical mechanisms or, conversely, relied on specific physical approaches in controlled environments focusing on only a few mechanisms or factors. Little emphasis has been placed on holistic field-based studies, where wind and rain play crucial roles. This study fills that gap by attempting to unravel the processes by which rainfall affects airborne spore concentrations over a wheat canopy during active rust epidemics. Over more than two months, bi-hourly spore counts from Burkard traps were integrated with detailed meteorological data, revealing both seasonal and diurnal trends. Diurnal peaks in airborne spore concentrations, typically driven by cyclic changes in wind and humidity, were dramatically altered by rain. Rain events either amplified spore concentrations by up to 25-fold through 'rain-puff' and/or depletes them via 'wash-out' and 'wash-off'. Rains events from the dataset were classified into categories with distinct impacts: 'precursor' rains often trigger spore release, while 'follower' (and prolonged rains) reduce airborne spore concentrations. Moreover, differences in the dispersal dynamics of Pst and Pt were observed, and some were linked to how humidity and wind influence spore clustering. These results provide valuable insights for a more integrated understanding of the effect of rain and in order to enhance forecasting models.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

However, a potential biomarker of balance function will be limited by its reliability and clinical feasibility, which has yet to be established. Here, we characterized the reliability of the N1 elicited by standing balance perturbations within and between sessions over a one-week interval in 10 younger and 14 older adults. A subset of older adults (n=12) completed a session approximately one year prior to the main experiment. We extracted N1 amplitude and latency from the Cz electrode using an advanced, computationally-intensive approach that relies on large amounts of data (e.g., 64 channels, many trials), Test-retest reliability was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Internal consistency was quantified by split-half reliability using the Spearman correlation coefficient. N1s varied across individuals (amplitude:12-82V, latency: 142-282ms), yet within individuals, the N1 showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC>0.9) across a one-week and one-year time span. N1 amplitude reached excellent internal reliability for each session and group (r>0.9), that generally plateaued within 6 trials, while more trials were needed to reliably measure N1 latency. Similar results were obtained when quantifying N1s using a minimal approach performed with only three electrodes and simple preprocessing. Overall, the N1 is stable within and across sessions, and is largely independent of approach suggesting it could be a clinically-feasible biomarker of balance function. Characterizing reliability in populations with neurologic dysfunction and in different environmental contexts will be necessary to enhance our understanding of the N1, optimize experimental design, and determine its predictive validity of clinical outcomes (e.g., falls risk).","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

While rational design strategies can expedite the discovery of heterobifunctional CIPs, molecular glues have predominantly been discovered by serendipity. Envisioning a prospective approach to discover molecular glues for a pre-selected target, we hypothesized that pre-existing ligands could be systematically decorated with chemical modifications to discover protein-ligand surfaces that are tuned to cooperatively engage another protein interface. Using high-throughput chemical synthesis to diversify a ligand for the transcriptional coactivator ENL with 3,163 structurally diverse chemical building blocks, we discovered a compound dHTC1 that elicits potent, selective, and stereochemistry-dependent degradation of ENL by induced binding to CRL4CRBN. Unlike prior CRBN-based degraders, dHTC1 binds the ligase with high affinity only after forming the ENL:dHTC1 complex, relying on a hybrid interface of protein-protein and protein-ligand contacts. Altogether, this study points toward an expanded chemical space for co-opting the therapeutically important substrate receptor, CRBN, and a second proof-of-concept extending this approach to BRD4 further validates high-throughput chemistry as a facile tool to discover new degraders.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

These diseases, if left untreated, can be lethal within hours. Hyperinvasive N. meningitidis strains often express a genomically encoded filamentous bacteriophage called MDA{Phi}, which promotes colonisation of mucosal host surfaces to facilitate invasion. How this phage is organised and how it promotes biofilm formation and infection at the molecular level is unclear. Here, we present an electron cryomicroscopy structure of the MDA phage, showing that MDA{Phi} is a class I filamentous inovirus, with the major capsid protein arranged within the phage as a highly curved and densely packed -helix. Comparison with other filamentous bacteriophages offers clues about inoviral genome encapsidation mechanisms, providing a framework for understanding the evolutionary diversity of inoviruses. A disordered, N-terminal segment in the major capsid protein presents hydrophobic patches on the surface of assembled phage particles, which, together with electron cryotomography data of phage bundles, furnishes a structural rationale for phage-phage interactions that were seen previously in an epithelium adhesion infection model of N. meningitidis. Taken together, our results shed light on the structure, organisation, and higher order assembly of a biomedically relevant phage encoded in the genome of a human pathogen. Molecular insights gleaned from this study increase our understanding of phage evolution, phage-mediated bacterial adhesion and pathogenicity.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar.

MethodsTwo matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024.

ResultsThe adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.07) in the three-dose analysis.

In the first six months of follow-up in the three-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.20-0.50); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02-1.85). The overall effectiveness of the primary series and third-dose vaccinations against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 95.9% (95% CI: 94.0-97.1) and 34.1% (95% CI: -46.4-76.7), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

ConclusionA strong healthy vaccinee effect was observed in the first six months following vaccination. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations.","NA","medrxiv",1728338966288

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Attention can also be seen as a solution to the binding problem: concurrent attention to all parts of an entity allows separating it from the rest. However, the rich models of attention in computational neuroscience are generally not scaled to real-world problems and there are thus many behavioral and neural phenomena that current models cannot explain. Here, we propose a bidirectional recurrent model of attention that is inspired by modern neural networks for image segmentation. It conceptualizes recurrent connections as a multi-stage internal gating process where bottom-up connections transmit features, while top-down and lateral connections transmit attentional gating signals. Our model can recognize and segment simple stimuli such as digits as well as objects in natural images and is able to be prompted with object labels, attributes or locations. It can learn to perform a range of behavioral findings, such as object binding, selective attention, inhibition of return, and visual search. It also replicates a variety of neural findings, including increased activity for attended objects, features, and locations, attention-invariant tuning, and relatively late onset attention. Most importantly, our proposed model unifies decades of cognitive and neurophysiological findings of visual attention into a single principled architecture. Our results highlight that the ability to selectively and dynamically focus on specific parts of stimulus streams can help artificial neural networks to better generalize and align with human brains.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

However, these dances have attracted little scientific attention and their structure and meaning remain largely obscure. Here we analyse close-range video recordings of captive crested gibbons, extracting descriptions of dance in four Nomascus species (N. annamensis, N. gabriellae, N. leucogenys, and N. siki). Additionally, we report results from a survey amongst relevant professionals clarifying behavioural contexts of dance in captive and wild crested gibbons. Our results demonstrate that dances in Nomascus represent a common and intentional form of visual communication restricted to sexually mature females. While primarily used as a proceptive signal to solicit copulation, dances occur in a wide range of contexts related to arousal and/or frustration in captivity. A linguistically informed view of this sequential behaviour demonstrates that dances follow a grouping organisation and isochronous rhythm - patterns not described for visual displays in other non-human primates. We argue that applying the concept of dance to gibbons allows us to expand our understanding of the communicative behaviours of non-human apes and develop hypotheses on the rules and regularities characterizing this behaviour. We propose that gibbons dances likely evolved from less elaborate rhythmic proceptive signals, similar to those found in siamangs. Although dance displays in humans and crested gibbons share a number of key characteristics, they cannot be assumed to be homologous.

Active modifications to the spatial environment could thus be a potent tool to mitigate epidemic risk. We tested whether Lasius niger ants modify their nest architecture in response to pathogens by introducing controlor pathogen-treated individuals into nest-digging groups, and monitoring three-dimensional nest morphogenesis over time. Pathogen exposure led to an array of architectural changes including faster nest growth, increased spacing between entrances, transmission-inhibitory changes in overall nest network topology, and reduced chamber centrality. Simulations confirmed that these changes reduced disease spread. These results provide evidence for architectural immunity in a social animal and offer insights into how spatial organisation can be leveraged to decrease epidemic susceptibility.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

The fossil, known on the basis of two specimens, has been historically assigned to seamoths (Pegasidae), then to oarfish and relatives (Lampriformes). We describe its enigmatic skeletal anatomy in detail, and provide a new genus name. ""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

This degeneracy impacts the efficiency of heterologous protein production due to the codon usage preferences of each organism. The process of tailoring organism-specific synonymous codons, known as codon optimization, must respect local sequence patterns that go beyond global codon preferences. As a result, the search space faces a combinatorial explosion that makes exhaustive exploration impossible. Nevertheless, throughout the diverse life on Earth, natural selection has already optimized the sequences, thereby providing a rich source of data allowing machine learning algorithms to explore the underlying rules. Here, we introduce CodonTransformer, a multispecies deep learning model trained on over 1 million DNA-protein pairs from 164 organisms spanning all kingdoms of life. The model demonstrates context-awareness thanks to the attention mechanism and bidirectionality of the Transformers we used, and to a novel sequence representation that combines organism, amino acid, and codon encodings. CodonTransformer generates host-specific DNA sequences with natural-like codon distribution profiles and with negative cis-regulatory elements. This work introduces a novel strategy of Shared Token Representation and Encoding with Aligned Multi-masking (STREAM) and provides a state-of-the-art codon optimization framework with a customizable open-access model and a user-friendly interface.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288

Yet, no efficient mechanisms for their removal have been identified. Here we report bioaccumulation of PFAS by several gut bacterial species over a wide range of concentrations from nanomolar up to 500 M. For bioaccumulating Bacteroides uniformis, a highly prevalent species, we estimate intracellular PFAS concentration in the mM range - above that of most native metabolites. Despite this high bioaccumulation, B. uniformis cells could grow appreciably up to 250 M perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure. Escherichia coli, which accumulated PFAS to a much lesser extent, substantially increased PFAS bioaccumulation when lacking TolC efflux pump indicating trans-membrane transport in PFAS bioaccumulation. Electron microscopy and cryogenic Focused Ion Beam-Secondary Ion Mass-spectrometry revealed distinct morphological changes and intracellular localisation of PFNA aggregates. Bioaccumulation of PFAS and transmembrane transport is also evident in proteomics, metabolomics, thermal proteome profiling, and mutations following adaptive laboratory evolution. In an in vivo context, mice colonized with human gut bacteria showed, compared to germ-free controls or those colonized with low-bioaccumulating bacteria, higher PFNA levels in excreted feces.

Mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction is associated with lack of physical activity and considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs) aflicting our societies such as T2D, CVD, metabolic syndrome, and even AD.

To our knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies on the metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular characteristics of ""healthy sedentary"" individuals living without clinical symptoms. Hence, the main aim of our study herein was to characterize multiple metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular bioenergetic signatures in ""healthy sedentary"" individuals which could already be downregulated compared to moderately active individuals.

Nineteen subjects, 9 sedentary (SED) and 10 moderately active (AC) volunteered for multiple assessments including muscle biopsies, in order to assess muscle metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics both at rest and during exercise.

For our exercise studies, we performed graded exercise testing (GXT) to assess carbohydrate and fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity according to our previously developed methodology.

Resting studies showed decreased mitochondrial respiration including decreases in complex I (-36%) and II (-28%) as well as total electron system capacity (-34%) and electron system capacity coupled to ATP production via ATP synthase (-30%). Regarding muscle carbohydrate metabolism, SED individuals showed a decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation (-37%) as well as reduced expression (-49%) of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Regarding fatty acid metabolism, SED showed decreased activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1)(-51%) and CPT2 (-44%) as well as decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (-35%). Metabolomics analysis also confirmed downregulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) identified distinct metabolic phenotypes through intermediates of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Further, we found significant differences in cardiolipin (CL) species expression between SED and AC groups, which, due to the important role of CL in mitochondrial structure, function, biogenesis and bioenergetics, deserves further attention.

Exercise studies also showed significant differences in substrate utilization between groups where SED possessed a significantly lower fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity. The correlation of different bioenergetic parameters between resting and exercise conditions were robust, suggesting the possibility of performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) as a non-invasive methodology to indirectly assess metabolic function in multiple populations. In summary, in our study herein, we show that ""healthy sedentary"" individuals already possess a significant decrease in cellular metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics compared to moderately active individuals both during resting and exercising conditions.

Since large numbers of sedentary individuals evolve to develop cardiometabolic disease, a better understanding of decreased cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial function is needed in order to improve both diagnosis and treatment of multiple metabolic diseases.

- Despite similar GLUT-4 concentrations, sedentary individuals show significant decreased pyruvate oxidation as well as expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC).
- During exercise studies, sedentary individuals show significantly decreased levels of fat oxidation and lactate clearance capacity which correlate with mitochondrial and bioenergetics parameters from resting muscle biopsies. Hence, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) accompanied by measuring blood lactate levels could be a practical manner to assess muscle mitochondrial function and bioenergetics in a non-invasive and ambulatory manner.
- Identifying early signatures of decreased mitochondrial function and bioenergetics capacity could be an important approach to prevent or improve different metabolic diseases through lifestyle changes mainly from exercise and nutrition.","NA","biorxiv",1728338966288
