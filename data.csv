This study identified over 421 million single-nucleotide variants and indels, as well as more than 600 million copy-number and structural variants. Small variants had 756 million molecular effects annotated. Of 7.7 million polymorphic variants having an allele frequency (AF) of more than 5% in EGP, 1,348 have a predicted deleterious effect on a protein. Characterization with respect to global variation shows that EGP represents a genetic continuum encompassing the range of African, Asian, and European populations. It is best described by two components: Arabian, Eurasian, and African, with the predominant Arabian component linked to mitochondrial haplogroups J and T, which are commonly attributed to the Middle East. Various aneuploidies of sex chromosomes were detected in 93 individuals overall, and specifically, aneuploidy of chromosome 21 was identified in 41 individuals. The median inbreeding coefficient and cumulative runs of homozygosity (ROHs) lengths were increased due to extensive consanguinity, were largest in the groups with Arabian main ancestry components, and were higher than those reported for Qatar. Families were identified based on genetic relatedness and classified into 264 families with unrelated parents and 247 families with third- and fourth-degree consanguineous parents. Representative consanguineous pedigrees of families in EGP were outlined. Cumulative ROHs were affected by the main ancestry component and significantly increased in offspring of consanguineous parents, with a pronounced difference between 3rd and 4th-degree relatedness. Investigation of cumulative AFs of variants causing Mendelian diseases highlighted genes related to alpha- and beta-thalassemia (HBB, HBA2) and revealed a high burden of variants associated with severe recessive diseases, metabolic and retinal disorders, and hearing loss. In summary, EGP represents a landmark effort in characterizing the genetic diversity of the Emirati population, leveraging the largest Middle Eastern cohort reported to date.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1757974105316

Most TMPs follow a conventional secretory pathway confined to the cell soma, where they are translated at the rough ER, exit through ER exit sites (ERES) to reach the Golgi apparatus (GA), prior to their delivery to the plasma membrane (PM). Intriguingly, we recently found that many mRNAs encoding TMPs are associated with the axonally-enriched ER-protein P180, which facilitates axonal ER-ribosome interaction and regulates local translation. Given the absence of the GA in the axon, it remains unknown how locally synthesized TMPs leave the ER and reach the axonal PM. Here, we visualized the translation of different axonal TMPs within the axon and followed their trafficking from the ER. We found that a fraction of neosynthesized cargos follow an unconventional route, exiting the axonal ER and reaching the PM independent of the GA. Notably, we identified axonal ERES components tightly associated with the axonal ER. Removal of these components prevents TMP exit from the axonal ER, while addition of external cues increases the number of axonal ERES and Golgi-bypassing cargos. Moreover, we identified the ER-translation regulator HDLBP and the NRZ-SEC22B vesicular tether complex associated with axonal ERES and involved in unconventional secretion. Local removal of axonal ERES components or depletion of these identified players causes defects in axon growth and bouton assembly. We propose a novel mechanism coupling local TMP translation and secretion to the PM at the axonal ER, which is essential for neuronal development.

The NAc is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders. Rodent studies have identified spatial organization of heterogeneous medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes across the NAc core and shell, but the extent to which this cellular diversity and spatial organization is conserved in the human brain remains unclear. Here, we generated a spatiomolecular atlas of NAc cell types and spatial domains by integrating spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from postmortem NAc tissue from 10 neurotypical adult donors. We identified 20 transcriptionally unique cell populations and 8 spatial domains, including specialized D1 islands composed of distinct dopamine receptor 1 (DRD1) MSN subtypes, which were enriched for OPRM1. In contrast to a discrete core vs. shell division, we observed continuous spatial gradients of gene expression across MSN domains, suggesting a more complex organization of DRD1 and DRD2 MSNs. Cross-species comparisons demonstrated conservation of MSN subtypes and spatial features between human, rodent, and nonhuman primate NAc. Genetic enrichment analysis with stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression revealed specific spatial domains associated with risk for psychiatric and addiction-related traits. To investigate this further, we spatially mapped ligand-receptor interactions involving neuropsychiatric risk genes. Finally, we leveraged existing rodent NAc data to identify drug-responsive transcriptional programs and predict their spatial distribution in the human NAc. Collectively, we provide a spatiomolecular framework for understanding the human NAc and its relevance to neuropsychiatric disease.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM139580;R01DA053581;""},{""name"":""Lieber Institute for Brain Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q36wn27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105316

However, their analysis is complicated by measurement noise and bias, differences between batches, technology platforms, and restricted antibody panels. This results in a limited capacity to accumulate knowledge across technologies, studies, experimental batches, or across different antibody panels. Here, we present CytoVI - a probabilistic generative model designed to address these challenges and enable statistically rigorous and integrative analysis for antibody-based single cell technologies. We show that CytoVI outperforms existing computational methods and effectively handles a variety of integration scenarios. CytoVI enables key functionalities such as generating informative cell embeddings, imputing missing measurements, differential protein expression testing, and automated annotation of cells. We applied CytoVI to generate an integrated B cell maturation atlas across 350 proteins from a set of smaller antibody panels measured by conventional mass cytometry, and identified proteins associated with immunoglobulin class-switching in healthy humans. Using a cohort of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients measured by flow cytometry, CytoVI uncovered T cell states that are associated with disease. Finally, we show that CytoVI is a robust probabilistic framework for the analysis of standard diagnostic flow cytometry antibody panels, enabling the automated detection of tumor populations and diagnoses of incoming patient samples.

One important aspect of such networks is experience-dependent plasticity: their activity changes after repeated exposures to external and internal physiological stimuli. This kind of functional plasticity gives rise to habituation to pharmacological interventions (resulting in loss of efficacy over time), sensitization (resulting in unacceptable side effects after repeated use), or canalizing of undesired dynamics that recur even when the original problem has been resolved (persistent disease states). Our in silico analyses reveal that memories formed in gene regulatory networks can be erased by specific further experiences without any changes of network topology (leaving the connectivity in place). We present a method for discovery of stimuli that can be used to selectively delete physiological memories, which can be used to remove unwanted behaviors in biomedical and bioengineering contexts without gene therapy or genomic editing. Remarkably, not only are the training-induced gains in causal emergence not lost after stimuli that wipe memories, but we also find a positive relationship between the causal emergence and learning ability of a network, suggesting a deep asymmetry (ratchet) in the relationship between learning/forgetting and integration of collective intelligence which may have implications for evolution.","[{""name"":""John Templeton Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/035tnyy05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Templeton World Charity Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00x0z1472"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Astonishing Labs"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105316

We developed highly efficient, in vivo RNA electroporation-based single-cell gene editing to investigate neuronal responses to loss of fast inhibition. Using CRISPR-Cas9 components delivered as RNA, we knocked out GABA-A receptor {beta} subunits in individual layer 2/3 cortical neurons in mouse visual cortex, eliminating fast inhibition. In vivo patch-clamp recordings revealed that cortical neurons adapted to inhibition loss through two sequential mechanisms: a transient reduction of excitatory synaptic input, followed by intrinsic membrane property changes that decreased input resistance. This sequential adaptation program ultimately prevented target neurons from contributing spikes to the cortical network. Our RNA-based single-cell gene editing approach enables investigation of cellular responses independent of network effects, providing new insights into neuronal homeostasis and gene function in individual cells in vivo.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105316

We present CenSegNet (Centrosome Segmentation Network), a modular deep learning framework for high-resolution, context-aware segmentation of centrosomes and epithelial architecture across diverse tissue types. Integrating a dual-branch architecture with uncertainty-guided refinement, CenSegNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalisability across both immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry modalities, outperforming existing models in accuracy and morphological fidelity. Applied to tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 911 breast cancer sample cores from 127 patients, CenSegNet enables the first large-scale, spatially resolved quantification of numerical and structural CA at single-cell resolution. These CA subtypes are mechanistically uncoupled, exhibiting distinct spatial distributions, age-dependent dynamics, and associations with histological tumour grade, hormone receptor status, genomic alterations, and nodal involvement. Discordant CA profiles at tumour margins are linked to local aggressiveness and stromal remodelling, underscoring their clinical relevance. To support broad adoption and reproducibility, CenSegNet is released as an open-source Python library. Together, our findings establish CenSegNet as a scalable, generalisable platform for spatially resolved centrosome phenotyping in intact tissues, enabling systematic dissection of the biology of this organelle and its dysregulation in cancer and other epithelial diseases.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/R026610/1;""},{""name"":""Breast Cancer Now"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qa92s63"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""China Scholarship Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04atp4p48"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105316

APP trafficking and processing depend on the endo-lysosomal system, but the molecular mechanisms that coordinate these processes remain unclear. Here, we studied the HOPS complex, a central regulator of endo-lysosomal maturation. We show that HOPS disruption impairs retromer-mediated recycling of APP to the TGN, resulting in the accumulation of APP in late endosomes. In neurons, this accumulation is spatially restricted to somatodendritic endosomes. These APP-containing endosomes are catalytically inactive and lack the {gamma}-secretase subunit PSEN2. However, they do contain BACE1, which leads to the build-up of toxic APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) upon HOPS disruption. Notably, loss of HOPS enhances secretion of APP-CTFs by exosomes, suggesting a potential mechanism for disease propagation. Together, our findings establish a mechanistic link between HOPS dysfunction and aberrant APP processing, with implications for neurodegeneration.","[{""name"":""Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OCENW.KLEIN.236;""},{""name"":""Alzheimer Nederland"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cw2h814"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NL-19064;WE.03-2023-13;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105316

We tested the hypothesis that individual HD cells show differences in their firing patterns and connectivity by recording and juxtacellularly labeling single HD cells in subregions of the ADn in awake mice during passive rotation. We identified HD cells that exhibited different response profiles to light, sound, and movement. We also identified a mediolateral gradient of calretinin-expressing (CR+) ADn cells, with CR+ HD cells having narrower tuning widths, lower maximal firing rates, and different intrinsic properties compared to CR- cells. Axons of labeled HD cells could be followed to the retrosplenial cortex, with collaterals innervating the thalamic reticular nucleus (type I cells); others additionally innervated the dorsomedial striatum (type II cells). Most medial CR+ cells preferentially projected to ventral retrohippocampal regions. Surprisingly, we also identified a subpopulation of medial CR+ cells with twisted dendrites and descending axons that avoided the thalamic reticular nucleus, termed tortuosa HD cells (type III cells).

Previous research has primarily examined these principles under carbon-limited conditions, demonstrating how microbes optimize their proteomic resources to balance metabolic efficiency and growth rates. This study extends this thermodynamic framework to explore microbial metabolism under various non-carbon nutrient limitations (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur). By integrating literature data from a range of species it is shown that growth under anabolic nutrient limitations consistently results in more negative Gibbs free energy ({triangleup}G) values for the Net Catabolic Reaction (NCR), when normalized per unit of biomass formed, compared to carbon-limited scenarios. The findings suggest three, potentially complementary hypotheses: 1. the Proteome Allocation Hypothesis, microbes favour faster (higher kcat) enzymes to reduce proteome fraction used for catabolism, thus freeing proteome resources for additional nutrient transporters; 2. Coupled Transport Contribution Hypothesis: The more negative {triangleup}G of the NCR may in part stem from the increased reliance on ATP-coupled or energetically driven transport mechanisms for nutrient uptake under limitation; 3. Bioenergetic Efficiency Hypothesis: microbes prefer pathways with more negative {triangleup}G to enhance cellular energy status to support nutrient uptake under anabolic limitations. Hereby, this integrative thermodynamic analysis broadens the understanding of microbial adaptation strategies and provides valuable insights for biotechnological applications in metabolic engineering and fermentation process optimization.","[{""name"":""Germany‚Äôs Excellence Strategy EXC-2048/2"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Project ID 390686111;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft CRC1535/1-B04"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Project ID 458090666;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105316

We find that these mutations generate subpopulations of bacteria with reduced capsule expression and mucoidy. In vitro and in vivo infection models reveal that phase variation to the OFF state facilitates epithelial cell infection while ON switching enhances resistance to the bactericidal activity of human serum and systemic spread to the liver and spleen in a murine infection model. Genomic analysis reveals that the phase variation mechanism is a conserved feature of all HVKp and that additional novel DNA repeats in rmpD and rmpC drive different combinations of capsule mucoidy and hyperexpression phenotypes.

Their versatility stems from the tunability of the flavin cofactor's one- and two-electron reduction potentials via interactions with the protein scaffold, which have dramatic influence on reactivity. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how the flavin-binding pocket modulates redox thermodynamics, few have been validated through quantitative experiments. In this study, we investigate how the flavin N5 environment influences the redox properties of the flavin mononucleotide cofactor in the improved light-oxygen-voltage (iLOV) sensing protein using site-directed mutagenesis, redox titrations, and hybrid quantum mechanical molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods combined with classical alchemical free energy simulations. Mutating the residue Q103, which interacts with the flavin N5 and O4' ; atoms in the X-ray crystallographic structure, exerts a modest < 35 mV effect on the overall two-electron reduction potential, but significantly alters the potential separation of the two one-electron couples (potential crossing) by up to 168 mV. QM/MM and free energy calculations reveal that water penetration into the flavin binding pocket near N5 and O4' largely explains the trend in reduction potentials among the mutants. The results suggest a molecular mechanism of flavin tuning in which hydrogen bonding to the neutral semiquinone, either directly by the side-chain or a protein-penetrating water, contributes significantly to the potential crossing. These findings establish quantitative experimental benchmarks for theoretical models and advance a molecular mechanism for redox tuning in flavoproteins.","[{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CHE-2047667;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105316

Autoregulation breakpoints were reliably identified by fUS, particularly the lower limit, while the upper limit was more variable.

Previous studies have described a hierarchical progression across the auditory pathway, characterized by a decrease in the temporal precision of AM encoding. In human and nonhuman primates (NHP), the left hemisphere exhibits enhanced temporal encoding relative to the right hemisphere. The NHP model provides an opportunity to understand what circuit mechanisms generate these transformations in encoding by characterizing AM encoding in different intracortical circuits, and across the cortical hierarchy. To address this, here we report the encoding of AM signals as a function of cortical layer and hemisphere in NHP core and parabelt auditory cortex (AC). We recorded electrophysiological activity using linear array multielectrodes positioned across cortical layers while AM noise and click trains were presented to awake NHPs. Core AC typically encoded all AM frequencies (1.6-200 Hz) with high ( > 90%) classification accuracy, while sites in the parabelt encoded a subset of lower (~1.6-25 Hz) frequencies. Across both areas, the granular and infragranular layers displayed enhanced AM encoding relative to the supragranular layers. Both areas displayed enhanced AM encoding in the left hemisphere, restricted to the supragranular layers. These results represent the first analysis of AM encoding in the parabelt, indicating that significant temporal encoding of AM is still present in tertiary auditory cortex, and the layer-specific hemispheric differences suggest a potential supragranular layer origin of previously documented left-hemisphere dominance in temporal encoding.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04mhx6838"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01DC015780;R01DC012947;R01DC019979;""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P50MH109429;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105316

Testing the rhythmic properties of the adult visual system with periodic or broadband visual stimulation elicited neural resonance phenomena at [~]10Hz alpha rhythm. Here, we extend this approach to reveal the inherent rhythmic properties of the infant brain. Eight-month-olds (N = 42) were presented with visual stimuli flickering at discrete frequencies (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, and 30Hz) and broadband (i.e., aperiodic) stimulation, while recording a high-density electroencephalogram (EEG). As predicted, infants visual system entrained to the harmonics of the periodic stimulation frequencies (first to third). In addition, a 4Hz rhythm emerged independent of stimulation frequency. Critically, the impulse response function (IRF) of the broadband sequence revealed a perceptual echo of visual information at 4Hz. This echo lasted for about 1 second (i.e. four cycles), extended into frontal sensors, and selectively resonated the 4Hz component of the input signal. In a complementary adult assessment, we confirm an alpha response upon periodic and broadband stimulation in the present paradigm for the mature visual system. To conclude, perturbing the infant visual system elicited a neural response and resonant activity at the 4Hz theta rhythm, which contrasts with the 10Hz alpha rhythm found in the adult visual system. Neural processing dynamics are thus essential to understand early brain development in full.

Significance StatementThis study tested resonance properties of the infant visual system upon perturbation. For the visual stimulation at discrete frequencies between 2 and 30Hz, the infant brain responded at 4Hz independent of the stimulation frequency. Following broadband stimulation, a perceptual echo at 4Hz emerged - resonating the 4Hz component of visual information over several cycles. These findings reveal that the 4Hz theta rhythm is an inherent processing dynamic of the infant visual system, contrasting with the 10Hz rhythm found in adults. The processing dynamics of the human visual system undergo fundamental changes from infancy into adulthood.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""KO 6028/1-1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105316

While transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of protein expression is well characterized, the subcellular interactions between secreted proteins and trafficking machinery are less explored. To address this, we systematically mapped protein protein interactions (PPIs) involved in the secretion of interleukin 2 (IL2) from human T cells using proximity based labeling coupled with mass spectrometry. Our analysis revealed significant enrichment of proteins associated with conventional secretory pathways, including ER to Golgi transport, protein folding, and vesicle mediated trafficking. Functional validation confirmed that several of these proteins are critical for IL2 secretion, underscoring their direct roles in cytokine processing. In addition, time resolved profiling of PPIs and transcriptomic changes following T cell stimulation revealed dynamic remodeling of the cytokine secretion machinery, reflecting multilayered regulation at both the protein and gene expression levels. These findings offer a systems level understanding of IL2 secretion and identify new molecular components that can be targeted to modulate immune responses.

While short-read (SR) sequencing has enabled broad insights at gene-level diversity, the inherently limited read length constrains the reconstruction of complete genomes. Conversely, HiFi-LR sequencing enhances the quality and completeness of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), enabling higher-resolution taxonomic and functional annotation. However, the cost and relatively low throughput of HiFi-LR sequencing can limit genome recovery, particularly at the binning stage, where coverage depth is critical. Results: Here, we present a novel hybrid strategy that differs from classical hybrid assemblies, where SR and LR reads are jointly used at the assembly step. Instead, we use high-depth SR data to improve the binning of HiFi-LR contigs. Using both SR and HiFi-LR metagenomic data generated from a tunnel-cultivated soil sample, we demonstrate that SR-derived coverage information significantly improves the binning of HiFi-LR assemblies. This results in a substantial increase in the number and quality of recovered MAGs compared to using HiFi-LR data alone and an uncomparable improvement compared to SR data alone. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the power of combining SR and LR in highly diverse environments, such as soil, not for hybrid assembly per se, but to enhance the downstream binning process. The combination of SR and LR data substantially improves the downstream binning process and overall genome recovery. Importantly, this approach underscores the potential of leveraging the vast amount of publicly available Illumina metagenomic datasets. Completing existing SR resources with PacBio HiFi sequencing can maximise assembly contiguity and binning accuracy using massive amounts of SR data already generated. This highlights a practical and forward-looking strategy for microbiome research, where novel LR technologies will bring new value to previous short-read efforts.","[{""name"":""French National Research Agency"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-22-PEAE-0011;ANR-15-IDEX-01;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105316

Critically, recurrent excitation within the evidence integration (EI) population supports sensory evidence accumulation, working memory for sequential sampling, and reward rate optimisation.

Proteins are inherently dynamic, interconverting among conformational states that govern their function. Perturbations such as mutations, ligand binding, and pH changes modulate these dynamics and are implicated in many diseases. While cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has transformed structure determination, it typically yields an averaged density map representing a static snapshot. A central challenge remains capturing the thermodynamics underlying protein motions and corresponding structural fingerprints that modulate function. CryoPhold enables Bayesian reweighting of AlphaFold-generated structural ensembles against experimental cryo-EM maps, generating posterior structural ensembles that are consistent with experimental data while preserving conformational heterogeneity. Molecular simulations seeded from the posterior ensemble capture time-dependent dynamics, while machine learning models trained on featurized molecular simulation data identify structural fingerprints (""hotspots"") that modulate protein dynamics. Finally, Markov state models trained on featurized molecular simulation data quantify metastable state populations and free-energy landscapes. By integrating a generative AI-based protein structure prediction model, experimental cryo-EM density, physics-based sampling, and machine learning, CryoPhold enables dynamics paradigm to capture biomolecular motion. The workflow enables prediction of equilibrium populations and structural fingerprints governing conformational dynamics in human transporter protein, GlyT1. It further captures structural changes and population shifts associated with oncogenic BRAF mutants, key driving factors behind melanoma progression.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

Beyond genetic adaptation, plastic responses to the environment can alter phenotypes and fitness, ultimately driving evolution. However, the interaction between plasticity and adaptation during environmental change is complex and hard to measure in natural systems. Here, we used two populations of Tigriopus californicus copepods, a thermally tolerant southern population and a thermally sensitive northern population, to conduct a fully factorial split brood experiment where we exposed animals as larvae and adults to either a sublethal heat stress or control (no heat treatment) before measuring heat tolerance and gene expression patterns. We found that increased thermal tolerance across populations came at the expense of physiological plasticity and evolved through higher baseline expression of heat stress response genes across environmental contexts as well as increased gene expression plasticity in response to heat stress. In the thermally sensitive northern population, developmental exposure to heat stress led to higher adult tolerance and lower physiological plasticity underpinned by higher gene expression plasticity. Importantly, we found that the same set of genes were largely responsible for both the evolved higher tolerance in the southern population and the developmentally induced tolerance in the northern population suggesting that in this system, a shared molecular response contributes to acclimation and adaptation across both populations. These results link existing physiological plasticity with long-term evolutionary responses providing insight into how these populations will adapt and respond to future environmental change.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology 2305966;NSF IOS 2154283;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

Changes in m6A status have been implicated in many different types of cancer, including glioblastoma where acquired resistance to temozolomide remains a major clinical challenge. We established glioblastoma cell culture models of acquired temozolomide resistance and analyzed the role of m6A in controlling resistance-associated pathways. We show that m6A stabilizes key genes and pathways promoting temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma, including MGMT, the enzyme that repairs primary temzolomide-induced DNA damage, and PI3K/Akt signaling, a major driver of chemoresistance. Pharmacological inhibition of the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 destabilizes MGMT and other critical mRNAs, restoring temozolomide sensitivity. Collectively, our results suggest that genes associated with temozolomide resistance are stabilized by m6A methylation, even as the majority of the transcriptome remains subject to canonical m6A-mediated mRNA decay. Moreover, these data highlight METTL3 inhibition as a promising therapeutic approach to overcoming temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM146919;R01HG011868;T32GM007499;T32GM145469;F31CA306101;1S10OD030363-01A1;""},{""name"":""Sontag Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01pkpj777"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""American Cancer Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02e463172"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

Prior maps in dogs were based on the canFam3.1 genome assembly, which contains thousands of sequence gaps that include functional elements. Although long-read technologies have enabled the generation of updated reference assemblies, updated maps are required to take full advantage of these new resources. Methods: We inferred fine-scale recombination maps that consider population demographic history for four populations of village dogs sequenced by the Dog10K Consortium. We compare properties among the newly generated and previously published maps and assess the effects of genetic map choice on genotype phasing accuracy. Results: The newly inferred maps are broadly consistent with previous studies of recombination in dogs. At small scales, stronger correlations are observed among maps inferred using linkage disequilibrium than with a pedigree-based map. The position of recombination hotspots showed significant overlap among inferred maps and were enriched for sequences that were gaps in a previous canine genome assembly. When using the Dog10K samples as a reference panel, a phase error rate of approximately 2% was found with the choice of genetic map having little effect. Conclusions: We describe genetic maps based on the canFam4 assembly which will be useful for future studies of genetic variation that rely on updated dog genome references.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

Dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) agonists treat PD-associated motor deficits by acting on postsynaptic receptors located within the striatum that have been upregulated due dopamine loss. However, mechanisms that contribute to increased D2R activity in PD that enhance D2R function are poorly described. Spinophilin is a protein phosphatase 1 targeting protein that is expressed in postsynaptic dendritic spines and interacts with postsynaptic D2Rs. However, how spinophilin regulates D2R function is unknown. In the current study, we found that genetic knockout of spinophilin limited the suppression of locomotion caused by the D2R agonist, quinpirole. Mechanistically, we found that spinophilin is required for quinpirole-induced increases in the interaction of the D2R with intracellular proteins, suggesting spinophilin mediates agonist-induced D2R internalization. Therefore, our data support future studies targeting the spinophilin/D2R interaction to enhance the efficacy of current PD therapeutics.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02jzrsm59"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R21AA030319;""},{""name"":""National Institute on Drug Abuse"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00fq5cm18"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R33DA041876;""},{""name"":""National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04pw6fb54"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UL1TR002529;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30CA082709;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

Here we present intelligent tool orchestration through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that enable Large Language Models (LLMs) agents to function as AI laboratory assistants for rapid model prototyping. We demonstrate this approach by constructing a multiscale model of cancer cell fate in response to TNF, entirely through natural language interactions, using an AI agent connected to MCP servers that interface with three complementary modeling software: NeKo for constructing gene regulatory networks from prior-knowledge databases, MaBoSS for simulating and analyzing Boolean models, and PhysiCell for setting up multicellular agent-based models. Our architecture encompasses more than 60 specialized tools, covering the entire workflow from data collection to multicellular simulation setup. From this use case we derived three key design principles for biological AI-tool integration: first, optimal tool granularity is best defined at biological decision points, where domain knowledge guides modeling choices; second, comprehensive session management is essential for tracking complex workflows and ensuring reproducibility across long interactions; and third, effective orchestration must be established from the start to let LLMs combine tools flexibly while maintaining biological coherence. In applying this framework across three different LLMs and scenarios, we observed consistent end-to-end orchestration as well as model-dependent differences in network size, dynamical behaviors, and integration details. This variability highlights both the portability of our approach and the importance of careful reporting and validation when deploying different LLMs in scientific contexts. While the resulting models require refinement, this work establishes the foundation for AI-assisted rapid prototyping in systems biology, enabling researchers to explore computational hypotheses at unprecedented speed while maintaining biological fidelity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

Demyelinated axons that are not remyelinated are vulnerable to irreversible degeneration and therefore therapies that enhance remyelination have been sought. However, there remains a paucity of suitable outcome measures to assess their efficacy. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that is used both preclinically and clinically for the assessment of anatomy and tissue function. Here we describe an MRI technique for following the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into oligodendrocytes during the spontaneous regenerative process of remyelination in vivo. OPCs were transduced in situ with a lentiviral vector expressing an organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp1a1) under the control of the differentiation-specific Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) promoter. Oatp1a1 mediates cell uptake of a gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent (Primovist), allowing detection of the cells in T1-weighted MR images. Uptake of the contrast agent is restricted to MBP-expressing cells, which is most highly expressed during myelin sheath formation, thereby allowing progenitor-mediated, and potentially oligodendrocyte-mediated, remyelination to be monitored non-invasively in vivo using MRI. These findings provide the foundation for the development of direct methods for assessing the efficacy of pro-remyelination therapies.","[{""name"":""Dr Miriam and Sheldon Medical Research Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""n/a;""},{""name"":""MS Society, UK"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MS50;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""203151/Z/16/Z;""},{""name"":""Cancer Research UK"",""id"":""https://ror.org/054225q67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""C197/A29580;C197/A17242;C9685/A25177;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in rats are modulated by various behavioral contexts and are thought to represent affective-like states. However, their diversity during palatable food consumption remains underexplored. In this study, we investigated acoustic features of USVs in male rats consuming chocolate, a highly palatable food. Using a machine-learning-assisted logistic regression model trained on spectrogram features, we identified a distinct USV subtype -- the 40-kHz inverted-U type -- that was selectively emitted during chocolate consumption. The emission of this subtype was tightly time-locked to chocolate feeding behavior. Systemic administration of naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, significantly reduced the emission of the 40-kHz inverted-U USVs during chocolate intake. These findings suggest that these USVs may reflect internal states associated with palatable feeding and are under modulation by the endogenous opioid system. Moreover, our data demonstrate the utility of machine learning for high-throughput, objective classification of USV subtypes. This framework provides a promising approach for decoding emotion-related vocal expressions in rats and highlights the potential of specific USVs as behavioral readouts for studying the neurobiology of positive emotions.","[{""name"":""Lotte Research Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Urakami Foundation for Food and Food Culture Promotion"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Takeda Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02y123g31"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""17KK0190;20H05955;21H05817;21K06440;24K02131;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

Here, NRF2 was pharmacologically activated via CDDO-Me (hitherto referred to as CDDO) to reduce the negative consequences on AC16 human cardiomyocyte cell health and functions.

Lifespan analysis revealed a trajectory of rapid claustrum volume increase from infancy to adolescence (~ 1 - 15 years, annual growth 39.300 mm3/year), a plateau phase from early to middle adulthood (~ 15 - 40 years, annual change 0.153 mm3/year), and a subsequent decline from middle adulthood to old age (~ 40 - 80 years, annual decrease 10.325 mm3/year). The right claustrum was on average larger than the left one across all ages. Finally, overall, females had larger total intracranial volume-adjusted claustrum volumes than males across the lifespan. Results demonstrate a distinct effect of age, hemisphere, and sex on claustrum volume. Data provide a comprehensive framework for sex- and hemisphere-sensitive claustrum structure lifespan trajectories relevant for studying neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative effects on the claustrum.","[{""name"":""T√úB&#304;TAK Marmara Research Center"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1059B142201145;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

The complexity of these habitats makes the in situ study of community dynamics after coalescence challenging, highlighting the need for controlled experiments to unravel the factors influencing the coalescence in the estuary. To study these processes, we combined natural freshwater and seawater bacterial communities at five different mixing ratios and incubated them in parallel microcosms containing freshwater or seawater incubation media. Forty mixed communities were tracked over six passages using Nanopore full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In the original field samples, freshwater hosted more diverse communities than seawater. While the communities were structurally distinct, shared bacterial families accounted for approximately 95% of total reads. Many low-abundance taxa were lost upon laboratory incubation, while potentially faster-growing ones were enriched. We found that the coalescence outcome was strongly shaped by the incubation media, whereas the mixing ratio had a minor influence. Mixed communities converged toward the source community native to the incubation media, with increasing similarity at a higher source community proportion. In freshwater, a 25% inoculum of the freshwater community was sufficient to re-establish a near-native freshwater community, whereas in seawater, similarity to the native seawater community depended on the inoculation ratio. Network analysis showed a tightly connected module of seawater families, reflecting their shared habitat preference or cooperation, whereas freshwater families were more loosely connected. We also observed that most families were unaffected by mixing ratios or temporal dynamics, with only a few showing mixing ratio dependence. For instance, the freshwater family Comamonadaceae and seawater families Marinomonadaceae and Pseudoalteromonadaceae were dominant in their respective native environments, and increased in mixed communities in proportion to their initial source proportion. Overall, environmental filtering had a stronger impact than the mixing ratio of source communities on coalesced communities, with habitat-specific taxa further modulating the outcome. These findings advanced our understanding of microbial responses to coalescence and provided insights into microbial community assembly in dynamic estuarine systems.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""390713860;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""865694;""},{""name"":""Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012kf4317"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Alexander von Humboldt-Professorship;""},{""name"":""German Federal Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""03ZU1107KA;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), the master transcription factor, is pivotal in IFN induction, particularly in myeloid cells. Ubiquitination of IRF7 is essential for its transcriptional activation; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that deubiquitinases (DUBs) act as endogenous regulators of IRF7 activity and conducted a genetic screen using a human DUB-targeted siRNA library. This screen identified USP2 as a positive regulator and OTUD5 as a negative regulator of IRF7 activity. OTUD5, an inducible DUB, physically interacted with IRF7 and inhibited its K63-linked ubiquitination, thereby suppressing IRF7 activation. Conversely, USP2 promoted IRF7 activity by binding to IRF7 and removing K27-linked ubiquitin chains, which we found to be inhibitory. Specifically, K27-linked ubiquitination impeded phosphorylation of IRF7, a critical step for its activation. Collectively, our genetic screen and mechanistic studies uncovered USP2 and OTUD5 as novel modulators of IRF7 function, providing new insights into the regulation of antiviral immunity.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AI155545;AI165521;AA027456;AI184880;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

The objective here was to assess the association between HR use and UFs independent of known risk factors as well as to quantify HR use impact in the population of women of reproductive age. A facility-based case control study was employed to assess the HR-UF association among 264 women presenting to the gynaecologic clinic within Kenyatta National Hospital between 23rd October and 19th December 2024. All cases were prospectively recruited while controls were simple randomly sampled from the clinics appointment schedule and frequency-matched to cases by day of presentation. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the HR-UF association, adjusting for the effect of potential confounders. Thereafter, a population attributable fraction (PAF) (along with its confidence interval) was estimated. The odds of UFs among HR users was approximately five times higher than non-users (OR=5.12, 95% CI: 3.00-8.73, <0.001). This relationship was not confounded by the studied covariates. The PAF estimate for the association was 59.2% (95% CI: 47.2-71.7) - suggesting that about three-fifths of UFs in this population could be prevented if HRs were not used. These findings call for more rigorous enforcement of existing legislations that regulate the supply and use of HRs in the country, with a view to safeguarding consumer health.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1757974105317

However, the circuit structure of a CPG for walking is not known in any animal. To identify the cells and synapses that underlie rhythmic leg movement in walking flies, we developed dynamic simulations of the Drosophila ventral nerve cord (VNC) connectomes. We used a computational activation screen to identify descending neurons from the brain that drive rhythmic activity in leg motor neurons, including a command neuron for walking (DNg100). By synthetic pruning of the VNC network, we isolated a minimal three-neuron rhythm-generating circuit consisting of one inhibitory and two excitatory interneurons. A model of this core CPG circuit is sufficient to generate motor rhythms, and the two excitatory neurons are necessary in the VNC network model. Connectome simulations also predicted that parallel descending neurons (DNb08) produce rhythmic leg movements, which we experimentally confirmed using optogenetics in behaving flies. Our results reveal the cellular identity and synaptic structure of a putative CPG circuit for fly walking.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

Through interactome profiling of misfolded tau aggregates from PBS- and sarkosyl-soluble fractions, we identified 493 high-confidence proteins with disease specificity and no overlap across diseases. Machine learning classification achieved compelling discrimination between diseases, demonstrating molecular signatures underlying clinical heterogeneity. AD tau aggregates engaged cellular metabolism machinery and glutamate/GABA cycling components, showing 27-fold enrichment over other tauopathies. PSP tau displayed the most distinctive profile, with protein depletion and selective enrichment of proteasome components. DLB tau associated with neurogenesis modulators while depleting neuroinflammatory mediators. These interactors were validated through proximity ligation assays and correlated with distinct post-translational modifications. Critically, sarkosyl-soluble fractions revealed reduced interactome complexity across diseases, except PSP tau which maintained interactions with GPCR-ERK signaling and kinetochore proteins, suggesting unique aggregation mechanisms.

Reaggregated early gastrula cells (here called gastruloids) of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis are able to regenerate with only little delay whole organisms that are virtually indistinguishable from normal developing polyps. However, the molecular control underlying the restoration of body axis and germ layers remains largely unknown. To address this, we established a standardized protocol, which reproducibly generates gastruloids developing into polys with a single body axis. Here, we show that committed mesodermal and endodermal cells are sorted out to the surface of the aggregate, where mesodermal cells form clusters of about 30 cells. At a critical time point, one mesodermal cluster immigrates, along with peripherally attached endodermal cells. Thereby, the inner germ layer and the oral-aboral axis is established in one and the same process. Functional studies demonstrated that this polarization of the endodermal cells requires a feedback loop of Notch and Wnt signaling. The dissociation of the early embryo disrupts Notch signaling in the endodermal cells, which leads to transient adoption of an endomesodermal profile, marked by the expression of the mesodermal cadherin1 until the boundaries between the germ layer identities are re-established. Our results highlight distinct morphogenetic behaviors of mesodermal and endodermal cells and the hitherto unknown role of Notch signaling in germ layer boundary formation in self-organizing gastruloids. Conservation of Notch-mediated boundary formation between endoderm and mesoderm mirrors bilaterian mechanisms, demonstrating how adoption of ancestral regulatory networks governing morphogenesis likely enabled the diversification of metazoan body plans.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P34404;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

Here, we combined high-density EEG with a serial awakening paradigm during NREM sleep to examine its neural and experiential correlates. As expected, deeper sleep was associated with reduced cortical activation, reflected in a lower high-to-low frequency power ratio. Yet, this relationship weakened in the presence of dreaming, indicating that immersive conscious experiences can counteract the impact of cortical activation on perceived depth. Indeed, perceived sleep depth was lowest during states with a mere sense of presence and highest during immersive dreaming or deep unconsciousness. Across the night, physiological sleep pressure and subjective sleepiness declined, but perceived sleep depth rose alongside increasing dream immersiveness. These results challenge the view that deep sleep stems solely from reduced brain activity and suggest that immersive dreaming sustains perceived sleep depth as homeostatic pressure wanes.","[{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""948891;""},{""name"":""Ministero dell'Universit√† e della Ricerca"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R2049C8YN3;2022BNE97C;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

It is critically dependent on ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), a mitochondrial reductase that facilitates cuproptosis by reducing ionophore-bound Cu(II) to Cu(I), which triggers its release, and by promoting mitochondrial protein lipoylation, which is directly targeted by the released Cu to drive cell death. Despite the pivotal role of FDX1 in cuproptosis, the structural determinants underlying its distinct functions remain unclear. To address this, we performed deep mutational scanning (DMS) of FDX1 and identified two conserved residues, D136 and D139, on -helix 3 that are critical for both FDX1-mediated lipoylation and cuproptosis. Charge-reversal mutations at these positions abolished FDX1 ability to support lipoylation and induce cuproptosis in cells, despite retaining full enzymatic activity in vitro. Guided by structural and genomic analyses, we further identified dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD), the E3 subunit of lipoylated complexes as an alternative FDX1 reductase both in cells and in vitro. Together, these findings establish -helix 3 of FDX1 as a critical interface for its upstream regulation and suggest that FDX1 roles in lipoylation and cuproptosis are both structurally and functionally linked.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01CA279550;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

Mapping receptor distributions in the brain is therefore necessary for understanding how neurotransmitter systems mediate the link between brain structure and function. Normative receptor density can be estimated using group averages from Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. However, the generalizability and reliability of group-average receptor maps depends on the inter-individual variability of receptor density, which is currently unknown. Here we collect group standard deviation brain maps of PET-estimated protein abundance for 12 different neurotransmitter receptors and transporters across 7 neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, cannabinoid, and opioid. We illustrate how cortical and subcortical inter-individual variability of receptor and transporter density varies across brain regions and across neurotransmitter systems. We complement inter-individual variability with inter-regional variability, and show that receptors that vary more across brain regions than across individuals also demonstrate greater out-of-sample spatial consistency. Altogether, this work quantifies how receptor systems vary in healthy individuals, and provides a means of assessing the generalizability of PET-derived receptor density quantification.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

Somitogenesis, the rhythmic segmentation of vertebrate embryos, is governed by signalling gradients and oscillations in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM)1,2, but the corresponding protein dynamics are largely unknown. Perturbations in this process cause congenital spine disorders and can result in embryonic lethality3. Here, we introduce an integrated proteomics and microfluidics approach to resolve spatiotemporal protein expression in the developing mouse tail. To this end, we established a microfluidic system to synchronize oscillations in embryo tails grown in 3D, which we combined with mass-spectrometry and RNA sequencing. We uncover novel oscillatory proteins and differentially expressed genes along the anteroposterior axis. Building on this dataset, we identify a previously unrecognized antagonistic, dynamic ligand-receptor expression pattern in R-Spondin/LGR signalling explaining how Wnt-oscillation amplitude increases despite decreasing ligand levels in anterior PSM. Dynamic ligand expression was validated in mouse gastruloids. Perturbation of ligand dynamics reduced oscillation amplitude and impaired somite formation. Our study reveals a novel regulatory strategy in which dynamic antagonistic gradients fine-tune signalling strength, providing new mechanistic insight into how protein dynamics control tissue patterning. We anticipate our dataset to serve as foundation for mechanistic investigations of mammalian somitogenesis including the role of mechanics and metabolism. More broadly, our approach combining microfluidics-based synchronization of signalling in multicellular systems with omics analyses can be applied to study dynamics in other contexts such as in tissue homeostasis4 and regeneration5.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

Here we propose to replace interstitial material by air to enhance X-ray phase contrast of the ultrastructural features. We used critical point drying (CPD) of heavy metal-stained mouse brain tissue to produce mechanically stable samples with preserved ultrastructure and enhanced refractive index boundaries, a nanofoam-like material that remains compatible with follow-up conventional resin embedding. Using two complementary synchrotron-based setups, a high-throughput microtomography beamline (P14, DESY) and a nanoscale holographic tomography beamline (ID16A, ESRF), we found that CPD samples consistently showed 2-4x stronger phase-shift signal than conventional resin-embedded tissue. The contrast gain remained consistent across samples, imaging conditions, and beamlines. Our results suggest that CPD offers a versatile route for preparing tissue for subcellular and ultrastructural-resolution X-ray imaging. It retains structural detail while improving signal, and is compatible with other processing procedures like femtosecond laser milling or electron microscopy, paving the path for biological tissue imaging beyond the mm3 scale.","[{""name"":""Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01js2sh04"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""XIMG-13;""},{""name"":""European Synchrotron Radiation Facility"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02550n020"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS3231;IHMA106;""},{""name"":""Cancer Research UK"",""id"":""https://ror.org/054225q67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC2036;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC2036;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC2036;110174/Z/15/Z;EP/W024292/1;""},{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0439y7842"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/W024292/1;EP/V007661/1;""},{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101094250;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""852455;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757974105317

Young donor cells in aged brains rapidly acquired aging phenotypes, particularly in the cerebellum, while old cells in young brains adopted youthful profiles. We identified STAT1-mediated signaling as one axis controlling microglia aging, as STAT1-loss prevented aging trajectories in reconstituted cells. Spatial transcriptomics combined with cell ablation models identified rare natural killer cells as necessary drivers of interferon signaling in aged microglia.

It is a fully automated, end-to-end diagnostic workflow, which automatically extracts NPIFs given a patient tumor slide and uses them to predict tumor subtype and survival.

The 12 NPIFs demonstrate strong and independent prognostic value for patient survival, underscoring their potential as biologically grounded, interpretable biomarkers for survival stratification in BC.

Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.
