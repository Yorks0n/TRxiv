For SARS-CoV-2, much of the population has been imprinted by a viral spike from an early strain, either through vaccination or infection during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence of this imprinting, infection with more recent SARS-CoV-2 strains primarily boosts cross-reactive antibodies elicited by the imprinting strain. Here we compare the neutralizing antibody specificities of imprinted individuals versus infants infected with a recent strain. Specifically, we use pseudovirus-based deep mutational scanning to measure how spike mutations affect neutralization by the serum antibodies of adults and children imprinted by the original vaccine versus infants with a primary infection by a XBB* variant. While the serum neutralizing activity of the imprinted individuals primarily targets the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), serum neutralizing activity of infants only infected with XBB* mostly targets the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). In these infants, secondary exposure to the XBB* spike via vaccination shifts more of the neutralizing activity towards the RBD, although the specific RBD sites targeted are different than for imprinted adults. The dramatic differences in neutralization specificities among individuals with different exposure histories likely impact SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

The role of prothrombotic metabolites in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy remains elusive. Leveraging K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, we observed higher levels of the tryptophan metabolite, kynurenine, compared to controls. SARS-CoV-2 infected mice showed a significant upregulation of enzymes controlling Kynurenine biogenesis, such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase levels in kidneys and liver, respectively, as well as changes in the enzymes involved in kynurenine catabolism, including kynurenine monooxygenase and kynurinase. Consistent with the agonistic role of these metabolites in Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) signaling, AHR activation and its downstream mediator, tissue factor (TF), a highly potent procoagulant factor, was observed in endothelial cells (ECs) of lungs and kidneys of infected mice. These findings were validated in humans, where compared to controls, sera of COVID-19 patients showed increased levels of Kynurenine, kynurenic acid, anthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid. Activation of the AHR-TF axis was noted in the kidneys and lungs of COVID-19 patients, and COVID-19 sera showed higher IDO-1 activity than controls. Levels of Kyn in COVID-19 patients correlated strongly with the TF-inducing activity of COVID-19 sera on ECs. A specific IDO-1 inhibitor or AHR inhibitor separately or in combination suppressed COVID-19 sera-induced TF activity in ECs. Together, we identified IDO-1 as upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in augmented Kyn and its prothrombotic catabolites, thereby suggesting the Kyn-AHR-TF axis as possibly a new diagnostic and/or therapeutic target.

This underexplored phenomenon arises when microbial content is inadvertently exchanged among concurrently processed samples. Such contamination that distort microbial profiles, poses significant risks to the reliability of metagenomic data and downstream analyses. Despite its critical impact, this issue remains insufficiently addressed. To fill this gap, we introduce CroCoDeEL, a decision-support tool for detecting and quantifying cross-sample contamination. Leveraging a pre-trained supervised model, CroCoDeEL identifies contamination patterns in species abundance profiles with high accuracy. Unlike existing tools, it requires no negative controls or prior knowledge of sample processing positions, offering improved accuracy and versatility. Benchmarks across three public datasets demonstrate that CroCoDeEL accurately detects contaminated samples and identifies their contamination sources, even at low rates (<0.1%), provided sufficient sequencing depth. Our findings suggest that cross-sample contamination is prevalent in metagenomics and emphasize the necessity of systematically integrating contamination detection into sequencing data quality control.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

Maternally expressed transcription factors present in the embryo are essential for this process. However, it is unknown if active chromatin modifications established in the gamete are propagated in the embryo as an epigenetic memory to support ZGA and embryonic development. Here, we provide evidence that in Xenopus laevis, H3K4 methylation provides an epigenetic memory of active chromatin states. We show that this is required for faithful zygotic genome activation and successful embryonic development. Chromatin configurations of promoters displaying high H3K4me3 intensity and breadth, alongside DNA hypomethylation and increased GC content, are propagated from the gametes to the embryo across multiple cell divisions and a transcriptionally quiescent phase in early development. We show that this transmission of H3K4 methylation is essential for precise zygotic genome activation and expression of key pioneer ZGA transcription factors Pou5f3.2 and Sox3. Finally, we demonstrate that the H3K4 methyltransferases Kmt2b and Cxxc1 ensure transcription-independent propagation of H3K4me3 and proper zygotic gene expression. In summary, our study establishes the role of H3K4 methylation in maintaining memory of active chromatin states in Xenopus embryos and reveals its importance for successful embryonic development","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

Yet, to date, no predictive theory incorporates the feedback between ecology and evolution while accounting for the evolution of genetic variance under selection, mutation, dispersal, and genetic drift. This study outlines a comprehensive theory showing that under joint evolutionary and population dynamics, the limits of adaptation are fundamentally determined by the three measurable parameters: i) the effective environmental gradient, ii) the effective rate of temporal change, and iii) the neighbourhood size, which represents the local population size accessible via dispersal. Dispersal across heterogeneous environments supports higher local genetic variance, facilitating adaptation to a faster temporal change. However, local diversity is depleted by genetic drift, which is measured by the inverse of neighbourhood size. Extending earlier predictions in stable environments, I use scaling arguments to derive a generalized expansion threshold -- a tipping point where adaptation fails and the species' range can no longer expand. Beyond this threshold, species' ranges also tend to fragment, particularly when temporal change incurs a high fitness cost. The onset of fragmentation is rapid and associated with a loss of genetic variance. The theory not only identifies new phenomena but also establishes a fundamental relationship between these core measurable parameters. It provides a predictive framework for understanding species' range and niche limits while advancing the theoretical foundations for assessing population resilience of spatially structured populations under unprecedented environmental change.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

Bacteriophages, viruses of bacteria, are drivers of gut bacterial composition in the human gut and could affect bifidobacterial abundance. Here, we use a bioinformatics approach to explore the direct interactions occurring between human-associated Bifidobacterium spp. and prophages, as evidenced by their genomes. A total of 1,086 bifidobacterial genomes were analysed in this study, revealing complex systems to prevent viral invasion. Despite their characteristically small genomes, Bifidobacterium strains harboured more than double the number of defence systems as most bacteria. In total, 34 defence system types and 56 subtypes were detected, including several different CRISPR-Cas systems with spacers that targeted almost three-quarters of bifidobacteria-derived prophages. We identified at least one prophage which met our stringent quality control measures in [~]63% of strains, with phages exhibiting high genomic diversity and evidence of historical recombination. Additionally, prophages were found to encode various anti-defence systems, such as anti-CRISPR genes and restriction modification resistance mechanisms. In summary, our investigation reveals ""arms race"" dynamics drive genomic diversity in both bifidobacteria and their phages.

ImportanceMembers of the Bifidobacterium genus are widely acknowledged as being highly important for human health, particularly in infants. To date, there have been a limited number of large-scale studies that have investigated the presence of prophages and anti-viral defence systems of Bifidobacterium strains from multiple human-associated species. Here, we have uncovered a complex set of anti-phage strategies encoded by Bifidobacterium strains. In addition, we have also identified a highly diverse phage mobilome present within the genomes of bifidobacteria across the genus, which also encode several unique systems for overcoming bacterial defences. Elucidating these co-evolutionary dynamics between phages and bifidobacteria may provide valuable insight into developing high-throughput methods for identifying next-generation probiotic or live biotherapeutic candidates, which may then be applied for the prevention and treatment of various diseases in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that type I IFN signaling is necessary for mRNA-LNP-induced IL-27 production, that immunization failed in IL-27 KO mice, and that immunization of IFNAR1-deficient mice with mRNA-LNP particles that also encode IL-27 mRNA restored antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses.

In the past decade, naive hPSCs, representing a pre-implantation stage, have been derived. Naive hPSCs efficiently differentiate towards embryonic and extraembryonic lineages such as trophectoderm, primitive endoderm, and extraembryonic mesoderm, and also self-organize into blastocyst-like structures called blastoids. However, their culture typically relies on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which are variable, resource-intensive, and can confound analyses. We report the long-term maintenance of naive hPSCs in a feeder-free, serum-coated system. We successfully expanded for up to 25 passages 8 different naive hPSCs lines across 5 laboratories. Growth rate, clonogenicity, and gene expression profiles on serum coating were comparable to MEF-based cultures, but serum coating eliminated fibroblast contamination. Naive hPSCs cultured on serum exhibited more efficient germ layer specification, retained trophectoderm potential and high blastoid formation efficiency. Exome sequencing revealed fewer mutations in serum-cultured cells, and mass spectrometry identified extracellular matrix proteins such as vitronectin, fibronectin, and collagens in the serum coating. Overall, serum coating offers a scalable, cost-effective and therefore widely applicable alternative for naive hPSC culture, maintaining developmental potential, reducing DNA mutations, and eliminating MEF-related confounding factors. We believe serum coating will expand the use of naive hPSCs to large-scale studies and facilitate the investigation of mechanistic insights into developmental and disease modelling.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

CEP290 was found throughout the connecting cilium between the microtubules and membrane, with nine-fold symmetry.

Its anticancer mechanism is thought to rely on mitotic arrest of fast-dividing cells and subsequent apoptosis following mitotic spindle disruption. However, paclitaxel reduces tumour size even in slow-dividing tumours, indicating an alternative, poorly characterised mechanism in interphase. Understanding paclitaxels less characterised effects is important for more effective cancer treatments, reducing tumour resistance and drug toxicity in healthy cells.

Here, we found that paclitaxel-induced microtubule reorganisation in interphase also affects the perinuclear distribution of actin and vimentin filaments. The formation of large microtubule-vimentin bundles coincided with nuclear shape deformation, nuclear envelope invaginations, loss of control of nuclear membrane spacing, and changes to nuclear lamina organisation. Concurrently, Lamin A/C protein levels were decreased, and this depended on nuclear-cytoskeletal connectivity through LINC complex component SUN2. Finally, we show that Lamin A/C expression levels, which are often aberrant in cancer cells, are important in determining cell sensitivity to paclitaxel and recovery from treatment. Overall, our data supports nuclear architecture disruption as an additional mechanism for paclitaxel during interphase and independent of mitotic arrest.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

Studies seeking to understand the underlying mechanisms have mostly focused on neurogenetic comparisons with extant species. Here we ask if developmental tempo differences may have also existed between us and our extinct relatives for whom genomes are available. To do so, we nominate a sapiens-specific derived allele, virtually fixed in contemporary populations, which resides in an enhancer region active during early cortical development. The single nucleotide variant is predicted to significantly affect CHD2 expression, a chromatin remodeler known to play an important role in neural development and for which haploinsufficiency is associated with epilepsy and autism. We leverage patient induced pluripotent stem lines (iPSC) and engineered iPSCs in which we reintroduced the ancestral allele and generated heterozygous loss-of-function mutations. We reveal that CHD2 deficiency impairs lysosomal acidification and autophagosome flux. In contrast, ancestralized lines, which we find express higher levels of CHD2, exhibit enhanced lysosomal function and consequently accelerated autophagosome flux, consistent with our observations in chimpanzee and bonobo lines. This set of findings demonstrates that CHD2 dosage critically regulates the autolysosomal pathway. Through deep phenotyping of cortical organoid and neuron cultures, we show that the CHD2-modulated autolysosomal pathway impacts the timing of developmental programs, acquisition of neuronal functional properties and circuit maturation. Finally, we validate an estrogen-dependent rewiring of CHD2 regulation in the evolution of our lineage, providing a mechanistic understanding of how a single nucleotide variant in a regulatory region contributed to the modern pace of neuronal development and maturation.

We show that cannabinoid administration increases the activity of central amygdala (CeA) somatostatin neurons (SOM) and alters basal network dynamics in a manner supporting generation of antagonistic sub-ensembles within the SOM population. Moreover, diverging neuronal population trajectory dynamics and enhanced antagonistic sub-ensemble representation of threat-related behaviors, and enhanced threat-related location representation, were also observed. Lastly, cannabinoid administration increased the proportion of SOM neurons exhibiting multidimensional representation of threat-related behaviors and behavior-location conjunction. While cannabinoid receptor activation ex vivo suppressed excitatory inputs to SOM neurons, our data suggest preferential suppression of local GABA release subserves cannabinoid activation of CeA SOM neurons. These data provide insight into how cannabinoid-mediated presynaptic suppression transforms postsynaptic population dynamics and reveal cellular mechanisms by which cannabinoids could affect threat-reactivity.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

While bacteriophages have developed various anti-CRISPR strategies to counteract these immune systems, the role of bacterial host factors in enhancing CRISPR-Cas functions has been relatively unexplored. In this study, we employ an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approach to systematically analyze potential interactions between Escherichia coli (E. coli) proteins and fifteen previously uncharacterized Cas12 proteins, generating 65,715 predicted binary complex structures. Our findings reveal a previously unknown dimension of CRISPR immunity, demonstrating that the hosts ubiquitous redox enzyme, thioredoxin (TrxA), significantly enhances the DNA cleavage efficiency of a phage-encoded, miniature Cas12 nuclease (termed  Cas12 hacker). This synergistic relationship represents a strategic inversion, where a bacteriophage hijacks a host protein to reinforce its own genome degradation machinery, possibly targeting rival nucleic acids. Through comprehensive biochemical characterizations, structural analyses of the Cas12 hacker-TrxA-sgRNA-dsDNA quaternary complex, and in vivo bacterial defense assays, we uncover an intricate association in which thioredoxin binds to and activates the Cas12 hacker nuclease, intensifying its DNA cleavage capacity and bolstering CRISPR immunity. Our findings expand the understanding of the molecular interactions underlying host-phage conflicts and highlight the potential for harnessing endogenous host factors to enhance the capabilities of CRISPR-based genetic engineering tools.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

We developed a multifactorial traumatic brain injury model in piglets which mirrors the evolving pathophysiology of severe pediatric TBI, showing age-dependent hypoxic-ischemic cerebral cortical injury and matrix metalloproteinase-driven vasogenic edema, with infant piglets experiencing less tissue damage than toddler piglets. Extracellular matrix breakdown can precipitate neuronal dysfunction, disrupting chloride homeostasis and the reversal potential for GABA. We hypothesized that ongoing tissue damage might be related to markers of ""immature GABA"", evaluated by changes to the expression and phosphorylation of sodium-potassium-2-chloride cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2), and a regulatory kinase, (STE20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich protein kinase) SPAK. We mapped these markers in developing swine and infant human brain, identifying a postnatal pNKCC1 decrease in human infant hippocampus, and a perinatal cortical and hippocampal GABA switch in pigs, with no change in the thalamus. In infant piglets with severe TBI, upregulation of neuronal pNKCC1 correlated with hypoxic-ischemic injury and seizure duration. We also observed dysregulation of NKCC1, KCC2, and SPAK in cortex and hippocampus in infant and toddler piglets with severe TBI, with thalamus unchanged. We noted ectopic, non-apical localization of pNKCC1 signal in choroid plexus epithelium across ages in piglets and humans with severe TBI, indicating acute dysregulation of the CSF chloride milieu. These findings position swine as a useful model for pediatric TBI research and suggest that SPAK or NKCC1 inhibition in infants may be therapeutic.

Significance statementSevere TBI in early childhood, the majority of which is due to abuse, remains an understudied area of neurotrauma. Our piglet model effectively replicates the pathophysiology of severe pediatric TBI, capturing age-dependent injury patterns and mechanisms of spreading hypoxic-ischemic injury throughout the cortical ribbon. We identified upregulation of neuronal-pNKCC1 in infant piglets, but not toddler piglets with severe TBI, and found this correlates with injury severity, seizure duration, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our findings indicate that treatments targeted to inhibit neuronal NKCC1 might alleviate evolving brain injury in infants with severe TBI. This model provides a valuable platform for studying mechanisms of TBI and testing new interventions, potentially advancing therapeutic strategies for pediatric brain injury where stopping traumatic seizures is difficult.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

How nascent mitochondrial precursors acquire and sustain import-competence in the cytosol under normal and stress conditions is incompletely understood. Here, we show that under normal conditions, the Hsc70 and Hsp90 systems interact with and redundantly minimize precursor degradation. During acute import stress, Hsp90 buffers precursor degradation, preserving proteins in an import-competent state until stress resolution. Unexpectedly, buffering by Hsp90 relies critically on a mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS), the absence of which greatly decreases precursor-Hsp90 interaction. Site-specific photo-crosslinking and biochemical reconstitution showed how the MTS directly engages co-chaperones of Hsc70 (St13 and Stip1) and Hsp90 (p23 and Cdc37) to facilitate chaperone retention on the mature domain. Thus, the MTS has a previously unappreciated role in regulating chaperone dynamics on mitochondrial precursors to buffer their degradation and maintain import competence, functions that may facilitate restoration of mitochondrial homeostasis after acute import stress.

Of particular concern is ice-rich, organic-rich, syngenetic ""yedoma"" type permafrost. The lability of organic carbon in permafrost post-thaw largely depends on the rate at which microorganisms resuscitate and proliferate after thousands of years in below-freezing, dark, anaerobic conditions. However, the resuscitation and growth rates of microorganisms in deep permafrost are unknown. To quantify these rates, we conducted lipid stable isotope probing (lipid-SIP) on permafrost cores collected from four locations within the Permafrost Tunnel near Fairbanks, Alaska. We compare rates of microbial growth, marker gene sequences, and greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4) emissions across cores held anaerobically at ambient and elevated temperatures. In deep, ancient permafrost, microbial biomass turnover is exceedingly slow, often undetectable, within the first month following thaw. Our results indicate microbial growth in response to anaerobic thaw has a notable lag period, where only 0.001 - 0.01% of cells turn over per day. This suggests a  slow reawakening that could provide some buffer between anomalous warmth and C degradation if permafrost refreezes seasonally. However, within six months, microbial communities undergo dramatic restructuring and succession, producing communities that are distinct from both the emplaced ancient and overlying surface communities. These results have critical implications for predictions of microbial biogeochemical contributions in a warming arctic, especially as thaw proceeds into deeper and more ancient permafrost horizons.

Plain Language SummaryPermafrost, earth material like soil, rock, or ice continually frozen for more than two years, contains more organic carbon than is currently in the atmosphere as CO2. As the Arctic warms and permafrost thaws, ancient microbes can reactivate, allowing the degradation of organic carbon that has accumulated in permafrost over millenia, resulting in the release of greenhouse gases. In this work, we measured the rates at which permafrost microorganisms resuscitate during thaw and related these growth rates to changes in microbial community composition and greenhouse gas emissions.

Key PointsO_LIMicrobial growth is extremely slow within the first 30 days of thaw. Temperature may drive which taxa are active, but not growth rates.
C_LIO_LISubsurface microbes show a preference for glycolipids over phospholipids, suggesting a possible cryotolerance adaptation.
C_LIO_LIAncient, entrapped gases may be the primary source of emissions in early thaw stages.

Here, we mapped first-order inputs to phrenic motor neurons (PMNs), a key respiratory MN population that initiates diaphragm contraction to drive breathing. We identified a predominant spinal input from a distinct subset of genetically-defined V0C cholinergic interneurons. We found that these interneurons receive phasic excitation from brainstem respiratory centers, augment phrenic output through M2 muscarinic receptors, and are highly activated under a hypercapnia challenge. Specifically silencing cholinergic interneuron neurotransmission impairs the breathing response to hypercapnia. Collectively, our findings identify a novel spinal pathway that amplifies breathing, presenting a potential target for promoting recovery of breathing following spinal cord injury.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

Traditionally linked to genomic imprinting, these effects are believed to have evolved from parental conflict over resource allocation to offspring, which results in opposing parental genetic influences. Despite their potential importance, POEs remain heavily understudied in complex traits, largely due to the lack of parental genomes. Here, we present a multi-step approach to infer the parent-of-origin of alleles without parental genomes, leveraging inter-chromosomal phasing, mitochondrial and chromosome X data, and sibling-based crossover inference. Applied to the UK Biobank (discovery cohort) and Estonian Biobank (replication cohort), this scalable approach enabled parent-of-origin inference for up to 221,062 individuals, representing the largest dataset of its kind. GWAS scans in the UK Biobank for more than 60 complex traits and over 2,400 protein levels contrasting maternal and paternal effects identified over 30 novel POEs and confirmed more than 50% of testable known associations. Notably, approximately half of our POEs exhibited a bi-polar pattern, where maternal and paternal alleles exert conflicting effects. These effects were particularly prevalent for traits related to growth (e.g., IGF-1, height, fat-free mass) and metabolism (e.g., type 2 diabetes, triglycerides, glucose). Replication in the Estonian Biobank and in 45,402 offspring from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study validated over 75% of testable associations. Overall, our findings shed new light on the influence of POEs on diverse complex traits and align with the parental conflict hypothesis, providing compelling evidence for this understudied evolutionary phenomenon.","NA","medrxiv",1737583676692

Traditional evolutionary analyses often overlook key family members due to technical limitations. Here, we present a cryo-EM-based, bottom-up approach for large-scale, de novo protein identification and functional prediction of endogenous axonemal dynein complexes. This approach led to the identification of a novel dynein heavy chain subfamily (XP_041462850), designated as DNAHX, from sea urchin sperm. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that DNAHX branches from the outer-arm dynein alpha chain during evolution and is found in specific animal lineages with external fertilization. DNAHX contains multiple insertions throughout the protein, locking DNAHX permanently in a pre-powerstroke state. The AAA1 site exhibits poor conservation of essential ATPase motifs, consistent with DNAHXs non-motile nature. DNAHX also forms a heterodimeric dynein complex, which we named dynein-X, with another dynein heavy chain and accessory chains. Furthermore, a subset of dynein-X displays an autoinhibited phi particle conformation, potentially facilitating the intraflagellar transport of axonemal dyneins. Our discovery of the novel, non-motile dynein heavy chain and the dynein-X complex provides valuable insights into the evolution of dyneins and potentially their diverse cellular functions.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

To detect C. auris we aimed to compare different culture-, and molecular-based methods.

MethodsRectal swabs routinely collected in clinical care were spiked with different concentrations of C. auris. Co-infection/colonization was mimicked by spiking part of these samples with other pathogenic Candida species. Spiked materials were cultured at 37{degrees}C or 42{degrees}C using CHROMagar Candida and CHROMagar CandidaPlus plates. In parallel, samples were incubated in a dulcitol salt enrichment broth. Additionally, we compared seven in-house and commercial molecular tests on the direct material and from the broth one day after inoculation.

ResultsCulture-based methods showed sensitivities up to 100% within 48 hours of incubation, although sensitivity decreased as low as 44% at lower concentrations ([&le;]50 CFU per inoculum), in the presence of an abundance of other species and at higher temperature (42{degrees}C). Incubation at 42{degrees}C made visual identification possible since other species with similar colony morphologies did not grow at this temperature. No added value of using the dulcitol salt enrichment broth was found. qPCR on direct materials was highly sensitive and specific (both up to 100%) but major differences between various molecular tests were observed.

ConclusionWe showed that both culture-based and molecular methods are sensitive for diagnosing C. auris. The clinical setting (routine screening versus an outbreak), local prevalence and the load in those that carry or are infected by C. auris are important factors to consider when determining which diagnostic tests should be employed.","NA","medrxiv",1737583676692

To address this, we monitored microbial dynamics in two microalgae biomass production raceways over two 8-month intervals inoculated with Desmodesmus armatus. One reactor was fed with wastewater, while the other received clean water and fertilizers. Metabarcoding of the 18S and 16S rRNA genes revealed a high microbial diversity across two time series, showing thousands of eukaryotic and prokaryotic species growing alongside the microalgae. Chlorophyta and Fungi were the dominant eukaryotic groups, while Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidia dominated the prokaryotic communities. We found contrasting ASVs (Amplicon Sequence Variant) patterns between healthy (D. armatus abundance >70%) and unhealthy (D. armatus abundance <20%) microbiomes, across reactors and time series. Network analysis identified up to 10 potential ecological interactions among D. armatus and its microbiome, predominantly positive. Our results suggest a link between microbiome composition and D. armatus abundance. Specifically, ASVs associated with a healthy microbiome were positively correlated with D. armatus, while ASVs characteristic of an unhealthy microbiome were negatively correlated. Potentially pathogenic bacteria included Mycobacterium and Flavobacterium, whereas potentially beneficial taxa included Geminocystis, Thiocapsa, Ahniella and Bosea. Several fungal ASVs showed context-specific associations, whereas specific P. tribonemae, A. parallelum, A. desmodesmi, Aphelidiomycota sp., Rozellomycota sp. and, Rhizophidium sp. ASVs were identified as potentially harmful. This study reveals the striking diversity and complexity of microalgae-associated microbiomes within raceways, providing valuable insights for optimizing industrial production processes, particularly for wastewater treatment and sustainable green biomass generation.

Using cryo-electron tomography and molecular dynamics simulations we elucidated the structure of phase separated chromatin condensates across scales, from individual amino acids to network architecture. We found that internucleosomal DNA linker length controls nucleosome arrangement and histone tail interactions, shaping the structure of individual chromatin molecules both within and outside condensates. This structural modulation determines the balance between intra- and intermolecular interactions, which in turn governs the molecular network, thermodynamic stability, and material properties of chromatin condensates. Mammalian nuclei contain dense clusters of nucleosomes whose non-random organization is mirrored by the reconstituted condensates.

Previously, we showed that pathogenic LRRK2 mutations inhibit primary cilia formation in rare interneurons and astrocytes of the mouse and human dorsal striatum. This blocks Hedgehog signaling and reduces synthesis of neuroprotective GDNF and NRTN, which support neurons vulnerable in PD. Here we show that GBA1 mutations also impair Hedgehog signaling through a distinct mechanism. Loss of GBA1 activity decreases accessible cholesterol in primary cilia of cultured cells, thereby disrupting Hedgehog signaling. In the mouse striatum, Gba1 mutations result in reduced Hedgehog-induced Gdnf RNA expression in cholinergic interneurons, despite having no detectable impact on cilia formation. Also, both Lrrk2 and Gba1 mutations suppress Hedgehog-induced Bdnf expression in striatal astrocytes. These findings underscore the role of Hedgehog signaling in the nigrostriatal circuit and reveal a convergent mechanism by which distinct mutations may contribute to PD pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

This study provides comprehensive evidence supporting the existence of polycistronic mRNA expression in the apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum. Leveraging long-read RNA-seq data from different parasite strains and using multiple long-read technologies, we demonstrate the existence of defined polycistronic transcripts containing 2-4 protein encoding genes, several validated with RT-PCR. Some polycistrons exhibit differential expression profiles, usually involving the generation of internal monocistronic transcripts at different times during development. ATAC-seq in sporozoites reveals that polycistronic transcripts usually have a single open chromatin peak at their 5-prime ends, which contains a single E2F binding site motif. Polycistronic genes do not appear enriched for either male or female exclusive genes. This study elucidates a potentially complex layer of gene regulation with distinct chromatin accessibility akin to monocistronic transcripts. This is the first report of polycistronic transcription in an apicomplexan and expands our understanding of gene expression strategies in this medically important organism.

SignificanceCryptosporidium parvum is a parasite that causes human gastrointestinal disease, profoundly impacting infants and immunocompromised individuals worldwide. C. parvum isolation, culturing, cloning, and its compact 9.2 Mb genome pose challenges for research. We have discovered that, unlike most eukaryotes, which express one gene per mRNA, C. parvum exhibits widespread polycistronic transcription, whereby 10% of its protein encoding genes are expressed as multiple genes per single mRNA molecule. Mining the published C. parvum single-cell atlas with proxy sequences for polycistronic expression, we observed patterns of polycistron expression that vary with developmental stages, suggesting a role in the parasites lifecycle. By illuminating this unique aspect of C. parvum biology, our findings provide novel insights into Cryptosporidium gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

In recent years, many small molecule inhibitors against these channels have been developed. The recent successful clinical trial of VX-548, a NaV1.8-selective inhibitor, has spurred much interest in expanding the arsenal of subtype-selective voltage-gated sodium channel therapeutics. Toward that end, we sought to determine whether NaVs are amenable to targeted protein degradation with small molecule degraders, namely proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and molecular glues. Here, we report that degron-tagged NaVs are potently and rapidly degraded by small molecule degraders harnessing the E3 ubiquitin ligases cereblon (CRBN) and Von Hippel Lindau (VHL). Using LC/MS analysis, we demonstrate that PROTAC-mediated proximity between NaV1.8 and CRBN results in ubiquitination on the 2nd intracellular loop, pointing toward a potential mechanism of action and demonstrating the ability of CRBN to recognize a VGSC as a neosubstrate. Our foundational findings are an important first step toward realizing the immense potential of NaV-targeting degrader analgesics to combat chronic pain.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

At the molecular and cellular level, the renormalization of synaptic weights during sleep has received substantial support, which is thought to free capacity to encode new information at the behavioral level. However, at the systems level and behaviorally, support for this process playing a major role for memory function remains scarce. In the current study, we investigated the utility of moderate- and high-intensity evening exercise as a low-cost low-tech intervention to modulate sleep and its influence on subsequent encoding in the morning. Our findings indicate that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) improved post-sleep memory performance with effects lasting up to 24 hours after initial encoding. In addition, we show that especially the early parts of the encoding task were affected by the HIIT intervention, which is in line with increases in synaptic homeostasis being targeted by the exercise. Intriguingly, low-performing participants seemed to benefit more from the HIIT intervention suggesting it not only as a tool for basic research but also as a candidate for applications to boost memory performance in mental disorders or in the elderly. These results provide first evidence that acute exercise can affect learning processes even hours after it occurs.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

Contrary to expectations, our findings revealed that individuals trained on tasks with similar low-dimensional structures performed worse than those trained on dissimilar tasks. Magnetoencephalography revealed correlated neural representations in the same-structure group and anticorrelated ones in the different-structure group. Crucially, practice reduced this performance gap and shifted the neural representations of the tasks in the same-structure group towards anticorrelation, like those in the different-structure group. A neural network model trained on similar tasks replicated these findings: tasks with similar structures require more iterations to orthogonalize their representations. These results highlight a complex interplay between task similarity, neural dynamics, and behavior, challenging traditional assumptions about learning and generalization.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

Polyploid genomes are expected to undergo chromosomal rearrangements and gene losses over time, potentially affecting supergene architecture. The iconic distyly supergene (S-locus), controlling a floral heteromorphism with two self-incompatible morphs, has been well-documented in diploids, but remains unknown in polyploids. Primula, the classic model for distyly since Darwin, is ancestrally diploid and distylous, yet polyploid, homostylous species with a single, self-compatible floral morph evolved repeatedly. The intraspecific loss of distyly is associated with small loss-of-function mutations in the S-locus CYPT gene controlling style length and female self-incompatibility. Over longer timescales, relaxed selection on CYPT should generate greater accumulation of larger mutations, including exon and gene loss. By analyzing the first assembled genome of an allotetraploid, homostylous species (Primula grandis) in a comparative framework, we discovered two, nearly identical S-locus alleles in the same subgenome, suggesting it originated via inter-specific hybridization between a homostylous and a distylous progenitor. Conformant to predictions from theory, the macroevolutionary loss of distyly coincided with considerable degeneration of CYPT, while other S-locus genes remained largely unaffected, suggesting the shift to homostyly preceded and facilitated polyploid establishment. At the whole-genome level, we found minimal subgenome dominance - as expected, given the inferred recent origin of P. grandis - and highly reduced genetic diversity, congruently with its narrow distribution and self-compatibility. This study provides the first comparison of a supergene across ploidy levels and reproductive systems, contributing new knowledge on the previously unknown fate of supergenes in polyploids.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

Hamiltons famous haplodiploid hypothesis proposed that eusociality evolves more readily in haplodiploids because of an inflated genetic relatedness between sisters. For the past sixty years, theoreticians have developed an array of models that further clarify how eusociality might evolve more readily in haplodiploids. Despite this sustained theoretical interest, the predicted evolutionary association between haplodiploidy and eusociality was only recently empirically tested when a family-level analysis in insects found mixed support. Here, we use a large species-level insect phylogeny with all available sociality and ploidy trait data to test whether there is an evolutionary association between haplodiploidy and eusociality. We show that the transition rate from solitary to eusocial life was 15-100 times higher in haplodiploid than diploid lineages, depending on the definitions of eusociality and haplodiploidy. Our results strongly support the prediction of the haplodiploid hypothesis and related models that the evolutionary transition from solitary to eusocial life is facilitated by haplodiploidy.

Significance statementSixty years ago, Hamilton hypothesized that eusociality evolves more readily in haplodiploid populations due to inflated relatedness among sisters. This haplodiploid hypothesis is often presented as a textbook example of how inclusive fitness theory can explain the phylogenetic distribution of eusociality across the tree of life. Theoreticians soon noted flaws in Hamiltons original formulation but have developed more models, still predicting that haplodiploidy facilitates the evolution of eusociality. Despite these theoretical predictions, most researchers have long doubted any phylogenetic association between haplodiploidy and eusociality. We tested this association using a large species-level insect phylogeny with all the available trait data. Our results show that eusociality evolved at a much higher rate in haplodiploids, conclusively supporting the predicted association.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

Conversely, thallus- and gemma-based methods maintain genetic consistency but are impractical for large-scale applications. To address these limitations, we developed a novel chopped-thallus transformation method. This technique involves generating numerous plant fragments by chopping thalli, eliminating the need for complex preprocessing.

We considered whether the paucity of natural IL-9R expression could be exploited for T cell immunotherapy given that, in mice, high doses of IL-9 were well-tolerated without discernible immune modulation. Compared to o9R, T cells engineered with IL-9R exhibit superior tissue infiltration, stemness, and anti-tumor activity. These qualities are consistent with a stronger JAK/STAT signal, which in addition to STAT1/3/5, unexpectedly includes STAT4 (canonically associated with IL-12 but not common {gamma}-chain cytokines). IL-9R T cells are exquisitely sensitive to perturbations of proximal signaling, including structure-guided attenuation, amplification, and rebalancing of JAK/STAT signals. Biased IL-9R mutants uncover STAT1 as a rheostat between proliferative stem-like and terminally differentiated effector states.

Reliable modeling of human adaptive immune responses is a prerequisite to understand processes leading to vaccine-induced protective immunization and to drive informed decisions in vaccine development pipelines.

Tolerance to mild replication stress (RS) relies on active fork slowing, mediated by transient fork reversal and RECQ1-assisted restart, and modulated by PARP1 and nuclear architectural components via yet-elusive mechanisms. We combined acute protein inactivation with cell biology and single-molecule approaches to investigate the role of Lamin A/C upon mild RS. We found that Lamin A/C dynamically interacts with replication factories throughout the nucleus and, together with its nucleoplasmic partner LAP2, is required to induce active fork slowing and maintain chromosome stability upon mild genotoxic treatments. Inactivating nucleoplasmic Lamin A/C reduces poly-ADP-ribosylation (PAR) levels at nascent DNA, triggering deregulated RECQ1-mediated restart of reversed forks. Moreover, we found that the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3, previously reported at stalled forks, also accumulates in response to mild RS. H3K9me3 accumulation requires Lamin A/C, which prevents its premature removal by the histone demethylase JMJD1A/KDM3A. H3K9me3 loss per se phenocopies Lamin A/C inactivation, reducing PAR levels and deregulating RECQ1 activity at forks. Hence, nucleoplasmic Lamin A/C, H3K9me3 and PARylation levels are crucial, mechanistically-linked modulators of fork slowing, remodelling and restart upon mild RS, with important implications for chemotherapy response and Lamin A/C deregulation in human disease.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

These events are associated with innate training and can have long-term impacts on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) development but can also compromise their function. While many cytokines support emergency myelopoiesis, less is known about the mechanisms that temper these events. When mice that lack the cytokine IL-27 were infected with Toxoplasma gondii, there was enhanced generation of monocyte progenitors and increased numbers of inflammatory monocytes. In the bone marrow of infected mice there was increased production of IL-27 that localized with HSPCs and a survey of cytokine receptor expression highlighted that HSPCs were uniquely poised to respond to IL-27. Furthermore, the use of in vitro differentiation assays and mixed bone marrow chimeras revealed that HSPCs from IL-27 deficient mice are pre-disposed towards the monocyte lineage. Additional studies highlighted that after infection loss of the IL-27R resulted in reduced HSPC fitness that manifested as reduced proliferative responses and a decreased ability to reconstitute the hematopoietic system. Thus, the ability of IL-27 to act on HSPC provides a regulatory brake on differentiation to limit monocyte induction and preserve HSPC stemness.","NA","biorxiv",1737583676692

Despite existing research, it remains unclear how the gut microbiome is affected by different intensities of PA, and how other lifestyle factors influence this relationship. Here we study the relation between PA intensity and gut microbiome composition and function in a large Lifelines Dutch Microbiome Project dataset.

MethodsA cross-sectional design was performed on 5409 adults aged 40 to 60 from the community-based Lifelines Dutch Microbiome Project and from all these participants metagenomic shotgun data was available. Participants were categorized into sedentary (N=2501), moderate (N=1915), and vigorous (N=993) PA groups, based on self-reported activity levels. We investigated association between PA intensity and microbial diversity, bacterial species, and metabolic pathways by multiple regression models sequentially adjusted for the covariates age/sex, BMI, stool consistency and diet quality/alcohol intake.

ResultsVigorous PA, but not moderate PA, was significantly associated with higher gut microbiome alpha diversity (i.e., species richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity) as compared to sedentary PA. Compared to the sedentary group, the vigorous PA group showed a lower abundance of the bacterial species Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus ({beta} = -0.003, p = 0.042), even after extensive covariate adjustments and correction for multiple testing. Other species were initially also significantly associated with vigorous PA, but they disappeared after adjusting for covariates resulting in a loss of significance. Pathway analysis showed significant enrichment of two distinct metabolic pathways related to cellular energy recycling (Pyruvate fermentation to acetate and lactate II, {beta} = 8.11x10-05, p = 0.035) and purine metabolism (Purine ribonucleosides degradation, {beta} = 3.36x10-04, p = 0.039) in participants engaging in vigorous PA as compared to sedentary PA.

ConclusionsVigorous PA is associated with higher gut microbiome diversity and with specific alterations of microbial composition. The lower abundance of Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus within the vigorous PA group may be linked to increased gut permeability. The identified enrichment of microbial fermentation and purine metabolism in vigorous PA hints at a potential role of PA in affecting gut microbiome functionality and host health. The results of our modeling strategy highlight the importance of adjusting for dietary covariates to understand how PA may impact the gut microbiome independently from other influences.","NA","medrxiv",1737583676692

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1737583676692

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1737583676692
