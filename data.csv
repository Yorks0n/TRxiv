While infection is known to impair mitochondrial function and enhance glycolysis, the role of viral accessory proteins in these alterations remains unclear. Here, we investigate the metabolic impact of the accessory protein ORF7a. Lentiviral expression of ORF7a in human lung epithelial (A549) and monocytic (THP1) cells, coupled with integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, revealed profound dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. ORF7a impaired oxidative phosphorylation, reducing basal and maximal respiration, inducing mitochondrial depolarization, and increasing reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, ORF7a upregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), promoting pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex phosphorylation and suppressing pyruvate oxidation. However, pharmacological PDK4 inhibition did not restore respiration. High-resolution respirometry in frozen samples revealed impaired complex I function, while Blue Native-PAGE demonstrated defective respiratory supercomplex assembly. By linking enzymatic inhibition with structural destabilization, our study uncovers a functional vulnerability of the mitochondrial respiratory chain to viral manipulation. These findings establish ORF7a as a key modulator of host metabolic reprogramming and highlight mitochondrial pathways as potential therapeutic targets in COVID-19.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification1 to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) as well as from local ER- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Despite recent progress in de novo design of protein binders, there are no current methods for designing binders that recognize phosphorylated proteins and peptides; this is a challenging problem as phosphate groups are highly charged, and phosphorylation often occurs within unstructured regions. Here we introduce RoseTTAFold Diffusion 2 for Molecular Interfaces (RFD2-MI), a deep generative framework for the design of binders for protein, ligand, and covalently modified protein targets. We demonstrate the power and versatility of this method by designing binders for four critical phosphotyrosine sites on three clinically relevant targets: Cluster of Differentiation 3 (CD3{varepsilon}), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Insulin Receptor (INSR). Experimental characterization shows that the designs bind their phospho-tyrosine containing targets with affinities comparable to native binding sites and have negligible binding to non-phosphorylated targets or phosphopeptides with different sequences. X-ray crystal structures of generated binders to CD3{varepsilon} and EGFR are very close to the design models, demonstrating the accuracy of the design approach. RFD2-MI provides a generalizable all-atom diffusion framework for probing and modulating phosphorylation-dependent signaling, and more generally, for developing research tools and targeted therapeutics against post-translationally modified proteins.","[{""name"":""NIH NCI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1K99CA293001;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

While open models for unconstrained ""minibinder"" design have shown great experimental promise, methods for designing binders in specific formats, such as antibodies, have lagged behind in experimental success rates. In this work, we present mBER, an open-source protein binder design system capable of designing antibody-format binders with state-of-the-art experimental success rates. mBER builds on the ColabDesign framework, achieving successful antibody design primarily through the inclusion of informative sequence and structure conditioning information. Using mBER, we designed two libraries comprising over 1 million VHH binders against 436 diverse targets. We experimentally screened the two libraries against 145 of these targets, resulting in a dataset of over 100 million binding interactions. We achieved specific and significant design success against 45% of targets. In a filtered set of designs, we detect binding rates to specific epitopes as high as 38%. Through mBER, we demonstrate that format-specific binder design is possible with no additional training of underlying folding and language models. This work represents the largest reported de novo protein design and validation campaign, and one of the first open-source methods to demonstrate double-digit percentage experimental success rates for antibody binder design.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Here, we present a spatially resolved, multi-omics framework that integrates whole-organ 3D imaging at cellular resolution with targeted proteomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic profiling to detect and characterize microscopic tubal lesions. Using this platform, we identified a total of 99 STICs and their presumed precursors that harbor TP53 mutations in morphologically unremarkable tubal epithelium in all five specimens obtained from cancer-free organ donors with average-risk of developing ovarian cancer. Although these lesions comprised only 0.2% of the epithelial compartment, they displayed geographic diversity, immune exclusion, metabolic rewiring, and DNA copy number changes among lesions and normal fallopian tube epithelium discovered alterations in STIC-associated genes and the pathways they control. In sum, this platform provides a comprehensive 3D atlas of early neoplastic transformation, yielding mechanistic insights into tumor initiation and informing clinical screening strategies for detecting cancer precursors in whole organs at cellular resolution.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U54CA268083;RO1CA300052;UG3CA275681;P50CA228991;R01GM149976;U01AI167892;5R01NS111039;R21NS125395;U54 HL165443;U54 DK 134301;R01 HL170107;U2CCA271891;""},{""name"":""Sloan research fellow award, a CZI Scialog award, and UCSD Startup funds"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Johns Hopkins University and Instituto Superior Técnico student exchange program (HOPTEC and FLAD)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Richard W.

Using polymer simulations and high-resolution live-cell microscopy, we identify rare but long-lived chromatin encounters arising from cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. These events occur when cohesin loads near the midpoint between two loci and extrudes them through a defined spatial radius, producing encounter durations that exceed those of random collisions. We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors. Our findings support a time-gated model of distal enhancer-promoter communication in which only rare, long-lived and mostly extrusion-driven encounters are productive, offering a unifying framework for how chromosome dynamics control transcription in single cells.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_192642;TMCG-3_213782;320030-236070;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 1305-2024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Here, we addressed this question in the Drosophila larva, where we could leverage the synaptic resolution connectome to determine where innate and learnt information from distinct aversive and appetitive sensory modalities converges; and combine this with imaging and manipulation of neural activity to determine how valence information is encoded and used to guide navigation. We found that information from multiple innately aversive and attractive sensory modalities converges onto a common output neuron of the learning circuit, specifically the Mushroom Body output neuron, MBON-m1. We discovered that this neuron is required for navigating both attractive odor and aversive temperature cues and is activated by attractive cues, such as food odour and sugar, and inhibited by different aversive cues, such as cooling, salt, or non-food odors.

How its chromosome is dynamically reorganized across these contrasting states remains unclear. Here, we used synchronized predatory infections combined with time-resolved RNA-seq, Hi-C, ChIP-seq, and quantitative microscopy to map transcriptional activity and chromosome architecture across seven key stages of the predatory lifecycle. We uncover a dramatic shift in nucleoid organization - from an ultra-compact, transcriptionally restricted state in attack-phase cells to a progressively decompacted, ori-centered conformation during intracellular replication. Notably, distinct transcriptional and chromosome folding states not only mark the canonical attack and growth phases, but also critical transitions such as prey invasion, replication onset, and predator division. Temporal gene expression profiles reflect the coordinated regulation of core cellular functions across the predatory cycle. Furthermore, spatial localization of RNA polymerase, ribosomes, DNA-binding proteins, and freely diffusing proteins highlight the tight, cell cycle-dependent coupling between nucleoid compaction, chromosome accessibility, and transcriptional activity. Altogether, our findings reveal the intricate dynamics and coordination of genome folding and gene expression in a complex bacterial cell cycle driven by prey-predator interactions.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PREDATOR STG #802331;VAMPIRE COG #101171143;""},{""name"":""F.R.S.-FNRS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Crédit de Recherche &#34;PREDATOR NUCLEOID&#34;;""},{""name"":""Conseil Interuniversitaire de la Communauté Française de Belgique"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Actions de Recherche Concertées &#34;PACHIDERM&#34;;""},{""name"":""WEL Research Institute"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""WELBIO Starting Grant &#34;ARSENAL&#34;;""},{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-23-CHBS-0002;""},{""name"":""France Génomique"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-10-INBS-09;""},{""name"":""Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03356n642"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Fellowship;""},{""name"":""Institute Strategic Program Harnessing Biosynthesis for Sustainable Food and Health"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X01097X/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting  spacetime attractor excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning.

The mechanisms that facilitate immunostimulatory ligand release from microbes during infection are largely undefined. Using the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, we describe wall teichoic acid (WTA) as a critical mediator of DNA release from bacterial cells during infection. Mechanistically, we found that the -glycosylated form of WTA, generated by the enzyme TarM, is the primary mediator of bacterial DNA release within macrophages. This process is antagonized by the enzyme O-acetyltransferase, which prevents WTA attachment to peptidoglycan. This competition among peptidoglycan modifying enzymes determines activation of cytosolic DNA receptors AIM2 and cGAS. WTA therefore operates as a meta-regulator of inflammation, by controlling the availability of microbial ligands that stimulate innate immunity.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/043z4tv69"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AI167993;R37AI116550;T32AI7061;K08AI193234;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-123-24;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00adh9b73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DK34854;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

However, due to the challenges of differentiating goat remains from that of sheep using traditional archaeozoological approaches, there are few specimens specifically identified as goat. To address this we employed genetic, proteomics, and archaeozoological techniques to assess faunal remains from the Late Bronze assemblage of Haugheys Fort (Armagh) and medieval assemblage of Carrickfergus (Antrim). We identify these specimens as goats using proteomics and genetics, and additionally determine their molecular sex.

Genomic data recovered from a Haugheys Fort goat reveals a three-millenia genetic connection between herds in the Late Bronze Age, medieval period, and the indigenous Irish breed extant today, the Old Irish Goat. We additionally find varying levels of inbreeding within goats from the settlement of Carrickfergus, suggesting possible mixed use of herds within medieval Irish society. Our results demonstrate the continuing potential of combining archaeological and biomolecular techniques to clarify existing ambiguities and at the same time reveal new facets of the past.","[{""name"":""EPSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/K039660/1; EP/M028127/1;""},{""name"":""Northern Way Initiative"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""885729-AncestralWeave;101055195-ANSOC;""},{""name"":""Taighde Éireann – Research Ireland"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""21/PATH-S/9515(T);GOIPG/2023/4390;""},{""name"":""AHRC Northern Bridge Doctoral Training Partnership"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Why these chaperones were recruited is unclear, as they are absent and not required in other prokaryotic autotrophs. By retracing the evolution of Rubisco-chaperone interactions, we find that Rubiscos dependence on chaperones evolved neutrally and not by adaptive optimization, and that this may be reversed without compromising catalytic function.

Today, images of biological structures can be acquired using different imaging technologies and at increasing resolutions. However, identifying relevant structural features in three-dimensional (3D) images remains a significant challenge. 3D image segmentation is usually performed using deep-learning segmentation models. Such models are trained on manually annotated and segmented, dataset-specific images. Consequently, they rarely generalize across datasets. Here, we overcome these limitations with TopoTome, an unsupervised 3D image segmentation and analysis algorithm. TopoTome is based on topological data analysis, and conceptually distinct from standard clustering and deep learning image analysis models. It encodes the 3D image directly in topological space. Then, it performs unsupervised clustering to detect and segment features represented by salient and spatially coherent voxel intensity gradients. We demonstrate on simple, complex, synthetic and real-world 3D image data that it outperforms all 3D clustering algorithms. Its segmentation ranks with or outperforms best-in-class deep learning 3D image segmentation software. Beyond image segmentation, it provides streamlined topological data analysis of 3D images, advancing 3D image analysis from conventional mesh volumetry to structural topology. Owing to its conceptually different topological data analysis core, TopoTome does not need prior information and tuning to generalize across different imaging modalities, including fluorescence microscopy and X-ray computed tomography. We show it also readily generalizes across biological subjects, such as different species, organs and cells. TopoTome is thus one of the most versatile and accurate unsupervised 3D image segmentation algorithms.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Critically, simple vividness ratings can replace the protracted questionnaires commonly used for this purpose and reduce methodological issues with these instruments. We further find that vividness is closely linked with the experience of ""seeing"" mental images or projecting them into the external world. People who report seeing mental images with their eyes shut are also more likely to experience externally projected imagery. Nevertheless, many people report having mental depictions but without seeing.

Laboratory studies indicate rapid degradation of FPB in water, but sediment persistence in aquatic systems remains poorly understood, creating uncertainty in ecological risk assessments. We evaluated the environmental fate and transport of FPB and its degradants in water, plants, and sediment following application of the herbicide to two bays of Lake George, NY. FPB was rapidly lost from the water column within 72 hours, consistent with prior studies, but persisted in sediments for at least one year. Sediment cores revealed vertical migration of FPB, which may contribute to frequent non-detects in surface sediments and potentially explain why US EPA was unable to establish sediment half-lives in aquatic systems. Measured concentrations exceeded the 28-day no observable adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) for chironomids for at least a year, highlighting the potential for long-term chronic exposure to benthic organisms. Modeled sorption and dilution scenarios aligned with field observations and indicated that circulation dynamics expanded the affected area beyond the direct treatment zones. These results demonstrate that FPB and its degradants persist longer in sediments than suggested by laboratory studies, raising important questions about long-term ecological risks, effects of repeated applications, and underestimation of sediment persistence. Long-term studies such as this are essential for understanding the fate of these compounds and for guiding informed decisions about future herbicide applications.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Understanding the mechanism behind OMV biogenesis in Bacteroides spp. is necessary to determine their role in the gut. Recent studies showed that mutation of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factor 1 increased OMV production in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt) by regulating members of its downstream regulon. Additional members of the Dma family have been identified, but very little is known regarding their roles in Bt. Here, we investigate the role of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factor 2 (Dma2) in controlling OMV biogenesis in Bt. We employ biochemical and proteomic analyses to show that mutation of dma2 increases OMV production in a manner that is dependent on the expression of its cognate sigma factor, das2. The precise mechanism by which dma2 increases OMV biogenesis remains elusive. However, transcriptome analyses revealed that{Delta} dma2 has decreased expression of select polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) that primarily target host-associated glycans. Follow-up comparative proteomics showed that the PUL repertoire was most impacted in the OMV fraction. In vitro growth assessments showed that{Delta} dma2 exhibits delayed growth in the presence of select host-associated glycans. Colonization studies in mice revealed that{Delta} dma2 is outcompeted by the wild-type in the gut, which indicates that dma2 is a key determinant of colonization fitness in Bt. Altogether, these findings expand our knowledge of the Dma familys role in OMV biogenesis and demonstrates their importance in Bacteroides physiology.

ImportanceDual membrane-spanning anti-sigma factors (Dma) are a novel class of regulatory system found solely amongst Bacteroidota. Previous studies have demonstrated the role of Dma1 in vesiculation, but the overall role of the Dma family in Bacteroides physiology remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Dma2 modulates vesiculation and regulates the expression of select polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) that target host-associated glycans. In vivo studies revealed that Dma2 is an important fitness determinant when competing against kin bacteria. This work begins characterizing the multifaceted involvement of Dma2 in OMV biogenesis, PUL regulation, and colonization fitness.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

The presentation of antigens in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by HSPCs to CD4+ T cells, biased HSPC lineages toward myelopoiesis and polarised CD4+ T-cells to regulatory T cells (T- regs), culminating in tumour immunotolerance. Remarkably, a single infusion of antibodies directed against cytokines enriched in the CSF of mice bearing ZFTA-RELA ependymomas, choroid plexus carcinomas or Group-3 medulloblastoma-all aggressive childhood brain tumours-disrupted this process and caused profound tumour regression. These data unmask a mechanism by which skull bone marrow-derived HSPCs and CD4+ T cells cooperate to promote the immunotolerance of childhood brain tumours.

Cachexia risk concentrated around periods of disease progression and associated with inferior outcomes in nearly all cancer types. Across cancers, cachectic episodes exhibited a consistent serologic signature characterized by low albumin and hemoglobin and high levels of liver enzymes. Numerous somatic tumor genotypes, including TP53 mutation across several diseases, were associated with elevated cachexia risk.

Studies of West African arthropod diversity can therefore help address important questions regarding conservation, ecosystem services, and insecticide use and other species-control interventions in agriculture and disease management. We intensively sampled arthropods in Ghana using complementary trapping methods, generated DNA barcodes, and classified sequences by Barcode Index Numbers (BINs, a species proxy). Using this dataset, we investigate assemblage composition, temporal activity patterns, and the state of regional biodiversity sampling. Results: Sequencing DNA from 95,996 individuals captured using Malaise, yellow pan, pitfall, Heath and Centre for Disease Control (CDC) traps, we identified 10,120 unique BINs. The rate of species accumulation did not approach an asymptote for any taxonomic group or trap type, indicating high biodiversity. The different trap types sampled different subsets of the local community, with greatest similarity between yellow pan and pitfall traps. More insects and species (BINs) were trapped during the day than at night. Our dataset shared more BINs in the Barcode of Life Database with South Africa than with any other country, although this predominantly reflects the limited sampling and DNA sequencing campaigns in Africa. Conclusions: This study more than doubles the published BINs for West Africa, offering insights into the biodiversity of an ecologically important but understudied taxon and region. Using multiple trap types allowed a more complete assessment of the local arthropod assemblage. The public release of these data will support and stimulate further taxonomic and ecological work in the region.","[{""name"":""Open Philanthropy Project"",""id"":""https://ror.org/004d1k391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

We evaluated the accuracy, including plasmid reconstruction, of Nanopore long-read only genome assemblies of Enterobacterales.

We sequenced 92 genomes from clinical Enterobacterales isolates, collected in England under a national surveillance program, with long-read Nanopore (R10.4.1, Dorado v5.0.0 super-high-accuracy basecalled) and short-read Illumina (NovaSeq) sequencing approaches. Genomes were assembled using three long-read only (Flye; Hybracter long; Autocycler), and three hybrid assemblers (Hybracter hybrid; Unicycler normal; bold). Three polishing modalities (Medaka v2 with subsampled or un-subsampled long-reads; Polypolish + Pypolca with short-reads) were investigated.

Autocycler circularised the most chromosomes (87/92 [95%]). Plasmid sequence reconstruction was comparable between all assemblers except Flye, all recovering 90-96% of plasmids, although the  ground truth was uncertain. Flye performed worse than other assemblers on almost all metrics. Autocycler + Medaka (un-subsampled long-reads) was the most accurate long-read only assembler/polisher combination, comparable to hybrid assemblies (median 0 [IQR:0-0] SNPs and 0 [IQR:0-1] indels per genome; quality value/Q score, 100 [IQR: 64-100]), with only 4/92 genome sequences having >10 SNPs/indels. Medaka polishing with un-subsampled long-reads resulted in small improvements in indels but not SNPs for both Flye and Autocycler assemblies. Seven-locus MLST, antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and stress gene annotation was equivalent across assembler/polisher combinations.

Nanopore long-read only bacterial genome assembly with Autocycler combined with Medaka polishing (using un-subsampled reads) is similarly accurate and possibly more complete than hybrid assemblies, representing a viable alternative for incorporating high-quality genomic data, including plasmids, into Enterobacterales surveillance.

Impact StatementNanopore long-reads have historically been too error-prone to use alone for accurate bacterial genome assembly, necessitating additional Illumina short-reads to achieve structurally complete and accurate  hybrid genome assemblies for public health surveillance. This increases cost and complexity. Previous studies have shown that recent improvements in Nanopore chemistry (R10.4.1 flowcell) and basecalling (super-high accuracy) allow high-quality long-read only assemblies on a small number of laboratory reference strains. This is the first evaluation, to our knowledge, to assess Nanopore long-read only genome assembly compared with hybrid assembly on a large number of clinical isolates. In addition, this is the first large-scale evaluation of the recently released automated consensus long-read assembly tool, Autocycler.

We show that Autocycler long-read only assemblies are more structurally complete for chromosomal sequences, while reconstructing a similar number of plasmids to other long-read and hybrid assemblers. Most long-read polished, Autocycler-assembled genome sequences have 0 errors (median: 0 SNPs/indels) relative to a short-read polished (hybrid) Autocycler assemblies, enabling accurate annotation of key genes.","[{""name"":""National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR207397;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

We uncover distinct concentration-dependent binding behaviors for each TF. NANOG occupancy increased monotonously with its concentration, even though a common set of regions made accessible by OCT4 and SOX2 are highly and uniformly bound at all NANOG concentrations. In contrast, SOX2 occupancy does not increase with its concentrations, while OCT4 displayed an intermediate behavior.

Testing the rhythmic properties of the adult visual system with periodic or broadband visual stimulation elicited neural resonance phenomena at [~]10Hz alpha rhythm. Here, we extend this approach to reveal the inherent rhythmic properties of the infant brain. Eight-month-olds (N = 42) were presented with visual stimuli flickering at discrete frequencies (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, and 30Hz) and broadband (i.e., aperiodic) stimulation, while recording a high-density electroencephalogram (EEG). As predicted, infants visual system entrained to the harmonics of the periodic stimulation frequencies (first to third). In addition, a 4Hz rhythm emerged independent of stimulation frequency. Critically, the impulse response function (IRF) of the broadband sequence revealed a perceptual echo of visual information at 4Hz. This echo lasted for about 1 second (i.e. four cycles), extended into frontal sensors, and selectively resonated the 4Hz component of the input signal. In a complementary adult assessment, we confirm an alpha response upon periodic and broadband stimulation in the present paradigm for the mature visual system. To conclude, perturbing the infant visual system elicited a neural response and resonant activity at the 4Hz theta rhythm, which contrasts with the 10Hz alpha rhythm found in the adult visual system. Neural processing dynamics are thus essential to understand early brain development in full.

Significance StatementThis study tested resonance properties of the infant visual system upon perturbation. For the visual stimulation at discrete frequencies between 2 and 30Hz, the infant brain responded at 4Hz independent of the stimulation frequency. Following broadband stimulation, a perceptual echo at 4Hz emerged - resonating the 4Hz component of visual information over several cycles. These findings reveal that the 4Hz theta rhythm is an inherent processing dynamic of the infant visual system, contrasting with the 10Hz rhythm found in adults. The processing dynamics of the human visual system undergo fundamental changes from infancy into adulthood.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""KO 6028/1-1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

While therapeutics have been developed to exploit these pH changes to modulate activity across different physiological environments, current approaches for generating pH-dependent binders, such as combinatorial histidine scanning and display-based selections, are largely empirical and often labor-intensive. Here we describe two complementary principles and associated computational methods for designing pH-dependent binders: (i) introducing histidine residues adjacent to positively charged residues at binder-target interfaces to induce electrostatic repulsion and weaken binding at low pH, and (ii) introducing buried histidine-containing charged hydrogen-bonding networks in the binder core such that the protein is destabilized under acidic conditions. Using these methods, we designed binders that dissociate at acidic pH against ephrin type-A receptor 2, tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, interleukin-6, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, and the interleukin-2 mimic Neo2. Fusions of the designs to pH-independent binders of lysosomal trafficking receptors function as catalytic degraders, inducing target degradation at substoichiometric levels.

Whilst there are known K. pneumoniae ciprofloxacin resistance determinants, there is a lack of systematic data on the effect of determinants, alone and in combination, and there are no publicly accessible tools for predicting resistance from whole genome sequence data.

METHODSThe KlebNET-GSP AMR Genotype-Phenotype Group aggregated a matched genotype-phenotype dataset of n=12,167 K. pneumoniae species complex (KpSC) isolates from 27 countries between 2001-2021. We developed a rules-based classifier to predict ciprofloxacin resistance by categorizing the number of quinolone resistance determining regions mutations in gyrA and parC, the number of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, and the presence/absence of aac(6')-Ib-cr (which can acetylate ciprofloxacin).

Predictive performance was assessed using the discovery dataset, for which we re-phenotyped discrepant isolates; and validated using externally contributed datasets (n=7,030 KpSC isolates).

RESULTSThe rules-based classifier predicted R vs S/I with categorical agreement, sensitivity, and specificity >96%, and major/very major error rates <4%. Performance was similar across diverse KpSC sources (human, animal, other), species, and intra-species lineages. External validation of the classifier yielded overall 93.12% categorical agreement [95% confidence interval (CI), 92.50-93.74%], 8.65% major errors [95% CI, 7.34-9.97%], and 6.20% very major errors [95% CI, 5.51-6.90%]. We implemented the classifier in Kleborate, a command-line tool that is integrated into the Pathogenwatch web platform. Using this to assess the global distribution of ciprofloxacin resistance determinants in KpSC genomes available in Pathogenwatch (n=31,319, from 109 countries between years 2000-2023), we observed a significant positive association between national quinolone consumption rates and predicted ciprofloxacin resistance (R2=0.20, p=0.004).

CONCLUSIONS

We investigated the distribution of fermentative yeast species in vineyards compared to nearby arboreal habitats and measured their resistance to two commonly used vineyard antimicrobials, copper and sulfite. We analyzed 4,101 strains, representing 70 species, collected from grapevine- and oak-associated substrates at 17 vineyard and 20 non-vineyard sites in the USA and Slovenia. Species frequency varied with geography and substrate, but the majority of species commonly present in vineyards were also found in non-vineyard arboreal environments, representing a potential source for vineyard colonization and exploitation of sugar from grapes. Species varied in both copper and sulfite resistance, but only Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed elevated resistance in vineyard compared to non-vineyard samples. Our results indicate that S. cerevisiae has uniquely taken advantage of vineyard environments through adaptations that appear either unnecessary or inaccessible to other yeast species present in vineyards.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GM080669;""},{""name"":""European Regional Development Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""3330-13-500031;""},{""name"":""The Slovenian Research and Innovation Agency"",""id"":""https://ror.org/059bp8k51"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ARRS J4-4300;BI-US/13-14-028;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

However, integration of environmental cues to genetic regulators for controlling tiller outgrowth remains poorly understood. We investigated the effects of nitrogen, one of the critical environmental factors, on the early stages of tiller bud outgrowth. Comprehensive temporal transcriptomic analyses in response to two nitrogen forms, nitrate (NO -) and ammonium (NH +), identified gene-regulatory networks for nitrogen-triggered tiller outgrowth, with phytohormone signaling as the central interface. Pharmacological, molecular, and genetic experiments established cytokinin-auxin antagonism as a central regulator of the nitrogen-mediated tillering. Cytokinin promoted bud outgrowth by repressing the TCP transcription factor OsTB1, the key inhibitor of tillering, via Cytokinin Response Factors OsERF53/54. OsERF53/54 further reduced polar auxin transport by repressing OsPIN1a to promote bud activation. Conversely, auxin promoted bud dormancy by inducing OsTB1 and OsPIN1a via OsARF11/16. Both NO - and NH + triggered tiller outgrowth and induced largely overlapping transcriptional responses, with a temporal delay for NO -. Adequate nitrogen supplies induced cytokinin signaling while inhibiting auxin signaling and transport in tiller buds, thereby triggering bud outgrowth. Together, we identify a key regulatory role of auxin-cytokinin antagonistic module for integrating nitrogen signals to determine tiller bud fate.","[{""name"":""Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BT/Ag/Network/Rice/2019–20;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Here, we use computational analysis and modeling to show that connectivity asymmetry supports high working-memory capacity, whereas increasing reciprocity reduces memory capacity and representational diversity in reservoir-computing models of recurrent neural networks. We systematically examine synthetic architectures inspired by mammalian cortical connectivity and find that sparse, modular, and hierarchical networks achieve superior performance, relative to random, small-world, or core-periphery graphs, but only when reciprocity is constrained. Validated on directed macaque and marmoset connectomes, these results indicate that restricting reciprocal motifs yields functional benefits in sparse networks, consistent with an evolutionary strategy for stable, efficient information processing in the brain.

Here, we present the largest curated database of giant virus metagenome-assembled genomes (GVMAGs V2), comprising 8,508 species-level clusters inferred from 18,727 genomes, originating from marine, freshwater, anthropogenic and terrestrial environments, a six-fold increase from the previous giant virus phylogenetic frameworks. Phylogenomics and relative evolutionary distance analysis revealed 712 novel genera, 13 previously unknown viral families and a new proposed order, tentatively named Mycodnavirales. We improved gene calling of 12% of giant virus genomes by accounting for alternative and custom genetic codes, enabling more accurate identification of protein-coding genes. Database mining uncovered endogenous viral elements in a broad spectrum of eukaryotes, spanning algae, fungi, and parasitic protists highlighting that giant virus integration is both widespread and evolutionarily persistent. Orthologous clustering of 2.5 million proteins identified 135,998 orthogroups representing comprehensive metabolic capabilities, such as enrichment of genes involved in aromatic compound degradation (commonly associated with bioremediation) in Algavirales genomes. Furthermore, we detected widespread biosynthetic gene clusters underpinning antimicrobial activity and antibiotic resistance, suggesting roles of giant viruses in host defense and in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes. Conversely, 67% of orthogroups have unknown functions, underscoring a substantial unexplored potential.

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors1-5, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Some of these targets have been successfully resolved by binding to antibody fragments (Fabs) or fusing with external scaffolds to increase their size. Recent advances in conventional single-particle techniques have enabled the determination of an in-creasing number of structures smaller than 100 kDa, achieving resolutions relevant to drug research. Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions. We envision that this method will further lower the molecular weight limit of single-particle cryo-EM, enabling its application to important drug-binding complexes that are below 50 kDa.","[{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Here, we identify mechanically activated ion channels PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 as key mechanotransducers required for labor progression. Genetic deletion of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in mice resulted in weakened uterine contractions and severe parturition defects. Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either the uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects, whereas combined loss significantly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing showed that loss of PIEZO reduced expression of connexin43 (Gja1), a gap junction protein in uterine smooth muscle cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to impaired contraction. These findings highlight the critical role of PIEZO channels in mechanotransduction during parturition and suggest therapeutic targets for labor dysfunction.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 NS105067;R01AT012051;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-2405-20;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CMMI-2135428;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2DK128800;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Whether chromatin assembly on newly replicated strands is also asymmetric remains unknown, as visualizing this short-lived state in cells is impossible. To circumvent this limitation, we combine in vitro reconstitution of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA and chromatin replication machineries with replication-aware single-molecule chromatin footprinting, to study how chromatin is re-assembled on replicated DNA. Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid. These pathways have implications for essential chromatin-templated processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and gene silencing at replication forks.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""851564;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04jsz6e67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Vidi.233.038;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2-HG012442;""},{""name"":""W.

Using CRISPR-Cas9 components delivered as RNA, we knocked out GABA-A receptor {beta} subunits in individual layer 2/3 cortical neurons in mouse visual cortex, eliminating fast inhibition. In vivo patch-clamp recordings revealed that cortical neurons adapted to inhibition loss through two sequential mechanisms: a transient reduction of excitatory synaptic input, followed by intrinsic membrane property changes that decreased input resistance. This sequential adaptation program ultimately prevented target neurons from contributing spikes to the cortical network.

EPP1 is recruited to the activated SYMRK receptor, where it is phosphorylated on a key serine residue, an event essential and sufficient to propagate symbiotic signaling. We provide structural and functional validation of the SYMRK-EPP1 signaling complex and demonstrate that EPP1 is required for root nodule formation. Synthetic engineering of the SYMRK-EPP1 interaction bypasses the need for symbiotic bacteria to initiate the pathway and triggers nodule organogenesis.

In particular, three genes (SYMRK, CCaMK and CYCLOPS) form the core of an ancestral common symbiosis pathway (CSP) for intracellular symbioses, and are conserved since the most recent common ancestor of land plants (Radhakrishnan et al. 2020; Delaux et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2010; Parniske 2008).

We found that loss-of-function epp1 mutants or EPP1 knock down lines in four clades of land plants are all impaired in their ability to associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We discovered that the plasma membrane-localized receptor-like SYMRK phosphorylates EPP1 on a conserved serine residue and that this phosphorylation is essential for symbiosis.

Many of the same genes were targeted in opposite directions across environments (deleted in glucose, duplicated in galactose), linking structural remodeling to divergent physiological strategies. History-dependent fitness costs were pronounced early for glucose-evolved lines after galactose preculture but diminished by ~900 generations, whereas costs deepened in galactose-evolved lines after glucose preculture. A linear modeling framework identified ancestral fitness as the strongest predictor of evolved fitness, with evolutionary time contributing modestly and preconditioning/recovery exerting subtle, time-dependent effects. Together, these results argue that predictable, environment-specific CNV trajectories, rather than SNP accumulation, underlie the bulk of adaptation, and that structural variation operates within constraints imposed by the starting genotype and regulatory architecture.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04reqzt68"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IA/S/19/2/504632;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Some fungal NLRs are known to control regulated cell death (RCD) in the context of allorecognition, the capacity to recognize conspecific nonself. However, the function of most fungal NLR genes remains unknown. Here, we characterize the evolution of the NLR repertoire in the Podospora anserina species complex. We show that the vast majority of the NLRs display effector domains known to be involved in RCD execution. Moreover, NLRs undergo more rapid gene turnover than random genes, show higher dN/dS values, and faster evolutionary rates. A subgroup of NLRs, distinguished by superstructure-forming repeats with very high sequence identity (high internal conservation, HIC), evolved independently multiple times. We found that HIC NLRs are more associated with transposable elements, exhibit higher nucleotide diversity partially driven by repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), and show elevated Tajima's D values indicative of balancing selection. Furthermore, HIC NLR phylogenies do not recapitulate species relationships, which we determined is caused by both balancing selection and introgression. In addition, we identified cases of repeat exchange between distinct HIC NLR genes, implying that novel binding specificities may evolve through repeat shuffling, thereby increasing allelic diversity. Finally, we determined that NLR-like genes with HIC repeats exist outside of the fungal realm, arguing for similar dynamics in other taxa. Overall, these findings suggest that fungal NLRs evolve under diversity-enhancing mechanisms and display selective signatures consistent with a general immune function.","[{""name"":""Swedish Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03zttf063"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-00341;""},{""name"":""Stiftelsen Anna-Greta och Holger Crafoords fond, Stockholm, SE"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CR2023-0039;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Though incompletely understood, the relationship between chromatin accessibility and enhancer activity has been exploited to identify, model, and even design functional enhancers for selected cell types, but to what extent this design strategy can generalize across human cell and tissue types remains unclear. Here, we trained deep neural networks on a large corpus of chromatin accessibility data from hundreds of human biosamples. We used these models to generate an atlas of tens of thousands of synthetic enhancers, targeting hundreds of cell lines, tissues, and differentiation states, aiming to maximize accessibility in target samples and minimize it in all off-target ones. Experimental testing of thousands of designs in a representative subset of ten human cell types and in mouse retina demonstrated their function as specific enhancers, not only in the case of one-versus-all objectives but also when targeting two or three cell types. An explainable AI analysis, enabled by our large-scale enhancer measurements, allowed us to identify similarities and differences between the sequence grammar underlying accessibility and enhancer activity.

We sought to characterize Long COVID-19 in this population. Predictors and outcomes of Long COVID-19 were evaluated in hospitalized and ambulatory patients aged <16 years receiving treatment during 2021-2023 at the University Hospital of the West Indies, Jamaica. Methods: This retrospective observational cohort study, approved by the University Ethics Committee, extracted medical records data from ill SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and then surveyed this cohort for symptoms of Long COVID-19. Poisson regression models accounted for varying follow-up times after acute COVID-19 and generated univariate and multivariable models for predictors of Long COVID-19. Results: Forty-seven percent of the 74 survey responders met the WHO 2023 pediatric criteria for Long COVID-19. Common symptoms of Long COVID-19 included cough, chest tightness, fatigue, congestion, ageusia, anosmia, anorexia, and insomnia. Acute illness symptoms associated with Long COVID-19 included fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, anosmia, abdominal pain, confusion, brain fog, persistent chest tightness, cough, nasal congestion, ageusia, anosmia, insomnia, and chest pain (IRR=1.61-2.56; p=0.000-0.034). Between those with and without Long COVID-19, there were no significant differences in demographics, comorbidities, SARS-CoV-2 variant, site of care, functional impairment and quality of life. Acute illness univariate Long COVID-19 predictors were vomiting, abdominal pain, ageusia, fatigue, confusion, brain fog, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome of children (MIS-C) (p<0.05; IRR>1.0). Multivariable composite predictors were MIS-C, vomiting, and ageusia (Pseudo R2:11.9%; p<0.001). Conclusion: This 47% prevalence of Long COVID-19 in pediatric patients implies potential negative outcomes in productivity, academic performance, and comorbidity development.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759442931011

Here, we investigate for the first time the role of the double-stranded RBP Staufen2 (STAU2) in human neurogenesis. Characterization of STAU2 knockout iPSC derived cells using scRNA-seq shows that loss of STAU2 disrupts neuroepithelial cell identity and accelerates neural differentiation by altering the activity of key transcription factors and driving early metabolic transitions. Additionally, STAU2 regulates the expression of miRNA host genes and alters miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional control in progenitor cells, which exerts additional effects on STAU2 regulated gene regulatory networks. These changes result in neural progenitor exhaustion, unstructured neural rosettes, and reduced organoid size. Together, our work uncovers a previously unrecognized role for STAU2 as a central regulator of early human neurogenesis, acting through both miRNA-mediated and transcriptional pathways to coordinate progenitor maintenance and neuronal fate specification.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

The conserved, ancient target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase is a central metabolic regulator in eukaryotes that integrates carbon and nitrogen to maintain homeostasis and promote growth and development through protein synthesis. While TOR regulatory mechanisms of amino acid accumulation are well known in yeast and mammals, they remain unknown in photosynthetic organisms. Here, we developed the unicellular green alga Chromochloris zofingiensis as a simpler model system for understanding TOR function. Multiomics experiments showed that TOR inhibition leads to an increase in amino acid levels independent of hexokinase-mediated glucose signaling. We observed upregulation of selective amino acid biosynthesis pathways at the transcript and protein levels as potential mechanisms driving the increase in amino acids. Transcriptomics and proteomics experiments identified a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor with rapid upregulation during TOR inhibition. DAP-seq analysis demonstrated that bHLH can bind directly to the promoters of amino acid biosynthesis genes, potentially regulating their transcription in response to TOR inhibition. We found high conservation of the bHLH-binding motif in the genomes of other green algae and plants, suggesting a conserved regulatory mechanism for amino acid biosynthesis across Viridiplantae. Phosphoproteomics experiments also revealed novel conserved targets that are not currently recognized as part of the TOR pathway. Altogether, our findings elucidate the transcriptional regulation of amino acid metabolism and explain how TOR regulates nitrogen metabolism to support growth and development in photosynthetic organisms.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

EC significantly reduced alpha power. EC also tended to increase neural complexity, unlike other states in which consciousness is absent (e.g., sleep, anesthesia, disorders of consciousness).

How do memories that are seemingly inaccessible persistently influence cognitive processes and behaviors throughout life? Rodent studies have demonstrated that forgotten infantile memories remain encoded as latent ""infantile memory engrams"" (iEngrams) within neuronal circuits, capable of memory reinstatement under artificial experimental conditions. Still, the network mechanisms underpinning the natural reinstatement of a forgotten infantile memory are unknown. Here, we show that infantile memories, though physiologically irretrievable in adults, remain stored within hippocampal circuits and their engrams contribute to hippocampal network dynamics. Crucially, reinstating these memories requires a carefully orchestrated network process. An initial contextual reminder primes the hippocampal network to increase activity of the iEngram during a subsequent aversive reminder, which tags iEngram neurons for offline reactivation. This reactivation facilitates the integration of previously latent infantile memories with novel neuronal ensembles, reinstating behavior consistent with the original memory. These findings critically advance our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying physiological memory encoding, retrieval, and reinstatement across development. Furthermore, they delineate the temporal boundaries and underlying physiological substrate of the process by which a latent representation becomes associated with a novel neuronal substrate, suggesting potential interventions to prevent the maladaptive reinstatement of traumatic infantile memories.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ERC-ST2019 850769;""},{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CEGP3_194220;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

DESIGNThe Phase IIb/III ANAVEX2-73-AD-004 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week trial with prespecified gene or GWAS identified genetic variant populations related to the mechanism of the pharmacological intervention.

OBJECTIVEProviding evidence of improved Precision Medicine neurology clinical treatment responses with optimal blarcamesine dose for up to [~]70% of AD patients within prespecified SIGMAR1 (ABCLEAR1) and GWAS identified COL24A1 (ABCLEAR2) and SIGMAR1/COL24A1 (ABCLEAR3) non-missense gene populations. Describing once-daily, oral therapeutic intervention of blarcamesine in early AD, with a differentiated upstream and constitutional mechanism of action by enhancing autophagy through SIGMAR1 activation and restoration of cellular homeostasis.

SETTINGMulticenter - 52 medical research centers/hospitals in 5 countries.

INTERVENTION508 participants with Early AD (Stage 3) were randomized to receive blarcamesine (n = 338) oral capsules once daily either in medium dose group (30 mg) or in high dose group (50 mg) or placebo (n = 170) for 48 weeks. An open-label-extension study ATTENTION-AD, continued for up to 192 weeks.

MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURESFurther improved clinical and biomarker outcomes of the ABCLEAR2 and ABCLEAR3 populations were accretive to the previously reported intent-to-treat (ITT) and prespecified ABCLEAR1 populations. The co-primary cognitive and functional outcomes were assessed as changes in ADAS-Cog13 and ADCS-ADL from baseline to 48 weeks. The outcomes include the secondary outcome CDR-SB as well as patient assessed clinical outcomes CGI-I, NPI-Q and QoL-AD (Quality of Life AD Patient) as well as biomarkers global brain volume changes measured by MRI. All clinical endpoints were analyzed using mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), and volumetric MRI scans were analyzed by general linear model.

RESULTSThe ITT population (mean age, 73.7 years; 225 [48.7%] women), consisted of 462 randomized participants, with ABCLEAR1 population comprising of 300 participants, ABCLEAR2 population of 336 participants and ABCLEAR3 of 222 participants. In both the ABCLEAR2 and ABCLEAR3 populations, the co-primary outcomes as well as all other clinical outcomes were statistically significant. ABCLEAR3 blarcamesine group vs. placebo at Week 48 (ADAS-Cog13 difference of -4.179 [95% CI -6.512, -1.845]; P=0.0005; ADCS-ADL difference of +3.131 [95%CI 0.720, 5.542]; P=0.0111; CDR-SB difference of -1.076 [95% CI -1.645, -0.508]; P=0.0002; QoL-AD Patient improvement from baseline of 0.334 [95% CI -1.164, 1.833] and difference of 1.848 [95% CI 0.455, 3.241]; P=0.0095). The clinical outcomes were strongest in the blarcamesine 30 mg cohort (ADAS-Cog13 difference of -4.739 [95% CI -7.370, -2.108]; P=0.0004; ADCS-ADL difference of +4.245 [95%CI 1.518, 6.972]; P=0.0024; CDR-SB difference of -1.414 [95% CI -2.054, -0.775]; P<0.0001; QoL-AD Patient improvement from baseline of 0.182 [95% CI -1.472, 1.835]; and difference of 1.651 [95% CI 0.455, 3.241]; P=0.0392). Whole brain volume loss in blarcamesine group vs. placebo was significantly further decreased from ITT population (37.6%, P=0.0019) to ABCLEAR3 population (44.5%, P=0.0019). Participants in the 30 mg group ABCLEAR3 full safety population with [&ge;]1 serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 10 participants (12.7%) in the blarcamesine and 6 (9.1%) in the placebo group. Common TEAEs included dizziness, which was transient and mostly mild to moderate in severity. There were no deaths in the blarcamesine group and 1 in the placebo group.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEBlarcamesine group demonstrated a balanced safety profile with no associated neuroimaging adverse events. The respective once-daily oral 30 mg blarcamesine cohort in the respective ABCLEAR1, ABCLEAR2, and ABCLEAR3 populations demonstrates further improvement of the already adequate safety profile of the ITT population and hence representing the dose with the most balanced benefit-to-risk ratio. In both ABCLEAR2 and ABCLEAR3 populations significant slowing in decline and even stabilization of clinical worsening was demonstrated. Blarcamesine group vs. placebo was 75.9% reduction in decline at 48 weeks in the total blarcamesine group and was 84.7% in the 30 mg dose group, respectively on the prespecified co-primary cognitive endpoint ADAS-Cog13 in the ABCLEAR3 population. Blarcamesine demonstrated consistently significantly improved clinical effect for all clinical endpoints, which was in accordance with significant and further reduced brain atrophy. Furthermore, a significant absolute improvement in Quality of Life (QoL-AD) scores indicating a reversal of negative trajectory for Alzheimers disease patients from baseline to end of trial was observed. The Phase IIb/III ANAVEX2-73-AD-004 clinical study confirmed blarcamesines consistent efficacy leading to improved cognitive stabilization with continued benefit in the open-label-extension study ATTENTION-AD up to 192 weeks. Evidenced by the Precision Medicine paradigm, including in a prespecified ABCLEAR1 population, a consistent significant improvement for all clinical endpoints in the ABCLEAR2 and ABCLEAR3 populations, respectively, was demonstrated. Coupled with a convenient once daily, oral pill administration, blarcamesine could represent a novel treatment option for up to [~]70% of early AD patients benefiting from further improved outcomes using directed Precision Medicine to alleviate significant medical and economic burden.

While these models demonstrate race-based and binary gender biases, anti-LGBTQIA+ bias remains understudied despite documented healthcare disparities affecting these populations. In this work, we evaluated the potential of LLMs to propagate anti-LGBTQIA+ medical bias and misinformation. We prompted 4 LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Flash, Claude 3 Haiku, GPT-4o, Stanford Medicine Secure GPT [GPT-4.0]) with 38 prompts consisting of explicit questions and synthetic clinical notes created by medically-trained reviewers and LGBTQIA+ health experts. The prompts consisted of pairs of prompts with and without LGBTQIA+ identity terms and explored clinical situations across two axes: (i) situations where historical bias has been observed versus not observed, and (ii) situations where LGBTQIA+ identity is relevant to clinical care versus not relevant. Medically-trained reviewers evaluated LLM responses for appropriateness (safety, privacy, hallucination/accuracy, and bias) and clinical utility. We found that all 4 LLMs generated inappropriate responses for prompts with and without LGBTQIA+ identity terms. The proportion of inappropriate responses ranged from 43-62% for prompts mentioning LGBTQIA+ identities versus 47-65% for those without. The most common reason for inappropriate classification tended to be hallucination/accuracy, followed by bias or safety. Qualitatively, we observed differential bias patterns, with LGBTQIA+ prompts eliciting more severe bias. Average clinical utility score for inappropriate responses was lower than for appropriate responses (2.6 versus 3.7 on a 5-point Likert scale). Future work should focus on tailoring output formats to stated use cases, decreasing sycophancy and reliance on extraneous information in the prompt, and improving accuracy and decreasing bias for LGBTQIA+ patients. We present our prompts and annotated responses as a benchmark for evaluation of future models. Content warning: This paper includes prompts and model-generated responses that may be offensive.

Author summaryLarge Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have the potential to enhance healthcare by assisting with tasks like responding to patient messages and assisting providers in making medical decisions. However, these technologies might inadvertently spread medical misinformation or reinforce harmful biases against minoritized groups. Our research examined the risk of LLMs perpetuating anti-LGBTQIA+ biases in medical contexts.

We tested four LLMs with prompts designed by medical and LGBTQIA+ health experts. These prompts addressed various clinical scenarios, some historically linked to bias against LGBTQIA+ individuals. Our evaluation revealed that all four LLMs produced responses that were inaccurate or biased for prompts with and without LGBTQIA+ identity terms mentioned. Qualitatively, the nature of inappropriate responses differed between these groups, with LGBTQIA+ identity terms eliciting more severe bias. The clinical utility of responses was, on average, lower for inappropriate responses than for appropriate responses.

These findings highlight the urgent need to ensure that LLMs used in medical contexts provide accurate and safe medical advice for LGBTQIA+ patients. Future efforts should focus on refining how LLMs generate responses, minimizing biases, and enhancing reliability in clinical settings in addition to critically examining use cases. This work is crucial for fostering equitable healthcare for all individuals.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759442931011

Experimental validation of two divergent Cas13an-like effectors demonstrated RNA knockdown capacity in human cells, confirming our framework's predictive power. These findings expand the functional repertoire of CRISPR-associated proteins and highlight unexplored modes of microbial immunity.

We present updates to Giraffe that allow it to quickly and accurately map long reads to pangenome graphs. For both short and long reads, Giraffe mapping to a pangenome containing data from more than 450 human haplotypes, generated by the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, is comparable in speed to linear mappers to human reference genomes; Giraffe is also over an order of magnitude faster than GraphAligner, the current state-of-the-art long-read-to-pangenome mapper. Its alignments produce similar or improved small and structural variant calling results, compared to those from commonly used graph-based and linear mappers.

Risk is shaped by both heritable factors and non-genetic environmental, behavioral, and social determinants of health, but these are rarely modeled together. The growing availability of large-scale, multimodal biobanks creates new opportunities to integrate diverse data types into more accurate disease risk models. Here, we apply Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to over 100 environmental, behavioral, and social variables from the All of Us biobank (N = 171,614) to generate low-dimensional embeddings that quantify non-genetic risk for six common chronic conditions. These embeddings recovered known and novel risk factors and consistently improved prediction beyond demographics and polygenic scores (PGS), with contributions to model performance (ROC-AUC) ranging from 0.03 to 0.05. For five of six diseases, the gains from MCA embeddings surpassed those attributable to PGS. Genetic and non-genetic risks combined largely additively: we observed little evidence of interaction effects ({Delta}AUC < 0.001) and highly stable variant effect sizes when embeddings were included in genetic association models (r > 0.98). In summary, we introduce a scalable, interpretable framework that summarizes survey-based environmental, behavioral, and social factors without prior assumptions about disease-specific variables. Our results demonstrate that these non-genetic contexts substantially improve prediction while acting largely additively with genetic risk, clarifying the role of gene-environment interplay in complex disease and supporting more equitable and robust risk modeling across diverse populations.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759442931011

Processes that govern species-specific aspects of human postnatal brain development are difficult to study in animal models.

Here, we developed human brain organoids for an unprecedented 5 years in culture, optimizing growth conditions able to extend excitatory neuron viability beyond previously-known limits. Using module scores of maturation-associated genes derived from a time course of endogenous human brain maturation, we show that brain organoids transcriptionally age with cell type-specificity through these many years in culture. Whole-genome methylation profiling reveals that the predicted epigenomic age of organoids sampled between 3 months and 5 years correlates precisely with time spent in vitro, and parallels epigenomic aging in vivo. Notably, we show that in chimeric organoids generated by mixing neural progenitors derived from 'old' organoids with progenitors from 'young' organoids, old progenitors rapidly produce late neuronal fates, skipping the production of earlier neuronal progeny that are instead produced by their young counterparts in the same co-cultures. The data indicate that human brain organoids can mature and record the passage of time over many years in culture. Progenitors that age in organoids retain a memory of the time spent in culture reflected in their ability to execute age-appropriate, late developmental programs.","[{""name"":""Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01tm9b530"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Klarman Cell Observatory"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Whole-genome sequencing of 3,102 individuals reveals that these traits are largely controlled by few loci of major effect with partially overlapping architectures. Temporal allele frequency analyses show subtle but consistent shifts at these loci. Simulations indicate that genetic drift alone cannot explain these changes, whereas models incorporating selection do.

Animal studies reveal that in individual neurons of the primary visual cortex (V1), anesthesia modulates the gain of neural responses while leaving orientation and direction tuning unaltered. However, the impact of anesthesia on spatial frequency (SF) tuning is largely unexplored despite it being a fundamental characteristic of visual perception. Furthermore, compared to excitatory neurons, the effects of anesthesia on the visual responsiveness of specific inhibitory neuron subtypes are poorly understood. Here, we directly compared visual responses from the same V1 neurons in mice under both anesthetized and awake states. We found that isoflurane anesthesia significantly shifts the preferred SFs of excitatory neurons to lower values. This downward shift was even more pronounced in inhibitory neurons. These downshifts selectively impaired the neural coding of high-SF information while leaving low-SF coding unaffected. We observed distinct patterns of anesthesia-induced downward shifts of preferred SFs between two major cortical inhibitory neuron subtypes: somatostatin-expressing (SOM) and parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons. Furthermore, anesthesia-induced changes in response gain and tuning sharpness were evident in SOM neurons but not in PV neurons. These results highlight the diverse effects of anesthesia on sensory responses, varying significantly based on both the visual feature processed and the specific neuron subtype involved. The consistent decrease in preferred SFs during anesthesia not only suggests a potential mechanism for anesthesia-induced alterations in sensory experience but also emphasizes the critical role of heightened SF preference during wakefulness for fine object perception.","[{""name"":""JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""21H026000;24K02140;""},{""name"":""JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Research (Pioneering)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""23K17409;""},{""name"":""National Health Medical Research Council"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GNT1183280;GNT2037172;""},{""name"":""Australian Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mmh0f86"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP240102680;""},{""name"":""JSPS of Science Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Areas (A)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""23H04829;23H04830;""},{""name"":""JST Moonshot R&D Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JPMJMS2295-14;""},{""name"":""Theoretical Sciences Visiting Program, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology."",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

In brush-footed butterflies (Nymphalidae), this diversity can be traced to the wing pattern ""ground plan"" that generates phenotypes deterministic in origin yet highly multidimensional in form. Quantifying such complexity at scale has long been a challenge, limiting our understanding of how visual signals interact, constrain one another, and evolve. Here, we used computer vision to extract high-dimensional traits from standardized museum specimens and assembled the largest comparative dataset of wing color patterns to date, spanning over one third of all known Nymphalid species. We first tested whether chemically defended species occupy a distinct region in morphospace and then derived a quantitative score for aposematism from the principal color patterns associated with defense. Using this score, we examined whether aposematic signals are expressed consistently across wing surfaces and sexes, and whether their origins are linked to shifts in evolutionary rate. We found that the dominant axis of morphospace is defined by chromatic and achromatic contrast, along which defended and undefended species cluster. Validation with an expert-labeled moth dataset confirmed that this axis separates aposematic from non-aposematic phenotypes across Lepidoptera. Consistent with theory, strongly aposematic species showed greater visual similarity between dorsal and ventral surfaces, between sexes, and among individuals. Rate analyses further indicated that aposematic patterns evolved repeatedly and were associated with non-linear shifts in evolutionary tempo. Together, these results identify aposematism as the dominant organizing axis of wing color pattern evolution in Nymphalidae.","[{""name"":""Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""304291/2020-0;408764/2024-4;""},{""name"":""Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2021/03868-8;14/23504-7;17/12716-1;""},{""name"":""Fundação de Apoio ao Ensino, Pesquisa e Extensão"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""convênio 519.292 solicitação 059/15;""},{""name"":""Research Opportunity Seed Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""#00133613;""},{""name"":""SEED AI award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""#00133688;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

We investigated how the structure of working-memory representations in the cortex compares to task representations that do not involve working memory. We used a task-switching paradigm in virtual reality, where mice alternated between a navigation-based working-memory task and a simpler task with matched sensorimotor demands. During behavior, we simultaneously imaged three cortical areas: higher visual area AM, and two association areas-premotor (M2) and retrosplenial cortex. At the single-neuron level, trial-averaged activity appeared similar across tasks. However, pairwise correlations decreased during the working-memory task, particularly in association areas. In addition, the corresponding linear task subspace explained the variance of both tasks equally well, whereas the simpler task subspace failed to do so, suggesting an asymmetric relationship between them. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction revealed a shared low-dimensional structure across tasks. Yet, the organization of neuronal firing fields along this shared structure accounted for the difference in pairwise correlations: in the working-memory task, firing fields were more disjoint, especially among neurons in association areas that formed sequences along the memory dimension. Moreover, the degree of overlap between these firing fields predicted the mice's behavioral reliance on working memory. We conclude that behaviors varying in cognitive demands are supported by a single low-dimensional neural structure, which can expand or contract depending on cognitive load. We thus provide a framework for how task representations across the cortex reconfigure to support cognitive processes.","[{""name"":""EMBO Postdoctoral Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 384-2020;""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U19NS132720;K99MH120047;R00K99MH120047;""},{""name"":""SCGB"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AWD543027;""},{""name"":""C.V.

We use artificial selection to investigate the evolutionary response of clonal reproduction in the common monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus), a species with extensive life history variation. We first characterize the standing genetic variation in a single perennial population, and then conduct four generations of divergent artificial selection on stolon number - the mechanism of clonal reproduction in this species. To start, stolon number had moderate heritability (H2=0.25) and was negatively genetically correlated with reproductive traits. Artificial selection produced a clear but asymmetrical response. High selection lines made significantly more stolons, while low lines diverged less from controls. Analyses of G matrices revealed that selection not only changed trait means but also genetic correlations, with high lines diverging more in multivariate genetic architecture. Our results demonstrate that single populations harbor sufficient genetic variation to respond rapidly to selection on clonality, and the response is shaped by existing patterns of genetic covariation. The capacity for rapid evolution of clonal traits is particularly relevant as climate change alters selection and shifts the relative advantages of sexual versus clonal life-history strategies.","[{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Two elite public soybean varieties, carrying either rhg1-a + Rhg4 or rhg1-b, negatively impacted Pp populations measured at 30 dpi. This contribution of Rhg1 was more rigorously demonstrated using near isogenic lines for rhg1-b. Additionally, in three of the four soybean SCN-susceptible genotypes tested we observed significantly more Pp when Pp were co-inoculated with SCN, consistent with a previous study. No significant changes in SCN cyst numbers upon co-inoculation with Pp were observed for any of the rhg1 resistant lines. No nematode-induced changes in Rhg1 transcript abundances were observed when sampling infected root sections in any of the plant genotypes, and no changes in a jasmonate response indicator were observed.

In this study we identify the Arabidopsis HEAT SHOCK FACTOR A1 (HSFA1) class of transcription factors, being key regulators of the heat stress response, as central players in wound-induced callus formation and shoot regeneration. Loss of HSFA1 function in the hsfa1abd triple mutants severely impairs cellular reprogramming, reducing callus formation from wounded hypocotyls, as well as shoot regeneration from explants. Conversely, overexpression of the HSFA1d gain-of-function variant markedly enhances regeneration. Time-series RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses revealed that HSFA1s directly activate the key reprogramming regulators WOUND-INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION 1 (WIND1), PLETHORA 3 (PLT3) and ZINC FINGER OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 6 (ZAT6). Furthermore, we demonstrate that HSFA1d activity is attenuated by SIZ1-mediated SUMOylation, linking post-translational modification to the regulation of wound responses. Our findings establish HSFA1s as an early transcriptional hub that integrates wound signals with the activation of a broad gene network that drives cellular reprogramming, thereby providing a mechanistic framework for understanding how stress-responsive transcription factors control regeneration.","[{""name"":""Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/048rj2z13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""22K15150;20H04893;22H05075;24K02051;20H05911;23KF0089;""},{""name"":""Japan Science and Technology Agency"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00097mb19"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PRESTO JPMJPR20D2;Gtex JPMJGXx23B;ASPIRE JPMJAP2306;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Although TDP-43 is known to regulate RNA processing, including repression of cryptic exons, we currently lack a systems-level understanding of the consequences of TDP-43 loss. To address this, we generated multiomic datasets, including RNA-seq and proteomics, from human iPSC-derived neurons depleted of TDP-43. We found that differentially spliced genes, many expressing cryptic exons, had the greatest protein reductions. Surprisingly, nearly half of differentially expressed proteins were neither mis-spliced, nor differentially expressed genes; most of these also had no reported mis-splicing in seven additional post-mortem and iPSC-derived neuron datasets. Integrative network analysis identified a high-confidence disease-specific subnetwork of over 700 interacting proteins, enriched for mRNA processing, synaptic function, and autophagy. Comparison with post-mortem ALS and FTD samples revealed convergent protein and pathway disruptions. We experimentally validated network-predicted effects of cryptic splicing in ATG4B, STMN2, and DAPK1. Our analyses reveal new TDP-43-dependent molecular cascades and nominate central genes as potential ALS/FTD therapeutic targets.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R00AG080036;RF1 AG075901;RF1 AG076214;R01NS120992;U54NS123743;ZIAAG000534;""},{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1745302;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

KL perception by KAI2/D14L promotes DWARF3 (D3)/MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2 (MAX2) F-box protein-mediated ubiquitination of SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1 (SMAX1) proteins, thereby transducing the KL signals. Although genetic and in vivo assays have demonstrated the functions of these components, the biochemical details of their interactions remain elusive. Here we investigated physical interactions between rice D14L, D3, and OsSMAX1 in vitro using desmethyl germinone (dMGer), a recently developed KL analog. dMGer elicited KL responses in rice with higher activity and pathway specificity than a widely used KL analog (-)-GR24. dMGer, but not (-)-GR24, directly bound to D14L and promoted the interaction between D14L and D3 in vitro. The interaction between D14L and OsSMAX1 was also enhanced by dMGer. Furthermore, we identified the domain of OsSMAX1 that distinguishes it from its paralog DWARF53 (D53), which is associated with the strigolactone signaling complex. These findings propose a model of the interactions among KL signaling components and highlight the role of the ligand in the signaling complex.","[{""name"":""Key Laboratory of Plant Carbon Capture, Chinese Academy of Sciences"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Computations for weighing alternatives, committing to an option, integrating evidence, and abandoning an option are dominantly formalized in reinforcement learning (RL). Yet, ecological considerations showcase foraging as a competing account. Identifying how the brain actually solves efficient weighing of options requires the identification of the neural representation of this abstract yet precise computation. We recorded neural populations from three areas of the primate frontal cortex involved in decision making to characterize neural dynamics while animals performed a standard RL task. By combining behavioral and neuron population analysis, we found a neural subspace in midcingulate (MCC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC) that precisely tracked value computations. We demonstrated that MCC dynamics showed signatures of foraging-like computation but conflicted with RL requirements. Our study thus provides a detailed neural account of foraging-like flexibility in the primate frontal cortex.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Although impaired angiogenesis is commonly observed in BRONJ, the underlying vascular mechanisms remain poorly understood, impeding the development of effective treatments. In this study, we integrated whole-organ tissue-clearing imaging, single-cell transcriptomics, and proteomics to construct a multimodal atlas of the mandibular microenvironment in both mouse and human BRONJ. Our findings revealed gross vascular and lymphatic rarefaction in BRONJ, along with 4 endothelial subtypes uniformly exhibiting aberrant upregulation of Col2a1. Moreover, fibroblasts and macrophages emerged as key endothelial interactors, collectively underscoring dysregulation of the endothelium-matrix-immune axis. Unlike homeostatic Dmp1/Tfap2a fibroblasts and Stab1 macrophages, BRONJ lesions featured pathological Lrrc15/Chad fibroblasts and Il6 macrophages, which promote ectopic chondrogenesis and inflammation. Mechanistically, BRONJ activated the COL2A1-CD44 axis (EC-to-fibroblast/macrophage signaling) and COL2A1-SDC4 axis (EC-to-fibroblast signaling), whereas lineage tracing excluded endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), implicating extracellular matrix remodeling as the driver of dysfunction. Cross-species validation in human mandibles further confirmed vascular-lymphatic dysregulation, inflammatory activation, and aberrant chondrogenesis. Overall, this study establishes vascular and lymphatic dysfunction as a central pathological hallmark of BRONJ, driving matrix remodeling dysregulation and immune-inflammatory imbalance, and identifies the COL2A1-CD44/SDC4 axis as a potential therapeutic target for BRONJ.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education (MOE) Singapore"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Nature Science Foundations of China"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011

Their activation by fasting is key for survival and is thought to be triggered by feedback when energy stores are low. However, we know that environmental cues can also regulate AgRP neurons, since cues that predict future food intake rapidly inhibit AgRP neurons. But is the converse true: can the prediction of future fasting rapidly activate AgRP neurons? Here we show that such rapid fasting activation of AgRP neurons does occur. This fasting response is driven by excitatory input from paraventricular hypothalamic neurons expressing Sim2, which are bidirectionally sensitive to predictions of future energy state. In this way, cognitively-processed contextual information conveyed by PVHSim2 neurons strongly activates AgRP neurons. Lastly, chronic silencing of PVHSim2 neurons causes persistent hypophagia. This PVHSim2 to AgRP neuron circuit, by anticipating and preventing negative energy balance, provides an important new dimension of hunger regulation.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759442931011
