Here, we describe a general deep-learning-guided approach for de novo design of dynamic changes between intra-domain geometries of proteins, similar to switch mechanisms prevalent in nature, with atom-level precision. We solve 4 structures validating the designed conformations, show microsecond transitions between them, and demonstrate that the conformational landscape can be modulated by orthosteric ligands and allosteric mutations. Physics-based simulations are in remarkable agreement with deep-learning predictions and experimental data, reveal distinct state-dependent residue interaction networks, and predict mutations that tune the designed conformational landscape. Our approach demonstrates that new modes of motion can now be realized through de novo design and provides a framework for constructing biology-inspired, tunable and controllable protein signaling behavior de novo.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

This is a powerful approach since it is a multi-region measurement, but because the imaging is done post-mortem, each animal only provides one set of counts. Experiments are expensive and since cells are counted by imaging and aligning a large number of brain sections, they are time-intensive. The resulting datasets tend to be under-sampled with fewer animals than brain regions. As a consequence, these data are a challenge for traditional statistical approaches. We demonstrate that hierarchical Bayesian methods are well suited to these data by presenting a 'standard' partially-pooled Bayesian model for multi-region cell-count data and applying it to two example datasets. For both datasets the Bayesian model outperformed standard parallel t-tests. Overall, the Bayesian approach's ability to capture nested data and its rigorous handling of uncertainty in under-sampled data can substantially improve inference for cell-count data.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

Previous studies, including our own research, have shown that specific interneuron subtypes are closely associated with particular pyramidal neuron types, forming stereotyped local inhibitory microcircuits. However, the developmental processes that establish these precise networks are not well understood. Here we show that pyramidal neuron types are instrumental in driving the terminal differentiation and maintaining the survival of specific associated interneuron subtypes. In a wild-type cortex, the relative abundance of different interneuron subtypes aligns precisely with the pyramidal neuron types to which they synaptically target. In Fezf2 mutant cortex, characterized by the absence of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons and an expansion of layer 6 intratelencephalic neurons, we observed a corresponding decrease in associated layer 5b interneurons and an increase in layer 6 subtypes. Interestingly, these shifts in composition are achieved through mechanisms specific to different interneuron types. While SST interneurons adjust their abundance to the change in pyramidal neuron prevalence through the regulation of programmed cell death, parvalbumin interneurons alter their identity. These findings illustrate two key strategies by which the dynamic interplay between pyramidal neurons and interneurons allows local microcircuits to be sculpted precisely. These insights underscore the precise roles of extrinsic signals from pyramidal cells in the establishment of interneuron diversity and their subsequent integration into local cortical microcircuits.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

These distinct properties make recoded cells state-of-the-art safe technologies. However, evolutionary pressures may endanger the longevity of the recoding. Here, we reveal that recoded Escherichia coli lacking 18,214 serine codons and two tRNASer can express wild-type antibiotic resistance genes and escape up to seven orders of magnitude faster than expected. We show a two-step escape process whereby recoded cells mistranslate antibiotic resistance genes to survive until modified or mutated tRNAs reintroduce serine into unassigned codons. We developed genetic-code-sensitive kill switches that sense serine incorporation and prevent cellular escape while preserving encoding of three distinct non-standard amino acids.

While much of the current understanding of P. syringae is centered on interactions with flowering plants, much less is known about infection in evolutionarily divergent non-flowering lineages. Here, we took a comparative evolutionary approach to understand how P. syringae infects distantly related plants. We identify broad host P. syringae isolates causing significant disease in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, the fern Ceratopteris richardii, and the flowering plant Nicotiana benthamiana, which last shared a common ancestor over 500 million years ago. We demonstrate that phytotoxin enriched isolates belonging to the phylogroup 2 clade of the P. syringae species complex are particularly virulent in non-flowering plants, relying on a combination of type-3 secreted effector proteins and the lipopeptide phytotoxin syringomycin. The application of purified syringomycin promotes necrosis in diverse host tissues and activates conserved genes associated with redox regulation and cell death. Toxin-deficient phylogroups normally unable to infect Marchantia thalli exhibit enhanced bacterial growth when supplemented with exogenous syringomycin, further highlighting its role as a host-range defining factor in Pseudomonas. Collectively our research reveals a key role for the lipopeptide syringomycin in promoting Pseudomonas colonization, which works in concert with type-3 effector proteins to antagonize an exceptionally wide spectrum of land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

We introduce EVOLVEpro, a few-shot active learning framework to rapidly improve protein activity using a combination of PLMs and protein activity predictors, achieving improved activity with as few as four rounds of evolution. EVOLVEpro substantially enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of in silico protein evolution, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods and yielding proteins with up to 100-fold improvement of desired properties. We showcase EVOLVEpro for five proteins across three applications: T7 RNA polymerase for RNA production, a miniature CRISPR nuclease, a prime editor, and an integrase for genome editing, and a monoclonal antibody for epitope binding. These results demonstrate the advantages of few-shot active learning with small amounts of experimental data over zero-shot predictions.

The latest example is the BA.2.86 Variant Of Interest (VOI), which rapidly outcompeted all other lineages following its detection in late July 2023. Descending sublineages dominated globally by July 2024, at the time of writing this study. The mechanisms by which highly-divergent viral lineages tend to emerge remain unclear, with the most strongly supported hypothesis being the acquisition of multiple mutations through accelerated evolution in chronically infected individuals, with spread back into the community facilitated by prolonged shedding. We used BA.2.86 as a case study to investigate the evolutionary process behind the emergence of a highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variant. Through fine-scale evolutionary analyses applied to four independently subsampled datasets, we identify over 100 genomes representing evolutionary intermediates occupying the branch in the phylogenetic tree leading to the BA.2.86*/JN.1* clade. Additionally, we detected more than 2,600 hybrid genomes across the evolutionary history of the Omicron-descending BA.2* sub-lineages, displaying a sequential acquisition of BA.2.86 lineage-defining mutation constellations through time. We observe that hybrid strains circulated up to 19 months prior to BA.2.86, denoting cryptic circulation in various countries, with further evidence of early transmission chains. We also found signals of recombination between pre-existing parental lineages, suggesting that this process contributed to the emergence of BA.2.86. Our results suggest that the BA.2.86 lineage emerged sequentially through a complex evolutionary process, rather than via accelerated evolution associated with a single emergence event.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

So far, a well-known mammalian mutation PB2-E627K has not been maintained in AIV in poultry, which limits the spread of AIVs from avian to humans. Here, we discovered a variant, PB2-627V, which combines the properties of avian-like PB2-627E and human-like PB2-627K, overcoming host restrictions and posing a risk for human pandemics. Specifically, by screening the global PB2 sequences, we discovered a new independent cluster with PB2-627V emerged in the 2010s, which is prevalent in various avian, mammalian, and human isolates of AIVs, including H9N2, H7N9, H3N8, 2.3.4.4b H5N1, and other subtypes. And, the increasing prevalence of PB2-627V in poultry is accompanied by a rise in human infection cases with this variant. Then we systematically assessed its host adaptation, fitness, and transmissibility across three subtypes of AIVs (H9N2, H7N9, and H3N8) in different host models, including avian and human cells, chickens, mice, and ferrets where infections naturally occur. We found that PB2-627V facilitates AIVs to efficiently infect and replicate in chickens and mice by utilizing both avian- and human-origin ANP32A proteins. Importantly, and like PB2-627K, PB2-627V promotes efficient transmission between ferrets through respiratory droplets. Deep sequencing in passaged chicken samples and transmitted ferret samples indicates that PB2-627V remains stable across the two distinct hosts and has a high potential for long-term prevalence in avian species. Therefore, the mutation has the ability to continue spreading among poultry and can also overcome the barrier between birds and humans, greatly enhancing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, it is crucial to closely monitor influenza viruses carrying PB2-627V to prevent a pandemic.

Author summaryAvian influenza viruses (AIVs) play a critical role in the evolution of pandemic influenza viruses. Adaptive changes in AIVs enable them to infect mammalian species by altering viral interactions with host-specific factors, and one well-known example is the PB2-E627K mutation. Fortunately, this mutation is sporadic and rare in AIVs, usually occurring after infecting humans, and AIVs with PB2-627E, which is prevalent in poultry, cannot easily infect humans. However, if an AIV manages to overcome this species barrier, the risk of a pandemic originating from an AIV will significantly increase. In our study, we identified a dual adaptive variant called PB2-627V that combines avian-like properties of PB2-627E and human-like properties of PB2-627K. This variant not only maintains viral fitness in chickens but also facilitates aerosol transmission of AIVs between ferrets. Mechanistically, PB2-627V utilizes both avian and human host protein ANP32A to support viral polymerase function. The mutation exhibited good fitness in both birds and humans, thereby greatly increasing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. The PB2-627V polymorphism has been found in birds, humans, and mammals worldwide across more than ten AIV subtypes. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, we recommend considering PB2-627V as a new molecular marker to assess the pandemic potential of AIVs.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

There are no vaccines available and no effective treatments for these patients. Another challenge is that Cryptosporidia are waterborne and resistant to common water treatments including chlorination. Cryptosporidia are transmitted as an oocyst that is made up of a hardy oocyst wall that protects four parasites. Little is understood about how the oocyst is constructed, its composition, and the how it resists chlorination. A family of predicted Cryptosporidium Oocyst Wall Proteins (COWPs) was identified from the genome. Using a genetic approach, we confirm that all members of the COWP family localise to the oocyst wall. Our studies indicate that COWP2, 3 and 4 localise specifically to the oocyst suture, a zipper-like structure on the oocyst wall from which parasites emerge during infection. In parasites lacking COWP8, we observe that the inner and outer layers of the oocyst wall are no longer associated suggesting a role for COWP8 in oocyst wall morphology. Despite loss of COWP8, these transgenic parasites are viable, unchanged in mechanical strength, and retain resistance to chlorination. This work sets the foundation for future exploration of Cryptosporidium transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

Here we demonstrate that random migration, and not only chemotaxis, drives macrophage tumor infiltration. We identified tumor-associated monocytes (TAMos) that display a dramatically enhanced migration capability, induced rapidly by the tumor microenvironment, that drives effective tumor infiltration, in contrast to low-motility differentiated macrophages. TAMo, not TAM{Phi}, promotes cancer cell proliferation through activation of the MAPK pathway. IL-6 secreted both by cancer cells and TAMo themselves enhances TAMo migration by increasing dendritic protrusion dynamics and myosin-based contractility via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Independent from CCL2 mediated chemotaxis, IL-6 driven enhanced migration and pro-proliferative effect of TAMo were validated in a syngeneic TNBC mouse model. Depletion of IL-6 in cancer cells significantly attenuated monocyte infiltration and reversed TAMo-induced cancer cell proliferation. This work reveals the critical role random migration plays in monocyte driven TAM{Phi} enrichment in a tumor and pinpoints IL-6 as a potential therapeutic target in combination with CCL2 to ameliorate current strategies against TAM{Phi} infiltration.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

Deep learning methods facilitate integration of heterogeneous datasets. However, almost all published deep learning-based bulk multi-omics integration methods have constrained usability. They suffer from lack of transparency, modularity, deployability, and are applicable exclusively to narrow tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce Flexynesis, a versatile tool designed with usability, and adaptability in mind. Flexynesis streamlines data processing, enforces structured data splitting, and ensures rigorous model evaluation. It offers unsupervised feature selection, different omics layer fusion options, and hyperparameter tuning. Users can choose from distinct architectures - fully connected networks, variational autoencoders, multi-triplet networks, graph neural networks, and cross-modality encoding networks. Each model is complemented with a straightforward input interface and standardized training, evaluation, and feature importance quantification methods, enabling easy incorporation into data integration pipelines. For improved user experience, Flexynesis supports features such as on-the-fly task determination and compatibility with regression, classification, and survival modeling. It accommodates multi-task prediction of a mixture of numerical/categorical outcome variables with a tolerance for missing labels. We also developed an extensive benchmarking pipeline, showcasing the tools capability across diverse real-life datasets. This toolset should make deep-learning based bulk multi-omics data integration in the context of clinical/pre-clinical data analysis and marker discovery more accessible to a wider audience with or without experience in deep-learning development. Flexynesis is available at https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/flexynesis and can be installed from https://pypi.org/project/flexynesis/.

As Tregs are pivotal to control inflammation, Treg stimulation by low-dose IL-2 (IL-2LD) could have a therapeutic impact on bipolar depression. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (2 active: 1 placebo) proof-of-concept trial of add-on IL-2LD in patients with bipolar depression. Patients received a placebo or IL-2LD (1MIU) once a day for 5 days, and then once a week for 4 weeks starting on week 2. The primary objective was to demonstrate a biological Treg response to IL-2LD assessed by fold increase in Treg percentage of CD4+ cells from baseline to day 5. Secondary objectives included safety assessment and mood improvement throughout the study period. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04133233. Fourteen patients with bipolar depression were included, with 4 receiving placebo and 10 IL-2LD. Baseline clinical and biological characteristics were balanced between groups. The primary evaluation criterion was met, with IL-2LD expanding 1.17 [95% CI 1.01- 1.34] vs 1.01 [95% CI 0.90 - 1.12] (p=0.0421) and activating Tregs. Secondary evaluation criteria were also met with significant improvements of depressive symptoms and global functioning from day-15 onwards in the IL-2LD treated patients. The treatment was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events related to treatment. This proof-of-concept trial shows that stimulating Tregs in patients with bipolar depression is safe and associated with clinical improvements. This supports a pathophysiological role of inflammation in BD and warrants pursuing the evaluation of IL-2LD as an adjunct treatment of major mood disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1721599668765

Patients with loss-of-function mutations in the ARPC5 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex develop inflammation and immunodeficiency after birth, leading to early mortality. However, the mechanistic basis for these phenotypes remains obscure. Here we demonstrate that loss of Arpc5 in the murine hematopoietic system, but not the corresponding Arpc5l isoform causes early-onset intestinal inflammation. This condition is initiated by microbiota breaching the ileal mucosa, leading to local and systemic inflammation. Macrophage and neutrophils infiltrate into the ileum, but in the absence of Arpc5 fail to restrict microbial invasion. Loss of Arpc5 compromises the ability of macrophages to phagocytose and kill intra-cellular bacteria. Our results underscore the indispensable role of Arpc5, but not Arpc5l containing Arp2/3 complexes in mononuclear phagocytes function and host-microbiota homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

In these molecular assemblies, termed ""coupled transcription-translation complexes"" or ""TTC-B"", RNA polymerase (RNAP) interacts directly with the ribosome, the transcription elongation factor NusG or its paralog RfaH forms a bridge between RNAP and ribosome, and the transcription elongation factor NusA optionally forms a second bridge between RNAP and ribosome. Here, we have determined structures of coupled transcription-translation complexes having mRNA spacers between RNAP and ribosome longer than the maximum-length mRNA spacer compatible with formation of TTC-B. The results define a new class of coupled transcription-translation complex, termed ""TTC-LC,"" where ""LC"" denotes ""long-range coupling."" TTC-LC differs from TTC-B by a ~60o rotation and ~70 Angstrom translation of RNAP relative to ribosome, resulting in loss of direct interactions between RNAP and ribosome and creation of a ~70 Angstrom gap between RNAP and ribosome. TTC-LC accommodates long mRNA spacers by looping out mRNA from the gap between RNAP and ribosome. We propose that TTC-LC is an intermediate in assembling and disassembling TTC-B, mediating pre-TTC-B transcription-translation coupling before a ribosome catches up to RNAP, and mediating post-TTC-B transcription-translation coupling after a ribosome stops moving and RNAP continues moving.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1721599668765

While PacBio HiFi sequencing data enhances the accessibility of the genome's TR regions for genotyping, simple de novo calling strategies often generate an excess of likely false positives, which can obscure true positive findings, particularly as the number of surveyed genomic regions increases. Results We developed TRGT-denovo, a computational method designed to accurately identify all types of de novo TR mutations-including expansions, contractions, and compositional changes-within family trios. TRGT-denovo directly interrogates read evidence, allowing for the detection of subtle variations often overlooked in variant call format (VCF) files. TRGT-denovo improves the precision and specificity of de novo mutation (DNM) identification, reducing the number of de novo candidates by an order of magnitude compared to genotype-based approaches. In our experiments involving eight rare disease trios previously studied, TRGT-denovo correctly reclassified all false positive DNM candidates as true negatives. Using an expanded repeat catalog, it identified new candidates, of which 95% (19/20) were experimentally validated, demonstrating its effectiveness in minimizing likely false positives while maintaining high sensitivity for true discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

Pakistan with its sociocultural and ethnic diversity, has the fifth largest population in the world. There was no prior high-quality nationally representative data on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and their socio-demographic correlates for Pakistan. To fill this gap in the planning of mental health services, the Pakistan Psychiatric Society conducted the National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (NPMS) of Pakistan, in the years 2019-2022.

AimTo estimate the prevalence and socio-demographic correlates of psychiatric morbidity in a representative sample of Pakistan.

MethodsThe cross-sectional NPMS collected data from the four provinces of Pakistan. After selection through a three-stage, stratified, random cluster sampling technique we interviewed 17,773 adults above the age of 18. We used the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI Version 7.0.2) to evaluate psychiatric morbidity. Current and lifetime precise and weighted prevalence is reported according to ICD-10 (International Classification of Disease-10th version). We used multivariate logistic regression to investigate the association between the risk of psychiatric illness and sociodemographic variables. National Bio-ethic Committee of Pakistan granted approval of survey.

ResultsThe lifetime and current weighted prevalence of all psychiatric disorder is 37.91% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) =37.22-38.59) and 32.28% (95% CI=31.62-32.94) respectively. The weighted prevalence of common psychiatric disorders in Pakistan included Mood Disorders (F30-F39; 19.62%), Neurotic and Stress-related Disorders (F40 F48; 24.81%), Psychotic Disorders (F20-F29; 4.52%) and Mental and Behavioural Problems due to Psychoactive Substance use (F10-F19; 0.85%). The psychiatric disorders had an association with age, female gender, urban living, lower income and being divorced. Among participants, 6.17% acknowledged suicidality in the past month, while 1.05% acknowledged a lifetime suicide attempt.

ConclusionThe NPMS is the first nationally representative study of psychiatric morbidities in Pakistan. The data from this survey can be utilized for designing and implementing mental health services and support programmes in the country.","NA","medrxiv",1721599668765

Objectives: In a post hoc 10-year follow-up analysis of the MI-GENES trial, we investigated whether disclosure of a PRS for CHD was associated with a reduction in adverse cardiovascular events. Methods: Participants were followed from randomization beginning in October 2013 until September 2023 to ascertain adverse cardiovascular events, testing for CHD, and changes in risk factors, by blinded review of electronic health records. The primary outcome was the time from randomization to the occurrence of the first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and non-fatal stroke. Statistical analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazards regression and linear mixed-effects models. Results: We followed all 203 participants who completed the MI-GENES trial, 100 in FRSg and 103 in IRSg (mean age at the end of follow-up: 68.2+-5.2, 48% male). During a median follow-up of 9.5 years, 9 MACEs occurred in FRSg and 2 in IRSg (hazard ratio (HR), 0.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.04 to 0.94; P=0.042). In FRSg, 47 (47%) underwent at least one test for CHD, compared to 30 (29%) in IRSg (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.81; P=0.004). IRSg participants had a longer duration of statin therapy during the first four years post-randomization and a greater reduction in LDL-C for up to 3 years post-randomization. No significant differences between the two groups were observed for hemoglobin A1C, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, weight, and smoking cessation rate during follow-up. Conclusions: The disclosure of an IRS that included a PRS to individuals at intermediate risk for CHD was associated with a lower incidence of MACE after a decade of follow-up, likely due to a higher rate of initiation and longer duration of statin therapy, leading to lower LDL-C levels.","NA","medrxiv",1721599668765

However, the development of AI models needs substantial labeled data, and these models are typically task-specific with limited generalizability to various applications. Here, we develop Genomics-FM, a genomic vocabulary driven foundation model that enables versatile and label-efficient functional genomic analysis. Specifically, Genomics-FM is first pretrained with ensemble genomic vocabulary on vast unlabelled data to learn comprehensive and generalizable representations and then finetuned with specific genomic vocabulary on limited labeled data to selectively activate and adapt the pretraining knowledge for specific tasks. We show that Genomics-FM significantly reduces the dependence on labeled data, and demonstrates the capability to outperform existing models across a comprehensive suite of tasks including genome annotation, epigenomic and expression profile prediction, and variant effect assessment. Remarkably, Genomics-FM even shows impressive zero-shot predictive capabilities across diverse species and tissues and exhibits noticeable adaptability to RNA-related tasks.

The neural mechanisms underlying the selective sampling of decision-relevant information remain unknown. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and neural decoding to track the spontaneous dynamics of the locus and strength of covert attention as human participants performed a three-alternative perceptual choice task. The strength of covert attention fluctuated rhythmically at 11 Hz. At the peak of this oscillation, attention re-focused on the location of the previously sampled alternative, promoting the in-depth evaluation of a single alternative. By contrast, at the trough, attention was oriented to a different alternative, that way facilitating the comparison between alternatives. Further, switching attention to a different alternative intrinsically reset the attentional oscillation. We propose that rhythmic attentional sampling is a universal cognitive mechanism underpinning the flexible information processing necessary for key decision computations.

Highlights- Humans navigate complex decisions by dynamically shifting their attention to sequentially sample different aspects of the decision problem.
- Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we tracked the locus and strength of covert attention in humans performing a multialternative choice task.

We estimate a recent divergence from the closest tick-borne ancestor, likely within the last ~8,000 years. We reconstruct a chronology of gene losses and acquisitions using the pan-genome of related species, and show that almost all of the reductive evolution observed in B. recurrentis had occurred by ~2,000 years ago, and was thus a rapid process after divergence.

While the aetiology of Parkinsons disease remains elusive, the degeneration of the dopamine - producing nigrostriatal neurons, along with the accumulation of alpha-synuclein, are pathophysiological hallmarks. The impairment of motor functions, a consequence of the involvement of the thalamic-frontal loop, dominates the overt clinical picture. However, more recent findings clarified that the symptoms are more widespread, and cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunctions are also common. Accordingly, neuroimaging studies show that, even in early disease, structural and functional alterations are not confined to the motor areas. This suggests that the effects of the nigro-striatal neurodegeneration are not restricted to the motor areas alone but, rather, they modify the behavior of the brain on a large scale. Understanding how the local degeneration of dopaminergic neurons affects the whole brain dynamics remains an open question.

The purpose of this study is to understand how the ability of the nigrostriatal pathways to support a dopaminergic stimulation affects the brain as a whole. To this end, we leverage simultaneous recordings from EEG and deep electrodes placed near the subthalamic nuclei (STN) from 10 Parkinsonian patients, acquired both before and after administration of L-Dopa. We used the topography of the spreading of aperiodic waves over a large scale (i.e. neuronal avalanches), utilizing the recently described avalanche transition matrix (ATM), to characterize the brain dynamics. To simulate the effect of L-Dopa in silico, we deployed a mechanistic neural-mass model derived from the adaptive quadratic integrate-and-fire model (aQIF) of individual neurons that has been extended to include dopamine concentration as a variable. Each parcelled brain region is equipped with a neural mass and then coupled according to the empirical connectomes, where connections can be either excitatory, inhibitory, or dopaminergic. Then, the whole-brain dynamics have been simulated for different configurations, i.e., for different dopaminergic tones. This way, we obtained a numerical prediction of the expected dynamics (in terms of properties of the ATMs), as observed in the deep electrodes and the EEG, given different dopaminergic tones. Then, in a Bayesian set-up, we used a class of deep neural networks to ""invert"" the model and infer the most likely dopaminergic tone given the empirically observed dynamics. For all ten patients, we correctly inferred that the dopaminergic tone was higher given the dynamics observed after administration of L-Dopa, and lower before. In other words, we could distinguish and quantify the dopaminergic tone from the electrophysiological data if the subjects had orally taken L-Dopa. This was achieved by integrating the background (anatomical and dynamical) knowledge into model prediction about the physiology of dopamine (as opposed to training a classifier to distinguish empirical data). Finally, we carried out a diagnostic for the validation of the model, as well as a further description of the simulated dopamine dynamics.","NA","medrxiv",1721599668765

Brain aging is complex and accompanied by many cellular changes. However, the influence that aged cells have on neighboring cells and how this contributes to tissue decline is unknown. More generally, the tools to systematically address this question in aging tissues have not yet been developed. Here, we generate spatiotemporal data at single-cell resolution for the mouse brain across lifespan, and we develop the first machine learning models based on spatial transcriptomics ('spatial aging clocks') to reveal cell proximity effects during brain aging and rejuvenation. We collect a single-cell spatial transcriptomics brain atlas of 4.2 million cells from 20 distinct ages and across two rejuvenating interventions--exercise and partial reprogramming. We identify spatial and cell type-specific transcriptomic fingerprints of aging, rejuvenation, and disease, including for rare cell types. Using spatial aging clocks and deep learning models, we find that T cells, which infiltrate the brain with age, have a striking pro-aging proximity effect on neighboring cells. Surprisingly, neural stem cells have a strong pro-rejuvenating effect on neighboring cells. By developing computational tools to identify mediators of these proximity effects, we find that pro-aging T cells trigger a local inflammatory response likely via interferon-gamma; whereas pro-rejuvenating neural stem cells impact the metabolism of neighboring cells possibly via growth factors (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor) and extracellular vesicles, and we experimentally validate some of these predictions. These results suggest that rare cells can have a drastic influence on their neighbors and could be targeted to counter tissue aging. We anticipate that these spatial aging clocks will not only allow scalable assessment of the efficacy of interventions for aging and disease but also represent a new tool for studying cell-cell interactions in many spatial contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

Untargeted AAV vectors require high doses to achieve therapeutic efficacy, which is associated with toxic off-target impacts and increased therapeutic costs. The ability to reprogram existing AAV vectors to selectively transduce target tissues is essential to develop next-generation human gene therapies that are safer, more efficacious, and less expensive. Using selective and high-affinity antibodies and antibody-like proteins to retarget existing AAV vectors to bind novel cell-surface receptors offers an attractive and modular approach to reprogram their tropism. However, attaching these proteins onto the complex and delicate AAV capsids remains challenging. Here, we report a versatile chemical strategy to covalently attach recombinant proteins onto the capsid of AAV, using a combination of genetic code expansion and bioorthogonal conjugation chemistry. This method is efficient, and allows precise control over the site and stoichiometry of protein attachment onto the AAV capsid, enabling systematic optimization of the resulting conjugate. Using this approach, we generated conjugates of AAV2 with an anti-HER2 nanobody and a full-length anti-HER2 IgG, which show highly efficient and selective gene delivery into HER2+ cancer cells. Remarkably, the optimized AAV2-nanobody conjugate facilitated efficient transduction of HER2+ tumor xenograft in mice with little off-target gene expression, including in the liver. Programmable synthesis of AAV-protein conjugates using this method offers a promising new strategy to rationally engineer next-generation gene therapy vectors.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

This reduces the risk of spreading pathogens while enabling effective population control. Robust sex sorting methods to enable early larval sorting in mosquitoes need to be developed to allow for scalable sex sorting for genetic biocontrol interventions. This study applies the SEPARATOR (Sexing Element Produced by Alternative RNA-splicing of A Transgenic Observable Reporter) system, previously developed for Aedes aegypti, to the Asian malaria vector Anopheles stephensi. We hypothesized that the intron from the doublesex gene in Anopheles gambiae would function in An. stephensi due to evolutionary conservation. Our results confirm that the splicing module from An. gambiae operates effectively in An. stephensi, demonstrating evolutionary conservation in sex-specific splicing events between these species. This system enables reliable positive male selection from first instar larval to pupal stages. RT-PCR analysis demonstrates that male-specific EGFP expression is dependent on doublesex sex-specific splicing events. The SEPARATOR system's independence from sex-chromosome linkage confers resistance to meiotic recombination and chromosomal rearrangements. This approach may facilitate the mass release of males, and the cross-species portability of SEPARATOR establishes it as a valuable tool for genetic biocontrol interventions across various pest species.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

Our study analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from mature and developing vertebrate lungs, revealing substantial similarities in cell composition, developmental trajectories and gene expression pattern across species. Notably, most lung-related genes are also present in cartilaginous fishes, indicating that gene presence alone does not guarantee lung development. We identified thousands of lung regulatory elements specific to bony fishes, with higher concentrations around genes such as tbx4 and the hoxb gene cluster. These regulatory changes might contribute to lung emergence as well as the unique co-expression patterns in lung epithelial cells, such as those related to pulmonary surfactants and cell morphology. Our research also revealed that AT1 cells are specific to mammals, and we identified a mammal-specific gene, sfta2. Knockout experiments demonstrated that sfta2 deletion causes severe respiratory defects in mice, underscoring its critical role in specialized mammalian lungs. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the origin and evolution of lungs are driven by a complex interplay of regulatory network modifications and the emergence of new genes, underscoring the multifaceted nature of organ evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

BLAST established itself as the canonical tool for sequence similarity search in large part thanks to its meaningful statistical analysis. Specifically, BLAST reports the E-value of each reported alignment, which is defined as the expected number of optimal local alignments that will score at least as high as the observed alignment score, assuming that the query and the database sequences are randomly generated. Here we critically reevaluate the E-values provided by the standard protein BLAST (blastp), showing that they can be at times significantly conservative while at others too liberal. We offer an alternative approach based on generating a small sample from the null distribution of random optimal alignments, and testing whether the observed alignment score is consistent with it. In contrast with blastp, our significance analysis seems valid, in the sense that it did not deliver inflated significance estimates in any of our extensive experiments. Moreover, although our method is slightly conservative, it is often significantly less so than the blastp E-value. Indeed, in cases where blastp's analysis is valid (i.e., not too liberal), our approach seems to deliver a greater number of correct alignment. One advantage of our approach is that it works with any reasonable choice of substitution matrix and gap penalties, avoiding blastp's limited options of matrices and penalties. In addition, we can formulate the problem using a canonical family-wise error rate control setup, thereby dispensing with E-values, which can at times be difficult to interpret.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

However, the dynamics of dynein stepping have been poorly characterized by tracking flexible regions of the motor with limited resolution. Here, we developed a cysteine-light mutant of yeast dynein and site-specifically labeled its MT-binding domain in vitro. MINFLUX tracking at sub-millisecond resolution revealed that dynein hydrolyzes one ATP per step and takes multitudes of 8 nm steps at physiological ATP. Steps are preceded by the transient movement towards the plus end.

Some bacteria, including the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), encode a proteasome system that selectively degrades damaged or misfolded proteins crucial for the pathogen's survival within host macrophages. Consequently, the 20S core particle (CP), the central component of the proteasome system, has emerged as a viable target for tuberculosis treatment strategies. Both eukaryotic and Mtb proteasome systems are allosterically regulated, yet the specific conformations involved have not been captured in high-resolution structures to date. Here we present the first structure of Mtb 20S CP, and indeed any 20S CP, in an inactive state called 20SOFF, distinguished from the canonical active state, 20SON, by the conformation of switch helices I and II. The rearrangement of these helices collapses the S1 pocket, effectively inhibiting substrate binding. The switch helices are conserved and regulate the activity of HslV protease, the proteasome's ancestral enzyme in bacteria, and a diverse family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases.

Despite this general heterogeneity, several common factors have been identified. For example, nearly all patients show pathological accumulations of phosphorylated TDP-43 protein in affected regions of the motor cortex and spinal cord. Moreover, large patient cohort studies have revealed that most patient samples can be grouped into a small number of ALS subtypes, as defined by their transcriptomic profiles. These ALS molecular subtypes can be grouped by whether postmortem motor cortex samples display signatures of: mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress (ALS-Ox), microglial activation and neuroinflammation (ALS-Glia), or dense TDP-43 pathology and associated transposable element de- silencing (ALS-TE). In this study, we have built a deep layer ALS neural network classifier (DANcer) that has learned to accurately assign patient samples to these ALS subtypes, and which can be run on either bulk or single-cell datasets. Upon applying this classifier to an expanded ALS patient cohort from the NYGC ALS Consortium, we show that ALS Molecular Subtypes are robust across clinical centers, with no new subtypes appearing in a cohort that has quadrupled in size. Signatures from two of these molecular subtypes strongly correlate with disease duration: ALS-TE signatures in cortex and ALS-Glia signatures in spinal cord, revealing molecular correlates of clinical features. Finally, we use single nucleus RNA sequencing to reveal the cell type- specific contributions to ALS subtype, as determined by our single-cell classifier (scDANCer). Single-cell transcriptomes reveal that ALS molecular subtypes are recapitulated in neurons and glia, with both ALS-wide shared alterations in each cell type as well as ALS subtype-specific alterations. In summary, ALS molecular subtypes: (1) are robust across large cohorts of sporadic and familial ALS patient samples, (2) represent a combination of cellular, genetic, and pathological features, and (3) correlate with clinical features of ALS.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

However, the sparsity (very few reads per transcript) or bias in protocols (favoring 3' ends of the transcripts) makes the chance of capturing somatic variants very unlikely. This can be overcome by targeted sequencing or the use of mitochondrial variants as natural barcodes for clone identification. Currently, available computational tools focus on genotyping, but do not provide functionality for combined analysis of somatic and mitochondrial variants and functional analysis such as characterization of gene expression changes in detected clones. Results: Here, we propose SIGURD, which is an R-based pipeline for the clonal analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. This allows the quantification of clones by leveraging both somatic and mitochondrial variants. SIGURD also allows for functional analysis after clonal detection: association of clones with cell populations, detection of differentially expressed genes across clones and association of somatic and mitochondrial variants. Here, we demonstrate the power of SIGURD by analyzing single-cell data of colony-forming cells derived from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

Most mammals are susceptible to progressive age-related hearing loss; however, the evolution of biosonar, which requires the ability to hear low-intensity echoes from outgoing sonar signals, may have selected against the development of hearing deficits in echolocating bats. Although many echolocating bats exhibit exceptional longevity and rely on acoustic behaviors for survival to old age, relatively little is known about the aging bat auditory system. In this study, we used DNA methylation to estimate the ages of wild-caught big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and measured hearing sensitivity in young and aging bats using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). We found no evidence for hearing deficits in aging bats, demonstrated by comparable thresholds and similar ABR wave and DPOAE amplitudes across age groups. We additionally found no significant histological evidence for cochlear aging, with similar hair cell counts, afferent, and efferent innervation patterns in young and aging bats. Here we demonstrate that big brown bats show minimal evidence for age-related loss of peripheral hearing sensitivity and therefore represent informative models for investigating mechanisms that may preserve hearing function over a long lifetime.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

However, previous studies on the physiology of soil ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOM), which play a critical role in the nitrogen cycle, were primarily conducted using freely suspended AOM cells (planktonic cells) in liquid media. In this study, we examined the growth of two representative soil ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), Nitrososphaera viennensis EN76 and ""Nitrosotenuis chungbukensis"" MY2, and an ammonia-oxidizing bacterium, Nitrosomonas europaea ATCC 19718 on polycarbonate membrane filters floated on liquid media to observe their adaptation to air-exposed solid surfaces. Interestingly, ammonia oxidation activities of N. viennensis EN76 and ""N. chungbukensis"" MY2 were significantly repressed on floating filters compared to the freely suspended cells in liquid media. Conversely, the ammonia oxidation activity of N. europaea ATCC 19718 was comparable on floating filters and liquid media. N. viennensis EN76 and N. europaea ATCC 19718 developed microcolonies on floating filters. Transcriptome analysis of N. viennensis EN76 floating filter-grown cells revealed upregulation of unique sets of genes for cell wall and extracellular polymeric substance biosynthesis, H2O2-induced oxidative stress defense, and ammonia oxidation, including ammonia monooxygenase subunit C (amoC3) and the multicopper oxidases. These genes may play a pivotal role in adapting AOA to air-exposed solid surfaces. Furthermore, the floating filter technique resulted in the enrichment of distinct soil AOA communities dominated by the ""Ca. Nitrosocosmicus"" clade. Overall, this study sheds light on distinct adaptive mechanisms governing AOA growth on air-exposed solid surfaces.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

Cation channelrhodopsins (CCRs), first recognized as the photoreceptors in the chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, have since been identified in diverse species of green algae, as well in other unicellular eukaryotes. The CCRs from non-chlorophyte species are commonly referred to as bacteriorhodopsin-like channelrhodopsins, or BCCRs, as most of them feature the three characteristic amino acid residues of the ""DTD motif"" in the third transmembrane helix (TM3 or helix C) matching the canonical DTD motif of the well-studied archaeal light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin. Here, we report characterization of HulaCCR1, a novel BCCR identified through metatranscriptomic analysis of a unicellular eukaryotic community in Lake Hula, Israel. Interestingly, HulaCCR1 has an ETD motif in which the first residue of the canonical motif is substituted for glutamate. Electrophysiological measurements of the wild-type and a mutant with a DTD motif of HulaCCR1 suggest the critical role of the first glutamate in spectral tuning and channel gating. Additionally, HulaCCR1 exhibits long extensions at the N- and C-termini. Photocurrents recorded from a truncated variant without the signal peptide predicted at the N-terminus were diminished, and membrane localization of the truncated variant significantly decreased, indicating that the signal peptide is important for membrane trafficking of HulaCCR1. These characteristics of HulaCCR1 would be related to a new biological significance in the original unidentified species, distinct from those known for other BCCRs.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1721599668765

This paper aimed to assess a multitude of cardiac signs, symptoms, and conditions, as well as focused on patients with and without congenital heart defects (CHDs), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the post-acute cardiovascular outcomes among children and adolescents after COVID-19.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 19 US childrens hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and September 2023. Every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry. Absolute risks of incident post-acute COVID-19 sequelae were reported. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by contrasting COVID-19-positive with COVID-19-negative groups using a Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through propensity scoring stratification.

ResultsA total of 1,213,322 individuals under 21 years old (mean[SD] age, 7.75[6.11] years; 623,806 male [51.4%]) were included. The absolute rate of any post-acute cardiovascular outcome in this study was 2.32% in COVID-19 positive and 1.38% in negative groups. Patients with CHD post-SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks of any cardiovascular outcome (RR, 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-1.80), including increased risks of 11 of 18 post-acute sequelae in hypertension, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias), myocarditis, other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest), thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain and palpitations). Those without CHDs also experienced heightened cardiovascular risks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57-1.69), covering 14 of 18 conditions in hypertension, arrhythmias (ventricular arrhythmias and premature atrial or ventricular contractions), inflammatory heart disease (pericarditis and myocarditis), other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock), thrombotic disorders (pulmonary embolism and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and syncope).

ConclusionsBoth children with and without CHDs showed increased risks for a variety of cardiovascular outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the need for targeted monitoring and management in the post-acute phase.

Clinical Perspective sectionO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIWe investigated the risks of 18 post-acute COVID-19 cardiovascular outcomes in the pediatric population without Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in over 1 million patients, stratified by congenital heart defects (CHD) status.
C_LIO_LIWe extended the follow-up period beyond previous pediatric studies, ensuring every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry.
C_LIO_LIWe included a comprehensive cross-section of the US pediatric population across various healthcare settings including primary, specialty, and emergency care, as well as testing and inpatient facilities.
C_LI

What are the clinical implications?O_LIWithin the post-acute phase, children and adolescents previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at statistically significant increased risk of incident cardiovascular outcomes, including hypertension, ventricular arrhythmias, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, thromboembolism, chest pain, and palpitations. These findings are consistent among patients with and without CHDs.
C_LIO_LIAwareness of the heightened risk of cardiovascular disorders after COVID-19 can lead to a timely referral, investigations, and management of these conditions in children and adolescents.

Most human pre-implantation are mosaics of euploid and aneuploid cells, however, mosaic embryos with a low proportion of aneuploid cells have a similar likelihood of developing to term as fully euploid embryos. How embryos manage aneuploidy during development is poorly understood. This knowledge is crucial for improving fertility treatments and reducing developmental defects. To explore these mechanisms, we established a new mouse model of chromosome mosaicism to study the fate of aneuploid cells during pre-implantation development. We previously used the Mps1 inhibitor reversine to generate aneuploidy in embryos. Here, we found that treatment with the more specific Mps1 inhibitor AZ3146 induced chromosome segregation defects in pre-implantation embryos, similar to reversine. However, AZ3146-treated embryos showed a higher developmental potential than reversine-treated embryos. Unlike reversine-treated embryos, AZ3146-treated embryos exhibited transient upregulation of Hypoxia Inducible-Factor-1A (HIF1A) and lacked p53 upregulation. Pre-implantation embryos develop in a hypoxic environment in vivo, and hypoxia exposure in vitro reduced DNA damage in response to Mps1 inhibition and increased the proportion of euploid cells in the mosaic epiblast. Inhibiting HIF1A in mosaic embryos also decreased the proportion of aneuploid cells in mosaic embryos. Our work illuminates potential strategies to improve the developmental potential of mosaic embryos.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

These gradients have been well characterised throughout the biofilm mass but the microenvironment of recently discovered nutrient transporting channels in Escherichia coli biofilms remains unexplored. This study employs three different oxygen sensing approaches to provide a robust quantitative overview of the oxygen gradients and microenvironments throughout the biofilm transport channel networks formed by E. coli macrocolony biofilms. Oxygen nanosensing combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy established that the oxygen concentration changes along the length of biofilm transport channels. Electrochemical sensing provided precise quantification of the oxygen profile in the transport channels, showing similar anoxic profiles compared with the adjacent cells. Anoxic biosensing corroborated these approaches, providing an overview of the oxygen utilisation throughout the biomass. The discovery that transport channels maintain oxygen gradients contradicts the previous literature that channels are completely open to the environment along the apical surface of the biofilm. We provide a potential mechanism for the sustenance of channel microenvironments via orthogonal visualisations of biofilm thin sections showing thin layers of actively growing cells. This complete overview of the oxygen environment in biofilm transport channels primes future studies aiming to exploit these emergent structures for new bioremediation approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

As the rRNAs and most of the mRNAs in mtDNA are flanked by tRNAs, the release of the mature RNAs occurs mostly by excision of the tRNAs. Processing the non-canonical mRNAs, not flanked by tRNAs, requires FASTKD5, but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. To investigate this, we created and characterized a knockout cell line to use as an assay system. The absence of FASTKD5 resulted in a severe combined OXPHOS assembly defect due to the inability to translate mRNAs with unprocessed 5'-UTRs. Analysis of RNA processing of FASTKD5 variants allowed us to map amino acid residues essential for function. Remarkably, this map was RNA substrate-specific, arguing against a one size fits all model. A reconstituted in vitro system with purified FASTKD5 protein and synthetic RNA substrates showed that FASTKD5 on its own was able to cleave client substrates correctly, but not non-specific RNA sequences.

We posit that nanoparticle-based approaches hold promise to overcome challenges associated with systemic administration of antioxidants.

MethodsWe employed a peptide-based nanoplatform to overexpress a key modulator of oxidative stress, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). The efficacy of systemic delivery of SOD2 mRNA as a nanotherapeutic agent was studied in two different murine AAA models. Unbiased mass spectrometry-enabled proteomics and high-dimensional bioinformatics were used to examine pathways modulated by SOD2 overexpression.

ResultsThe murine SOD2 mRNA sequence was mixed with p5RHH, an amphipathic peptide capable of delivering nucleic acids in vivo to form self-assembled nanoparticles of [~]55 nm in diameter. We further demonstrated that the nanoparticle was stable and functional up to four weeks following self-assembly when coated with hyaluronic acid. Delivery of SOD2 mRNA mitigated the expansion of small AAA and largely prevented rupture. Mitigation of AAA was accompanied by enhanced SOD2 protein expression in aortic wall tissue. Concomitant suppression of nitric oxide, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and cell death was observed. Proteomic profiling of AAA tissues suggests that SOD2 overexpression augments levels of microRNAs that regulate vascular inflammation and cell apoptosis, inhibits platelet activation/aggregation, and downregulates mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Gene set enrichment analysis shows that SOD2 mRNA delivery is associated with activation of oxidative phosphorylation, lipid metabolism, respiratory electron transportation, and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways.

ConclusionsThese results confirm that SOD2 is key modulator of oxidative stress in AAA. This nanotherapeutic mRNA delivery approach may find translational application in the medical management of small AAA and the prevention of AAA rupture.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

These protofibrils and fibrils can intertwine to form mature amyloid fibres. Similar phenomena occur in blood from individuals with circulating inflammatory molecules (also those originating from viruses and bacteria). In the presence of inflammagens, pathological clotting can occur, that results in an anomalous amyloid form termed fibrinaloid microclots. Previous proteomic analyses of these microclots have shown the presence of non-fibrin(ogen) proteins, suggesting a more complex mechanism than simple entrapment. We provide evidence against a simple entrapment model, noting that clot pores are too large and centrifugation would have removed weakly bound proteins. Instead, we explore whether co-aggregation into amyloid fibres may involve axial (multiple proteins within the same fibril), lateral (single-protein fibrils contributing to a fibre), or both types of integration. Our analysis of proteomic data from fibrinaloid microclots in different diseases shows no significant overlap with the normal plasma proteome and no correlation between plasma protein abundance and presence in microclots. Notably, abundant plasma proteins like -2-macroglobulin, fibronectin, and transthyretin are absent from microclots, while less abundant proteins such as adiponectin, periostin, and von Willebrand Factor are well represented. Using bioinformatic tools including AmyloGram and AnuPP, we found that proteins entrapped in fibrinaloid microclots exhibit high amyloidogenic tendencies, suggesting their integration as cross-{beta} elements into amyloid structures. This integration likely contributes to the microclots resistance to proteolysis. Our findings underscore the role of cross-seeding in fibrinaloid microclot formation and highlight the need for further investigation into their structural properties and implications in thrombotic and amyloid diseases. These insights provide a foundation for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting amyloidogenic cross-seeding in blood clotting disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

Homologous with ATP synthases, these multi-subunit enzymes consist of a soluble catalytic V1 subcomplex and a membrane-embedded proton-translocating VO subcomplex. The V1 and VO subcomplexes can undergo reversible dissociation to regulate proton pumping, with reassociation of V1 and VO requiring the protein complex known as RAVE (regulator of the ATPase of vacuoles and endosomes). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RAVE consists of subunits Rav1p, Rav2p, and Skp1p. We used electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine a structure of yeast RAVE bound to V1. In the structure, RAVE is a L-shaped complex with Rav2p pointing toward the membrane and Skp1p distant from both the membrane and V1. Only Rav1p interacts with V1, binding to a region of subunit A not found in the corresponding ATP synthase subunit. When bound to RAVE, V1 is in a rotational state suitable for binding the free VO complex, but it is partially disrupted in the structure, missing five of its 16 subunits. Other than these missing subunits and the conformation of the inhibitory subunit H, the V1 complex with RAVE appears poised for reassembly with VO.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

But for any given application, it is likely that just a small subset of informative time-series features is required to capture the dynamical quantities of interest. So, while comprehensive libraries of time-series features have been developed, it is useful to construct reduced and computationally efficient subsets for specific applications. In this work, we demonstrate a systematic process to deduce such a reduced set, focused on the problem of distinguishing changes to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) time series caused by a range of experimental manipulations of excitatory and inhibitory neural activity in mouse cortical circuits. We reduce a comprehensive library of over 7000 candidate time-series features down to a subset of 16 features, which we call catchaMouse16, that aims to both: (i) accurately characterize biologically relevant properties of fMRI time series; and (ii) minimize inter-feature redundancy. The catchaMouse16 feature set accurately classifies experimental perturbations of neuronal activity from fMRI recordings, and also shows strong generalization performance on an unseen mouse and human resting-state fMRI data where it tracks spatial variations in excitatory and inhibitory cortical cell densities, often with greater statistical power than the full hctsa feature set. We provide an efficient, open-source implementation of the catchaMouse16 feature set in C (achieving an approximately 60 times speed-up relative to the native Matlab code of the same features), with wrappers for Python and Matlab. This work demonstrates a procedure to reduce a large candidate time-series feature set down to the key statistical properties of mouse fMRI dynamics that can be used to efficiently quantify and interpret informative dynamical patterns in neural time series.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

Research into rare (<0.1) genetic variants on the X chromosome has implicated over 20 genes in ASD pathogenesis, such as MECP2, DDX3X, and DMD. The ""female protective effect"" in ASD suggests that females may require a higher genetic burden to manifest similar symptoms as males, yet the mechanisms remain unclear. Despite technological advances in genomics, the complexity of the biological nature of sex chromosomes leave them underrepresented in genome-wide studies. Here, we conducted an X chromosome-wide association study (XWAS) using whole-genome sequencing data from 6,873 individuals with ASD (82% males) across Autism Speaks MSSNG, Simons Simplex Cohort SSC, and Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research SPARK, alongside 8,981 population controls (43% males). We analyzed 418,652 X-chromosome variants, identifying 59 associated with ASD (p-values 7.9x10- to 1.51x10-), surpassing Bonferroni-corrected thresholds. Key findings include significant regions on chrXp22.2 (lead SNP=rs12687599, p=3.57x10-) harboring ASB9/ASB11, and another encompassing DDX53/PTCHD1-AS long non-coding RNA (lead SNP=rs5926125, p=9.47x10-).

CAUTI pathogenesis is mediated by bladder damage-induced inflammation, resulting in accumulation and deposition of the blood-clotting protein fibrinogen (Fg) and its matrix form fibrin, which are exploited by uropathogens as biofilm platforms to establish infection. Catheter-induced inflammation also results in robust immune cell recruitment, including macrophages (M{phi}s). A fundamental knowledge gap is understanding the mechanisms by which the catheterized-bladder environment suppresses the M{phi} antimicrobial response, allowing uropathogen persistence. Here, we found that Fg and fibrin differentially modulate M1 and M2 M{phi} polarization, respectively.

However, a comprehensive model that investigates the association between a broad range of psychiatric disorders and immune-mediated disease in a multivariate framework is lacking. Objective: This study aims to establish a factor structure based on the genetic correlations of immune-mediated diseases and investigate their genetic relationships with clusters of psychiatric disorders. Design, Setting, and Participants: We utilized Genomic Structural Equation Modeling (Genomic SEM) to establish a factor structure of 11 immune-mediated diseases. Genetic correlations between these immune factors were examined with five established factors across 13 psychiatric disorders representing compulsive, schizophrenia/bipolar, neurodevelopmental, internalizing, and substance use disorders. We included GWAS summary statistics of individuals of European ancestry with sample sizes from 1,223 cases for Addison's disease to 170,756 cases for major depressive disorder. Main Outcomes and Measures: Genetic correlations between psychiatric and immune-mediated disease factors and traits to determine genetic overlap. We develop and validate a new heterogeneity metric, QFactor, that quantifies the degree to which factor correlations are driven by more specific pairwise associations. We also estimate residual genetic correlations between pairs of psychiatric disorders and immune-mediated diseases. Results: A four-factor model of immune-mediated diseases fit the data well and described a continuum from autoimmune to autoinflammatory diseases. The four factors reflected autoimmune, celiac, mixed pattern, and autoinflammatory diseases. Analyses revealed seven significant factor correlations between the immune and psychiatric factors, including autoimmune and mixed pattern diseases with the internalizing and substance use factors, and autoinflammatory diseases with the compulsive, schizophrenia/bipolar, and internalizing factors. Additionally, we find evidence of divergence in associations within factors as indicated by QFactor. This is further supported by 14 significant residual genetic correlations between individual psychiatric disorders and immune-mediated diseases. Conclusion and Relevance: Our results revealed genetic links between clusters of immune-mediated diseases and psychiatric disorders. Current analyses indicate that previously described relationships between specific psychiatric disorders and immune-mediated diseases often capture broader pathways of risk sharing indexed by our genomic factors, yet are more specific than a general association across all psychiatric disorders and immune-mediated diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1721599668765

Our study aims to assess the association between COVID-19 infections and subsequent kidney diseases, using influenza as a positive control and incorporating a negative control to establish clearer associations.

MethodsA large retrospective cohort study with strata matching was conducted using the MarketScan database with records from Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. We used the international classification of 10th revision (ICD-10) codes to identify individuals and build three cohorts, (1) COVID-19 group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of COVID-19; (2) Influenza but no COVID-19 (positive control) group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of Influenza; and (3) no COVID-19 / Influenza (negative control) group, with randomly assigned index dates between Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. The main outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To evaluate the association between COVID-19 and the new onset of kidney diseases relative to both control groups, we employed multivariable stratified Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.

ResultsThe study included 939,241 individuals with COVID-19, 1,878,482 individuals in the negative control group, and 199,071 individuals with influenza. After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and medication histories, COVID-19 was significantly associated with increased risks of AKI (adjusted hazards ratio, aHR: 2.74, 2.61-2.87), CKD (aHR: 1.38, 1.32-1.45), and ESRD (aHR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.67-3.88), while influenza was associated with a modestly increased risk of AKI (aHR: 1.24, 1.11-1.38) and had no impact on CKD (aHR: 1.03, 0.92-1.14), and ESRD (aHR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.55-1.29). Time-specific analyses indicated that while the HR for AKI declined from 0-180 days to 0-540 days, the HR for CKD and ESRD remained stable, with COVID-19s risk surpassing influenzas risk throughout follow-up. Exploratory analysis also found significant impacts of COVID-19 on glomerular diseases (aHR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50).

ConclusionIn this large real-world study, COVID-19 infections were associated with a 2.3-fold risk of developing AKI, a 1.4-fold risk of CKD, and a 4.7-fold risk of ESRD compared to influenza. Greater attention needs to be paid to kidney diseases in individuals after contracting COVID-19 to prevent future adverse health outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1721599668765

The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1721599668765
