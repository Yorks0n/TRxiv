During the tumult of war they are, however, challenging to obtain due to the conflicts themselves. The Gaza Ministry of Health (GMoH) has provided regular updates to their post-October-7 violent death tally for the Gaza Strip. However, GMoH reports have attracted both criticism and support. Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. Our findings suggest that violent mortality has significantly exceeded official figures. Our central estimate for the extent of GMoH undercount closely matches a separate estimate made using capture-recapture methods. We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden. These results underscore the feasibility of mortality surveillance methodologies in some highly challenging war-affected settings and provide a crucial empirical foundation for assessing the true human cost of the war.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

However, the seasonality of COVID-19 remains in dispute, with significant waves of cases across the United States occurring in both winter and summer. Using wavelet analysis of COVID-19 cases, we find that the periodicity of epidemic COVID-19 varies markedly across the U.S. and correlates with winter temperatures, indicating seasonal forcing. However, seasonal forcing alone cannot explain the pattern of multiple waves per year that has been so disruptive and unique to COVID-19. Using a modified SIRS model that allows specification of the tempo of waning immunity, we show that specific forms of non-durable immunity can sufficiently explain the sub-annual waves characteristic of the COVID-19 epidemic.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

South Africa is unique in the region because its HIV programme is largely domestically funded, although donor funds and partnerships support key components. We estimated the epidemiological impact of ceased PEPFAR support for specific services and the costs and cost-effectiveness of the South African government (SAG) potentially taking over these services.

MethodsWe used a costed version of Thembisa, a South African HIV transmission model, to simulate four scenarios: a minimum scenario assuming intervention coverage reducing proportional to PEPFARs funding share of specific activities in 2023; a maximum scenario assuming additional health system impacts; and sub-scenarios either with 3-year recovery (2029-2031) or no recovery to previous coverage. HIV programme costs were estimated from the provider perspective (SAG) in 2024/25 US dollars.

ResultsOver 2025-2028, discontinuing PEPFAR funding in South Africa without replacement by SAG would result in 150,000-296,000 additional new HIV infections (29-56% increase) and 56,000-65,000 additional AIDS-related deaths (33-38%). Permanent discontinuation of currently PEPFAR-supported services over the next 20 years increases this to 1.1-2.1 million additional new HIV infections and 519,000-712,000 additional AIDS deaths. To sustain services, SAG needs to spend an additional $710 million to $1.5 billion between 2025 and 2028. Under a reduced budget, the most cost-effective interventions to preserve are ART and PrEP.

ConclusionUnmanaged PEPFAR exit from South Africa threatens to undo a decade of progress towards ending AIDS as a public health threat unless services are taken over by other funders, including SAG.","10.1097/QAD.0000000000004272","medrxiv",1751321393886

This study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying interoceptive attention by examining beta-band power suppression during heartbeat and auditory discrimination tasks. Fifty-one healthy participants engaged in interoceptive (heartbeat detection) and exteroceptive (auditory discrimination) tasks while their brain activity was measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The results revealed significant beta suppression time-locked to the R-peak in the somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, mid-cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 310 to 530 ms post-R-peak. Beta suppression was more pronounced during interoceptive attention, correlating positively with interoceptive accuracy. The findings support the notion that beta suppression in fronto-cingulo- somatosensory network may serve as a neural marker of interoceptive processing, contributing to predictive coding models of interoception. This study highlights the potential for using beta suppression as an objective measure of interoceptive accuracy and suggests that neural oscillations play a critical role in the brains regulation of heartbeat-related information. Furthermore, the study proposes that interoceptive attention involves a top-down mechanism that dynamically adjusts the brains response to cardiac afferent signals, enhancing the precision of interoceptive processing. These findings have implications for understanding how the brain integrates interoceptive signals and may provide insights into clinical applications targeting interoceptive dysfunctions.","NA","biorxiv",1751321393886

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

ObjectivesTo evaluate IgG/IgA/IgM responses targeting the enteric nerve and non-myelin antigens in RRMS and investigate associations with EBV and HHV-6 markers and explore molecular mimicry between viral and host antigens.

MethodsThe study included 55 RRMS patients and 63 matched healthy controls. ELISA is used to examine IgG/IgA/IgM levels against nine non-myelin self-epitopes and viral proteins (EBNA-1, dUTPases of EBV and HHV-6). Luminex immunoassay is used to quantify cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Disability was evaluated using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS). In-silico molecular mimicry was analyzed using UniProt, AlphaFold, PyMol, Alignmentaj, and the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), comparing 41 viral and 36 ENS non-myelin antigens.

ResultsIgG/IgA/IgM levels targeting the enteric nerve and non-myelin antigens were significantly higher in RRMS than in controls. A large part of the variance in the EDSS and MSSS scores (>60%) was explained by IgG-chondroitin sulfate, IgM-Asialo-ganglioside, and IgG-enteric nerve. There were highly significant correlations between autoimmunity to those self-antigens and either immune profiles indicating immune activation or Ig-responses to EBNA-1, and EBV/HHV-6 DUTPases. Molecular mimicry analysis confirmed the association between EBV/HHV-6 and the self-antigens by identifying shared pentapeptides, which might cause T-cell immunogenicity.

ConclusionRRMS is characterized by autoimmune responses targeting the enteric nerve and non-myelin proteins. EBV and HHV-6 reactivation contribute via molecular mimicry mechanisms.

Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, global vectors of dengue, require protein from host blood to support egg development and undergo repeated cycles of blood-feeding and egg-laying. After biting, females temporarily alter their behavioral state and suppress host-seeking while using blood-derived nutrients to develop eggs. Host-seeking suppression ends once eggs are laid. While this period has generally been thought of as one of behavioral inactivity, we reveal that it instead reflects behavioral reprogramming, during which females transition from post-blood-meal inactivity into active searching for egg-laying sites. Females with mature eggs show a distinct behavioral state characterized by increased locomotor activity and a shift in circadian behavioral timing, leading to nocturnal humidity-seeking and egg-laying in an otherwise diurnal species. We show that the circadian clock gene cycle is critical for regulating this transition; its absence disrupts the timing of oviposition behaviors, leading to poor site selection and reduced predicted offspring survival. These findings suggest that during egg development, circadian clock-dependent behavioral reprogramming triggers nocturnal hyperactivity and oviposition site search, an essential process for mosquito reproduction and population viability.","NA","biorxiv",1751321393886

ObjectiveTo evaluate the effects of Pycnogenol(R), a French maritime pine bark extract with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, versus placebo on patient-reported health status in individuals with PCC.

DesignSingle-center, placebo-controlled, quadruple-blind, randomized trial. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05890534

SettingGerman-speaking Switzerland.

ParticipantsAdults with PCC with at least one of the following symptoms: fatigue, post-exertional malaise, dyspnea, or brain fog.

InterventionDaily dose of 200 mg Pycnogenol(R) (50 mg capsules four times daily) or placebo for 12 weeks.

MeasurementsThe primary outcome was self-reported health status (EQ-VAS). Secondary outcomes included symptoms, quality of life, exercise capacity, physical activity and blood biomarkers.

ResultsBetween June 14, 2023, and July 5, 2024, 153 participants were randomized to receive Pycnogenol(R) (n=75) or placebo (n=78). Participants reported persisting symptoms for a median duration of 101 weeks.

Its importance is reflected by the severe, congenital LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (LAMA2 MD) caused by loss-of-function mutations in the LAMA2 gene. While laminin-2 has an established role in structurally supporting muscle fibers, it remains unclear whether it exerts additional functions that contribute to the maintenance of skeletal muscle integrity. Here, we report that in healthy muscle, activated muscle stem cells (MuSCs) express Lama2 and remodel their microenvironment with laminin-2. By characterizing LAMA2 MD-afflicted MuSCs and inducing MuSC-specific Lama2 knockouts, we show that MuSC-derived laminin-2 is essential for rapid MuSC expansion and regeneration. In humans, we identify LAMA2 expression in MuSCs and demonstrate that loss-of-function mutations impair the cell-cycle progression of myogenic precursors. In summary, we show that self-secreted laminin-2 supports MuSC proliferation post-injury, thus implicating MuSC dysfunction in LAMA2 MD pathology.","NA","biorxiv",1751321393886

While previous studies have linked de novo or dominantly inherited TUBA4A missense variants to neurodegenerative phenotypes, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, hereditary spastic ataxia, and more recently, an isolated report of congenital myopathy, the full phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of TUBA4A-related disorders remains incompletely characterised. In this multi-centre study, we identified 13 novel TUBA4A missense variants in 31 individuals from 19 unrelated families. Remarkably, affected individuals in 17 families presented with a primary axial myopathy without any identified CNS involvement or history of such disease. In the remaining two families, we observed probands with cerebellar ataxia and epilepsy accompanying proximal and axial muscle weakness, establishing the first documented association between TUBA4A variants and multisystem proteinopathy. Our cohort exhibited diverse genotypes and associated inheritance patterns: four families demonstrated autosomal dominant transmission through heterozygous variants in TUBA4A, three probands had homozygous TUBA4A variants, where the biallelic genotype was found to be associated with the disease, and the heterozygous carriers were asymptomatic; five probands carried de novo variants, and nine probands with heterozygous TUBA4A variants were classified as ""isolated-sporadic cases"" where parental samples were unavailable. Clinical phenotypes ranged from mild to severe myopathy, predominantly affecting the axial and paraspinal muscles. We observed a range of disease onset, from congenital to late adulthood. Creatine kinase levels were also variable, ranging from normal to highly elevated. Cardiac function remained preserved across the cohort. Muscle biopsies revealed a range of pathologies, including myofibre size variation, myofibre atrophy, nemaline bodies, core-like regions, internal nuclei, and endomysial fibrosis. Immunohistochemical staining showed evidence of proteinopathy, with autophagic features and TUBA4A accumulation in patient myofibres. Complementary in silico and in vitro investigations suggested that the identified TUBA4A substitutions cause significant protein abnormalities and may differentially impact microtubule dynamics. Our findings establish myo-tubulinopathies as distinct clinical entities, encompassing both primary myopathies and multisystem proteinopathies with muscle involvement. This study broadens the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of TUBA4A-related disorders beyond autosomal dominant or de novo mechanisms and neurodegenerative presentations. These results underscore the importance of considering TUBA4A variants in the differential diagnosis of axial myopathies and multisystem proteinopathies, regardless of central nervous system (CNS) involvement.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

While common and rare variants implicate few shared genes, they converge on shared molecular networks for more than 75% of traits. We demonstrate that the strength of this convergence is influenced by core factors such as trait heritability, gene mutational constraints, and tissue specificity. Using neuropsychiatric traits as examples, we show that common and rare variants impact shared functions across multiple levels of biological organization. These findings underscore the importance of integrating variants across the frequency spectrum and establish a foundation for network-based investigations of the genetics of diverse human diseases and phenotypes.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

Cardiovascular risk is associated with impaired cognitive health, although mechanisms are not completely understood. We sought to explore whether cardiovascular risk moderates the relationship between plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and cognitive status. Methods--We included groups of cognitively normal (n=301) and combined mild cognitive impairment or probable Alzheimer's disease (n=444), based on clinical assessment, from the Bio-Hermes-001 study. Cardiovascular risk was quantified using the Atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk calculator. We conducted a series of logistic regression analyses to evaluate the association of cardiovascular risk, each of several Alzheimer's disease biomarkers (i.e., plasma amyloid beta (A{beta})42/A{beta}40, phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181, p-tau217, and circulating levels of apolipoprotein E (ApoE4)), with cognitive status. We tested moderation by cardiovascular risk in each model. Results--We included 745 participants (mean age=72.3 years; 423 (56.8%) female) in the analysis. In each model, plasma biomarkers and cardiovascular risk were independently associated with cognitive status; the strongest association was found with p-tau217 (odds ratio (OR)=2.33; 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) [1.89-2.9]; p<0.0001). CVD risk only marginally moderated the relationships between p-tau181 and cognitive status, and between p-tau217 and cognitive status (p<0.05). Discussion--Plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and cardiovascular risk were independently associated with cognitive status, but cardiovascular risk only marginally moderated the p-tau181- and p-tau217-cognitive status relationships. If plasma biomarkers and CVD risk potentially confer an independent risk of dementia, cardiovascular risk assessment should complement other dementia biomarker assessments in clinical and research cognitive screening.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

Yet, despite growing clinical use, little is known about how sex assigned at birth shapes symptom-specific responses to these interventions, a critical gap in the move toward personalized psychiatry. Methods We conducted a pooled analysis of five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in which adults with TRD received intranasal esketamine or placebo twice weekly for four weeks, alongside a newly initiated oral antidepressant. We evaluated the effects of sex assigned at birth on overall depression severity, measured via total Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores, and across four symptom factors: sadness, negative thoughts, detachment, and neurovegetative symptoms. Rates of clinical response and remission were also analyzed by sex assigned at birth. Findings Overall, esketamine treatment improved total MADRS scores in both sexes; however, significant sex-specific patterns emerged. Females showed greater improvement in total MADRS scores than males towards the end of the trials, in both the placebo and esketamine arms. Females also showed more pronounced reductions in the sadness and detachment factors at the end of the trials, as well as in the neurovegetative factor on day 15, regardless of the treatment group. On the other hand, males showed a significant reduction in sadness symptoms after esketamine on day 2 of the treatment. Females had higher odds of responding, regardless of treatment arm, during later time points. Interpretation These findings reveal that sex assigned at birth influences overall antidepressant response and shapes the trajectory and symptom profile of improvement. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of incorporating sex assigned at birth as a key variable, essential for optimizing TRD treatment strategies and advancing individualized mental healthcare.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

A deep understanding of this process can secure healthy growth at the early phases of plant development and therefore the yield. Recent research indicates that germination is a complex process involving translational regulation. A large group of seed stored mRNAs together with newly synthesized transcripts are regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms and selectively translated at different stages to support the germination process. To investigate the mechanism of translational control, we performed ribosome profiling on mRNAs of distinct physiological stages during Arabidopsis thaliana seed germination. The 3-nucleotide periodicity of the ribosome association on mRNAs identified indicates their translational potential. Dry seeds, in which translation is on hold are characterized by a unique ribosome association landscape with high association at the 5 and 3 UTR, compared to physiological stages that show active translation. Start codon specific stalling of ribosomes in dry seeds is associated with an adenine enriched sequence motif. Throughout germination codons encoding glycine, aspartate, tyrosine and proline are the most frequent ribosome pausing sites. Moreover, the non-coding RNAs which we identified as associated to ribosomes are indeed translated as was revealed by investigating total seed proteome data. Seed specific upstream Open Reading Frames (uORFs) are identified which may be associated to translational control of adaptative response during early seed germination. Altogether, we present a first ribosome profiling analysis across seed germination that illuminates various regulatory mechanisms that potentially contribute to the seeds survival strategy.","NA","biorxiv",1751321393886

In early 2024, H5N1 HPAIV was detected in dairy cattle in the United States of America, where it has continued to circulate, with sporadic detections also reported in other ruminant species. The detection of high viral loads in milk from infected cattle, has resulted in several human infections, underscoring the zoonotic potential of these viruses. In response, several countries have intensified surveillance in non-avian species to evaluate the potential for undetected viral circulation in captive mammals. In Great Britain, bulk milk tank testing of cattle and targeted surveillance of captive mammalian species on an infected premises is undertaken in accordance with the outcome of a rapid risk assessment undertaken to determine the epidemiological links between the poultry and captive mammals. A result of this testing was the first recorded detection of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 HPAIV in a sheep in March 2025, identified on an infected poultry premises in Great Britain. An initial seropositive result in a single ewe triggered further investigation, confirming serological positivity across repeated sampling and the presence of viral RNA in milk samples. This detection was confined to a single animal and was likely attributable to proximity to infected poultry and a presumed heavily contaminated environment. The implications of this ruminant detection are discussed in the context of interspecies transmission and surveillance strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1751321393886

A vaccine administered to pregnant women, protecting against 70% of K. pneumoniae infections, could avert ~400,000 cases and ~80,000 deaths annually, mostly in Africa and South Asia. Vaccine formulations targeting the capsular polysaccharide (K) or lipopolysaccharide (O) antigens are in development. Global K. pneumoniae populations display extensive K and O diversity, necessitating a polyvalent vaccine targeted to the serotypes associated with neonatal disease in relevant geographical regions. We investigated the prevalence of K and O types associated with neonatal sepsis in Africa and South Asia to inform maternal vaccine design. Methods and Findings: We analysed n=1930 K. pneumoniae neonate blood isolates from 13 surveillance studies across 35 sites in 13 countries. We used pathogen sequencing to predict K and O serotypes and correct for local transmission clusters, and Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis to estimate K and O prevalence. Eighty-seven K loci were identified. KL2, KL102, KL25, KL15 and KL62 accounted for 49% of isolates. We estimate that 20 K loci, combining the eight most prevalent per region, could cover 72.9% of all infections [95% credible interval, 69.4&--76.5%] and [&ge;]70% in each of Eastern, Western and Southern Africa and South Asia. Preliminary findings from three sites suggested sufficient temporal stability of K loci to maintain 20-valent K vaccine coverage over 5-10 years, but more longitudinal data are needed to support this prediction. O types were far less diverse (n=14 types). We estimate the top-5 (O1{beta},2, O1{beta},2{beta}, O2, O2{beta} and O4) would cover 86% [82.6--89.9%] of total infections (76--92% per region), while the top-10 would cover 99% of infections in all four regions. Conclusions: Neonatal sepsis is associated with diverse K and O types, with substantial geographic and temporal variation even after adjusting for localised transmission clusters. Despite this, a single 20-valent K vaccine could theoretically cover [&ge;]70% of infections in all target regions. Locally-targeted vaccines could achieve higher coverage with lower valency, but are less feasible. In principle, very high coverage could be achieved with lower valency O-based vaccines, however protective efficacy of antibodies targeting the O antigen remains uncertain. Further research is needed on cross-reactivity, antigen exposure and stability of antigens over time, to better inform vaccine development.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

Little is known, however, about how the relative intensity of childrens PA volume and intensity distribution relates to health or fitness. To address this, we examined associations between childrens absolute and relative PA volume and intensity distribution with cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), and differences in these PA outcomes for children stratified by CRF level.

Materials and MethodsIn 9-10-year-old children (N=235) PA was assessed using wrist accelerometers for up to 7-days and CRF estimated from the 20-m multistage shuttle run test (20mSRT). Children were classified as Healthy or Low CRF. Absolute PA outcomes were PA volume (average acceleration; AvAccabs) and intensity distribution (intensity gradient; IGabs). Equivalent relative PA outcomes were generated (AvAccrel and IGrel) using maximum acceleration values derived from the 20mSRT.

ResultsAbsolute, but not relative standardised PA outcomes were positively associated with CRF (AvAccabs Std{beta}=0.21, p=0.02; IGabs Std{beta}=0.21, p=0.03). Absolute standardised PA outcomes were significantly higher among Healthy CRF children (AvAccabs Std{beta}=0.40, p=0.007; IGabs Std{beta}=0.46, p=0.008), but there were no significant differences between Healthy and Low CRF groups for relative PA outcomes.

ConclusionsChildren were similarly active relative to their physiological capacity, despite children with Healthy CRF being more active in absolute terms. Future studies should seek to better understand the influence of relative PA on CRF among diverse child populations who differ on a range of physical, physiological and demographic characteristics.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 10,913 patients from three sites in the REFINE PET registry with clinically indicated MPI and linked clinical outcomes. SR was calculated using fully automated algorithms as the ratio of splenic uptake at stress versus rest. Patients were stratified by SR into high (>=90th percentile) and low (<90th percentile) groups. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for clinical and imaging covariates, including myocardial flow reserve (MFR >=2 vs. <2). Results: The cohort had a median age of 68 years, with 57% male patients. Common risk factors included hypertension (84%), dyslipidemia (76%), diabetes (33%), and prior coronary artery disease (31%). Median follow-up was 4.6 years. Patients with high SR (n=1,091) had an increased risk of MACE (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.31, p=0.002).

However, data on the purity of illicitly manufactured fentanyl in the United States typically comes from law enforcement seizures and is rarely available at the consumer-level, which is most relevant to overdose risk. Methods: Samples were analyzed from a community-based drug checking program operating at four geographic sites in Los Angeles County, California 2023 Q1 to 2025 Q2. Participants answered an anonymous survey about sample characteristics. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted leveraging directly-observed mass spectrometry (DART-MS) and Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) respectively. LC/MS quantified a panel of compounds including fentanyl and fluorofentanyl. Composite fentanyl purity was estimated by adding the percent mass of fentanyl and fluorofentanyl. Results: A total of 353 samples had either fentanyl, fluorofentanyl, or both, quantified. Average purity was 10.0%, SD 11.1%, range 0.1%-64.9%. Samples expected to be fentanyl (n=308) had higher average purity (10.9%) compared to those expected to be heroin (n=24, average purity=2.7%) or other drugs.

Conclusions: We found high variation in fentanyl purity among consumer-level samples sold as fentanyl, which may explain overdose among people with opioid tolerance. Fentanyl concentration was lower among samples sold as heroin, other drugs, or in pill form, and was particularly low among expected non-opioid drugs.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

The risk of falls may be mitigated using reactive balance training (RBT) which has been shown to effectively reduce fall risk by enhancing reactive stepping following repeated balance perturbations. However, the optimal RBT intensity for people with chronic stroke remains unknown. The purpose of this assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial is to investigate the optimal intensity of RBT by comparing high-intensity, moderate-intensity, and walking control groups among 63 individuals with chronic stroke. Participants will undergo four consecutive days of training, with outcomes assessed pre- and post-training and at a one-year follow-up. The primary outcomes are reactive stepping ability, measured using number of steps required to recover balance from a novel perturbation. Secondary outcomes include rates of adverse events, functional balance, falls efficacy, and participation in daily activities. We hypothesize that high-intensity RBT will yield faster adaptations and greater retention compared to moderate-intensity and walking. Determining the optimal RBT intensity could substantially enhance clinical guidelines for stroke rehabilitation, optimize therapy efficiency, and improve patient outcomes by reducing fall risk and improving functional independence.

Study Design and MeasuresRetrospective RECORD-compliant electronic health record cohort study. We extracted 65 prodromal features (symptoms and substance use before FEP onset) using natural language processing to assess the presence, duration and first presentation of the psychosis prodrome and occurrences of features across the prodrome. Duration and feature occurrences were compared between DET+ and DET-individuals using Mann-Whitney U tests and Wilcoxon Effect Size, while presence and first presentation were compared using logistic regression.

Study Results1,545 FEP patients (n=119 DET+ [mean age 28.7 years; SD=9.4; 61.6% male]) were included.

Here, we present TIME_ACT, an unsupervised 66-gene transcriptomic signature of tumor immune activation derived from TCGA melanoma data. First, TIME_ACT scores accurately identify tumors with activated immune microenvironments across cancer types. Analysis of spatial features of the tumor microenvironment revealed that TIME_ACT-high regions exhibit dense lymphocyte infiltration near tumor cells, indicating localized immune activation. Second, in 15 anti-PD1 transcriptomic cohorts spanning six cancer types, TIME_ACT outperforms 22 established signatures and methods, achieving a mean AUC of 0.76 and a clinically meaningful mean odds ratio of 6.11. Thirdly, TIME_ACT scores can be accurately inferred from tumor histopathology slides. Finally, slide-inferred TIME_ACT scores predict ICB response across eight unseen cohorts, achieving a mean AUC of 0.72 and a mean odds ratio of 5.02. These findings establish TIME_ACT as a robust, pan-cancer, and low-cost predictor of ICB response.","NA","biorxiv",1751321393886

Deep learning (DL)-based assessment of FOG using inertial measurement units ameliorates these problems but poses challenges. Particularly, the large heterogeneity between patients and assessment methods potentially affects detection performance between independent cohorts. To evaluate heterogeneity effects, we developed a DL model on a local cohort (85 participants; 2043 trials) and validated it across six external cohorts (256 participants; 1058 trials). Model-expert agreement on the percentage-of-time-frozen was strong locally (ICC=0.886 [0.79,0.90]) but reduced in external cohorts (ICC=0.562{+/-}0.141). Fine-tuning the DL model with just 50 minutes of external cohort data improved the ICC to 0.732{+/-}0.138, falling within the borderline of the inter-rater agreement (ICC=0.73-0.99). Therefore, while unified standards are still being developed, we propose an expert-in-the-loop workflow as an effective intermediary and present a proof-of-concept web-based platform for fine-tuning and expert review (https://aidfog.be/).","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

The prevailing paradigm of oncofetal reprogramming posits that cancer cells reactivate embryonic developmental programs to drive tumorigenesis; however, the lineage-specific nature of this reversion remains incompletely defined. This review advances and systematically evaluates the hypothesis that the cancer PTM landscape is a traceable relic of the cell's embryonic germ layer origin, ectoderm, mesoderm, or endoderm offering a novel, developmentally-informed framework for precision oncology. Objectives: To systematically review and synthesize the global evidence linking cancer PTMs to their developmental origins and to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and implementation of PTM-targeted therapeutics through this novel developmental lens, with LLM assistance. Methods: Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, and using LLM assistance, a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and extensive grey literature sources, including over 3,000 theses, dissertations, clinical trial registries, and institutional reports, from inception to June 2025 was conducted. Results: From an initial screen of over 25,000 records, 3,128 studies met the inclusion criteria, encompassing data from over 500,000 patients. Our analysis revealed distinct, germ-layer-specific PTM signatures and corresponding therapeutic vulnerabilities. Ectoderm-derived cancers (e.g., neuroblastoma, melanoma) are characterized by aberrant oncofetal glycosylation. Anti-GD2 immunotherapy, which targets a neural crest-specific glycan, demonstrated a profound survival benefit in high-risk neuroblastoma (Hazard Ratio for overall survival: 0.57, 95% CI 0.42-0.78, p<0.001). Mesoderm-derived malignancies (e.g., sarcomas, leukemias) exhibit dysregulated phosphorylation and SUMOylation. These cancers respond preferentially to kinase inhibitors (HR for overall survival: 0.72, 95% CI 0.68-0.76, p<0.001) and cellular therapies like CAR-T, which achieve overall response rates exceeding 80% in hematologic malignancies. Endoderm-derived adenocarcinomas (e.g., lung, colorectal) display a heightened dependency on the ubiquitin-proteasome system for managing proteotoxic stress, validating proteasome inhibitors (HR for overall survival: 0.77, 95% CI 0.71-0.84, p<0.001) and emerging PROTACs as key therapeutic classes. Implementation science analysis revealed profound global disparities, with treatment costs exceeding $450,000 per sequence and access to advanced PTM therapies below 5% in low-income countries. Conclusion: The post-translational modification landscape of cancer is fundamentally imprinted by its embryonic lineage, with the Golgi apparatus acting as a key arbiter of this oncofetal memory. This developmental framework provides a powerful new tool for rational drug design, biomarker discovery, and patient stratification. However, translating this scientific progress into global patient benefit requires timely and coordinated policy action to address the profound implementation chasm created by prohibitive costs and systemic inequities in healthcare access.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

Ruptured AVMs can cause significant morbidity and mortality. The Ruptured Arteriovenous Malformation Grading Scale (RAGS) was developed to better predict outcomes in patients with ruptured AVMs. However, the reliability of this scale has yet to be confirmed to support its use in clinical practice. Objective: To determine the intra- and inter-rater reliability of RAGS among those most likely to use it in clinical practice. Methods: A cross-sectional sample of 42 patients with ruptured AVMs was selected via retrospective review, and clinical vignettes were created. Five raters were chosen to assign a RAGS score to all 42 patients to assess the inter-rater reliability of RAGS. After two months, ten patients from the study sample were randomly selected to be re-rated to determine the intra-rater reliability of RAGS. Results: The overall agreement rate was 97.2% among all raters. The inter-rater reliability was found to be substantial when measured using Cohen/Conger Kappa (0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.63, 0.82]), Scott/Fleiss Kappa (0.72, 95% CI [0.62, 0.82]), Krippendorf Alpha (0.73, 95% CI [.63, 95% CI [0.63, 0.82]), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (0.78, 95% CI [0.68, 0.86]), and Kendall W (0.79, 95% CI [0.68, 0.86]) and almost perfect using Gwet AC (0.90, 95% CI [0.88, 0.93]). The test-retest percent agreement was between 94.7% and 98.1% among raters. Conclusions: The RAGS classification system is highly reliable and has substantial to near-perfect agreement among raters with different expertise levels and specialties.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate an automated method to identify nCET and assess its prognostic value. Methods: Pre operative T2 weighted and FLAIR MRI from 940 patients with newly diagnosed GB in four multicenter cohorts were analyzed. A deep learning model segmented enhancing tumor, edema and necrosis; a non local spatially varying finite mixture model then isolated edema subregions containing nCET. The ratio of nCET to total edema volume - the Diffuse Infiltration Index (DII) - was calculated. Associations between DII and overall survival (OS) were examined with Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox regression. Results: The algorithm distinguished nCET from vasogenic edema in 97.5 percent of patients, showing a mean signal intensity gap greater than 5 percent. Higher DII is able to stratify patients with shorter OS. In the NCT03439332 cohort, DII above the optimal threshold doubled the hazard of death (hazard ratio 2.09, 95 percent confidence interval 1.34 to 3.25; p = 0.0012) and reduced median survival by 122 days. Significant, though smaller, effects were confirmed in GLIOCAT and BraTS (hazard ratio 1.31; p = 0.022), OUS (hazard ratio 1.28; p = 0.007) and in pooled analysis (hazard ratio 1.28; p = 0.0003). DII remained an independent predictor after adjustment for age, extent of resection and MGMT methylation. Conclusions: We present a reproducible, server hosted tool for automated nCET delineation and DII biomarker extraction that enables robust, independent prognostic stratification.

We studied 602 individuals [&le;] 61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months.

The mean age was 51 years (range, 25-61), 46% were women and 59% self-identified as Black. Black women had a more adverse psychosocial profile and higher rates of obesity and diabetes, but a less severe index MI. The incidence of MSIMI was approximately doubled in Black women than the other groups (p<.001 for interaction). Clinical and psychosocial risk factors did not explain these differences. In a fully adjusted model, the risk ratio of MSIMI for Black women was 2.2 (95% CI, 2.0-2.5) compared to Black men, 2.3 (1.8-2.9) compared to non-Black women, and 1.8 (1.4-2.2) compared to non-Black men. Conclusions. Among midlife individuals with a recent MI, Black women have a disproportionately higher risk of MSIMI.

There is evidence that some facets of the initiation consultation, or the initiating clinician, are associated with adherence. CVD risk estimation is fundamental to statin initiation and shared decision making (SDM), because the benefits of statins are proportional to CVD risk. Absence of a recorded CVD risk score before statin initiation therefore indicates SDM is unlikely. This study investigates whether, in primary prevention, SDM, using CVD risk score as a proxy measure, is associated with adherence to statins and CVD outcomes. Method: A cohort of statin naive patients aged 40-84 years initiated on statins for primary prevention between 2017 and 2020 was identified and categorised by the presence or absence of a CVD risk score at statin initiation. Statin adherence and persistence was determined from subsequent statin prescriptions. Multivariable modelling, accounting for potential confounders determined the association between a recorded CVD risk score and statin adherence and persistence. A secondary analysis investigated the relationship with subsequent CVD outcomes and death. Results: 255,730 patients were included with a mean follow up of 4.6 years. 67.7% had a CVD risk score coded. The presence of a CVD risk score increased odds of adherence at the end of year one by 7% and reduced the chances of discontinuation by 8%. The composite outcome of CVD and all-cause mortality was decreased by 21% when a CVD risk score was present. Conclusion: When a statin is initiated in the presence of a CVD risk score there is a small, but significant improvement in both adherence and persistence which could indicate that the quality of initiation consultations, and a focus on SDM, improves the utility of statins. Additionally, CVD risk scoring is associated with a large decrease in CVD/death which cannot fully be explained by improvements in statin adherence and persistence; an important finding necessitating further investigation.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

ObjectiveTo estimate the impacts of federal policy changes on PrEP coverage, new HIV infections and costs associated with new HIV infections

DesignEstimation of excess HIV infections under different policy impacts were conducted using parameters from a previously published ecological model of the relationship between PrEP coverage and new HIV infections. Costs were estimated for the treatment of infections not averted under different scenarios.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsThere was no individual participation in research activities; population-based data sources were used to describe the population-level PrEP use and new diagnoses under different hypothetical changes in PrEP coverage.

ExposuresPercent of people with indications for PrEP who are taking PrEP

Main Outcome and MeasuresEstimated change in new HIV infections under different assumptions of change in PrEP coverage; costs of treatment for avoidable HIV infections and net costs of avoidable infections after accounting for costs of PrEP medications.

ResultsEven modest reductions in PrEP coverage would result in thousands of avoidable HIV infections. An absolute 3.3% annual reduction in PrEP coverage over the next decade would result in 8,618 avoidable HIV infections, with lifetime medical costs of over $3.6 billion (discounted) for treatment of the unaverted HIV infections.

Conclusions and RelevanceChanges in policy that reduce PrEP uptake would result in avoidable HIV infections and increased costs for HIV treatment. Maintaining policies and programs that support PrEP uptake offers benefits for health and is estimated to result in net cost savings.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the likely impacts on HIV transmissions and healthcare costs if policy changes result in decreased PrEP utilization in the United States?

FindingsUnder assumptions of even modest reductions in PrEP use, we estimated thousands of HIV infections would fail to be averted over the next decade, and billions of dollars of additional treatment costs would accrue to the healthcare system.

Results of the studyWe used historical descriptive data on the US HIV epidemic to quantify the relationship between PrEP coverage and trends in HIV diagnoses and to estimate future trends in HIV infections if PrEP coverage were to be rolled back. If PrEP use declines modestly - about 3% annually - we estimate that 8,618 new infections would fail to be averted in a decade because of lowered PrEP uptake, and the estimated lifetime medical costs of these unaverted infections would be $3.6 billion (discounted) and $9.3 billion (undiscounted).

MeaningChanges in healthcare priorities and policies, especially those that increase out of pocket costs of PrEP or reduce the convenience of engaging in PrEP care, risk rolling back our progress in ending the HIV epidemic, accruing avertable HIV infections, and incurring increased costs for medical care of people whose HIV infections were avoidable.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

These results are consistent with theories arguing that biases in sensory and cognitive processing sculpt acoustic preferences and confirm Darwin's century-old hunch about the conservation of aesthetics and beauty in nature.","NA","biorxiv",1751321393886

The structure, together with structure-guided mutagenesis and functional assays, reveals how GOLPH3 uses coincidence detection of COPI and lipid to engage Golgi residents preferentially at late cisternae. Our findings rationalize the logic of cisternal maturation and explain how COPI can engage different types of substrates in different Golgi cisternae to retrieve some proteins back to the ER while retaining others within the Golgi apparatus.","NA","biorxiv",1751321393886

Many organisms with symbiotic microorganisms have developed elaborate vertical transmission mechanisms, which are thought to be important for the evolution of intimate symbiotic relationships with microorganisms. One such case is the cockroach-Blattabacterium endosymbiosis, in which the symbiotic bacteria have been evolutionarily conserved and co-speciated with the host insects with stable vertical symbiont transmission via ovarial passage. While classical histological descriptions and recent electron microscopic observations have reported the vertical symbiont transmission processes in some cockroach-Blattabacterium associations, the full picture of the infection dynamics has not been fully understood. In this study, we conducted detailed histological and cytological observations of the localization of the bacteriocytes and the symbiotic bacteria during the postembryonic development of the German cockroach Blattella germanica. We found that the symbiont-filled bacteriocytes migrate into and associate with nymphal ovaries and are subsequently eliminated from adult ovaries, suggesting that symbiont infection to the ovaries may only occur during nymphal stages. We also found that the symbiotic bacteria are localized in the space between each oocyte and surrounding follicle cells, the symbiont-localized space is interconnected between neighboring oocytes, and therefore the symbiotic bacteria can move across oocytes within the same ovariole, suggesting the possibility that the symbiont-infected oocytes may serve as the source of symbiont supply to developing young oocytes upstream in the same ovariole. Based on these observations, we provide a hypothesis as to how the postembryonic developmental dynamics of the bacteriocytes are integrated into the vertical symbiont transmission and functioning in the cockroach-Blattabacterium endosymbiosis.","NA","biorxiv",1751321393886

However, research on Elicits performance is limited.

ObjectivesTo determine whether Elicit AI is a viable tool for systematic literature searches.

MethodsWe compared the included studies in four systematic reviews to those identified searching with Elicit. We calculated sensitivity, precision and observed patterns in the performance of Elicit.

ResultsElicit had an average of 39.6% precision (26.7% - 46.2%) which was higher than the 7.55% average of the original reviews (0.65% - 14.7%). However, the sensitivity of Elicit was poor, averaging 37.9% (25.5% - 69.2%) compared to 93.5% (87.2% - 98.0%) in the original reviews. Elicit also identified some included studies not identified by the original searches.

DiscussionAt the time of this evaluation, Elicit did not search with high enough sensitivity to replace traditional literature searching. However, the high precision of searching in Elicit could prove useful for preliminary searches, and the unique studies identified mean that Elicit can be used by researchers as a useful adjunct.

ConclusionWhilst Elicit searches are currently not sensitive enough to replace traditional searching, Elicit is continually improving, and further evaluations should be undertaken as new developments take place.

Understanding how the Healthy Eating Index-2020 (HEI-2020) can be used as a measure of diet quality to create benchmarks for national nutrition monitoring can assist in surveillance and improve the design of nutrition programs and policies.

ObjectiveTo examine the utility of the HEI-2020 to create benchmarks for national diet quality monitoring.

MethodsThis serial cross-sectional study used data from the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Nationally representative data for 22,168 US adults ([&ge;]20 years) who completed two 24-hour recalls were analyzed. We derived HEI-2020 scores (0-100) from participants two 24-hour dietary recalls. Diet quality categories were established: high diet quality (>70-100), marginal (>60-70), low (>50-60), and very low (0-50).

ResultsOnly 13% of US adults had high diet quality while nearly two-thirds had low or very low diet quality. Diet quality was higher for older adults, female, ""Other"" race or ethnicity, born outside of the US, have higher education attainment, higher income, and food security. Compared to adults with high diet quality, adults with very low diet quality had lower intakes of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and seafood and the highest intakes of ultra-processed foods, refined grains, and red and processed meats (all P-trends <0.01). Adults with very low diet quality were more likely to have elevated adiposity, lower HDL cholesterol, and higher triglycerides, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c (all P-trends [&le;]0.01).

ConclusionsThe HEI-2020 is a robust measure of diet quality that can be directly linked to biological measures associated with chronic disease risk. Using evidence-based HEI categories could allow policymakers, public health practitioners, and nutrition professionals to set benchmarks and nationwide targets for achieving improved diet quality.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

Rationally predicting individual-specific success or failure of probiotic and prebiotic interventions remains an outstanding challenge. In this study, we leverage microbial community-scale metabolic models (MCMMs) to predict probiotic engraftment and shifts in microbiota-mediated short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in response to a synbiotic intervention. Using data from a placebo-controlled synbiotic intervention trial, involving a cocktail of five probiotic strains and the prebiotic inulin, we validate model engraftment predictions with quantitative PCR (qPCR), demonstrating that MCMMs accurately predict probiotic engraftment outcomes in the treatment group with over 85% accuracy. Engraftment varied by species, with Akkermansia muciniphila and Bifidobacterium infantis displaying higher engraftment rates than Clostridium beijerinckii, Anaerobutyricum hallii, and Clostridium butyricum. Furthermore, MCMMs predicted significant increases in butyrate and propionate production following synbiotic treatment. MCMM-predicted changes in propionate production in the treatment group were negatively associated with changes in C-reactive protein (CRP), a blood marker of systemic inflammation, from baseline to 12 weeks after the synbiotic intervention. Finally, we explore MCMM-predicted responses to a wider range of synbiotic combinations in a larger observational cohort, suggesting that personalized prebiotic selection can augment probiotic efficacy. These findings highlight the potential of metabolic modeling to inform precision microbiome therapeutics.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

Recently, a novel approach for the fast and efficient differentiation of ovarian support cells (OSCs) to generate a versatile platform for basic research and clinical applications was demonstrated. This study details the clinical process development and application of an OSC product, known as Fertilo, to improve the in vitro maturation (IVM) of human oocytes, a method referred to as OSC-IVM. First, transcription factor (TF) mediated OSC differentiation using research-grade raw materials was shown to produce granulosa-like cells that improve the MII maturation rate of human oocytes. To support clinical application, several raw material upgrades were initiated, including substitution of the differentiation matrix with a higher-quality alternative, laminin-521, and the generation of a clinically suitable hiPSC seed bank and master cell bank. Single cell RNA sequencing of OSCs generated using the updated protocol for clinical translation demonstrated the consistency and reproducibility of cellular outcomes. Next, analytical release testing of the clinical product was performed and a murine oocyte maturation assay was developed to establish the potency of OSCs for use in OSC-IVM. Finally, the qualified Fertilo product was applied in a two-phase longitudinal cohort analysis, with the results showing improvement in key outcomes compared to traditional IVM treatment. Our findings demonstrate the first-time clinical development and application of an hiPSC-derived product to improve reproductive outcomes after IVM and advance womens health.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

Symptoms of sympathetic dysfunction are prevalent in diabetes, affecting up to 90% of patients. The molecular and cellular composition of the human SCG and its alteration in diabetes remains poorly defined. To address this gap, we performed spatial transcriptomic profiling of lumbar SCGs from diabetic and non-diabetic organ donors. We identified 3 three distinct neuronal populations, two noradrenergic (NA1 and NA2) and one cholinergic (CHO), based on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and SLC18A3 expression, respectively. We also characterized 9 non-neuronal populations consisting of Schwann cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, adipocytes, and endothelial cells. In diabetic SCGs, we observed a significant loss of myelinating Schwann cells and a phenotypic shift of cholinergic neurons toward a noradrenergic identity. Additionally, diabetes was associated with a significant reduction in the transcripts of vasodilatory neuropeptides, such as VIP and CALCA, suggesting a mechanism for impaired vascular control. Upstream regulator analysis highlighted altered neurotrophic signaling in diabetes, with enhanced NGF/TRKA and diminished BDNF/TRKB activity, potentially driven by target-derived cues. Comparison between SCG and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons revealed ganglia-specific genes, like SCN3A and NPY (SCG) versus SCN10A and GPX1 (DRG), offering specific therapeutic targets for autonomic dysfunction or pain. Our findings provide a transcriptomic characterization of human SCG, revealing molecular signatures that underlie diabetic autonomic dysfunction. This work lays a foundation for the development of therapies to restore sympathetic function and avoid unintended autonomic effects in the development of analgesics.

Significance StatementAutonomic dysfunction affects up to 90% of people with diabetes, yet the human sympathetic nervous system remains poorly molecularly defined. To address this gap, we present a spatial transcriptomic profile of the human sympathetic chain ganglia (SCG), revealing how diabetes affects the human autonomic nervous system. We show that diabetes shifts the cholinergic neuronal population to a noradrenergic phenotype and reduces vasodilation neuropeptide expression, potentially explaining impaired vascular control and thermoregulation. Comparative analysis of sympathetic and sensory ganglia reveals distinct gene profiles that may inform novel therapeutic strategies. These findings offer critical insight into the molecular drivers of diabetic autonomic neuropathy and lay the groundwork for safer, more precise treatments that selectively modulate autonomic or sensory function in chronic disease.","NA","biorxiv",1751321393886

Discrepancies between these predictions and actual inputs, sensory prediction errors, guide perceptual inference. A fundamental yet largely unresolved question is which stimulus features the brain predicts, and therefore, what kind of surprise drives neural responses. Here, we investigated this question using EEG and computational modelling based on deep neural networks (DNNs). Participants viewed object images whose identity was probabilistically predicted by preceding cues. We then quantified trial-by-trial surprise at both low-level (early DNN layers) and high-level (late DNN layers) visual feature representations. Results showed that stimulus-evoked responses around 200ms post-stimulus onset over parieto-occipital electrodes were increased by high-level, but not by low-level visual surprise. These findings demonstrate that high-level visual predictions are rapidly integrated into perceptual inference, suggesting that the brains predictive machinery is finely tuned to utilize expectations abstracted away from low-level sensory details to facilitate perception.","NA","biorxiv",1751321393886

Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1751321393886
