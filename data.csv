However, the extent to which these viral prospecting efforts have enhanced preparedness for disease outbreaks remains poorly characterized, especially in terms of whether they are necessary, sufficient, or feasible ways to spur medical countermeasure development. We find that several viruses which pose known threats to human health lack approved vaccines and that known viruses discovered in human patients prior to 2000 have caused most major 21st-century outbreaks. With Filoviridae as a case study, we show there is little evidence to suggest that viral prospecting has accelerated countermeasure development or that systematically discovering novel zoonotic viruses in animal hosts before they cause human outbreaks has been feasible. These results suggest that prospecting for novel viral targets does not accelerate a rate-limiting step in countermeasure development and underscore questions about the importance of zoonotic viral discovery for outbreak preparedness. We consider limitations to these conclusions and alternative but related approaches to preparedness and response.","NA","medrxiv",1723500529751

Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation.

We employed a single-nucleus RNA-sequencing approach to assess the transcriptional heterogeneity and cell differentiation processes within the SAM. By collecting dissected inflorescence meristems, we constructed an inflorescence single-nucleus SAM atlas from Arabidopsis thaliana. Our analysis unveiled regulatory elements for most previously known cell types such as the boundary domain, vasculature, early primordia, epidermis and internal stem cells. We also identified previously unobserved transcriptional profiles, revealing that the stem cortex is defined early within forming primordia. Moreover, trajectory inference analysis allowed us to capture spatial control of S-phase machinery by floral homeotic genes and differentiation gene expression dynamics from internal shoot stem cells toward internal layers such as cortex, cambium, xylem and phloem. The results advance our understanding of the cellular and transcriptional heterogeneity underlying the cell-fate transcriptional dynamics shaping shoot organs and architecture.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529751

In particular, it is unknown how metabolism might be differentially affected by an acute infection that the immune system can successfully clear, compared to a chronic and persistent infection. Here we used metabolomics and isotope tracing to identify metabolic changes in mice infected with acute or chronic forms of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) for three or eight days. Both types of infection alter metabolite levels in blood and tissues, including itaconate and thymidine. However, we observed more dramatic metabolite changes in the blood and tissues of mice with chronic LCMV infection compared to those with acute infection. Isotope tracing revealed that the contribution of both glucose and glutamine to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle increase in the spleen, liver, and kidneys of mice infected with chronic LCMV, while acute LCMV only increases the contribution of glutamine to the TCA cycle in the spleen. We found that whole-body turnover of both glutamine and thymidine increase during acute and chronic infection, whereas whole-body glucose turnover was surprisingly unchanged. Activated T cells in vitro produce thymidine and mice with T cell leukemia display elevated serum thymidine, nominating T lymphocytes as the source of thymidine in LCMV infection. In sum, we provide comprehensive measurements of whole-body and tissue metabolism in acute and chronic viral infection, and identify altered thymidine metabolism as a marker of viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529751

This capability results in high temporal resolution, reduced data redundancy, and a wide dynamic range. This makes EBS ideal for Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) as SMLM relies on the sequential imaging of sparse, blinking fluorescent emitters to achieve super-resolution. Recent studies have shown that EBS can effectively capture these emitters, achieving spatial resolution comparable to traditional cameras. However, existing analyses of event-based SMLM (eveSMLM) data have relied on converting event lists into image frames for conventional analysis, limiting the full potential of the technology. To overcome this limitation, we developed EVE, a specialized software for analyzing eveSMLM data. EVE offers an integrated platform for detection, localization, and post-processing, with various algorithmic options tailored for the unique structure of eveSMLM data. EVE is user-friendly and features an open, modular infrastructure that supports ongoing development and optimization. EVE is the first dedicated tool for event-based SMLM, transforming the analysis process to fully utilize the spatiotemporal data generated by EBS. This allows researchers to explore the full potential of eveSMLM and encourages the development of new analytical methods and experimental improvements.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529751

Anatomical studies show EC in W. floribunda arise from cortical parenchyma, while cambium-specific transcriptome comparisons reveal that genes acting as regulators of typical cambium development in model species are likewise associated with atypical EC development.

Using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behaviour (COM-B) model for behaviour change, the aim of this research was to explore the barriers and facilitators of community pharmacy PrEP delivery, for pharmacists and community members.

MethodsCommunity members at elevated risk of acquiring HIV and community pharmacists were recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analysed within the framework of the COM-B model.

Results17 interviews with pharmacists (pharmacy owners n=7; employed pharmacists n=6; locums n=4) and 24 with community members (Black African women n=6; other women n=2; young adults aged 18-25 years n=6; transgender people n=6; female sex workers n=4) were carried out. Capability barriers included sub-optimal awareness and knowledge of PrEP, pharmacy facilities, and pharmacist roles in delivering public health services. Opportunity barriers included lack of staff capacity, privacy and pharmacy screening and monitoring facilities. Motivational barriers included a concern that increased access could increase sexually transmitted infections and involve a financial cost. Capability facilitators included awareness raising, HIV and PrEP training and education. Opportunity facilitators included PrEP appointments and the accessibility of pharmacies. Motivational facilitators included a preference for pharmacy delivery over other models (e.g., sexual health, GP), and a belief that it would be discrete and less stigmatising.

ConclusionPharmacy PrEP delivery is acceptable but for it to be feasible, results point to the need for the development of a behaviour change intervention focusing on education, training and awareness raising, targeting pharmacists and community members to stimulate patient activation and de-stigmatise HIV. This intervention would need to be facilitated by system and environmental changes (e.g., commissioning service).

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSLocation, sigma of sexual health clinics and lack of PrEP awareness limits PrEP access for key groups among whom new HIV acquisitions remain high. Previous research and the UK government suggests PrEP provision via community pharmacies as a potential way of improving PrEP access and health equity.

What this study addsThis is the first research study to explore the barriers to and facilitators of pharmacy PrEP delivery for pharmacists and community members in the UK. To increase capabilities and motivation, training and awareness raising is needed. To increase opportunities and motivation, environmental and system level changes are needed.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyResults point to the acceptability of pharmacy PrEP delivery, but for it to be feasible behaviour change interventions supported by system and environmental changes are needed.","NA","medrxiv",1723500529751

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1723500529751

ObjectiveThis cross-sectional study examined the relationships between macronutrients, dietary components, and sleep parameters, considering their interdependencies.

MethodsData from 4,825 users of sleep and nutrition apps for at least 7 days were analyzed. Multivariable regression analysis investigated associations between quartiles of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate, and total fat, including saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats), dietary components (sodium, potassium, dietary fiber, and sodium-to-potassium ratio), and sleep variables (total sleep time [TST], sleep latency [SL], and % wakefulness after sleep onset [%WASO]). Nutrients were divided into quartiles, with the lowest intake group as the reference. Compositional data analysis accounted for interdependencies among macronutrients. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI).

ResultsHigher protein intake was associated with longer TST in the 3rd (B = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.26) and 4th quartiles (B = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.27).

Here, we report a broad survey of plasmids from hundreds of academic and industrial labs worldwide. We show that nearly half of them contained design and/or sequence errors. For transfer plasmids used in making AAV vectors, which are widely used in gene therapy, about 40% carried mutations in ITR regions due to their inherent instability, which is influenced by flanking GC content. We also list genes difficult to clone into plasmid or package into virus due to their toxicity. Our finding raises serious concerns over the trustworthiness of lab-made plasmids, which parallels the underappreciated mycoplasma contamination and misidentified mammalian cell lines reported previously, and highlights the need for community-wide standards to uphold the quality of this ubiquitous reagent in research and medicine.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529751

The mechanisms of lineage restriction remain enigmatic. We previously defined occlusion as a mode of gene silencing wherein affected genes lack the transcriptional potency to be activated by their cognate transcription factors (TFs). Here, we present a comprehensive mechanistic basis of lineage restriction as driven by gene occlusion. Specifically, we show that genes can become occluded simply by the default action of chromatinization in the absence of TF binding, that naive pluripotent stem cells establish full developmental potency via their capacity to erase occlusion, that primed pluripotent cells shut down this deocclusion ability in preparation for differentiation, that differentiating cells become increasingly restricted in their fate potency by the irreversible occlusion of lineage-inappropriate genes, and that stem cells employ placeholder factors (PFs) to protect silent genes needed for later activation from premature occlusion. Collectively, these mechanisms drive lineage restriction whereby the transcriptionally potent portion of the genome shrinks progressively during differentiation, rendering the fate potency of developing cells to also dwindle progressively.

Here we integrated single cell- and spatial transcriptomics, as well as in vitro and in vivo live-cell imaging to define supratentorial ependymoma cell states, spatial organization, and dynamic behavior within the neural microenvironment. We find that individual tumor subgroups harbor two distinct progenitor-like cell states reminiscent of early human brain development and diverge in the extent of neuronal or ependymal differentiation.

Despite the far-reaching epidemiological implications of this trend, the extent to which antimicrobial resistance load varies within human populations and the drivers that contribute most to this variation remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate in a representative cohort of 7,095 Finnish adults1 that socio-demographic factors, lifestyle, and gut microbial community composition shape resistance selection and transmission processes. Antimicrobial resistance gene load was linked not only to prior use of antibiotics, as anticipated, but also to frequent consumption of fresh vegetables and poultry, two food groups previously reported to contain antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Interestingly, ARG load was not associated with high-fat and -sugar foods. Furthermore, antimicrobial resistance gene load was systematically higher in females and the generally healthier high-income demographics in urban and densely populated areas. Data from this prospective cohort with a 17-year follow-up suggests that the prognostic potential of antimicrobial resistome is comparable to blood pressure for mortality and sepsis. These findings highlight population-level risks and socio-demographic dimensions of antimicrobial resistance that are particularly relevant in the current context of global urbanization and middle-class growth.","NA","medrxiv",1723500529751

In healthy controls (HC) regulation of CBF is complex and involves multiple mechanisms including cardiac output (CO), cerebral perfusion pressure, PO2 and PCO2, flow-metabolism coupling, and innervation of cerebral vessels. In ME/CFS multiple other mechanisms have also been identified.

Aim of the studyWe previously found that both CBF and CO were reduced in ME/CFS patients during tilt testing, and we hypothesized that the relation between CBF and CO is abnormal and different from HC. In this retrospective study we analyzed this relation in a large group of patients. To compare the patient data with those of HC, we focused on patients with a normal heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) response to upright tilt. Also, the influence of clinical data was analyzed.

MethodsA total of 534 ME/CFS patients and 49 HC underwent tilt testing with measurements of HR, BP, CBF, and CO. In 46 (9%) patients CO and CBF changes were in the normal range of HC, and in 488 (91%) an abnormal CO and CBF reduction was found.

Resultspatients with a CO and CBF reduction in the range of HC had less severe disease and were more likely to be male. In patients with an abnormal CO and CBF reduction the slope of the regression line of CO versus CBF reduction was almost 1. A multiple regression analysis of the latter group, including patients with PetCO2 measurements (440/488: 90%) showed that the CO reduction for the major part predicted the CBF reduction, with a limited role for the PetCO2 reduction and the tilt duration. Other data did not add to the model.

ConclusionsTwo different patient groups with a normal HR and BP response during the tilt were identified: those with a CO and CBF in the normal range of HC and those with an abnormal CO and CBF reduction during the tilt (91% of patients). The former group had milder disease and included more men. In the largest group of patients there was an almost 1:1 relation between the CO and CBF reduction, suggesting absence of compensatory vasodilation in the cerebral vasculature. This may be an appropriate target for clinical and therapeutic interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1723500529751

A handful of ncRNAs have characterised functions, including important epigenetic roles in development and disease. Neither ncRNA nor multinucleated muscle is ideally suited to sequencing technologies. We therefore used customised RNA profiling methods and quantitative network modelling to study cell-type specific ncRNA transcriptome responses during load-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy. We completed five independent supervised exercise-training studies (n=144) and 61% of individuals accrued muscle mass beyond normal technical variation (lean mass responders, LMR). The remainder were defined as having no measurable lean mass response (NMLMR). Fifty ncRNA genes (FDR <1%) were differentially regulated in LMR, and in total we identified 110 ncRNAs for further study. A network model of the human muscle transcriptome was built (n=437 samples), assigning ncRNAs to protein coding modules representing functional pathways or single-cell types. We identified that the known hypertrophy-related ncRNA, CYTOR, was leukocyte-associated in vivo in humans (FDR = 4.9 x10-7; Fold Enrichment [FE] = 6.6). Other ncRNA modules included PPP1CB-DT, which was segregated with myofibril assembly genes (FDR = 8.15 x 10-8; FE = 47.5), while EEF1A1P24 and TMSB4XP8 were associated with vascular remodelling and angiogenesis genes (FDR = 2.77 x 10-5; FE = 3.6). MYREM was positively associated with hypertrophy, and we established its myonuclear expression pattern in vivo in humans using spatial transcriptomics probes.

We demonstrate that human cortical thickness development and aging trajectories unfold along patterns of molecular and cellular brain organization, traceable from population-level to individual developmental trajectories. During childhood and adolescence, cortex-wide spatial distributions of dopaminergic receptors, inhibitory neurons, glial cell populations, and brain-metabolic features explain up to 50% of variance associated with a lifespan model of regional cortical thickness trajectories. In contrast, modeled cortical thickness change patterns during adulthood are best explained by cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptor and transporter distributions. These relationships are supported by developmental gene expression trajectories and translate to individual longitudinal data from over 8,000 adolescents, explaining up to 59% of developmental change at cohort- and 18% at single-subject level.

These turns occur as motor sequences accompanied by neural sequences, in which defined neurons activate in a stereotyped order during each turn. Distinct neurons in this sequence respond to sensory cues, anticipate upcoming turn directions, and drive movement, linking key features of this sensorimotor behavior across time.

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1723500529751

Here, we propose to bypass these problems with a time- and memory-efficient clustering algorithm, BitBIRCH. This method uses a tree structure similar to the one found in the Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies (BIRCH) algorithm to ensure O(N) time scaling. BitBIRCH leverages the instant similarity (iSIM) formalism to process binary fingerprints, allowing the use of Tanimoto similarity, and reducing memory requirements. Our tests show that BitBIRCH is already > 1,000 times faster than standard implementations of the Taylor-Butina clustering for libraries with 1,500,000 molecules.

Currently, age-related chronic diseases account for over 90% of annual healthcare expenditures (more than $4.1 trillion) in the US alone. Thus, new therapies to improve healthspan and reduce the burden of chronic disease are needed. Herein, we conducted a phase 3 controlled clinical trial to evaluate the biological age (BA) effects of different therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) modalities in ambulatory individuals. We longitudinally profiled the subjects to measure changes in the epigenome, proteome, metabolome, glycome, and shifts in immune cell composition (cytomics). We demonstrate that administering TPE supplemented with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (TPE-IVIG) on a biweekly regime (two sessions in the first week, followed by a three-week break) is a robust therapy for BA rejuvenation. This intervention induced coordinated cellular and molecular  omics responses, reversed age-related immune decline, and modulated key cellular senescence-associated proteins. Integrative analysis revealed baseline biomarkers associated with successful responses, indicating that TPE-IVIG treatment benefits those with a poorer baseline health status. In summary, this is the first multi-omics study to examine the effectiveness of various TPE modalities, which demonstrate biological age rejuvenation and the molecular features associated with this rejuvenation.","NA","medrxiv",1723500529751

Most mammals are susceptible to progressive age-related hearing loss; however, the evolution of biosonar, which requires the ability to hear low-intensity echoes from outgoing sonar signals, may have selected against the development of hearing deficits in echolocating bats. Although many echolocating bats exhibit exceptional longevity and rely on acoustic behaviors for survival to old age, relatively little is known about the aging bat auditory system. In this study, we used DNA methylation to estimate the ages of wild-caught big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and measured hearing sensitivity in young and aging bats using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). We found no evidence for hearing deficits in aging bats, demonstrated by comparable thresholds and similar ABR wave and DPOAE amplitudes across age groups. We additionally found no significant histological evidence for cochlear aging, with similar hair cell counts, afferent, and efferent innervation patterns in young and aging bats. Here we demonstrate that big brown bats show minimal evidence for age-related loss of peripheral hearing sensitivity and therefore represent informative models for investigating mechanisms that may preserve hearing function over a long lifetime.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529751

However, plasmid acquisition can produce physiological alterations in the bacterial host, leading to potential fitness costs that determine the clinical success of bacteria-plasmid associations. In this study, we used a transcriptomic approach to characterize the interactions between a globally disseminated carbapenem resistance plasmid, pOXA-48, and a diverse collection of multidrug resistant clinical enterobacteria. Although pOXA-48 produced mostly strain-specific transcriptional alterations, it also led to the common overexpression of a small chromosomal operon present in Klebsiella spp. and Citrobacter freundii strains. This operon included two genes coding for a pirin and an isochorismatase family proteins (pfp and ifp), and showed evidence of horizontal mobilization across Proteobacteria species. Combining genetic engineering, transcriptomics, and CRISPRi gene silencing, we showed that a pOXA-48-encoded LysR regulator is responsible for the plasmid-chromosome crosstalk. Crucially, the operon overexpression produced a fitness benefit in a pOXA-48-carrying K. pneumoniae clinical strain, suggesting that this crosstalk promotes the dissemination of carbapenem resistance in clinical settings.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529751

Neurofibromatosis type 1 results from loss-of-function mutations in the neurofibromin gene and subsequent reduction in the neurofibromin protein (Nf1). While the mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated, loss of Nf1 may alter neuronal circuit activity leading to changes in behavior and susceptibility to cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Here we show that mutations decreasing Nf1 expression alter motor behaviors, impacting the patterning, prioritization, and behavioral state dependence in a Drosophila model of neurofibromatosis type 1. Loss of Nf1 increases spontaneous grooming in a nonlinear spatial and temporal pattern, differentially increasing grooming of certain body parts, including the abdomen, head, and wings. This increase in grooming was internal state-dependent, and could be overridden by hunger in food-deprived foraging animals, demonstrating that the Nf1 effect on grooming is plastic and internal state-dependent. Stimulus-evoked grooming patterns were altered as well, with nf1 mutants exhibiting reductions in wing grooming when coated with dust, suggesting that hierarchical recruitment of grooming command circuits was altered. Yet loss of Nf1 in sensory neurons and/or grooming command neurons did not alter grooming frequency, suggesting that Nf1 affects grooming via higher-order circuit alterations. Changes in grooming coincided with alterations in walking. Flies lacking Nf1 walked with increased forward velocity on a spherical treadmill, yet there was no detectable change in leg kinematics or gait. Thus, loss of Nf1 alters motor function without affecting overall motor coordination, in contrast to other genetic disorders that impair coordination. Overall, these results demonstrate that loss of Nf1 alters the patterning and prioritization of repetitive behaviors, in a state-dependent manner, without affecting motor coordination.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529751

LC has significant detrimental effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), activities of daily living (ADL), and work productivity. Condition-specific patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), such as the modified Covid-19 Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale (C19-YRSm), have been developed to capture the impact of LC. However, these do not provide health utility data required for cost-utility analyses of LC interventions. The aim of this study was therefore to derive a mapping algorithm for the C19-YRSm to enable health utilities to be generated from this PROM. Methods: Data were collected from a large study evaluating LC services in the UK. A total of 1434 people with LC had completed both the C19-YRSm and the EQ-5D-5L on the same day. The EQ-5D-5L responses were then converted to EQ-5D-3L utility scores. Correlation and linear regression analyses were applied to determine items from the C19-YRSm and covariates for inclusion in the algorithm. Model fit, mean differences across the range of EQ-5D-3L scores (-0.59 to 1), and Bland-Altman plots were used to evaluate the algorithm. Responsiveness (standardised response mean; SRM) of the mapped utilities was also investigated on a subset of participants with repeat assessments (N=85). Results: There was a strong level of association between 8 items and 2 domains on the C19-YRSm with the EQ-5D single-item dimensions. These related to joint pain, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, walking/moving around, personal care, ADL, and social role, as well as Overall Health and Other Symptoms. Model fit was good (R2 = 0.7). The mean difference between the actual and mapped scores was < 0.10 for the range from 0 to 1 indicating a good degree of targeting for positive values of the EQ-5D-3L. The SRM for the mapped EQ-5D-3L health utilities (based on the C19-YRSm) was 0.37 compared to 0.17 for the observed EQ-5D-3L utility scores, suggesting the mapped EQ-5D-3L is more responsive to change. Conclusions: We have developed a simple, responsive, and robust mapping algorithm to enable EQ-5D-3L health utilities to be generated from 10 items of the C19-YRSm. This mapping algorithm will facilitate economic evaluations of interventions, treatment, and management of people with LC, as well as further helping to describe and characterise patients with LC irrespective of any treatment and interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1723500529751

Transient times become extremely long near phase transitions (or bifurcations) in a phenomenon generically known as critical slowing down, observed in electronic circuits, quantum electrodynamics, ferromagnetic materials, ecosystems, and gene regulatory networks. Typically, these transients follow well-defined universal laws of the form{tau} [~] |{micro} - {micro}c| {beta}, describing how their duration,{tau} , varies as the control parameter, {micro}, approaches its critical value, {micro}c. For instance, transients delays right after a saddle-node (SN) bifurcation, influenced by so-called ghosts, follow {beta} = -1/2. Despite intensive research on slowing down phenomena over the past decades for single bifurcations, both local and global, the behavior of transients when several bifurcations are close to each other remains unknown. Here, we study transients close to two SN bifurcations collapsing into a transcritical one. To do so, we analyze a simple nonlinear model of a self-activating gene regulated by an external signal that exhibits a mushroom bifurcation. We also propose and study a normal form for a system with two SN bifurcations merging into a transcritical one. For both systems, we show analytical and numerical evidence of a synergistic increase in transients due to the coupling of the two ghosts and the transcritical slowing down. We also explore the influence of noise on the transients in the gene-regulatory model. We show that intrinsic and extrinsic noise play opposite roles in the slowing down of the transition allowing us to control the timing of the transition without compromising the precision of the timing. This establishes novel molecular strategies to generate genetic timers with transients much larger than the typical timescales of the reactions involved.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529751

Our findings reveal associations between anthropometric factors and depression scores in mental tests of participants with their gut microbiome composition.

For instance, is there an optimal granularity at which to view protein structural similarities (e.g., architecture, topology or some other level)? If so, how does it vary with the type of question being asked? Similarly, the discrete/continuous dichotomy of fold space is central in structural bioinformatics, but remains unresolved. Discrete views of fold space bin 'similar' folds into distinct, non-overlapping groups; unfortunately, such binning may inherently miss many remote relationships. While hierarchical systems like CATH, SCOP and ECOD represent major steps forward in protein classification, a scalable, objective and conceptually flexible method, with less reliance on assumptions and heuristics, could enable a more systematic and nuanced exploration of fold space, particularly as regards evolutionarily-distant relationships. Building upon a recent 'Urfold' model of protein structure, we have developed a new approach to analyze protein interrelationships. This framework, termed 'DeepUrfold', is rooted in deep generative modeling via variational Bayesian inference, and we find it to be useful for comparative analysis across the protein universe. Critically, DeepUrfold leverages its deep generative model's learned embeddings, which occupy high-dimensional latent spaces and can be distilled for a given protein in terms of an amalgamated representation that unites sequence, structure, biophysical and phylogenetic properties. Notably, DeepUrfold is structure-guided, versus being purely structure-based, and its architecture allows each trained model to learn protein features (structural and otherwise) that, in a sense, 'define' different superfamilies. Deploying DeepUrfold with CATH suggests a new, mostly-continuous view of fold space--a view that extends beyond simple 3D structural/geometric similarity, towards the realm of integrated sequence {leftrightarrow} structure {leftrightarrow} function properties. We find that such an approach can quantitatively represent and detect evolutionarily-remote relationships that evade existing methods.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529751

Standard Visium capture areas (6.5mm by 6.5mm) limit the survey of larger tissue structures, but combining overlapping images and associated gene expression data allow for more complex study designs. Current software can handle nested or partial image overlaps, but is designed for merging up to two capture areas, and cannot account for some technical scenarios related to capture area alignment. Results We generated Visium data from a postmortem human tissue sample such that two capture areas were partially overlapping and a third one was adjacent. We developed the R/Bioconductor package visiumStitched, which facilitates stitching the images together with Fiji (ImageJ), and constructing SpatialExperiment R objects with the stitched images and gene expression data. visiumStitched constructs an artificial hexagonal array grid which allows seamless downstream analyses such as spatially-aware clustering without discarding data from overlapping spots. Data stitched with visiumStitched can then be interactively visualized with spatialLIBD. Conclusions visiumStitched provides a simple, but flexible framework to handle various multi-capture area study design scenarios. Specifically, it resolves a data processing step without disrupting analysis workflows and without discarding data from overlapping spots. visiumStiched relies on affine transformations by Fiji, which have limitations and are less accurate when aligning against an atlas or other situations. visiumStiched provides an easy-to-use solution which expands possibilities for designing multi-capture area study designs.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529751

Still, processing and analysis of camera-trap data are extremely time-consuming. While algorithms for automated species classification are becoming more common, they have only served as supporting tools, limiting their true potential in being implemented in ecological analyses without human supervision. Here, we assessed the capability of two camera-trap based models to provide robust density estimates when image classification is carried out by machine learning algorithms.
C_LIO_LIWe simulated density estimation with Camera-Traps Distance Sampling (CT-DS) and Random Encounter Model (REM) under different scenarios of automated image classification. We then applied the two models to obtain density estimates of three focal species (roe deer Capreolus capreolus, red fox Vulpes vulpes, and Eurasian badger Meles meles) in a reserve in central Italy. Species detection and classification was carried out both by the user and machine learning algorithms (respectively, MegaDetector and Wildlife Insights), and all outputs were used to estimate density and ultimately compared.
C_LIO_LISimulation results suggested that the CT-DS model could provide robust density estimates even at poor algorithm performances (down to 50% of correctly classified images), while the REM model is more unpredictable and depends on multiple factors. Density estimates obtained from the MegaDetector output were highly consistent for both models with the manually labelled images. While Wildlife Insights performance differed greatly between species (recall: badger = 0.15; roe deer = 0.56; fox = 0.75), CT-DS estimates did not vary significantly; on the contrary, REM systematically overestimated density, with little overlap in standard errors.
C_LIO_LIWe conclude that CT-DS and REM models can be robust to the loss of images when machine learning algorithms are used to identify animals, with the CT-DS being an ideal candidate for applications in a fully unsupervised framework. We propose guidelines to evaluate when and how to integrate machine learning in the analysis of camera-trap data for density estimation, further strengthening the applicability of camera traps as a cost-effective method for density estimation in (spatially and temporally) extensive multi-species monitoring programs.

Biomolecular condensates have emerged as an attractive signaling substrate in this process, but the underlying mechanisms are not well-understood. Here, we probed the molecular basis of YAP signal integration through transcriptional condensates. Leveraging light-sheet single-molecule imaging and synthetic condensates, we demonstrate charge-mediated co-condensation of the transcriptional regulators YAP and Mediator into transcriptionally active condensates in stem cells. IDR sequence analysis and YAP protein engineering demonstrate that instead of the net charge, YAP signaling specificity is established through its negative charge patterning that interacts with positive charge blocks of Mediator. The mutual enhancement of YAP/Mediator co-condensation is counteracted by negative feedback from transcription, driving an adaptive transcriptional response that is well-suited for decoding dynamic inputs. Our work reveals a molecular framework for YAP condensate formation and sheds new light on the function of YAP condensates for emergent gene regulatory behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529751

However, the mechanism by which PRMT5 couples splicing to transcriptional output is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that a major function of PRMT5 activity is to promote chromatin escape of a novel, large class of mRNAs that we term Genomically Retained Incompletely Processed Polyadenylated Transcripts (GRIPPs). Using nascent and total transcriptomics, spike-in controlled fractionated cell transcriptomics, and total and fractionated cell proteomics, we show that PRMT5 inhibition and knockdown of the PRMT5 SNRP (Sm protein) adapter protein pICln (CLNS1A), but not type I PRMT inhibition, leads to gross detention of mRNA, SNRPB, and SNRPD3 proteins on chromatin. Compared to most transcripts, these chromatin-trapped polyadenylated RNA transcripts have more introns, are spliced slower, and are enriched in detained introns. Using a combination of PRMT5 inhibition and inducible isogenic wildtype and arginine-mutant SNRPB, we show that arginine methylation of these snRNPs is critical for mediating their homeostatic chromatin and RNA interactions. Overall, we conclude that a major role for PRMT5 is in controlling transcript processing and splicing completion to promote chromatin escape and subsequent nuclear export.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529751

There is evidence that distinct movements can be generated by changes in activity dynamics within a common pool of motoneurons, or by selectively engaging specific subsets of motoneurons in a task-dependent manner. However, in most cases we have an incomplete understanding of the patterns of motoneuron activity that generate distinct actions and how upstream premotor circuits select and assemble such motor programmes. In this study, we used two closely related but kinematically distinct types of saccadic eye movement in larval zebrafish as a model to examine circuit control of movement diversity. In contrast to the prevailing view of a final common pathway, we found that in oculomotor nucleus, distinct subsets of motoneurons were engaged for each saccade type. This type-specific recruitment was topographically organised and aligned with ultrastructural differences in motoneuron morphology and afferent synaptic innervation. Medially located motoneurons were active for both saccade types and circuit tracing revealed a type-agnostic premotor pathway that appears to control their recruitment. By contrast, a laterally located subset of motoneurons was specifically active for hunting-associated saccades and received premotor input from pretectal hunting command neurons. Our data support a model in which generalist and action-specific premotor pathways engage distinct subsets of motoneurons to elicit varied movements of the same body part that subserve distinct behavioural functions.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529751

Further, it harnesses machine learning empowered and smartphone interfaced colorimetric analysis without needing any specialized optical detector. The efficacy of the test is validated via community-adapted randomized field trials at underserved rural settings by frontline health workers, reporting sensitivity >96% and specificity > 98% in 1500 cohorts.

The class A beta-lactamase blaTEM-1 is often carried by co-amoxiclav-resistant pathogens, but exhibits high phenotypic heterogeneity, making genotype-phenotype predictions challenging. We present a curated dataset of n=377 E. coli isolates representing all 8 known phylogroups, where the only acquired beta-lactamase is blaTEM-1. For all isolates, we generate hybrid assemblies and co-amoxiclav MICs, and for a subset (n=67/377), blaTEM-1 qPCR expression data. First, we test whether certain E. coli lineages are intrinsically better or worse at expressing blaTEM-1, for example, due to lineage differences in regulatory systems, which are challenging to directly quantify. Using genotypic features of the isolates (blaTEM-1 promoter variants and copy number), we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model for blaTEM-1 expression that controls for phylogeny. We establish that blaTEM-1 expression intrinsically varies across the phylogeny, with some lineages (e.g. phylogroups B1 and C, ST12) better at expression than others (e.g. phylogroups E and F, ST372). Next, we test whether phylogenetic variation in expression influences the resistance of the isolates. With a second model, we use genotypic features (blaTEM-1 promoter variants, copy number, duplications; ampC promoter variants; efflux pump AcrF presence) to predict isolate MIC, again controlling for phylogeny. Lastly, we use a third model to demonstrate that the phylogenetic influence on blaTEM-1 expression causally drives the variation in co-amoxiclav MIC. This underscores the importance of incorporating phylogeny into genotype-phenotype predictions, and the study of resistance more generally.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529751

CD8 T cells are among the most abundant immune cell types in plaque, and conditions linked to their activation correlate with increased levels of cardiovascular disease. As lethal effectors of the immune response, CD8 T cell activation is suppressed at multiple levels. These checkpoints are critical in dampening autoimmune responses, and limiting damage in cardiovascular disease.

Endothelial cells are well known for their role in recruiting CD8 T and other hematopoietic cells to low and disturbed flow (LDF) arterial regions that develop plaque, but whether they locally influence CD8 effector functions is unclear. Here, we show that endothelial cells can actively suppress CD8 T cell responses in settings of chronic plaque inflammation, but that this behavior is governed by expression of the RNA-binding protein Embryonic Lethal, Abnormal Vision-Like 1 (Elavl1). In response to immune cell recruitment in plaque, the endothelium dynamically shifts splicing of pre-mRNA and their translation to enhance expression of immune-regulatory proteins including C1q and CD27. This program is immuno-suppressive, and limited by Elavl1. We show this by Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2-mediated deletion of Elavl1 (ECKO), and analysis of changes in translation by Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP). In ECKO mice, the translational shift in chronic inflammation is enhanced, leading to increased ribosomal association of C1q components and other critical regulators of immune response and resulting in a [~]70% reduction in plaque CD8 T cells. CITE-seq analysis of the remaining plaque T cells shows that they exhibit lower levels of markers associated with T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, survival, and activation. To understand whether the immunosuppressive mechanism occurred through failed CD8 recruitment or local modulation of T cell responses, we used a novel in vitro co-culture system to show that ECKO endothelial cells suppress CD8 T cell expansion--even in the presence of wild-type myeloid antigen-presenting cells, antigen-specific CD8 T cells, and antigen. Despite the induction of C1q mRNA by T cell co-culture in both wild-type and ECKO endothelial cells, we find C1q protein abundantly expressed only in co-culture with ECKO cells. Together, our data define a novel immune-suppressive transition in the endothelium, reminiscent of the transition of T cells to T-regs, and demonstrate the regulation of this process by Elavl1.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529752

We show that TADs are dynamic structures whose anchors are brought in proximity about once per hour and for 6-19 min (~16% of the time). TADs are continuously subjected to extrusion by multiple cohesin complexes, extruding loops at ~0.1 kb/s. Remarkably, despite strong differences of Hi-C patterns between the chromatin regions, their dynamics is consistent with the same density, residence time and speed of cohesin.

It serves as an adhesive substrate for cells and, hence, plays critical roles in health and disease. We have recently identified a novel ECM protein, SNED1, and have found that it is required for neural crest cell migration and craniofacial morphogenesis during development and in breast cancer, where it is necessary for the metastatic dissemination of tumor cells. Interestingly, both processes involve the dynamic remodeling of cell-ECM adhesions via cell surface receptors. Sequence analysis revealed that SNED1 contains two amino acid motifs, RGD and LDV, known to bind integrins, the largest class of ECM receptors. We thus sought to investigate the role of SNED1 in cell adhesion. Here, we report that SNED1 mediates breast cancer and neural crest cell adhesion via its RGD motif. We further demonstrate that cell adhesion to SNED1 is mediated by 5{beta}1integrin. These findings are a first step toward identifying the signaling pathways activated downstream of the SNED1-integrin interactions guiding craniofacial morphogenesis and breast cancer metastasis.

Previous studies support that pasteurization effectively inactivates avian influenza in milk and an earlier retail milk survey showed viral RNA, but no live virus could be detected in the dairy products tested. Because of the variety of products and processing methods in which milk is used, additional product testing was conducted to determine if HPAI viral RNA could be detected in retail dairy samples, and for positive quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) samples to be tested for presence of live virus. Revised protocols were developed to extract RNA from solid dairy products including cheese and butter. The solid dairy product was mechanically liquified with garnet and zirconium beads in a bead beater diluted 1 to 4 with BHI media. This pre-processing step was suitable in allowing efficient RNA extraction with standard methods. Trial studies were conducted with different cheese types with spiked in avian influenza virus to show that inoculation of the liquified cheese into embryonating chicken eggs was not toxic to the embryos and allowed virus replication. A total of 167 retail dairy samples, including a variety of cheeses, butter, ice cream, and fluid milk were collected as part of nationwide survey. A total of 17.4% (29/167) of the samples had detectable viral RNA by qRT-PCR targeting the matrix gene, but all samples were negative for live virus after testing with embryonating egg inoculation. The viral RNA was also evaluated by sequencing part of the hemagglutinin gene using a revised protocol optimized to deal with the fragmented viral RNA. The sequence analysis showed all viral RNA positive samples were highly similar to previously reported HPAI dairy cow isolates. Using the revised protocols, it was determined that HPAI viral RNA could be detected in a variety of dairy products, but existing pasteurizations methods effectively inactivate virus assuring consumer safety.","NA","medrxiv",1723500529752

Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1723500529752

MethodsThis study uses the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to investigate the potential relationship between vaccinations and the incidence of NMOSD, AE, and MOGAD. Potential risk factors, such as age, sex, type of vaccine, and previous history of autoimmune diseases, were examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

ResultsOur analysis included 161 cases: 72 NMOSD, 82 AE, and 7 MOGAD. The COVID-19 vaccine was implicated in 19/72 (26.3%) NMOSD, 43/82 (52.4%) of AE and 6/7 (85.7%) of MOGAD. The subacute temporal profile (OR 24.4, p = 0.004) and the presence of any comorbidity (OR 12.49, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with hospitalization for those with NMOSD. The subacute onset of symptoms and encephalopathy was statistically significant for hospitalization (OR 6.15, p = 0.048) and (OR 10.3, p = 0.005) respectively for patients with AE. Anti-NMDAR (N-methyl D-aspartate) antibodies were observed in 16/24 (66.7%) of AE. Treatment often involved high-dose corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

ConclusionsMost cases of vaccine induced NMOSD, AE, and MOGAD occurred secondary to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The subacute onset of symptoms and the presence of encephalopathy was most associated with hospitalization.","NA","medrxiv",1723500529752

Among challenges in diagnosing and treating aspergillosis are Aspergillus species identification, which can inform therapeutic choices, and detection of antifungal resistance. Increasing rates of triazole resistance have been reported for the most common species, Aspergillus fumigatus. Methods. A collection of clinical Aspergillus isolates cultured during 2014-2021, previously identified morphologically, were tested with the AsperGenius qPCR-kit for identification of A. fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus and the presence of a cyp51A mutation encoding azole resistance (TR34/L98H and Y121F/T289A); other species were identified with calmodulin sequencing. Results. Identification of the 312 isolates (224 patients) tested revealed 19 species in nine Aspergillus sections. Rare or cryptic species were identified in 48 isolates (44 patients). Thirty-one isolates had been assigned an incorrect species name when initially cultured. The TR34/L98H and Y121F/T289A mutations were not found in any of the 202 A. fumigatus isolates tested. Discussion. In this first study on clinical Aspergillus isolates in Iceland the proportion of cryptic and rare species was on par with findings from other countries. In contrast, unlike other studies we did not find the most common azole resistance-related mutations in A. fumigatus, possibly due to the absence of significant environmental antifungal pressure in the local agriculture.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529752

Disease progression and failure to respond to anthracycline based chemotherapy, standard first-line treatment, is associated with poor patient outcomes. To address this, we investigated the contribution of STS cancer stem cells (STS-CSCs) to doxorubicin resistance. We identified a positive correlation between CSC abundance and doxorubicin IC50 in resistant cell lines. We investigated if a common genetic signature across STS-CSCs could be targeted. Utilizing patient derived samples from five sarcoma subtypes we identified Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a member of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) responsible for H3K27 methylation as being enriched in the CSC population. EZH2 activity and a shared epigenetic profile was observed across subtypes. Targeting of EZH2 using Tazemetostat, an FDA approved inhibitor specifically ablated the STS-CSC population. Treatment of doxorubicin resistant cell lines with tazemetostat resulted in a decrease in the STS-CSC population. Further, co-treatment was not only synergistic in the parent cell lines, but restored chemosensitivity in doxorubicin resistant lines. These data confirm the presence of shared genetic programs across distinct subtypes of CSC-STS that can be therapeutically targeted.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529752

CDAN1 interacts with CDIN1 and the paralogous histone H3-H4 chaperones ASF1A (Anti-Silencing Function 1A) and ASF1B, but its function remains unclear. Here, we biochemically and structurally analyze CDAN1 complexes. We find that CDAN1 dimerizes and assembles into cytosolic complexes with CDIN1 and multiple copies of ASF1A/B. Single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of CDAN1 complexes identify interactions with ASF1 mediated by two CDAN1 B-domains commonly found in ASF1 binding partners and two helices that mimic histone H3 binding. We additionally observe that one CDAN1 can recruit two ASF1 molecules and that ASF1A and ASF1B have different requirements for CDAN1 engagement. Our findings explain how CDAN1 sequesters and inhibits the chaperone function of ASF1A/B and provide new molecular-level insights into this enigmatic complex.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529752

We identified biomarkers of T1D by combining plasma cis and trans protein QTLs (pQTLs) for 2,922 proteins in the UK Biobank with a T1D genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 157k samples. T1D risk variants at over 20% of known loci colocalized with cis or trans pQTLs, and distinct sets of T1D loci colocalized with immune, pancreatic secretion, or gut-related proteins. We identified 23 proteins with evidence for a causal role in using pQTLs as genetic instruments in Mendelian Randomization which included multiple sensitivity analyses. Proteins increasing T1D risk were involved in immune processes (e.g. HLA-DRA) and, more surprisingly, T1D protective proteins were enriched in pancreatic secretions (e.g. CPA1), cholesterol metabolism (e.g. APOA1), and gut homeostasis. Genetic variants associated with plasma levels of T1D-protective pancreatic enzymes such as CPA1 were enriched in cis-regulatory elements in pancreatic exocrine and gut enteroendocrine cells, and the protective effects of CPA1 and other enzymes on T1D were consistent when using instruments specific to acinar cells. Finally, pancreatic enzymes had decreased acinar expression in T1D, including CPA1 which was altered prior to onset. Together, these results reveal causal biomarkers and highlight processes in the exocrine pancreas, immune system, and gut that modulate T1D risk.","NA","medrxiv",1723500529752

Identifying and controlling dose-dependent transgenes require tools for precisely titrating expression. To this end, we developed a highly modular, extensible framework called DIAL for building editable promoters that allow for fine-scale, heritable changes in transgene expression. Using DIAL, we increase expression by recombinase-mediated excision of spacers between the binding sites of a synthetic zinc finger transcription factor and the core promoter. By nesting varying numbers and lengths of spacers, DIAL generates a tunable range of unimodal setpoints from a single promoter. Through small-molecule control of transcription factors and recombinases, DIAL supports temporally defined, user-guided control of transgene expression that is extensible to additional transcription factors. Lentiviral delivery of DIAL generates multiple setpoints in primary cells and iPSCs. As promoter editing generates stable states, DIAL setpoints are heritable, facilitating mapping of transgene levels to phenotypes. The DIAL framework opens new opportunities for tailoring transgene expression and improving the predictability and performance of gene circuits across diverse applications.

HighlightsPromoter editing generates unimodal setpoints from a single synthetic promoter

DIAL setpoints are tuned by the length of an excisable spacer within the promoter

DIAL setpoints are uniform and robust to varying levels of the transcription factor

This study investigates virological factors contributing to the reemergence of Oropouche fever in Brazil between 2023 and 2024.

MethodsIn this study, we combined OROV genomic, molecular, and serological data from Brazil from 1 January 2015 to 29 June 2024, along with in vitro and in vivo characterization. Molecular screening data included 93 patients with febrile illness between January 2023 and February 2024 from the Amazonas State. Genomic data comprised two genomic OROV sequences from patients. Serological data were obtained from neutralizing antibody tests comparing the prototype OROV strain BeAn 19991 and the 2024 epidemic strain. Epidemiological data included aggregated cases reported to the Brazilian Ministry of Health from 1 January 2014 to 29 June 2024.

FindingsIn 2024, autochthonous OROV infections were detected in previously non-endemic areas across all five Brazilian regions. Cases were reported in 19 of 27 federal units, with 83.2% (6,895 of 8,284) of infections in Northern Brazil and a nearly 200-fold increase in incidence compared to reported cases over the last decade. We detected OROV RNA in 10.8% (10 of 93) of patients with febrile illness between December 2023 and May 2024 in Amazonas. We demonstrate that the 2023-2024 epidemic was caused by a novel OROV reassortant that replicated approximately 100-fold higher titers in mammalian cells compared to the prototype strain. The 2023-2024 OROV reassortant displayed plaques earlier than the prototype, produced 1.7 times more plaques, and plaque sizes were 2.5 larger compared to the prototype. Furthermore, serum collected in 2016 from previously OROV-infected individuals showed at least a 32-fold reduction in neutralizing capacity against the reassortment strain compared to the prototype.

InterpretationThese findings provide a comprehensive assessment of Oropouche fever in Brazil and contribute to a better understanding of the 2023-2024 OROV reemergence. The recent increased incidence may be related to a higher replication efficiency of a new reassortant virus that also evades previous immunity.","NA","medrxiv",1723500529752

Here, we sequenced and analyzed 382 full-length OROV genomes from human samples collected between 2022 and 2024 from all four states, aiming to trace the origin and genetic evolution of OROV leading to the current outbreak. Genomic analyses revealed that the recent upsurge of OROV cases in the Brazilian Amazon region coincides with the emergence of a novel reassortant viral lineage containing the M segment of viruses detected in the eastern Amazon region from 2009 to 2018 and the L and S segments of viruses detected in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador from 2008 to 2021. The novel reassortant OROV lineage likely emerged in the Central region of the AM state between 2010 and 2014 and displayed a long-range silent dispersion during the second half of the 2010s. The 2022-2024 OROV epidemic was spatially segregated into three major subpopulations located in RR, AMACRO (a bordering region between AC, RO, and AM-Southern region), and AM-Central (which includes the Amazonas capital, Manaus) regions. The peak of OROV transmissions in all regions occurred during the rainy season in the Amazon basin. Furthermore, our phylodynamics reconstructions showed that OROV spread was driven mainly by short-range (< 2 km) movements, with an average dispersal rate [&le;] 1.2 km/day, consistent with the pattern of an active flight of infected vectors. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion (22%) of long-range (> 10 km) OROV migrations were also detected, consistent with viral dispersion via human activities. Our data provides an unprecedented view of the real-time spread and evolution of a neglected emergent human pathogen. Moreover, our results emphasize the need for widespread, long-term genomic surveillance to better understand the real burden of OROV within and beyond the Amazon region.","NA","medrxiv",1723500529752

Specifically, we enter n variations of k pattern classes (n*k patterns) onto a cortex-like balanced inhibitory-excitatory network with heterogeneous neurons, and let the pattern spread within the recurrent network. We show that we can identify high mutual-information (MI) neurons as major information-bearing elements within each pattern representation. We employ a simple one-shot adaptive (learning) process focusing on high MI neurons and inhibition. Such  localist plasticity has high efficiency, because it requires only few adaptations for each pattern. Specifically, we store k=10 patterns of size s=400 in a 1000/1200 neuron network. We stimulate high MI neurons and in this way recall patterns, such that the whole network represents this pattern. We assess the quality of the representation (a) before learning, when entering the pattern into a naive network and (b) after learning, on the adapted network, during recall. The recalled patterns could be easily recognized by a trained classifier. The pattern  unfolds over the recurrent network with high similarity, albeit compressed, with respect to the original input pattern. We discuss the distribution of neuron properties in the network, and find that an initial Gaussian or uniform distribution changes into a more heavy-tailed, lognormal distribution during the adaptation process. The remarkable result is that we are able to achieve reliable pattern recall by stimulating only high information neurons.

Here, we introduce CarboTag, a modular toolbox for live functional imaging of plant walls. CarboTag relies on a small molecular motif, a pyridine boronic acid, that targets its cargo to the cell wall, is non-toxic and ensures rapid tissue permeation. We designed a suite of cell wall imaging probes based on CarboTag in any desired color for multiplexing. Moreover, we created new functional reporters for live quantitative imaging of key cell wall features: network porosity, cell wall pH and the presence of reactive oxygen species. CarboTag opens the way to dynamical and quantitative mapping of cell wall responses at subcellular resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529752

The earwax showed antibacterial activity against both isolates (except the 20% v/v for Staphylococcus aureus) at all concentrations used with antibacterial activity directly proportional to earwax concentration and a better antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (zone of inhibition 20mm) aureus than Escherichia coli. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out on the 10(41.7%) and 8(33.3%) presumptive isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli respectively based on Kirby Bauer method. Highest rate of susceptibilities of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates to antibiotics were observed in Erythromycin (100%), while for Escherichia coli were observed in Erythromycin and Levofloxacin (100%). Meanwhile, highest rate of resistant to Staphylococcus aureus isolates were observed in Gentamicin (100%) while for Escherichia coli was observed in Amoxicillin (100%). This study shows that earwax plays a critical role in the fight against infectious microorganisms as some of the antibiotics.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529752

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529752

Here we show that language models trained on tokens generated by evolution can act as evolutionary simulators to generate functional proteins that are far away from known proteins. We present ESM3, a frontier multimodal generative language model that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to biological alignment. We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins with a chain of thought. Among the generations that we synthesized, we found a bright fluorescent protein at far distance (58% identity) from known fluorescent proteins. Similarly distant natural fluorescent proteins are separated by over five hundred million years of evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529752

Yet little is known about factors contributing to long-term lack of intimate relationships. We investigated phenotypic and genetic correlates of never having had sex in [~]400,000 UK residents aged 39 to 73 and [~]13,500 Australian residents aged 18 to 89. The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g. upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% and 14% of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56. Polygenic scores predicted a range of related outcomes in the Australian dataset. Our findings uncover multifaceted correlates of human intimacy of evolutionary significance.","NA","medrxiv",1723500529752

However, this notion has recently been challenged. Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529752

This study compared leading commercial blood tests for amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.

MethodsPlasma samples from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were assayed with AD blood tests from C2N Diagnostics, Fujirebio Diagnostics, ALZPath, Janssen, Roche Diagnostics, and Quanterix. Outcomes measures were amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, cortical thickness, and dementia severity. Logistic regression models assessed the classification accuracies of individual or combined plasma biomarkers for binarized outcomes, and Spearman correlations evaluated continuous relationships between individual plasma biomarkers and continuous outcomes.

ResultsMeasures of plasma p-tau217, either individually or in combination with other plasma biomarkers, had the strongest relationships with all AD outcomes.

DiscussionThis study identified the plasma biomarker analytes and assays that most accurately classified amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1723500529752

However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role. Our data show that the clonal dynamics of blood are consistent with a set of remarkably simple evolutionary rules which strike a balance between chance and determinism.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529752

Here, we estimate biological age of 11 organs from 44,526 individuals in the UK Biobank using an antibody-based proteomics platform to model disease and mortality risk. Organ age estimates are associated with future onset of heart failure (heart age HR=1.83), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (lung age HR=1.39), type II diabetes (kidney age HR=1.58), and Alzheimers disease (brain age HR=1.81) and sensitive to lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise, hormone replacement therapy, or supplements. Remarkably, the accrual of aged organs progressively increases mortality risk while a youthful brain and immune system are uniquely associated with disease-free longevity. These findings support the use of plasma proteins for monitoring organ health and the efficacy of drugs targeting organ aging disease.","NA","biorxiv",1723500529752
