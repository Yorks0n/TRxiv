A subset meets diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Several studies have reported persistence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins or RNA in serum or tissues of both recovered individuals and PCS patients. In this exploratory study, we investigated whether serum spike protein is associated with PCS and whether it correlates with symptom severity and laboratory biomarkers. We analyzed serum spike protein levels in 121 PCS patients following mild-to-moderate COVID 19, 72 of whom met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS (post-COVID ME/CFS, pcMECFS). Pre-pandemic seronegative healthy controls (ppHC, n = 32) and post-COVID recovered healthy controls (pcHC, n = 37) after SARS-CoV-2 infection were also included in the study. We found persistent serum SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a subset of pcHC (11 %), PCS non-ME/CFS patients (2 %), and pcMECFS patients (14 %). There was no significant association with disease severity, symptoms, or laboratory markers. The spike protein concentration was independent of the time since last spike exposure (infection or vaccination). In five spike-positive out of a total of 22 patients who underwent immunoglobulin depletion via immunoadsorption (IA), spike protein was reduced or completely removed after treatment, indicating binding to immunoglobulins. In summary, our study identified serum spike protein in a subset of patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection without evidence for a role in the pathogenesis of PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1731535771561

However, most scientists don't have access to experts from multiple fields. Fortunately, large language models (LLMs) have recently shown an impressive ability to aid researchers across diverse domains by answering scientific questions. Here, we expand the capabilities of LLMs for science by introducing the Virtual Lab, an AI-human research collaboration to perform sophisticated, interdisciplinary science research. The Virtual Lab consists of an LLM principal investigator agent guiding a team of LLM agents with different scientific backgrounds (e.g., a chemist agent, a computer scientist agent, a critic agent), with a human researcher providing high-level feedback. We design the Virtual Lab to conduct scientific research through a series of team meetings, where all the agents discuss a scientific agenda, and individual meetings, where an agent accomplishes a specific task. We demonstrate the power of the Virtual Lab by applying it to design nanobody binders to recent variants of SARS-CoV-2, which is a challenging, open-ended research problem that requires reasoning across diverse fields from biology to computer science. The Virtual Lab creates a novel computational nanobody design pipeline that incorporates ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta and designs 92 new nanobodies. Experimental validation of those designs reveals a range of functional nanobodies with promising binding profiles across SARS-CoV-2 variants. In particular, two new nanobodies exhibit improved binding to the recent JN.1 or KP.3 variants of SARS-CoV-2 while maintaining strong binding to the ancestral viral spike protein, suggesting exciting candidates for further investigation. This demonstrates the ability of the Virtual Lab to rapidly make impactful, real-world scientific discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

Most organisms have a life cycle with unicellular bottlenecks during reproduction. However, some organisms like plants, fungi, or colonial animals can grow indefinitely, changing the manner in which mutations spread throughout both the individual and the population. Furthermore, clonally reproducing organisms may also achieve exceedingly long lifespans, making somatic mutation an important mechanism of creating heritable variation for Darwinian evolution by natural selection. Yet, little is known about intra-organism mutation rates and evolutionary trajectories in long-lived species. Here, we study the Pando aspen clone, the largest known quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) clone founded by a single seedling and thought to be one of the oldest studied organisms. Aspen reproduce vegetatively via new root-borne stems forming clonal patches, sometimes spanning several hectares. To study the evolutionary history of the Pando clone, we collected and sequenced over 500 samples from Pando and neighboring clones, as well as from various tissue types within Pando, including leaves, roots, and bark. We applied a series of filters to distinguish somatic mutations from the pool of both somatic and germline mutations, incorporating a technical replicate sequencing approach to account for uncertainty in somatic mutation detection. Despite root spreading being spatially constrained, we observed only a modest positive correlation between genetic and spatial distance, suggesting the presence of a mechanism preventing the accumulation and spread of mutations across units. Phylogenetic models estimate the age of the clone to between ~16,000-80,000 years. This age is generally corroborated by the near-continuous presence of aspen pollen in a lake sediment record collected from Fish Lake near Pando. Overall, this work enhances understanding of mutation accumulation and dispersal within and between ramets of long-lived, clonally-reproducing organisms.

Significance StatementThis study enhances our understanding of evolutionary processes in long-lived clonal organisms by investigating somatic mutation accumulation and dispersal patterns within the iconic Pando aspen clone. The authors estimated the clone to be between 10,000 and 80,000 years old and uncovered a modest spatial genetic structure in the 42.6-hectare clone, suggesting localized mutation build-up rather than dispersal along tissue lineages. This work sheds light on an ancient organism and how plants may evolve to preserve genetic integrity in meristems fueling indefinite growth, with implications for our comprehension of adaptive strategies in long-lived perennials.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty. We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit. Based on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still undeniably demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1731535771561

With the increased use of exome sequencing in the clinical setting, there is opportunity to identify patients who have a high chance of having elevated Lp(a) and are therefore at risk of ASCVD. However, accurate genetic predictors of Lp(a) are challenging to design. In addition to single nucleotide variants (SNVs), which are often summarized as a combined genetic risk score, Lp(a) levels are significantly impacted by copy number variation in repeats of the kringle IV subtype 2 domain (KIV-2), which are challenging to quantify. KIV-2 copy numbers are highly variable across populations, and understanding their impact on Lp(a) levels is important to creating an equitable and reliable genetic predictor of Lp(a)-driven cardiovascular risk for all individuals.

MethodsWe develop a novel method to quantify individuals total number of KIV-2 repeats from exome data, validate this quantification against measured Lp(a) levels, and then use this method, combined with a SNV-based genetic risk score, to genotype an entire all-comers cohort of individuals from health systems across the United States (Helix Research Network; N = 76,147) for an estimated Lp(a) level.

ResultsOur combined genotyping strategy improved prediction of those with clinically-elevated Lp(a) measurements across the genetically diverse cohort, especially for individuals not genetically similar to European reference populations, where GRS-based estimates fall short (r2= 0.04 for GRS, r2 = 0.34 KIV2+GRS in non-European). Importantly, high combined genetic risk of high Lp(a) genotypes are significantly associated with earlier onset and increased incidence in ASCVD, compared to average and low combined genetic risk genotypes in a retrospective analysis of atherosclerotic diagnoses derived from electronic health records (EHRs). This holds in the cohort at large (CAD HRs=1.29, 1.58), in the European subcohort (HRs=1.30,1.61) as well as at trending levels of significance in individuals not genetically similar to Europeans (HRs=1.22,1.31). In addition, high combined genetic risk for high Lp(a) genotypes are at least 2-fold enriched amongst individuals with ASCVD diagnosis despite a lack of EHR-based evidence of traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

ConclusionsOur study demonstrates that genetically predicted Lp(a) levels, incorporating both SNV and our novel KIV-2 repeat estimate, may be a practical method to predict clinically elevated Lp(a). Supporting this, individuals with high combined genetic risk for high Lp(a) have an increased risk for ASCVD, as evidenced across data from seven US-based health systems.","NA","medrxiv",1731535771561

While each omics profile assists characterization of specific molecular components relevant for the studied phenotype, their joint evaluation can offer deeper insights into the overall mechanistic functioning of biological systems. Here, we introduce an approach where starting from representative traits (e.g., differentially expressed elements) obtained for each omics profile, we construct and analyze joint interaction networks. The resulting networks rely on the existing knowledge of confident interactions among biological entities. We use these maps to identify and describe central elements, which connect multiple entities characteristic for the studied phenotypes and we leverage MONET network decomposition tool in order to highlight functionally connected network modules. In order to enable broad usage of this approach, we developed the NOODAI software platform, which enables integrative omics analysis through a user-friendly interface.

Here we present MethylGPT, a transformer-based foundation model trained on 226,555 (154,063 after QC and deduplication) human methylation profiles spanning diverse tissue types from 5,281 datasets, curated 49,156 CpG sites, and 7.6 billion training tokens. MethylGPT learns biologically meaningful representations of CpG sites, capturing both local genomic context and higher-order chromosomal features without external supervision. The model demonstrates robust methylation value prediction (Pearson R=0.929) and maintains stable performance in downstream tasks with up to 70% missing data. Applied to age prediction across multiple tissue types, MethylGPT achieves superior accuracy compared to existing methods. Analysis of the models attention patterns reveals distinct methylation signatures between young and old samples, with differential enrichment of developmental and aging-associated pathways. When finetuned to mortality and disease prediction across 60 major conditions using 18,859 samples from Generation Scotland, MethylGPT achieves robust predictive performance and enables systematic evaluation of intervention effects on disease risks, demonstrating potential for clinical applications.

Accumulated research evidence suggests that ME/CFS and Long COVID exhibit overlapping metabolic symptoms, indicating potential shared metabolic dysfunctions. This study aims to systematically explore shared metabolic disturbances in the muscle tissue of patients. Utilizing genome-wide metabolic modeling, we identified key metabolic irregularities in the muscle of patients with ME/CFS, notably the downregulation of the alanine and aspartate metabolism pathway and the arginine and proline metabolism pathway. Further, in silico knockout analyses suggested that supplementation with aspartate (ASP) or asparagine (ASN) could potentially ameliorate these metabolic deficiencies. In addition, assessments of metabolomic levels in Long COVID patients also showed the significant downregulation of ASP during post-exertional malaise (PEM) in both muscle and blood. Consequently, we propose that a combination of l-ornithine and l-aspartate (LOLA) is a potential candidate to alleviate metabolic symptoms in ME/CFS and Long COVID for future clinical trials.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

To analyze subcellular transcriptomes, multiple proximity-based techniques have been developed in which RNAs near a localized bait protein are specifically labeled, facilitating their biotinylation and purification. However, these complex methods are often laborious and require expensive enrichment reagents. To streamline the analysis of localized RNA populations, we developed Oxidation-Induced Nucleotide Conversion sequencing (OINC-seq). In OINC-seq, RNAs near a genetically encoded, localized bait protein are specifically oxidized in a photo-controllable manner. These oxidation events are then directly detected and quantified using high-throughput sequencing and our software package, PIGPEN, without the need for biotin-mediated enrichment. We demonstrate that OINC-seq can induce and quantify RNA oxidation with high specificity in a dose- and light-dependent manner. We further show the spatial specificity of OINC-seq by using it to quantify subcellular transcriptomes associated with the cytoplasm, ER, nucleus, and the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria. Finally, using transgenic zebrafish, we demonstrate that OINC-seq allows proximity-mediated RNA labeling in live animals.

One prominent approach to forecasting such long-run outcomes is the successor representation (SR), which predicts future states aggregated over multiple timesteps. Although much behavioral and neural evidence suggests that people and animals use such a representation, it remains unknown how they acquire it. It has frequently been assumed to be learned by temporal difference bootstrapping (SR-TD(0)), but this assumption has largely not been empirically tested or compared to alternatives including eligibility traces (SR-TD({lambda} > 0)). Here we address this gap by leveraging trial-by-trial reaction times in graph sequence learning tasks, which are favorable for studying learning dynamics because the long horizons in these studies differentiate the transient update dynamics of different learning rules. We examined the behavior of SR-TD({lambda}) on a probabilistic graph learning task alongside a number of alternatives, and found that behavior was best explained by a hybrid model which learned via SR-TD({lambda}) alongside an additional zeroth-order predictive model. The relatively large {lambda} we estimate indicates a predominant role of eligibility trace mechanisms over the bootstrap-based chaining typically assumed. Our results provide insight into how humans learn predictive representations, and demonstrate that people simultaneously learn the SR alongside lower-order predictions.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

Here, we present the Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine Pretrained Transformer (CpGPT), a novel foundation model pretrained on over 1,500 DNA methylation datasets encompassing over 100,000 samples from diverse tissues and conditions. CpGPT leverages an improved transformer architecture to learn comprehensive representations of methylation patterns, allowing it to impute and reconstruct genome-wide methylation profiles from limited input data. By capturing sequence, positional, and epigenetic contexts, CpGPT outperforms specialized models when finetuned for aging-related tasks, including chronological age prediction, mortality risk, and morbidity assessments. The model is highly adaptable across different methylation platforms and tissue types.

By utilizing quantitative and qualitative models, we discovered that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion in viral-infected cells. Through cytokine screening, we identified that interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}), a key mediator of inflammation, inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains. Mechanistically, IL-1{beta} activates RhoA/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway, which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at the cell-cell junctions, thus prevents syncytia formation. Notably, in vivo infection experiments in mice confirms that IL-1{beta} significantly restricted SARS-CoV-2 spreading in the lung epithelia. Together, by revealing the function and underlying mechanism of IL-1{beta} on SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion, our study highlights an unprecedented antiviral function for cytokines during viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

To interrogate clonal evolution, we performed simultaneous single cell molecular profiling and immunophenotyping on 43 samples from 32 NPM1-mutant AML patients at different stages of disease. Here we show that diagnosis and relapsed AML samples display similar clonal architecture patterns, but signaling mutations can drive increased clonal diversity specifically at relapse. We uncovered unique genotype-immunophenotype relationships regardless of disease state, suggesting leukemic lineage trajectories can be hard-wired by the mutations present.

To date, the United States Centers for Disease Control reports that there have been 27 humans infected with H5N1 in 2024 (2). The broader potential impact on human health remains unclear. In this study, we computationally model 1,804 protein complexes consisting of various H5 isolates from 1959 to 2024 against 11 hemagglutinin domain 1 (HA1)-neutralizing antibodies. This study shows a trend of weakening binding affinity of existing antibodies against H5 isolates over time, indicating that the H5N1 virus is evolving immune escape of our medical defenses. We also found that based on the wide variety of host species and geographic locations in which H5N1 was observed to have been transmitted from birds to mammals, there is not a single central reservoir host species or location associated with H5N1s spread. These results indicate that the virus has potential to move from epidemic to pandemic status in the near future. This study illustrates the value of high-performance computing to rapidly model protein-protein interactions and viral genomic sequence data at-scale for functional insights into medical preparedness.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPrevious studies have shown cases of avian influenza transmissions to mammals that are increasing in frequency, which is of concern to human health. Since 1997, nearly a thousand H5N1 cases have been reported in humans with a 52% fatality rate. Previous analyses have indicated specific mutations on the hemagglutinin protein that allow for this ""host jumping"" between birds and mammals (3). There are also existing evidence of recent viral strains with reduced neutralization to sera (4).

Added value of this studyThis study provides a comprehensive look at the mutational space of hemagglutinin of H5N1 influenza and presents computational predictions of the binding between various HA1-neutralizing antibodies derived from infected vaccinated patients and humanized mice and 1,804 representative H5 HA1 proteins. These analyses show a weakening trend of existing antibodies. We also confirm that the mutations found in other studies that enable zoonosis also affect binding affinities of the antibodies tested. Furthermore, through phylogenetic analyses, we quantify the avian-to-mammalian transmissions from 1959 to 2024 and show a persistent circulation of isolates between North America and Europe.

Taken together, the continuous transmission of H5N1 from birds to mammals and the increase in immuno-evasive HA strains in mammals sampled over time suggest that antigenic drift is a source of spillover risk.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings indicate that the worsening in antibody binding, along with the increase in of avian-to-mammalian H5N1 influenza transmissions are risks to public health.

Through the findings of previous studies along with the predictions reported in this study, we can now monitor specific mutations of interest, quantified by their potential impact on antibody evasion, and inform public health monitoring of circulating isolates in 2024 and beyond.

In addition, these findings may help to guide future vaccine and therapeutic development in the fight against H5N1 influenza infections in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

The genome also encodes hundreds of putative and poorly characterized transcription factors (TFs). We determined genomic binding locations of 166 uncharacterized human TFs in living cells. Nearly half of them associated strongly with known regulatory regions such as promoters and enhancers, often at conserved motif matches and co-localizing with each other. Surprisingly, the other half often associated with genomic dark matter, at largely unique sites, via intrinsic sequence recognition. Dozens of these, which we term ""Dark TFs"", mainly bind within regions of closed chromatin. Dark TF binding sites are enriched for transposable elements, and are rarely under purifying selection. Some Dark TFs are KZNFs, which contain the repressive KRAB domain, but many are not: the Dark TFs also include known or potential pioneer TFs. Compiled literature information supports that the Dark TFs exert diverse functions ranging from early development to tumor suppression. Thus, our results sheds light on a large fraction of previously uncharacterized human TFs and their unappreciated activities within the dark matter genome.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

However, the late onset of diseases suggests that compensatory quality control mechanisms may be engaged to delay the deleterious effects induced by compromised autophagy. Neurons expressing common familial Parkinsons disease (PD)-associated mutations in LRRK2 kinase exhibit defective autophagy. Here, we demonstrate that both primary murine neurons and human iPSC-derived neurons harboring pathogenic LRRK2 upregulate the secretion of extracellular vesicles. We used unbiased proteomics to characterize the secretome of LRRK2G2019S neurons and found that autophagic cargos including mitochondrial proteins were enriched. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that autophagosomes are rerouted toward secretion when cell-autonomous degradation is compromised, likely to mediate clearance of undegraded cellular waste. Immunoblotting confirmed the release of autophagic cargos and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that secretory autophagy was upregulated in LRRK2G2019S neurons. We also found that LRRK2G2019S neurons upregulate the release of exosomes containing miRNAs. Live-cell imaging confirmed that this upregulation of exosomal release was dependent on hyperactive LRRK2 activity, while pharmacological experiments indicate that this release staves off apoptosis. Finally, we show that markers of both vesicle populations are upregulated in plasma from mice expressing pathogenic LRRK2. In sum, we find that neurons expressing pathogenic LRRK2 upregulate the compensatory release of secreted autophagosomes and exosomes, to mediate waste disposal and transcellular communication, respectively. We propose that this increased secretion contributes to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, delaying neurodegenerative disease progression over the short term while potentially contributing to increased neuroinflammation over the longer term.

SIGNIFICANCEA hallmark feature of many neurodegenerative diseases is autophagy dysfunction, resulting in the accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles that is detrimental to neuronal health. The late onset of neurodegenerative diseases, however, suggests alternative quality control mechanisms may delay neuronal degeneration. Here, we demonstrate that neurons expressing a Parkinsons Disease-causing mutation upregulate the release of two extracellular vesicle populations. First, we observe the increased expulsion of secreted autophagosomes to mediate cellular waste disposal. Second, we observe the increased release of exosomes, likely to facilitate transcellular communication. Thus, we propose that increases in secretory autophagy and exosome release are a homeostatic response in neurons undergoing chronic stress.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

Here we adopt a magnetogenetic approach that allows direct manipulation of Rab25 positioning to show that localisation to the cell periphery drives the formation of F-actin protrusions. We demonstrate that endogenous Rab25 vesicles coordinate the positioning of key cargoes, including the actin regulator FMNL1 and integrin beta1, with the activation of Rho GTPases at the plasma membrane to generate and maintain F-actin rich filopodial protrusions and promote cancer cell invasive migration in 3D matrix.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

Moreover, multiple zoonotic infections in humans have been reported. Importantly, HPAI H5N1 viruses with genetic markers of adaptation to mammals have been detected. Together with HPAI H5N1, avian influenza viruses H7N9 (high and low pathogenic) stand out due to their high mortality rates in humans. This raises the question of how prepared we are serologically and whether seasonal vaccines are capable of inducing protective immunity against these influenza subtypes. An observational study was conducted in which sera from people born between years 1925-1967, 1968-1977, and 1978-1997 were collected before or after 28 days or 6 months post-vaccination with an inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine. Then, haemagglutination inhibition, viral neutralization, and immunoassays were performed to assess the basal protective immunity of the population as well as the ability of seasonal influenza vaccines to induce protective responses. Our results indicate that subtype-specific serological protection against H5N1 and H7N9 in the representative Spanish population evaluated was limited or nonexistent. However, seasonal vaccination was able to increase the antibody titers to protective levels in a moderate percentage of people, probably due to cross-reactive responses. These findings demonstrate the importance of vaccination and suggest that seasonal influenza vaccines could be used as a first line of defense against an eventual pandemic caused by avian influenza viruses, to be followed immediately by the use of more specific pandemic vaccines.

ImportanceInfluenza A viruses (IAV) can infect and replicate in multiple mammalian and avian species. Avian influenza virus (AIV) is a highly contagious viral disease that occurs primarily in poultry and wild water birds. Due to the lack of population immunity in humans and ongoing evolution of AIV, there is a continuing risk that new IAV could emerge and rapidly spread worldwide causing a pandemic, if the ability to transmit efficiently among humans was gained. The aim of this study is to analyze the basal protection and presence of antibodies against IAV H5N1, and H7N9 subtypes in the population from different ages. Moreover, we have evaluated the h humoral response after immunization with a seasonal influenza vaccine. This study is strategically important to evaluate the level of population immunity that is a major factor when assessing the impact that an emerging IAV strain would have, and the role of seasonal vaccines to mitigate the effects of a pandemic.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

MethodsWe identified which participants with long COVID also met the Institute of Medicine (IOM) or the 2003 Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC) for ME/CFS at approximately 6-8 months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection in two cohorts: (1) the JHU COVID Recovery cohort, which enrolled participants within 4 weeks of infection and (2) the Long-term Impact of Infection with Novel Coronavirus (LIINC) cohort, which enriched for participants with long COVID. Neither study administered ME/CFS-specific surveys, so available data elements were mapped onto each ME/CFS diagnostic criteria.

ResultsOf 97 JHU participants with long COVID, 5 met IOM criteria and 2 met CCC criteria. Of 281 LIINC participants with long COVID, 51 met the IOM criteria and 29 met the CCC criteria. In LIINC, participants with long COVID meeting ME/CFS criteria were more likely to be female and report a greater number of post-COVID symptoms (p<0.001).

We discovered that bacteria can overcome this limitation by acquiring nutrients through lysing neighboring cells via contact-dependent antagonism. Using single-cell live imaging and isotopic markers, we found that during starvation the type VI secretion system, which transfers toxins into neighboring cells, increases growth by enabling the uptake of nutrients from lysing cells. In a spatially structured environment, the gradual lysis of just a few target cells allows for the growth of a new antagonist cell. Genomic adaptations in antagonists, characterized by a reduced metabolic gene repertoire, and the prevalence of the type VI secretion system in natural environments, such as global oceans and soils, suggest that bacterial antagonism has the potential to substantially contribute to nutrient transfer within microbial communities across various ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

However, the molecular changes leading to exaptations remain unclear. Here, we investigated the potential of bacterial transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) to evolve exaptively, examining three global transcription factors (TFs) from Escherichia coli: CRP, Fis, and IHF. Using a massively parallel reporter assay, we mapped three combinatorially complete adaptive landscapes, encompassing all intermediate sequences between three pairs of strong TFBSs for each TF. Our results revealed that these landscapes are smooth and navigable, with a monotonic relationship between mutations and their impact on gene regulation. Starting from a strong TFBS for one of our TFs, Darwinian evolution can create a strong TFBS for another TF through a small number of individually adaptive mutations. Notably, most intermediate genotypes are prone to transcriptional crosstalk - gene regulation mediated by both TFs. Because our landscapes are smooth, Darwinian evolution can also easily create TFBSs that show such crosstalk whenever it is adaptive. Our study presents the first in vivo evidence that new TFBSs can evolve exaptively through multiple small and adaptive mutational steps. It also highlights the importance of regulatory crosstalk for the diversification of bacterial gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

To better understand the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, it is essential to determine whether it is primary or secondary (or recall). The analysis of highly granular immunological variable trajectories of a homogeneous cohort of patients receiving standardised medical care should discern between primary and secondary responses.

MethodsThis is a prospective cohort study of 191 SARS-CoV-2 infection cases and 44 healthy controls from the second wave of COVID-19 in the Barcelona area. The study stratified patients by severity and analysed the trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and multiple immune variables for features associated with primary and recall immune responses.

FindingsIsotype-specific antibody trajectories to SARS-CoV-2 proteins revealed a pattern of recall response in 94{middle dot}2% of cases. In these cases, the detailed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cells, cTfh high-resolution subsets, and cytokines were consistent with a secondary response. The transcriptomic data indicated that this cohort is strictly comparable to contemporary cohorts.

ConclusionsIn most cases, the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is a recall response. This opens the possibility that most COVID-19 cases are subjected to immune imprinting by endemic coronavirus, which, in turn, can contribute to severity by interfering with the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and by antibody-dependent enhancement. Considering the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 secondary provides a better perspective to interpret COVID-19 pathology.

However, these profiles are susceptible to technical and biological variation. Capturing biological variability and removing technical variability are essential for future studies. The EATRIS-Plus consortium analyzed blood samples from 127 healthy adults across twelve omics layers, resulting in one of the most comprehensive omics profiling datasets. These layers were analyzed and integrated with reproducible workflows. Sex significantly impacted all omics profiles, highlighting the need for sex-balanced studies. Age was associated with fewer omics features, but we could accurately predict participants age with epigenetic predictors (R^2=0.90). And we identified aging biomarkers in other omics layers. Strikingly, omics features including miR-877-5p, CDP-diacylglycerol, COQ10B, SH3GLB1, and MFSD14A mRNAs and immunoglobulin proteins were significantly (False Discovery Rate < 0.05) associated with the difference between biological and chronological age, but not with chronological age itself. The EATRIS-Plus dataset is FAIR and made accessible via the ClinData Portal and Zenodo repository. This reference dataset with normal ranges for abundance and variation of all omics features can guide future biomarker studies. The dataset enables power analyses and sample size estimations for future multi-omics studies and is ideal for benchmarking computational methods that integrate multi-omics data.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

To assess the immunogenicity and virus-neutralisation ability of antibodies induced by individual or combination of Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca: AZ) and Comirnaty (Pfizer: PZ) vaccines and of a hybrid immunity induced in people who were also infected with SARS-CoV-2, longitudinal sera samples of participants recruited through the David Serisier Research biobank (Mater Research Hospital) or at the University of Queensland were collected. ELISA with a panel of purified Spike proteins from ancestral, alpha, delta and omicron BA.1 and BA.2 VOCs showed significantly (by ~2 to 6-fold) reduced IgG antibody titres against Spike proteins from Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 compared to ancestral strain regardless of the number of vaccinations or presence of infection. Neutralisation assays showed reduced activity against delta and omicron BA.1, BA.5 and BA.5 VOCs. However, the differences were in general less pronounced than in the ELISA assay and some were not statistically significant, particularly after four (two AZ and two PZ) vaccinations.

Notably, the data also provide evidence that the outbreak resulted from a single zoonotic transmission event with limited human-to-human transmission, rather than multiple independent zoonotic transmission events. The Rwandan MVD outbreak prompted a thorough investigation that included contact tracing, clinical assessment, travel history, sequencing, and serology testing, to trace the viruss origin.

The cV2F score leverages features reflecting variant-level experimentally and computationally predicted function (e.g. allelic imbalance and sequence-based deep learning models) and element-level function (e.g. predicted enhancers), and learns optimal combinations of features by training a gradient boosting model on GWAS fine-mapping results. The cV2F-annotated variants attained an AUPRC of 0.822 at identifying held-out fine-mapped variants. Variants with high cV2F scores are highly enriched for heritability (14.2x, s.e. 0.5) across 66 diseases/traits, are uniquely informative for disease heritability, and are highly predictive of variants implicated by reporter assays; cV2F substantially outperforms previous variant-to-function scores using all of these metrics. GWAS fine-mapping of 110 diseases/traits informed by cV2F identified 14.3% more confidently fine-mapped (PIP > 0.95) variants than non-functionally informed fine-mapping.

Glutamate is released preferentially at lower firing rates with minimal release at higher firing rates, whereas neuropeptides are released at higher firing rates, resulting in frequency-dependent switching of transmitters. Aversive stimuli evoke high frequency responses with accompanying neuropeptide release to encode negative valence, whereas appetitive stimuli evoke low frequency responses with glutamate release to encode positive valence.

Naturalistic behaviors such as rearing or chasing a bait were each encoded by unique neural ensembles, but the behavioral representations were not anchored to posture or movement. Rather, the coding of kinematic features depended on their relevance to the animals' current behavior or which task the animal performed. Behavior-specific ensembles often preceded and outlasted physical actions and, accordingly, prefrontal population activity evolved at slower timescales than in motor cortex. These findings argue that prefrontal coding of behavior is not locked to motor output, and may instead reflect motivations to perform certain actions rather than the actions themselves.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

Increased activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is linked to numerous diseases including gout, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, neuroinflammatory diseases and cancer, which has prompted the search for therapeutics that can inhibit the NLRP3 pathway.

Recent work suggested that NIMA-related kinase 7 (NEK7) may be required for proper assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome independent of its kinase activity, and that hence reduction of NEK7 protein levels may block NLRP3 activation. Since NEK7 contains a glycine beta hairpin loop structural degron found in many targets of cereblon (CRBN) molecular glue degraders, we used this strategy to degrade NEK7 and inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome. We identified NK7-902, a CRBN glue degrader of NEK7. NK7-902 potently and selectively degraded NEK7 in human primary monocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and whole blood. Unexpectedly, full NEK7 degradation led to only partial blockade of NLRP3-dependent interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) release in these cells under different stimulation conditions, with the extent of IL-1{beta} inhibition varying greatly across donors.

Unlike most CRBN glue degraders, NK7-902 degraded NEK7 in mouse cells and efficiently inhibited NLRP3-dependent IL-1{beta} release in a mouse cryopyrin-associated syndrome (CAPS) model. By contrast, oral administration of NK7-902 in non-human primates led to profound and long lasting NEK7 degradation but only transiently blocked IL-1{beta} production in blood.

Collectively, our data suggest that NEK7 is involved but may not be strictly required for NLRP3 activation in primates and humans.

Here, we characterize how hunger restructures an animal's spontaneous behavior as well as its directed exploration of a novel object. We show that hunger-induced changes in exploration are accompanied by and result from modulation of dopamine signaling in the tail of the striatum (TOS). Dopamine signaling in the TOS is modulated by internal hunger state through the activity of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, putative ""hunger neurons"" in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.

Each combination underwent four protease treatments and was analyzed across four experimental and three technical replicates, totaling 3,360 LC-MS/MS runs.

Despite their ecological and evolutionary importance, this phylogenetic group, which is very distantly related to animals and land plants, is still poorly characterised at the genome level. Here we analyse 60 new genomes that include species from all the major brown algal orders. Comparative analysis of these genomes indicated the occurrence of several major events coinciding approximately with the emergence of the brown algal lineage. These included marked gain of new orthologous gene families, enhanced protein domain rearrangement, horizontal gene transfer events and the acquisition of novel signalling molecules and metabolic pathways. The latter include enzymes implicated in processes emblematic of the brown algae such as biosynthesis of the alginate-based extracellular matrix, and halogen and phlorotannin biosynthesis. These early genomic innovations enabled the adaptation of brown algae to their intertidal habitats. The subsequent diversification of the brown algal orders tended to involve loss of gene families, and genomic features were identified that correlated with the emergence of differences in life cycle strategy, flagellar structure and halogen metabolism. Analysis of microevolutionary patterns within the genus Ectocarpus indicated that deep gene flow between species may be an important factor in genome evolution on more recent timescales. Finally, we show that integration of large viral genomes has had a significant impact on brown algal genome content and propose that this process has persisted throughout the evolutionary history of the lineage.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

Unlike multi-objective light sheet setups, the microscope uses a single objective at the fly head interface, facilitating sample mounting and inspection, and reducing invasiveness. In contrast to two-photon microscopies, the light-sheet configuration with visible excitation offers reduced phototoxicity. We demonstrate in vivo imaging of the membrane, mitochondria, and dense-core vesicles in the axonal projections of small lateral ventral neurons.

To address this, we present TCR-TRANSLATE, a novel framework that adapts low-resource machine translation techniques to the TCR:pMHC specificity domain. Here, we explore sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling with various training strategies, including semi-synthetic data augmentation and multi-task objectives to generate antigen specific TCR sequences for a given target of interest. We benchmark twelve model variants derived from the BART and T5 model architectures on a target-rich validation set of well-studied pMHCs, finding an optimal model, TCRT5, that generated validated antigen-specific CDR3{beta} sequences for previously unseen antigens. While current limitations include a narrow validation set and a focus on the CDR3{beta} loop, our approach demonstrates the potential of seq2seq models in rapidly generating antigen-specific TCR repertoires, offering a promising avenue for increasing throughput in precision immunotherapies. Our findings highlight both the capabilities and limitations of sequence-based conditional TCR design, emphasizing the need for experimental validation to bridge the gaps between predictions, metrics, and functional capacity.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

Since its outbreak in late 2019, the virus has been estimated to have explored all possible alternatives in terms of missense mutations for all sites of its polypeptide chain. Spike protein of the virus-responsible for target recognition, cellular entry, and endosomal escape-exhibits the largest sequence variation in particular. Here, we detail the evolutionary changes in ionizable amino acids which can acquire either positive or negative charge and which have been shown to have led to a significant increase in the overall charge on the spike protein during the initial period of the pandemic. While the previously observed charge trends have recently come to a halt, we show that mutations in ionizable amino acids continue to occur with the newly emerging variants. What is more, we show that in mutations of amino acids which can acquire positive charge, there is a particular preference for lysine residues over arginine residues, a trend which has gained in prominence with BA.2.86 and its sublineages, including the recently dominant JN.1 and KP.3 variants. The high lysine-to-arginine ratio in the spike proteins of BA.2.86 and its sublineages does not appear to directly influence viral fitness, including receptor binding, and the reasons behind it remain unclear, even though similar trends having been observed in several other systems as well.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

In the central nervous system (CNS), neuroinflammation is a characteristic feature underlying the onset and progression of retinal and neurodegenerative diseases. Targeting neuroinflammation to reduce neuronal cell death and protect against visual and cognitive declines is therefore a key therapeutic strategy. However, due to the complex and multi-faceted nature of these diseases, to date there has been little therapeutic success with single target approaches insufficient to tackle widespread and multi-pathway inflammatory cascades. Furthermore, as the retina and brain reside within immune-privileged environments, a major challenge in treating these diseases is producing and delivering a therapeutic that, in itself, does not exacerbate inflammation. Extracellular vesicles (EV), derived from red blood cells (RBC EV), present a promising solution to overcome these hurdles, due to their innate ability to cross blood-tissue barriers, biocompatible nature, and their broad anti-inflammatory properties to modulate complex neuroinflammatory pathways.

This study therefore investigated the therapeutic potential of RBC EV in mediating neuroinflammation using an in-vivo photo-oxidative damage model of retinal degeneration as a model for CNS neuroinflammation. In this work, we developed a novel incubation pipeline using N1 medium supplement and superoxide dismutase (SOD) supplementation to promote the production of safe, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory RBC EV. Delivery of RBC EV in vivo, was shown to be safe with strong penetration across all retinal layers. Further, therapeutic administration of RBC EV via local intravitreal injection significantly reduced inflammation and cell death and preserved retinal function. Notably, strong safety and therapeutic efficacy was also demonstrated in the retina following systemic (intraperitoneal) administration, highlighting a potential game-changing approach for less-invasive therapeutic delivery to the CNS. Finally, multi-omic analyses and in vitro findings supported an anti-inflammatory mechanism-of-action, with RBC EV modulating pro-inflammatory cytokine release, including those known to be involved in the pathogenesis of retinal and neurodegenerative diseases.

Taken together, these findings highlight the broad applicability of RBC EV in treating neuroinflammation in the CNS, presenting a scalable and effective treatment approach for these currently untreatable diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

Following a bloodmeal, mosquitoes experience significant physiological changes, primarily orchestrated by the midgut and fat body tissues. These changes begin with digestion and culminate in egg production. However, our understanding of those key processes at the cellular and molecular level remains limited. We have created a comprehensive cell atlas of the mosquito midgut and fat body by employing single-cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics techniques. This atlas unveils the dynamic cellular composition and metabolic adaptations that occur following a bloodmeal. Our analyses reveal highly diverse cell populations, specialized in digestion, metabolism, immunity, and reproduction. While the midgut primarily comprises enterocytes, enteroendocrine and intestinal stem cells, the fat body consists not only of trophocytes and oenocytes, but also harbors a substantial hemocyte population and a newly found fat body-yolk cell population. The fat body exhibits a complex cellular and metabolomic profile and exerts a central role in coordinating immune and metabolic processes. Additionally, an insect-specific virus, PCLV (Phasi Charoen-Like Virus) was detected in single cells, mainly in the midgut a week after the bloodmeal. These findings highlight the complexity of the mosquito abdominal tissues, and pave the way towards the development of exquisitely refined vector control strategies consisting of genetically targeting specific cell populations and metabolic pathways necessary for egg development after a bloodmeal.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

We show that IDR function depends on two distinct but related properties: sequence- and chemical specificity. While sequence-specificity works via linear binding motifs, chemical specificity reflects the sequence-encoded chemistry of multivalent interactions through amino acids across an IDR. Unexpectedly, a binding motif that is essential in the wild-type IDR can be removed if compensatory changes to the sequence chemistry are made, highlighting the orthogonality and interoperability of both properties and providing a much deeper sequence space compatible with function. Our results provide a general framework to understand the functional constraints on IDR sequence evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

While it is known how urea catabolism leads to biomineralization, the non-ureolytic pathways of MICP are less clear. This limits the use of the latter in biotechnology, despite its clear benefit of avoiding toxic ammonia release. To address this knowledge gap, the present study explored the interdependence between carbon source utilization and non-ureolytic MICP. We show that acetate can serve as the carbon source driving calcite formation in several environmental Bacillaceae isolates. This effect was particularly clear in a Solibacillus silvestris strain, which could precipitate almost all provided calcium when provided with a 2:1 acetate-to-calcium molar ratio, and we show that this process was independent of active cell growth. Genome sequencing and gene expression analyses revealed an apparent link between acetate catabolism and calcite precipitation in this species, suggesting MICP may be a calcium stress response. Development of a simple genetic system for S. silvestris led to deletion of a proposed calcium binding protein, although this showed minimal effects on MICP. Taken together, this study provides insights into the physiological processes leading to non-ureolytic MICP, paving the way for targeted optimization of biomineralization for sustainable materials development.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

Predicted to be extinct by 2038, the orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster) is a Critically Endangered migratory bird threatened by numerous viral, bacterial and fungal diseases. The species has undergone multiple population crashes, reaching a low of three wild-born females and 13 males in 2016 and is now represented by only a single wild population and individuals in the captive breeding program. Here we used our high-quality long-read reference genome, and contemporary and historical resequenced genomes from as early as 1829, to track the long-term genomic erosion and immunogenetic diversity decline in this species. 62% of genomic diversity was lost between historical (mean autosomal heterozygosity = 0.00149 {+/-} 0.000699 SD) and contemporary (0.00057 {+/-} 0.000026) parrots. A greater number and length of runs of homozygosity in contemporary samples was also observed. A temporal reduction of the number of alleles at Toll-like receptor genes was found (historical average alleles = 5.78 {+/-} 2.73; contemporary = 3.89 {+/-} 2.10), potentially exacerbating disease susceptibility in the contemporary population. Of particular concern is the new threat of avian influenza strain (HPAI) to Australia.

Significance statementOrange-bellied parrots (Neophema chrysogaster) face a dire future, with extinction predicted by 2038 due to severe genetic diversity loss. This Critically Endangered species, now reduced to a single wild population and a captive breeding program, has lost 62% of its genomic diversity since 1829. Contemporary samples show a decline in immunogenetic diversity and signs of very recent inbreeding. Meaning birds today are more susceptible to disease events than birds a hundred years ago. Conservation efforts must consider hybridization and synthetic biology to counteract the catastrophic loss of genetic diversity to ensure the species survival. Our study underscores the urgent need for innovative strategies to preserve the adaptive potential and resilience of the orange-bellied parrot and other species in similar situations.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

Stabilized RNA reporter barcodes can be selectively packaged and exported from cells via virus-like particles (VLPs) containing selective affinity handles for convenient multichannel tracking of co-cultured cells. Using an engineered RNA adapter, NTVE exports cellular transcripts from inducible human and murine reporter cell lines with high concordance to conventional lysate-derived RNA-seq. NTVE allows monitoring of transcriptome changes in response to genetic and chemical perturbations in the same cells over time using standard sequencing workflows. NTVE can also be equipped with fusogens to deliver mRNA-encoded effectors or ribonucleoprotein gene editors from sender cells to activate gene reporters in co-cultured recipient cells.

However, it has also been suggested that innate immune responses may be triggered by viral transcription. In this study, we investigated whether an immunostimulatory RNA is produced during IAV transcription. We show that the IAV RNA polymerase can read though the polyadenylation signal during transcription termination, generating a capped complementary RNA (ccRNA), which contains the 5' cap of an IAV mRNA and the 3' terminus of a cRNA instead of a poly(A) tail. ccRNAs are detectable in vitro and in both ribonucleoprotein reconstitution assays and IAV infections. Mutations that disrupt polyadenylation enhance ccRNA synthesis and increase RIG-I-dependent innate immune activation. Notably, while ccRNA itself is not immunostimulatory, it forms a RIG-I agonist by hybridizing with a complementary negative-sense viral RNA. These findings thus identify a novel non-canonical IAV RNA species and suggest an alternative mechanism for RIG-I activation during IAV infection.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

Motif scans therefore produce many false-positive binding site predictions. By surveying 179 TFs across 25 families using >1,500 cyclic in vitro selection experiments with fragmented, naked, and unmodified genomic DNA - a method we term GHT-SELEX (Genomic HT-SELEX) - we find that many human TFs possess much higher sequence specificity than anticipated. Moreover, genomic binding regions from GHT-SELEX are often surprisingly similar to those obtained in vivo (i.e. ChIP-seq peaks). We find that comparable specificity can also be obtained from motif scans, but performance is highly dependent on derivation and use of the motifs, including accounting for multiple local matches in the scans. We also observe alternative engagement of multiple DNA-binding domains within the same protein: long C2H2 zinc finger proteins often utilize modular DNA recognition, engaging different subsets of their DNA binding domain (DBD) arrays to recognize multiple types of distinct target sites, frequently evolving via internal duplication and divergence of one or more DBDs. Thus, contrary to conventional wisdom, it is common for TFs to possess sufficient intrinsic specificity to independently delineate cellular targets.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

Genetic loss of either LUBAC or OTULIN causes autoinflammatory syndromes, which are associated with defects in glycogen and lipid metabolism. However, how LUBAC and OTULIN regulate metabolic signalling remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that LUBAC promotes, while OTULIN restricts, activation of the key metabolic regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in cells, mice, and human samples. LUBAC and OTULIN interact with AMPK, control its M1-ubiquitination, and regulate its activation in response to glucose starvation and allosteric activation. During starvation, LUBAC deficiency impairs autophagy induction and hinders the shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Strikingly, LUBAC-deficient Drosophila have a strongly reduced survival rate after starvation. Our work identifies LUBAC and OTULIN as physiological regulators of AMPK, providing the first mechanism by which M1-linked ubiquitin chains regulate metabolic signalling.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

Performing both DBiT-seq and CODEX on the same tissue slide enables accurate cell typing in each spatial transcriptome spot and subsequently image-guided decomposition to generate single-cell resolved spatial transcriptome atlases. DBiTplus was applied to mouse embryos with limited protein markers but still demonstrated excellent integration for single-cell transcriptome decomposition, to normal human lymph nodes with high-plex protein profiling to yield a single-cell spatial transcriptome map, and to human lymphoma FFPE tissue to explore the mechanisms of lymphomagenesis and progression.

Here, we used Mendelian randomisation (MR) to test the causal effects of [~]1000 plasma metabolites and [~]300 metabolite ratios on anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease and multiple sclerosis.

No evidence of reverse causality was identified. Multivariate analyses implicated sphingolipid metabolism in psychiatric disorder risk and carnitine derivatives in risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis.

While knowledge of regulatory roles of the microenvironment on the intestine is vast, how distinct perturbations within the intestinal epithelium may influence tailored responses from the microenvironment, remains understudied. Here, we present previously unknown signaling between enteroendocrine cells (EE), vasculature-like trachea (TTCs), and neurons, which drives regional and global stem cell proliferation during adult intestinal regeneration in Drosophila.

Injury-induced ROS from midgut epithelial cells promotes the production and secretion of Dh31, the homolog of mammalian Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), from anterior midgut EE cells. Dh31 from EE cells and neurons signal to Dh31 receptor within TTCs leading to cell autonomous production of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-like Pvf1. Tracheal derived Pvf1 induces remodeling of the tracheal stem cell niche and regenerative ISC proliferation through autocrine and paracrine Pvr/MAPK signalling, respectively. Interestingly, while EE Dh31 exerts broad control of ISC proliferation throughout the midgut, functions of the neuronal source of the ligand appear restricted to the posterior midgut. Altogether, our work has led to the discovery of a novel enteroendocrine/neuronal/vascular signaling network controlling global and domain specific ISC proliferation during adult intestinal regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

Here, using marine bacterial isolates, we detected energy transfer from a carotenoid (myxol) to retinal not only in proteorhodopsin but also in the chloride ion-pumping rhodopsin. Carotenoid binding improved the light utilization efficiency of the proteorhodopsin by accelerating the photocycle, together with facilitating light-harvesting.

To guarantee its propagation, the chromosome must replicate, segregate, and accommodate other biological processes like gene expression. Therefore, to understand the causal relationship between chromosome organization and biological function, it is essential to follow chromosome dynamics. Live-cell imaging of fluorescent labels allows the tracking of specific genomic locations, but the current imaging-based approaches to study bacterial chromosome organization over the cell cycle are limited in their throughput. Even with multicolor fluorescent locus labeling, the genomic resolution is insufficient to gain insights about the whole chromosome structure from a single experiment. Although sequencing-based methods like chromosome conformation capture provide high genomic coverage, they can only be done in bulk, providing an averaged static view of the chromosome structure. In this study, we address these limitations and investigate the bacterial chromosome organization by imaging fluorescently labeled loci in a library of Escherichia coli strains, following the 3D locations of 68 different loci in live cells in a single experiment. The resulting location distributions along the cells longitudinal and radial axes are used to inform a dynamic polymer model of the chromosome over the cell cycle.

Extensive conformational heterogeneity is especially characteristic of intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions (collectively IDRs), which lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure and instead rapidly exchange between a diverse ensemble of configurations. An emerging paradigm recognizes that the conformational biases encoded in IDR ensembles can play a central role in their biological function, necessitating understanding these sequence-ensemble relations. All-atom simulations have provided critical insight into our modern understanding of the solution behavior of IDRs. However, effectively exploring the accessible conformational space associated with large, heterogeneous ensembles is challenging. In particular, identifying poorly sampled or energetically trapped regions of disordered proteins in simulations often relies on qualitative assessment based on visual inspection of simulations and/or analysis data. These approaches, while convenient, run the risk of masking poorly-sampled simulations. In this work, we present an algorithm for quantifying per-residue local conformational heterogeneity in protein simulations. Our work builds on prior work and compares the similarity between backbone dihedral angle distributions generated from molecular simulations in a limiting polymer model and across independent all-atom simulations. In this regime, the polymer model serves as a statistical reference model for extensive conformational heterogeneity in a real chain. Quantitative comparisons of probability vectors generated from these simulations reveal the extent of conformational sampling in a simulation, enabling us to distinguish between situations in which protein regions are well-sampled, poorly-sampled, or folded. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we apply our algorithm to several toy, synthetic, and biological systems. Accurately assessing local conformational sampling in simulations of IDRs will help better quantify new enhanced sampling methods, ensure force field comparisons are equivalent, and provide confidence that conclusions drawn from simulations are robust.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

However, the organization of arousal and memory reactivation markers within the human ISFS and its conservation in younger ages remain unclear. This study characterizes the ISFS from childhood to young adulthood (N = 154; ages 8-26), examining its relationship with functional markers. Results indicate that the ISFS is present across all ages, with frequency, variability, and strength increasing from early to late adolescence. Notably, markers of arousal and memory reactivation are organized within the spindle-rich ISFS peak. The consistent presence and organization of the ISFS suggest it is intrinsic to sleep, with adolescence marking a dynamic window.

Although many methods have been developed to infer such co-expression networks from single-cell data, the lack of consideration of false positive control in many evaluations may lead to incorrect conclusions because higher reproducibility, higher functional coherence, and a larger overlap with known biological networks may not imply better performance if the false positives are not well controlled. In this study, we have developed an efficient and effective simulation tool to derive empirical p-values in co-expression inference to appropriately control false positives in assessing method performance. We studied the power of the p-value-based approach in inferring cell-type-specific co-expressions from single-cell data using both simulated and real data. We also highlight the need to adjust for random overlaps between the inferred and known networks when the number of selected correlated gene pairs varies substantially across different methods. We further illustrate the expression level bias in known biological networks and the impact of such bias in method assessment. Our study indicates the importance of controlling false positives in the inference of co-expressed genes to achieve more reliable results and proposes a simulation-based p-value method to achieve this.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

We show in artificial neural network models that varying the recurrence level causes these differences in coding properties to emerge. We confirmed the contribution of recurrent connectivity to functional heterogeneity by characterizing the representational geometry of neural recordings and comparing it with theoretical predictions of neural manifold dimensionality.

These hyphal networks represent a carbon sink in soil, thus it has been suggested that these fungi can also boost atmospheric carbon sequestration, highlighting their potential role in managing greenhouse emissions. In this study, we aimed to determine whether certain AMF genotypes and nuclear organizations (homokaryons vs heterokaryons) are associated with higher rates of host plant yield and carbon storage. To assess this, we compared Sudan-grass (Sorghum x drummondii) AMF inoculation across 8 strains of Rhizophagus irregularis: 4 homokaryotic and 4 heterokaryotic strains. Sudan-grass was grown in a growth chamber, which included 13C-CO2 pulse labeling to track plant carbon into AMF. AMF inoculation increased total and root biomass, as well as phosphorous, magnesium and manganese uptake in the host. Heterokaryons led to greater root biomass, as well as less variable increases in shoot phosphorous. Host biomass had a significant positive effect on mycorrhizal carbon inputs to the soil. Mycorrhizal inputs to the mineral associated organic carbon - a more persistent carbon pool with slow turnover - were overall greater in heterokaryons than in homokaryons but varied significantly among strains. This indicates that the potential for carbon storage by mycorrhizal carbon inputs varies based on both fungal genomic identity and nuclear organization. Overall, inoculation improved the yield of Sudan-grass and resulted in significant inter-strain variation in persistent carbon contributions to the soil. This work highlights the importance of considering genotype and nuclear identity in assessments of AMF as bio-stimulants and drivers of carbon sequestration.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

We examined three cohorts of university students (N=584) and used non-parametric methods to assess correlations of various health and cognitive variables with SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 severity, vaccination status, time since infection, time since vaccination, and virus variants. Our results show that some health and cognitive impairments persist, with some even progressively worsening especially fatigue in women and memory in men, up to four years post-infection, with the Wuhan variant having the most significant long-term impact and the Omicron variant the least. Interestingly, the severity of the acute illness was not correlated with the variant of SARS-CoV-2. The analysis also revealed that individuals who contracted COVID-19 after vaccination had better health and cognitive outcomes compared to those infected before vaccination. The study also discusses some limitations inherent in cross-sectional studies, particularly those arising from the stronger tendency of individuals with poorer health, compared to healthier individuals, to avoid infection and prioritize vaccination.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of respiratory system disorders before and after the pandemic onset in individuals with and without PASC. Methods: We designed a case-control study was designed to investigate the prevalence of respiratory system-related diagnoses in adult, non-hospitalized PASC patients (cases) in 2019, 12 months before and 6 months after the PASC diagnosis compared to matched controls without PASC. Data was extracted from the Stockholm Region's database warehouse (VAL). Results: Higher diagnostic rates for common respiratory illnesses were observed among PASC patients in 2019 and 12 months before PASC diagnosis, which then slightly decreased 6 months after PASC diagnosis. PASC patients showed more pre-pandemic respiratory diagnoses compared to controls: in 2019 they had higher incidence of acute upper respiratory tract infection (OR 2.47 for males, 2.22 for females), asthma (OR 1.76 (males), 1.95 (females)), and bronchitis (OR 2.15 (males), 2.71 (females)) compared to controls. Conclusions: This study highlights that individuals with PASC have a higher prevalence of respiratory disorders both before and after their COVID-19 diagnosis. Notably, asthma and other respiratory conditions were more common in PASC patients compared to matched controls. Our study demonstrates that individuals with asthma are more likely to develop PASC, even if asthma does not increase the severity of acute COVID-19. These findings underscore the need for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms connecting respiratory illnesses and PASC. Understanding the long-term consequences of COVID-19 in individuals with pre-existing conditions will be crucial for refining clinical management strategies and improving patients outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1731535771561

However, obtaining reproducible and accurate maps requires lengthy acquisition due to the need to massively oversample the parameter space. This means that tensor-based dw-MRI accessibility is still relatively low in daily practice, and more advanced approaches with increased sensitivity and specificity to microstructure are seldom applied in research and clinical contexts. Motivated by recent advances in simulation-based inference (SBI) methods, this work uses neural networks to model the posterior distribution of key diffusion parameters when provided experimental data, allowing accurate estimation with fewer measurements and without the need to train on real data. We find that SBI outperforms standard non-linear least squares fitting under noisy and sparse data conditions in both diffusion tensor and kurtosis imaging, reducing imaging time by 90% while maintaining high accuracy and robustness. Demonstrated on simulated and real data in healthy and pathological brains, this approach can substantially impact radiology by: i) increasing dw-MRI access to more patients, including those unable to undergo long exams; ii) promoting advanced dw-MRI protocols for greater microstructure sensitivity; and iii) rescuing older data where noise hindered analysis. Combining SBI with dw-MRI could greatly improve clinical MRI workflows by reducing patient discomfort, enhancing scan efficiency, and enabling advanced imaging approaches in a data and privacy friendly way.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

The second and third models are Analytical Behavioral Feedback Models, which simulate the feedback loop either through the explicit representation of different behavioral compartments within the population or by utilizing an effective non-linear force of infection. Our results do not identify a single best model overall, as performance varies based on factors such as data availability, data quality, and the choice of performance metrics.

However, the relatively low representation of admixed populations in both discovery and fine-tuning individual-level datasets limits PRS development for admixed populations. Under the assumption that the most informative PRS weight for a homogeneous sample, which can be approximated by a data point in the ancestry continuum space, varies linearly in that space, we introduce a Genetic Distance-assisted PRS Combination Pipeline for Diverse Genetic Ancestries (DiscoDivas) to interpolate a harmonized PRS for diverse, especially admixed, ancestries, leveraging multiple PRS weights fine-tuned within single-ancestry samples and the genetic ancestry continuum information. DiscoDivas treats ancestry as a continuous variable and does not require shifting between different models when calculating PRS for different ancestries. We generated PRS with DiscoDivas and the current conventional method, i.e. fine-tuning multiple GWAS PRS using the matched or similar ancestry sample, for simulated datasets and large-scale biobank datasets (UK Biobank [UKBB] N=415,402, Mass General Brigham Biobank N=53,306, All of Us N=245,394) and compared our method with the conventional method with quantitative traits and complex disease traits. DiscoDivas generated a harmonized PRS of the accuracy comparable to or higher than the conventional approach, with the greatest advantage exhibited in admixed samples: DiscoDivas PRS for admixed samples was more statistically accurate than the PRS fine-tuned in matched or similar ancestry sample in 12 out of 16 simulated scenarios and was statistically equivalent in the remaining four scenarios; when tested with quantitative trait data in UKBB, DiscoDivas increased the PRS accuracy of admixed sample by 5% on average; yet no statistical difference was observed when tested for binary traits in UKBB where ancestry-matched data was available. For the single ancestry samples, the accuracy of DiscoDivas PRS and PRS fine-tuned in match samples was similar. In summary, our method DiscoDivas yields a harmonized PRS of robust accuracy for individuals across the genetic ancestry spectrum, including where ancestry-matched training data may be incomplete.","NA","medrxiv",1731535771561

Extensive studies have generated molecular profiles at both bulk and single-cell levels; however, systematic integration that describes tissue-wide changes as a function of cell type coordination remains challenging. This disconnect hampers our understanding of the complex multicellular interactions driving heart failure, limiting our ability to translate molecular insights into actionable therapeutic strategies. Here, we integrated bulk and single-cell transcriptional profiles from cardiac tissues of HF and control patients across 25 studies, covering 1,524 individuals and seven cell-types, to delineate consensus multicellular transcriptional changes associated with cardiac remodeling. Our analyses revealed conserved cellular coordination events involving fibrotic, metabolic, inflammatory, and hypertrophic mechanisms, with fibroblasts playing a central role in predicting cardiomyocyte stress. Further analysis of fibroblast populations suggested that their activation in HF represents a broad phenotypic shift rather than solely accumulating distinct cell states. The integration of bulk and single-cell data within our data collection indicated that transcriptional responses to HF across cell types occur independently of tissue composition. Mapping independent data into our consensus programs demonstrated that recovery after left ventricular assist device implantation aligns with molecular recovery, highlighting the clinical relevance of the multicellular molecular state. Overall, our work synthesizes independent cardiac transcriptomics studies and makes the conserved HF associated insights available, establishing a reference for detailed exploration of HF-related multicellular molecular events.

While a plethora of sequence-based prediction methods for TCR-epitope binding exists, their available pre-trained models have not been comparatively evaluated on standardized datasets and evaluation settings. Furthermore, technical problems such as non-standardized input and output formats of these prediction tools hinder interoperability and broad usage in applied research. To alleviate these shortcomings, we introduce ePytope-TCR, an extension of the vaccine design and immuno-prediction framework ePytope. We integrated 18 TCR-epitope prediction methods into this common framework offering interoperable interfaces with standard TCR repertoire data formats. We showcase the applicability of ePytope-TCR by evaluating the performance of the prediction methods on two challenging datasets for annotating single-cell repertoires and predicting TCR cross-reactivity towards mutated epitopes. While novel predictors successfully predicted binding to frequently observed epitopes, all methods failed for less observed epitopes. Further, we detected a strong bias in the prediction scores between different epitope classes. We envision this benchmark to guide researchers in their choice of a predictor for a given setting. Further, we aspire to accelerate the development of novel prediction models by allowing fast benchmarking against existing approaches through common interfaces and defining standardized evaluation settings.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

One such gene is nblA which is present in multiple cyanophage families2,6-9. Under nutrient deprivation the cyanobacterial NblA is responsible for inducing proteolytic degradation of the phycobilisome10-12, the large cyanobacterial photosynthetic light harvesting complex. This increases the pool of amino acids available for essential tasks12, serving as a survival mechanism13. Ectopic expression of different cyanophage nblA genes results in host pigment protein degradation9,7,6. However, the benefit of the cyanophage-encoded NblA for the cyanophage and the broader impact on the host are unknown. Here, using a recently developed genetic manipulation system for cyanophages14, we reveal that cyanophage NblA significantly accelerates the cyanophage infection cycle, directs degradation of the host phycobilisome and other photosynthetic proteins and reduces host photosynthetic light harvesting efficiency. Furthermore, metagenomic analysis revealed that cyanophages carrying nblA are widespread in the oceans and compose 35% and 65% of oceanic T7-like cyanophages in the surface and deep photic zones, respectively.

During the engineering of a red-shifted variant of an mTurquoise-based calcium sensor, we serendipitously generated a green-emitting sensor that shows high brightness in both the calcium-bound and -unbound state, while still showing a calcium dependent lifetime change of >1 nanosecond. This sensor, named G-Ca-FLITS, is comparable in brightness to the bright state of GCaMP3 and jGCaMP7c in mammalian cells. The calcium induced loss in fluorescence intensity is only around 30% and therefore we observe little variation in the SNR when calcium levels change. G-Ca-FLITS shows negligible sensitivity to pH in the physiological range, like its turquoise parent. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), we measured the calcium concentration with G-Ca-FLITS in various organelles and observed in HeLa cells transient and spatially heterogeneous calcium elevations in mitochondria. Finally, we evaluated the use of G-Ca-FLITS and its turquoise predecessor for two-photon FLIM in Drosophila brains.

However, several questions on the mechanistic links between shape and function remain unanswered. Here, we developed an efficient protocol to generate pure populations of morphologically distinct human astrocytes in vitro, which we used for a systematic analysis of shape-function relationships. We performed a structural, molecular, and functional characterization of these populations and highlighted how their distinct morphologies mirror distinct functional and transcriptional patterns at the population level. We were also able to both correlate gene expression profiles of these morphologically distinct astrocyte subtypes with in vivo astrocytes in the human brain, and to validate our findings with primary isolated murine astrocytes in vitro. Moreover, we show that the observed morphological differences are correlated with changes in key cytoskeletal proteins, which offers a potential link to the observed functional differences. Finally, we demonstrated that different morphological subtypes of astrocytes have distinct reactivity responses to a common stimulus. This study offers a glimpse into the shape-function dynamics of human astrocytes, highlighting potential mechanistic links between cytoskeletal usage and astrocyte function, while also providing tools and datasets that will be useful for further studies into human glial biology in health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

Streptococci are common in animal microbiota and include opportunistic pathogens like Group A Streptococcus (GAS) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). While the conserved streptococcal S protein has been identified as a key factor in GAS virulence, its exact function is unclear. Here, we show that the pneumococcal S protein is crucial for resisting against host-derived antimicrobials by coordinating cell wall modification and repair. Specifically, we show that S proteins are septally localized through their transmembrane domain and contain an extracellular peptidoglycan (PG) binding LysM domain which is required for its function. Protein-protein and genetic interaction studies demonstrate that the pneumococcal S protein directly interacts with a PG synthase, class A penicillin binding protein PBP1a, and the PG deacetylase PgdA. Single-molecule experiments reveal that the fraction of circumferentially moving PBP1a molecules is reduced in the absence of S protein. Consistent with an impaired PBP1a function, streptococci lacking S protein exhibit increased susceptibility to cell wall targeting antibiotics and altered cell morphologies. PG analysis showed reduced N-deacetylation of glycans in the S. pneumoniae S protein mutant, indicating reduced PgdA activity. We show that pneumococci lacking the S protein cannot persist transient penicillin treatment, are more susceptible to the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 and to lysozyme, and show decreased virulence in zebrafish and mice. Our data support a model in which S proteins regulate PBP1a activity and play a key role in coordinating PG repair and modification. This cell wall  sentinel control system provides defense against host-derived and environmental antimicrobial attack.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

The ability of engineered cells to traffic to and function at specific anatomical locations is a major aspect of their performance.

Here, we establish a platform for in vivo imaging of primary cell therapies using ultrasound - a ubiquitously accessible technology for high-resolution non-invasive imaging. We introduce and optimize a lentiviral delivery system to express acoustic reporter genes based on gas vesicles in primary mammalian cells such as T cells, showing that this results in robust ultrasound contrast. Additionally, we develop genetic circuits making it possible to monitor T cell activation via activity-dependent promoters. We apply this technology to primary human T cells, using it to non-invasively track their accumulation and proliferation as a targeted therapy in a mouse tumor xenograft model and compare it to invasive, terminal measures such as immunohistology. By making it possible to visualize cell-based therapies and their function inside opaque living organs with unprecedented resolution and accessibility, this technology has the potential to significantly accelerate their development and effective use.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

This process is guided by the accumulation of the plant hormone auxin and the polar localisation of the efflux protein PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1). The transcription factor MONOPTEROS (MP) plays a crucial role in orienting PIN1 polarity, thereby facilitating auxin-driven organogenesis. In this study, we investigated how MP regulates PIN1 polarity and organogenesis, discovering that the downstream vascular transcription factor TMO5 regulates PIN1 polarity non-cell-autonomously and promotes organ initiation in the SAM. Furthermore, we find that exogenous auxin and cytokinin can partially rescue the organ defects associated with loss of MP and TMO5 activity. Collectively, these findings uncover a novel role for TMO5 in controlling PIN1 polarity and driving organogenesis by coordinating hormonal signalling.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

While the genes for diguanylate cyclases and c-di-GMP hydrolases (active or mutated) can be easily identified in microbial genomes, the list of c-di-GMP receptor domains is quite limited, and only two of them, PliZ and MshEN, are found across multiple bacterial phyla. Recently, a new c-di-GMP receptor protein, named CdgR or ComFB, has been identified in cyanobacteria and shown to regulate their cell size and, more recently, natural competence. Sequence and structural analysis indicated that CdgR is part of a widespread ComFB protein family, named after the ""late competence development protein ComFB"" from Bacillus subtilis. This prompted the suggestion that ComFB and ComFB-like proteins could also be c-di-GMP receptors. Indeed, we revealed that ComFB proteins from Gram-positive B. subtilis and Thermoanaerobacter brockii were able to bind c-di-GMP with high-affinity. The ability to bind c-di-GMP was also demonstrated for the ComFB proteins from clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria Vibrio cholerae and Treponema denticola. These observations indicate that the ComFB family serves as yet another widespread family of bacterial c-di-GMP receptors. Incidentally, some ComFB proteins were also capable of c-di-AMP binding, identifying them as a unique family of c-di-NMP receptor proteins. The overexpression of comFB in B. subtilis, combined with an elevated concentration of c-di-GMP, suppressed motility, attesting to the biological relevance of ComFB as a c-di-GMP binding protein.

IMPORTANCEThe cellular content of the bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP is controlled by c-di-GMP synthases (GGDEF domains) and hydrolases (EAL or HD-GYP domains), whose activities, in turn, respond to the signals perceived by their upstream sensory domains. Cyclic-di-GMP transmits the signals to a variety of its targets, which may contain inactivated GGDEF, EAL, or HD-GYP domains, widespread PilZ or MshEN domains, or various lineage-specific c-di-GMP receptors. Many organisms encode multiple GGDEF domains but few c-di-GMP-binding proteins, suggesting the existence of still unidentified c-di-GMP receptors. Here, we demonstrate that the ComFB family proteins, which include the recently characterized cyanobacterial CdgR/ComFB, constitute yet another widespread family of bacterial c-di-NMP receptors. We additionally show that ComFB controls bacillar motility in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these highly complex conditions remains limited. To gain deeper insights into the etiology of different brain diseases, we used specimens from 1,494 unique donors to generate a population-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), comprising over 6.3 million individual nuclei. The cohort includes neurotypical controls as well as donors affected by eight common and complex brain disorders: Alzheimers disease (AD), diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), vascular dementia (Vas), Parkinsons disease (PD), tauopathy, frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. We show that inter-individual variation accounts for a substantial portion of gene expression variation in the DLPFC. By comparing transcriptomic variation across diseases, we reveal universal signatures enriched in basic cellular functions such as mRNA splicing and protein localization. After discounting these cross-disease signatures, we show strong genetic and transcriptomic concordance among AD, DLBD, Vas, and PD, largely driven by alteration of synaptic signaling functions in neurons. Furthermore, we characterize transcriptomic variation among different AD phenotypes that were distinct from healthy aging. We uncover mitigating effects of interneurons and aggravating effects of immune and vascular cells in AD dementia. Further exploring the effect of the neuropsychiatric symptoms frequently accompanying AD, we identify a link to deep layer excitatory neurons. By constructing transcriptome trajectories that capture AD progression, we show cell-type specific responses implicated in early and late stages of AD. Our atlas provides an unprecedented perspective of the transcriptomic landscape in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, shedding light on shared and distinct processes involving the neuro-immune-vascular systems, and identifying potential targets for therapeutic intervention.","NA","medrxiv",1731535771561

The ER-to-Golgi transport must be tightly regulated during adaptation to environmental stress. However, the sensing mechanism and regulatory pathways governing the consecutive formation, budding and transportation of COPII vesicles from the ER remain insufficiently explored. Here, we present evidence indicating that COPII-mediated vesicle transport is transcriptionally controlled through the phosphatidic acid-dependent Opi1-Ino2/Ino4 regulatory circuit. Our analysis indicates that YIP3, a target gene of Ino2/Ino4, exerts a negative regulatory impact on COPII-mediated vesicle transport. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Ino2/Ino4 but not Yip3 modulates Sar1 activation, the initial step in COPII vesicle formation, whereas Yip3 hinders Sec16 assembly on the ER membrane, thereby implying that Ino2/Ino4 governs COPII-mediated trafficking at multiple steps. Thus, this study provides the first evidence for an ER sensing system that transcriptionally fine-tunes multiple steps of anterograde vesicular transport in response to alterations in lipid composition of the ER membrane.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

Acute infections have shown to change decisions to engage in effortful and rewarding activities, but it is currently unclear whether fatigue and depressive symptoms similarly affect decision making during acute and persistent phases of a COVID infection. Here, we investigated whether fatigue and depressive mood are associated with altered weighting of effort and reward in decision-making during different timepoints after COVID infection.

MethodsWe conducted an online cross-sectional study between March 2021 and March 2022. 242 Participants (18-65 years) with COVID <4 weeks ago (n=62), COVID >12 weeks ago (n=81), or no prior COVID (self-reported) (n=90) performed an effort-based decision-making task, in which they decided whether they wanted to exert physical effort (ticking boxes on screen, 5 levels) for reward (money to be gained in a voucher-lottery, 5 levels). State fatigue and depressive mood was measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) prior to the task. We used multilevel binomial regression analysis to test whether fatigue and depressive mood were related to acceptance rates for effort and reward levels and whether this differed between the groups.

ResultsCompared with no COVID and COVID <4 weeks groups, the COVID >12 weeks group reported higher state fatigue scores (mean{+/-}SD: 20{+/-}7 vs. 14{+/-}7 and 12{+/-}6 POMS-score, respectively; both p<0.001) and was less sensitive to rewards (Reward*Group: OR: 0.35 (95%CI 0.20, 0.62), p<0.001 and OR: 0.38 (95%CI 0.20, 0.72), p=0.003). In the COVID >12 weeks group, fatigue was more negatively associated with reward sensitivity compared with the COVID <4 weeks group (Reward*Fatigue*Group: OR 0.47 (95%CI 0.25, 1.13), p=0.022) and the no COVID group (Reward*Fatigue*Group: OR 0.48 (95%CI 4.01, 0.92), p=0.029). No group differences were observed for the relationship between fatigue and effort sensitivity. No group differences were observed for the relationship between depressive mood and effort or reward sensitivity. Higher age, lower BMI, unhealthy lifestyle, and worrying during the acute phase of COVID each predicted decreased reward sensitivity in the >12 weeks group (Age*Reward: OR 0.30 (95%CI 0.19, 0.48), p<0.001; BMI*Reward: OR 1.43 (95%CI 1.01, 2.00), p=0.047); Lifestyle*Reward: OR 1.50 (95%CI 1.06, 2.14), p=0.022; Worrying*Reward: OR 0.59 (95%CI 0.38, 0.94), p=0.025, respectively).

ConclusionThe finding that fatigue is related to lower reward sensitivity >12 weeks after COVID, suggesting potential reward deficits in post-covid fatigue. These findings are in line with previous observations that long-term inflammation can induce dysregulations in neural reward processing, which should be further investigated in future studies.

Previous research employing functional MRI (fMRI) in humans has identified cortical organizing principles that allow not only for coarse-scale distinctions such as animate versus inanimate objects but also more fine-grained distinctions at the level of individual objects. This suggests that fMRI carries rather fine-grained information about individual objects. However, most previous work investigating fine-grained category representations either additionally included coarse-scale category comparisons of objects, which confounds fine-grained and coarse-scale distinctions, or only used a single exemplar of each object, which confounds visual and semantic information. To address these challenges, here we used multisession human fMRI (female and male) paired with a broad yet homogenous stimulus class of 48 terrestrial mammals, with 2 exemplars per mammal. Multivariate decoding and representational similarity analysis (RSA) revealed high image-specific reliability in low- and high-level visual regions, indicating stable representational patterns at the image level. In contrast, analyses across exemplars of the same animal yielded only small effects in the lateral occipital complex (LOC), indicating rather subtle category effects in this region. Variance partitioning with a deep neural network and shape model showed that across exemplar effects in EVC were largely explained by low-level visual appearance, while representations in LOC appeared to also contain higher category-specific information. These results suggest that representations typically measured with fMRI are dominated by image-specific visual or coarse-grained category information but indicate that commonly employed fMRI protocols may reveal subtle yet reliable distinctions between individual objects.

Significance StatementWhile it has been suggested that functional MRI (fMRI) responses in ventral visual cortex carry fine-grained information about individual objects, much previous research has confounded fine-grained with coarse-scale category information or only used individual visual exemplars, which potentially confounds semantic and visual object information. Here we address these challenges in a multisession fMRI study where participants viewed a highly homogenous stimulus set of 48 land mammals with 2 exemplars per animal. Our results reveal a strong dominance of image-specific effects and additionally indicate subtle yet reliable category-specific effects in lateral occipital complex, underscoring the capacity of commonly employed fMRI protocols to uncover fine-grained visual information.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

This study evaluates these three tools for predicting protein-peptide complex structures using Template-Based (TB) and Template-Free (TF) methods. AlphaFold-Multimer excels in TB predictions and performs moderately in TF scenarios in the prediction pool, but TF outperforms TB in the first-ranked models. ColabFold demonstrates versatility in both TB and TF settings. AlphaFold3 generates high-quality structures for more proteins, but the medium accuracy is not as good as AlphaFold-Multimer using a large model pool. We also assessed the performance of various scoring functions in ranking predicted protein-peptide complex structures. While the scoring function built in AlphaFold demonstrates the best performance, some other scoring functions, e.g., FoldX-Stability and HADDOCK-mdscore, provide complementary values. The findings suggest the potential for enhancing scoring functions targeting AlphaFold-based predictions by combining multiple scoring functions or using a consensus approach from many prediction models.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

We analysed data from five young and old adult cohorts (MRi-Share, Human Connectome Project, UK Biobank, Generation Scotland Subsample, and Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 [LBC1936]) to test the validity and utility of LBA inferred from cross-sectional MRI data, i.e., a single MRI scan per participant. LBA was simply calculated based on the relationship between total brain volume (TBV) and intracranial volume (ICV), using three computationally distinct approaches: the difference (ICV-TBV), ratio (TBV/ICV), and regression-residual method (TBV[~]ICV). LBA derived with all three methods were substantially correlated with well-validated neuroradiological atrophy rating scales (r = 0.37-0.44). Compared with the difference or ratio method, LBA computed with the residual method most strongly captured phenotypic variance associated with cognitive decline (r = 0.36), frailty (r = 0.24), age-moderated brain shrinkage (r = 0.45), and longitudinally-measured atrophic changes (r = 0.36). LBA computed using a difference score was strongly correlated with baseline (i.e., ICV; r = 0.81) and yielded GWAS signal similar to ICV (rg = 0.75). We performed the largest genetic study of LBA to date (N = 43,110), which was highly heritable (h2 SNP GCTA = 41% [95% CI = 38-43%]) and had strong polygenic signal (LDSC h2 = 26%; mean{chi} 2 = 1.23). The strongest association in our genome-wide association study (GWAS) implicated WNT16, a gene previously linked with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, and Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study is the first side-by-side evaluation of different computational approaches to estimate lifetime brain changes and their measurement characteristics. Careful assessment of methods for LBA computation had important implications for the interpretation of existing phenotypic and genetic results, and showed that relying on the residual method to estimate LBA from a single MRI scan captured brain shrinkage rather than current brain size.

PE remains inadequately predicted, prevented and treated. Here, we comprehensively investigated altered transcriptomic and epigenetic changes in the PE placenta and maternal cell free RNA (cfRNA). We show that many transposable elements (TEs) in sub-families are deregulated in the gestational age-matched PE placenta. Increased expression of endogenous retrovirus (ERV) and long interspersed nuclear element 1 (L1, LINE1) subfamilies of TEs is associated with higher histone acetylation levels at their regulatory elements. A higher TE transcript level correlates with the type I interferon (IFN I) pathway, suggesting inflammation associated with PE could be due to the sensing of TE transcripts by the antiviral innate immune system. Consistent with higher TE transcript levels in the PE placentas, analysis of maternal cfRNA data revealed differential levels of TE subfamilies in PE compared to healthy controls. Machine learning-based training for TE transcripts for early prediction of PE showed a robust performance in the validation cohort, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88, 81% sensitivity, and 74% positive predictive value (PPV). Overall, we show TE deregulation in the placenta is associated with PE, and maternal cfRNA TE signature accurately predicts early diagnosis of PE, which can improve prophylaxis and obstetric outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

To explore the possible utility of glucokinase activators (GKA) and of glucagon-like receptor-1 (GLP-1) agonists in these diseases, we have developed a novel hypomorphic Gck allele in mice encoding an aberrantly spliced mRNA deleted for exons 2 and 3. In islets from homozygous knock-in (GckKI/KI) mice, GK immunoreactivity was reduced by >85%, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion eliminated. Homozygous GckKI/KI mice were smaller than wildtype littermates and displayed frank diabetes (fasting blood glucose >18 mmol/L; HbA1c ~12%), ketosis and nephropathy. Heterozygous GckKI/+ mice were glucose intolerant (HbA1c ~5.5%). Abnormal glucose-stimulated Ca2+ dynamics and beta cell-beta cell connectivity in GckKI/+ islets were completely reversed by the recently-developed GKA, dorzagliatin, which was largely inactive in homozygous GckKI/KI mouse islets. The GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 improved glucose tolerance in male GckKI/+ mice, an action potentiated by dorzagliatin, in male but not female mice. Sex-dependent additive effects of these agents were also observed on insulin secretion in vitro.

COVID-19 vaccines that are more closely matched to circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages elicit more potent and relevant immune responses that translate to improved real-world vaccine effectiveness. The rise in prevalence of the Omicron JN.1 lineage, and subsequent derivative sublineages such as KP.2 and KP.3, coincided with reduced neutralizing activity and effectiveness of Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted vaccines. Here, we characterized the biophysical and immunologic attributes of BNT162b2 JN.1- and KP.2-adapted mRNA vaccine-encoded spike (S) protein immunogens. Biophysical interrogations of S revealed the structural consequences of hallmark amino acid substitutions and a potential molecular mechanism of immune escape employed by JN.1 and KP.2. The vaccine candidates were evaluated for their immunogenicity when administered as fourth or fifth doses in BNT162b2-experienced mice or as a primary series in naive mice. In both vaccine-experienced and naive settings, JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccines conferred improved neutralizing responses over the BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 vaccine against a broad panel of emerging JN.1 sublineages, including the predominant KP.3.1.1 and emerging XEC lineages. Antigenic mapping of neutralizing responses indicated greater antigenic overlap of JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccine responses with currently circulating sublineages compared to an XBB.1.5-adapted vaccine. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were generally conserved across all three vaccines. Together, the data support the selection of JN.1- or KP.2-adapted vaccines for the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine formula.

The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha propagates clonally through vegetative gemmae or via sexually generated spores, but our understanding of the genetic pathways underpinning reproductive decision-making is limited. GRAS transcriptional regulators are highly conserved proteins across land plants, with diverse functionality in stress and development. Here, we discover a central role for the SCLA-type transcription regulator MpGRAS7 in both stress signalling and reproduction in Marchantia. MpGRAS7 is highly expressed in gemma cups and gametangiophores and is activated in response to Far Red (FR) light and abscisic acid (ABA) environmental cues. Genetic dissection further suggests MpGRAS7 is required to maintain gemma dormancy, gemma cup frequency, and FR-induced gametangiophore development. The sequence conservation and expression patterns of MpGRAS7 orthologs in flowering plants hints towards the broader function of SCLA-type GRAS proteins in stress-regulated developmental transitions in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US. It remains unclear, however, how medical and societal changes during this period affected national chronic pain prevalence, a key dimension of population health.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic and explore reasons driving the trends

MethodsWe use data from the 2019, 2021, and 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a multi-wave cross-sectional survey. Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian US population age 18 and older (n=88,469). Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; some models include additional 19 covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of COVID and long COVID. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP also increased from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019, to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023, after a decline to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021. The 2023 increases occurred in all examined body sites except for dental pain. COVID and long COVID had a modest role in the population-wide pain increases, the causes of which remain unclear.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before the pandemic but surged dramatically since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1731535771561

Mechanistically, we directly show that strand invasion and subsequent HR defects upon BRCA2 loss primarily arises from the unrestricted removal of RAD51 from DSB sites by FIGNL1, rather than from defective RAD51 loading.

Recently, protein phase separation has been observed at cellular membranes, suggesting it may play a role in the assembly of protein complexes. Inspired by these findings, we observed that protein condensates on one side of a planar suspended membrane spontaneously colocalized with those on the opposite side. How might this phenomenon contribute to the assembly of stable transmembrane complexes? To address this question, we examined the diffusion and growth of protein condensates on both sides of membranes. Our results reveal that transmembrane coupling of protein condensates on opposite sides of the membrane slows down condensate diffusion while accelerating condensate growth. How can the rate of condensate growth increase simultaneously with a decrease in the rate of condensate diffusion? We provide insights into these seemingly contradictory observations by distinguishing between diffusion-limited and coupling-driven growth processes. While transmembrane coupling slows down diffusion, it also locally concentrates condensates within a confined area. This confinement increases the probability of condensate coalescence and thereby enhances the overall rate of growth for coupled condensates, substantially surpassing the growth rate for uncoupled condensates. These findings suggest that transmembrane coupling could play a role in the assembly of diverse membrane-bound structures by promoting the localization and growth of protein complexes on both membrane surfaces. This phenomenon could help to explain the efficient assembly of transmembrane structures in diverse cellular contexts.

SignificanceProtein assemblies that span biological membranes are critical to cellular physiology. In the past decade, liquid-like protein condensates, which are flexible, multivalent protein assemblies, have been discovered on diverse membrane surfaces. Recently, we observed that protein condensates on opposite sides of a membrane spontaneously colocalize to form coupled, transmembrane complexes. Interestingly, while transmembrane coupling slows down the diffusion of membrane-bound condensates, it substantially accelerates their growth by strongly localizing interactions between them. These findings suggest that transmembrane coupling of protein condensates may play a role in promoting the robust assembly of membrane-bound protein complexes in crowded, complex cellular environments.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771561

However, our tools for deeply profiling how proteins co-occupy individual fibers, especially at the single-cell level, remain limited. We present Deaminase-Assisted single-molecule chromatin Fiber sequencing (DAF-seq), which leverages a non-specific double-stranded DNA deaminase toxin A (SsDddA) to efficiently stencil protein occupancy along DNA molecules via selective deamination of accessible cytidines, which are preserved via C-to-T transitions upon DNA amplification. We demonstrate that DAF-seq enables [~]200,000-fold enrichment of target loci for single-molecule footprinting at near single-nucleotide resolution, enabling the precise delineation of the regulatory logic guiding neighboring proteins to cooperatively occupy chromatin fibers. Furthermore, DAF-seq enables the synchronous identification of single-molecule chromatin and genetic architectures - resolving the functional impact of rare somatic variants, as well as transitional chromatin states guiding haplotype-selective promoter actuation. Finally, we demonstrate that single-cell DAF-seq enables the accurate reconstruction of the diploid genome and epigenome from a single cell, revealing that a cells accessible regulatory landscape can diverge by as much as 63% while still retaining the cells identity. Overall, DAF-seq enables the comprehensive characterization of protein occupancy and chromatin accessibility across entire chromosomes with single-nucleotide, single-molecule, single-haplotype, and single-cell precision.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771562

The mechanisms imposing a different crossover landscape in female and male meiosis remain elusive. Here, we simultaneously disrupted multiple anti-crossover mechanisms in Arabidopsis and analyzed the whole genome sequence of thousands of female- and male-derived progenies. The largest crossover increase was reached in zyp1 recq4, with 12-fold in females and a 4.5-fold increase in males. Despite this unprecedented level of crossovers, fertility is marginally affected, opening new possibilities for plant breeding. Manipulating additional crossover regulators in zyp1 recq4 did not further elevate the frequency of crossovers, but modified the relative contributions of the two known crossover pathways. This suggests an upper limit was reached and the two pathways compete for a large but limited set of recombination intermediates. Remarkably, while wild-type crossover distribution differs markedly between sexes, the crossover landscapes of diverse mutants in both females and males converge to a single novel profile, which we termed Crossover Potential (COP). The COP profile, which we defined using 49,482 crossovers, can be accurately predicted using only sequence divergence and chromatin features. We propose that the COP represents the density of eligible recombination precursors, which is determined by genomic features and is thus identical in females and males. It suggests that the sexual dimorphism in the crossover landscape results exclusively from differential regulation of the likeness of precursors to mature into crossovers.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771562

How external perturbations after initial exposure affect the duration of infection is unclear. We discovered that murine astrovirus, an enteric RNA virus, persists indefinitely when mice remain unperturbed but is cleared rapidly after cage change. Besides eliminating the external viral reservoir, cage change also induced a transcriptional defense response in the intestinal epithelium. We further identified that displacing infected animals initially caused a temporary period of immune suppression through the stress hormone corticosterone, which was followed by an immune rebound characterized by an increase in CD8 T cells responsible for the epithelial antiviral responses. Our findings show how viral persistence can be disrupted by preventing re-exposure and activating immunity upon stress recovery, indicating that external factors can be manipulated to shorten the duration of a viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771562

A key factor in their success is the ability to filter out erroneous k-mers by removing those with low abundances. However, large numbers of distinct k-mers make counting a memory-intensive step. Early tools addressed this issue by storing k-mers on disk. More recent solutions, mitigate the excessive redundancy of overlapping k-mers by partially reassembling them into super-k-mers. Nevertheless, consecutive super-k-mers still overlap by k - 1 bases, leading to some degree of inefficiency.

Here we present hyper-k-mers as an alternative, less redundant, representation of super-k-mers. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we propose hyper-k-mers, a new k-mer representation that asymptotically decreases duplication compared to super-k-mers. Second, we present a theoretical analysis comparing the space efficiency of super-k-mers, syncmers, and hyper-k-mers. Our approach offers significant advantages compared to super-k-mers, by reducing the asymptotic lower bound from 6 to 4 bits per nucleotide. Third, we present KFC, a k-mer counting algorithm leveraging hyper-k-mers. KFC offers significant practical advantages, including an order of magnitude improvement in memory usage compared to state-of-the-art tools. Notably, our experiments show that KFC is the only tool whose memory usage scales sub-linearly with k-mer size k, and is the fastest option when k is large.

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771562

Here we assess the ability of protein language models (PLMs), routinely applied to protein folding, to be retrained for PPI prediction. Existing PPI prediction models that exploit PLMs use a pre-trained PLM feature set, ignoring that the proteins are physically interacting. Our novel method, PLM-interact, goes beyond a single protein, jointly encoding protein pairs to learn their relationships, analogous to the next-sentence prediction task from natural language processing. This approach provides a significant improvement in performance: Trained on human-human PPIs, PLM-interact predicts mouse, fly, worm, E. coli and yeast PPIs, achieving between 16-28% improvements in AUPR compared with state-of-the-art PPI models. Additionally, it can detect changes that disrupt or cause PPIs and be applied to virus-host PPI prediction.

A subset of people with LC present with symptoms resembling those of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The objective of this study was to compare cortisol concentrations in those with and without Long COVID, with a particular focus on people experiencing ME/CFS-like Long COVID.

METHODSWe measured plasma cortisol in 200 individuals 3-6 months following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Banked biospecimens collected between 8 AM-12 PM were used. Participants met the case definition for Long COVID if they had [&ge;]1 COVID-attributed symptom at least 3 months after symptom onset. People who did not report any symptoms at least 3 months after symptom onset served as recovered controls. Adapting the 2015 Institute of Medicine criteria for ME/CFS, we further defined those with LC resembling ME/CFS (LC-ME).

RESULTSWe found no difference in overall morning cortisol concentrations between people with LC (n=144) and those who fully recovered (n=56) (median 8.9 {micro}g/dL vs. 8.8 {micro}g/dL, p=0.97). Analyses of samples collected between 8-10 AM, however, revealed that, compared to those who fully recovered, cortisol concentrations were lower between 8-9 AM for those with LC-ME (median 8.2 vs. 14.8, p=0.02), but higher between 9-10 AM for those with severe LC (>=5 symptoms) (median 12.4 vs. 8.5, p=0.009) and those with LC-ME (median 13.7 vs. 8.5, p=0.02).

CONCLUSIONWe found no difference in overall morning plasma cortisol concentrations between those with and without Long COVID. Although our data could be suggestive of altered morning cortisol dynamics in a subset of people with Long COVID, longitudinal measures of cortisol in individuals with Long COVID will be critical to further inform the biology of the condition.","NA","medrxiv",1731535771562

Computational analyses separated the principal and accessory members in chicken and lizard, identifying molecular signatures distinguishing either member from single cones and rods in the same species. Comparative transcriptomic analyses suggest that both the principal and accessory originated from ancestral red cones. Furthermore, the gene expression variation among cone subtypes mirrors their spectral order (red[-&gt;] green[-&gt;] blue[-&gt;] UV), suggesting a constraint in their order of emergence during evolution. Finally, we find that rods are equally dissimilar to all cone types, suggesting that they emerged before the spectral diversification of cones.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771562

Following CT-guided localised intestinal irradiation, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry revealed RT-induced chemokine-dependent recruitment of innate immune cells. Deletion of C-C chemokine receptor (Ccr)1, Ccr2, Ccr3 and Ccr5, blocked recruitment and worsened radiation induced toxicities, suggesting an important role for an innate immune cell population in limiting RT-mediated bowel damage.

Furthermore, CCR2-deficient mice showed exacerbated weight loss and intestinal permeability, while the transfer of Ly6C+ monocytes alleviated symptoms. Mechanistically, IL-17 cytokine production by group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), a critical factor in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, was found to be reduced in irradiated CCR2-/-, however the transfer of Ly6C+ monocytes resulted in increased IL-17 levels.

The extension of these concepts to microorganisms is however challenging and thus far only assumed. Here, we hypothesize that two closely related microbial species, if indeed similar in both their morphology and their ecological niche, should be found in samples with similar community compositions.

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently.

Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599.

Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1.

Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771562

Notably, both variants carry mutations, S31del of KP.3.1.1 and T22N of XEC, that could introduce new N-linked glycans on the Spike N-terminal domain (NTD), emphasizing the urgent need to assess their potential changes in viral characteristics. Here, we found that both KP.3.1.1 and XEC maintained the high ACE2-Spike binding affinity and pseudovirus infectivity of KP.3. Importantly, compared to KP.3, KP.3.1.1, and especially XEC, could further evade the neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma, even those elicited by KP.2-like breakthrough infections. Interestingly, both variants demonstrated increased resistance against monoclonal neutralizing antibodies targeting various epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD). These suggest that the additional NTD glycosylation of KP.3.1.1 and XEC could enhance immune evasion via allosteric effects, and supports the future prevalence of XEC.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771562

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771562

Generally, experienced bullying showed increased subcortical volumes in the putamen ({beta}=0.12), caudate ({beta}=0.06), accumbens ({beta}=0.06), amygdala ({beta}=0.07), hippocampus ({beta}=0.06), paired with decreased cerebellar ({beta}=-0.10), entorhinal, ({beta}=-0.12), and insula ({beta}=-0.11) volumes. Females exhibited more volumetric changes in emotional processing areas whereas males had more changes in motor and sensory regions. These findings point to widespread associations between bullying victimization and brain development, offering a potential neurobiological framework to explain the emotional and behavioral difficulties observed. Importantly, this study emphasizes the need for a sex-sensitive approach in future research and interventions related to bullying.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771562

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Translational PerspectiveHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a significant and growing global health concern lacking disease-modifying therapeutic options, reflecting inadequate preclinical models of the disease. Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we created the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, demonstrated phenotypic disease characteristics of elevated stiffness and slowed kinetics, showed transcriptomic consistency with HFpEF patient data, identified SERCA2a as a key downregulated gene, performed dosing titration of SERCA2a gene therapy, and showed improvement of cardiac kinetics post-treatment. The findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF.","NA","biorxiv",1731535771562

Animal studies have yielded rich insight into mechanisms for visual perception, but the neural mechanisms for visual imagery remain poorly understood. Here, we first determined that [~]80% of visually responsive single neurons in human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) used a distributed axis code to represent objects. We then used that code to reconstruct objects and generate maximally effective synthetic stimuli. Finally, we recorded responses from the same neural population while subjects imagined specific objects and found that [~]40% of axis-tuned VTC neurons recapitulated the visual code. Our findings reveal that visual imagery is supported by reactivation of the same neurons involved in perception, providing single neuron evidence for existence of a generative model in human VTC.
