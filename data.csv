Based on the number of formants, two different coda quality categories have been described: a-codas and i-codas. In the present paper, we demonstrate that sperm whale codas not only resemble human vowels acoustically, but also pattern like them across several dimensions. First, traditional count- and timing-based coda types interact with coda ""vowel"" quality (a vs. i). Second, a-codas are generally longer than i-codas. Third, the duration of i-codas has a bimodal distribution, showing a contrast between short i-codas and long[i] -codas. Fourth, the baseline coda length differs across whales. And fifth, edge clicks mismatching their coda often match an adjacent coda, a phenomenon that resembles human coarticulation. All five properties have close parallels in the phonetics and phonology of human languages. Sperm whale coda vocalizations thus represent one of the closest parallels to human phonology of any known animal communication system.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSperm whales communicate using series of clicks known as codas. The codas acoustically resemble human vowels. In addition, they pattern in ways similar to human sound systems. For example, different coda types are correlated with particular click qualities, and their durations are intentionally controlled. This shows that sperm whale vocalizations are highly complex and likely constitute one of the most sophisticated communication systems in the animal kingdom. By studying it, we may be able to gain a broader understanding of animal intelligence and social behaviors, determine the impact of human activities on whale habitat, develop strategies to protect whales from threats such as noise pollution and ship traffic, and advance legislation which facilitates that protection.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756159740650

REM sleep comprises about twenty percent of adult sleep, alternates between phasic and tonic periods, and includes delta waves (1-4Hz) in two forms: fast sawtooth waves and slower, NREM-like waves, whose expression dynamically varies across REM periods. Yet, the functional relevance of these REM sleep delta waves remains unknown. Here, using two independent cohorts, we show that aging is associated with a shift from fast sawtooth to slow NREM-like delta waves, particularly during phasic REM sleep, a period typically marked by high cortical activation. Beyond chronological age, this shift is associated with amyloid-beta and tau burden, suggesting that AD pathology disrupts REM-specific oscillatory patterns. Furthermore, this shift in REM oscillations is linked to impaired overnight memory consolidation, independent of NREM sleep quality. Moreover, variation in ApoE alleles, a major genetic risk factor for AD, was independently associated with a reduction in fast sawtooth wave density, thereby linking a genetic predisposition for AD to these specific REM microstructural changes. These findings identify a novel signature of memory decline in aging and implicate REM sleep as a distinct vulnerable substrate through which AD pathology may impair brain function.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RF1AG054106;""},{""name"":""Glenn Foundation for Medical Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebg5q27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756159740650

The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) integrates multiple metabolic inputs to produce uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a central substrate for protein and lipid glycoconjugates. While UDP-GlcNAc levels influence pluripotency, the broader metabolic roles of the HBP in stem cell maintenance and differentiation remain largely unexplored. Using proteomic and metabolomic analyses, we uncovered extensive enzymatic remodelling of the HBP during early mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation, including a significant decrease in N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc6P) levels, despite stable UDP-GlcNAc levels. Isotope labelling experiments revealed that pluripotent stem cells maintain UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis through a combination of glucose-driven de novo synthesis and the N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) salvage pathway, both of which are downregulated during differentiation. Functionally, we identified GlcNAc6P--a point of convergence of the de novo synthesis and the salvage pathways--as a pivotal metabolite of stem cell fate. Preventing GlcNAc6P's deacetylation by deleting or depleting AMDHD2 impaired mESC differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that GlcNAc6P catabolism is essential for sustaining cytosolic acetate and in turn acetyl-CoA levels, which are critical for lipid synthesis and histone modifications required for pluripotency exit. These findings establish AMDHD2 as a key supplier of cellular acetate and reveal an essential metabolic link between HBP activity and acetyl-CoA homeostasis. By expanding the role of the HBP beyond UDP-GlcNAc production, this study reveals an unrecognised metabolic vulnerability that can be exploited to manipulate stem cell identity.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE 2326/3-1;""},{""name"":""JÃ¼rgen Manchot Stiftung"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PhD project Lea Hund;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756159740650

The organism displays a surprisingly rich locomotor repertoire, emerging from the intricate dynamics of the cilia, which form a tight bundle when swimming. We leverage high-speed quantitative live imaging to extract the spectrum of possible ciliary beating patterns, and derive a dispersion relation coupling the temporal frequency and spatial wavelength of cilia oscillations. We further reconstruct the attractor manifold embedded in the behavioural space, showing that despite the range and complexity of ciliary beating modes, the underlying behavioural manifold is intrinsically low-dimensional with elaborate topological structure. Dynamic and excitable transitions in motility behaviour are encoded as trajectories in this space.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""853560;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DMS-2235451;""},{""name"":""Schmidt Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/044fk6795"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Polymath Award;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756159740650

Within these systems, bulk transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are critical substrates which deliver amino acids to the elongating ribosome. For years, CFE systems were completed with commercially available tRNA isolated from E. coli MRE600. All commercial sources of tRNA have since been discontinued, jeopardizing future work in all applications of cell-free translation.

Here, we address this need by repurposing previously described tRNA isolation methods to produce tRNAs suitable for CFE applications. We isolated the tRNA pools of E. coli strains A19, BL21(DE3), and Rosetta2 BL21(DE3), finding A19 tRNAs but not BL21(DE3) or Rosetta2 BL21(DE3) capable of robust in vitro translation. We determined the abundances of individual tRNAs using tRNA-seq, finding BL21(DE3) and Rosetta2 BL21(DE3) contained outsized abundances of several tRNAs, compromising translation activity. Using codon optimization strategies which align codon usage to tRNA abundance, we were able to mitigate the impact of misaligned tRNA abundances. We extended these studies to V. natriegens, a promising platform for synthetic biology and CFE. We find that neither exogenous V. natriegens tRNAs nor codon optimization are viable options to improve translation yields. Our work here highlights the importance of tRNA abundance within the context of CFE, and simultaneously addresses a critical challenge within cell-free translation.","[{""name"":""Alfred P.

The IUCN Red List provides guidelines for assessing climate-related extinction risk using species distribution models (SDMs) and spatially explicit population models (SEPMs). However, a systematic evaluation of these guidelines is currently missing. Using simulations of virtual species with diverse life-history traits and range dynamics, we found that SDMs consistently underestimated extinction risk for range-shifting species. This was due to a concave relationship between population size and habitat loss, which contradicts the linear assumption in the Red List guidelines. For range-contracting species, SDMs provided adequate warning times. Probabilistic extinction estimates from SEPMs provided delayed warning for all species, particularly for highly threatened ones. Our results reveal key limitations of current Red List guidelines under climate change.

Their virulence can be affected by both the host immune system, as well as diverse host-associated bacteria. Generally, how these factors interact is not well studied, but may provide insights toward sustainable plant protection. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Ssc) is a devastating, broad host range necrotrophic pathogen with limited control options. Here, we find that necrotic Ssc lesions strongly enrich diverse bacterial taxa. Arabidopsis thaliana, like other Brassica plants including crops, produce and store large amounts of aliphatic glucosinolates (aGLS). Upon Ssc invasion and tissue damage, myrosinase enzymes transform aGLS into toxic metabolites, including aliphatic isothiocyanates (aITCs). Adapted Ssc strains can detoxify aITCs by hydrolyzing them with the enzyme SaxA, which is important for its virulence. Here, we find that this detoxification is critical for bacterial enrichment in necrotic lesions, since a SaxA-deficient strain does not alter the bacteriome. Additionally, our results suggest that both aliphatic and other GLSs likely contribute specific effects to this phenomenon. Thus, we demonstrate a mechanism in which the interaction of host and pathogen factors together shape a pathogen-associated bacteriome, providing directions to better understand interactions of host bacteria with foliar necrotic pathogens.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EXC 2051 - Projektnummer 390713860;Projektnummer 458884166;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756159740650

Our attempts to capture it has thus far been limited to the addition of individual features of complexity to stochastic models, leading to limited insights into its origin. Based on the idea that the morphologies of neurons underlies the network structure, we developed an intuitive explanation for the mechanisms leading to structured, non-random connectivity. While a class of neurons on average innervates its entire surroundings, each individual one can only cover a small part of the space. That part is different for each neuron, but in a way that is not completely random, as it must be spatially continuous due to the physicality of neurites. We tested predictions from our hypothesis successfully in biophysically-detailed models and an electron-microscopic (EM) reconstruction of cortical connectivity. We distilled it into a simple stochastic algorithm that generates networks, which accurately match the EM reconstruction in basic network statistics as well as functionally relevant metrics of complexity. Our work may improve the understanding of the impact of neuron malformations and enable the study of the functional role of non-random network structure in simplified models.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756159740650

Gene flow--via within-population dispersal and external immigration--shapes population health and evolutionary potential by boosting genetic diversity, but it can also counteract local adaptation. We investigate these processes in a population of great tits (Parus major) in Wytham Woods, United Kingdom. This system represents a large, continuous population of a vagile, widely distributed species. Using a comprehensive social pedigree alongside genomic data from two genomic datasets, one with 949 individuals genotyped at ~600,000 SNPs and another with 2,644 individuals at ~10,000 SNPs, we observe some spatial genetic structure largely driven by the spatial and temporal clustering of close kin. We quantify how temporally persistent this pattern is and find similar levels of decay of relatedness with distance across years, without a consistent genetic basis, which is frequently renewed due to high population turnover. Immigrants make up a substantial portion of the breeding population, yet are often assumed to be genetically distinct, unrelated, and outbred--assumptions that can bias population inferences. We show that immigrants are indeed outbred, as are local birds; have fewer close relatives within the population, and are less likely to be related to their neighbours than locally born birds. Despite low FST and no clear genome-wide population structure, immigrants and locals can be distinguished above chance using a Random Forest classifier trained on SNP data. Our study highlights the complex interplay between dispersal, population turnover and spatial population structure, and suggests that great tits in Wytham Woods experience substantial gene flow within the population and from immigrants, maintaining high genetic diversity and reducing the possibility of local adaptation at this spatial scale.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""250164;202487;""},{""name"":""Natural Environment Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02b5d8509"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NE/J012599;""},{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001aqnf71"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X024520/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756159740650

Players often rely on caffeinated or sugary drinks to combat fatigue, but regular use poses health risks. Sparkling water, a sugar- and caffeine-free beverage, stimulates brainstem and prefrontal activity via sensory pathways mediated by transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in the throat. We here tested the hypothesis that sparkling water mitigates cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play. Fifteen young adult players participated in a randomized crossover trial, each completing two 3-hour sessions of a virtual football game while consuming either sparkling water or plain water. Subjective fatigue, enjoyment, and executive function (via a flanker task) were measured at baseline and hourly, while pupil diameter and heart rate were monitored continuously. Blood glucose and salivary cortisol were also assessed periodically.

Compared to plain water, sparkling water significantly attenuated increases in subjective fatigue, enhanced enjoyment, and preserved executive function, along with preventing pupil constriction. Heart rate, blood glucose, and salivary cortisol levels did not differ between conditions. Notably, players committed fewer in-game fouls with sparkling water, while offensive and defensive performance remained unchanged. These findings demonstrate that sparkling water alleviates both subjective and objective signs of cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play, supporting our hypothesis. This non-caffeinated intervention may help sustain inhibitory control and promote fair behavior, offering a safe and sustainable strategy for managing mental fatigue in modern life.

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B âMeiosisâ;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756159740650

Despite their critical role, the structural organization of kinetochores assembled on centromeres with vastly distinct architectures across diverse species remains poorly understood2,3. To address this question, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the inner kinetochore (CCAN) from the silkmoth Bombyx mori, an insect that lacks the canonical centromere-specifying histone variant CENP-A and exhibits chromosome-wide centromeric activity (holocentric). Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour lâEducation et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756159740650

Here, we connect cell state dynamics of type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2) in cholangitis with site-specific{gamma}{delta} T17 responses in liver and draining lymph nodes (LN).

MethodsThe 0.1% Diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-Dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet was used to generate an immunobiliary DC- and{gamma}{delta} T-enriched mouse liver and LN single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas covering temporal disease dynamics, resolution and cDC2B depletion. cDC2 trajectories were inferred using VarID2 and{gamma}{delta} T cell transcription factor (TF) regulon activity was predicted by SCENIC. The human biliary niche was resolved by integrating human liver scRNA-seq data with available spatial transcriptomics data. Functional studies were conducted using Tcrd knockout, Il17a/f knockout and Tcrd reporter mice.

ResultsA disease trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B was identified connecting DC maturation, homing and the expression of Il17-inducing genes. Disease progression was associated with numeric exhaustion of mature cDC2B and recruitment of DC precursors.{gamma}{delta} T cells were the main Il17 producers and were subtyped into Il17ahigh Scart1+ V{gamma}6+ and Il17low Scart2+ V{gamma}4+ populations exhibiting cDC2-directed communication and divergent TF regulon activity. Spatial proximity and conserved molecular interactions of cDC2 and{gamma}{delta} T cells were confirmed in human cholangitis. Il17-deficiency resulted in reduced liver fibrosis in mice, while cDC2B depletion attenuated{gamma}{delta} T17 cell states.

ConclusionsIn cholangitis, a profibrogenic function of{gamma}{delta} T cells is contingent on the induction by peribiliary cDC2B, thereby highlighting relevant disease determinants within the immunobiliary and liver-draining LN niche.

Impact and ImplicationsThe immunobiliary niche contains rare immune cells such as conventional dendritic cells and unconventional T cells, however, the function of these cell types in liver inflammation remains poorly understood. Mirroring human biliary diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, we induced experimental cholangitis in a mouse model to generate a site-specific single-cell sequencing atlas resource resolving underexplored cell populations. Our data capture a profibrotic hepatic disease state trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B inducing a{gamma}{delta} T cell-specific Il17-response, which is attenuated upon cDC2B depletion and in DC precursors, which are characterized by reduced genomic accessibility of{gamma}{delta} T cell-interacting genes.

These results highlight the importance of portal niche residing underexplored immune cell populations and the necessity to further resolve immunobiliary niche responses and crosstalk in inflammatory settings such as in cholangitis.

A key component of social behavior is approach, where animals actively move to-ward social partners to maintain group cohesion, establish affiliations, and coordinate actions. While a continuous stream of social information is encoded across sensory modalities, it remains unclear whether a distinct neural process underlies social approach. Here, we developed a novel assay in which a head-fixed, tail-free zebrafish interacts with a freely swimming conspecific, enabling precise quantification of social behavior alongside whole-brain functional imaging at cellular resolution. We demonstrate that zebrafish approach behavior is jointly shaped by spatial and temporal information from conspecifics rather than by these features acting independently. Social approach behavior is preceded by distinct brain-wide neural activity patterns emerging seconds before movement onset, characterized by increased activity in a small subset of forebrain neurons and decreased activity in midbrain and hindbrain neuronal populations. These activity patterns reliably predict upcoming approach movements from each of these regions separately. Moreover, the extent to which neural activity distinguishes approach from non-approach movements predicts individual differences in social behavior, directly linking neural dynamics to behavioral variability. Together, our findings reveal a neural mechanism underlying social approach behavior, highlighting how a distributed yet functionally coordinated network facilitates social interaction.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756159740650
