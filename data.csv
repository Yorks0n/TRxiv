ObjectiveTo estimate the impacts of federal policy changes on PrEP coverage, new HIV infections and costs associated with new HIV infections

DesignEstimation of excess HIV infections under different policy impacts were conducted using parameters from a previously published ecological model of the relationship between PrEP coverage and new HIV infections. Costs were estimated for the treatment of infections not averted under different scenarios.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsThere was no individual participation in research activities; population-based data sources were used to describe the population-level PrEP use and new diagnoses under different hypothetical changes in PrEP coverage.

ExposuresPercent of people with indications for PrEP who are taking PrEP

Main Outcome and MeasuresEstimated change in new HIV infections under different assumptions of change in PrEP coverage; costs of treatment for avoidable HIV infections and net costs of avoidable infections after accounting for costs of PrEP medications.

ResultsEven modest reductions in PrEP coverage would result in thousands of avoidable HIV infections. An absolute 3.3% annual reduction in PrEP coverage over the next decade would result in 8,618 avoidable HIV infections, with lifetime medical costs of over $3.6 billion (discounted) for treatment of the unaverted HIV infections.

Conclusions and RelevanceChanges in policy that reduce PrEP uptake would result in avoidable HIV infections and increased costs for HIV treatment. Maintaining policies and programs that support PrEP uptake offers benefits for health and is estimated to result in net cost savings.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the likely impacts on HIV transmissions and healthcare costs if policy changes result in decreased PrEP utilization in the United States?

FindingsUnder assumptions of even modest reductions in PrEP use, we estimated thousands of HIV infections would fail to be averted over the next decade, and billions of dollars of additional treatment costs would accrue to the healthcare system.

Results of the studyWe used historical descriptive data on the US HIV epidemic to quantify the relationship between PrEP coverage and trends in HIV diagnoses and to estimate future trends in HIV infections if PrEP coverage were to be rolled back. If PrEP use declines modestly - about 3% annually - we estimate that 8,618 new infections would fail to be averted in a decade because of lowered PrEP uptake, and the estimated lifetime medical costs of these unaverted infections would be $3.6 billion (discounted) and $9.3 billion (undiscounted).

MeaningChanges in healthcare priorities and policies, especially those that increase out of pocket costs of PrEP or reduce the convenience of engaging in PrEP care, risk rolling back our progress in ending the HIV epidemic, accruing avertable HIV infections, and incurring increased costs for medical care of people whose HIV infections were avoidable.","NA","medrxiv",1751062156278

South Africa is unique in the region because its HIV programme is largely domestically funded, although donor funds and partnerships support key components. We estimated the epidemiological impact of ceased PEPFAR support for specific services and the costs and cost-effectiveness of the South African government (SAG) potentially taking over these services.

MethodsWe used a costed version of Thembisa, a South African HIV transmission model, to simulate four scenarios: a minimum scenario assuming intervention coverage reducing proportional to PEPFARs funding share of specific activities in 2023; a maximum scenario assuming additional health system impacts; and sub-scenarios either with 3-year recovery (2029-2031) or no recovery to previous coverage. HIV programme costs were estimated from the provider perspective (SAG) in 2024/25 US dollars.

ResultsOver 2025-2028, discontinuing PEPFAR funding in South Africa without replacement by SAG would result in 150,000-296,000 additional new HIV infections (29-56% increase) and 56,000-65,000 additional AIDS-related deaths (33-38%). Permanent discontinuation of currently PEPFAR-supported services over the next 20 years increases this to 1.1-2.1 million additional new HIV infections and 519,000-712,000 additional AIDS deaths. To sustain services, SAG needs to spend an additional $710 million to $1.5 billion between 2025 and 2028. Under a reduced budget, the most cost-effective interventions to preserve are ART and PrEP.

ConclusionUnmanaged PEPFAR exit from South Africa threatens to undo a decade of progress towards ending AIDS as a public health threat unless services are taken over by other funders, including SAG.","10.1097/QAD.0000000000004272","medrxiv",1751062156279

Symptoms of sympathetic dysfunction are prevalent in diabetes, affecting up to 90% of patients. The molecular and cellular composition of the human SCG and its alteration in diabetes remains poorly defined. To address this gap, we performed spatial transcriptomic profiling of lumbar SCGs from diabetic and non-diabetic organ donors. We identified 3 three distinct neuronal populations, two noradrenergic (NA1 and NA2) and one cholinergic (CHO), based on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and SLC18A3 expression, respectively. We also characterized 9 non-neuronal populations consisting of Schwann cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, adipocytes, and endothelial cells. In diabetic SCGs, we observed a significant loss of myelinating Schwann cells and a phenotypic shift of cholinergic neurons toward a noradrenergic identity. Additionally, diabetes was associated with a significant reduction in the transcripts of vasodilatory neuropeptides, such as VIP and CALCA, suggesting a mechanism for impaired vascular control. Upstream regulator analysis highlighted altered neurotrophic signaling in diabetes, with enhanced NGF/TRKA and diminished BDNF/TRKB activity, potentially driven by target-derived cues. Comparison between SCG and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons revealed ganglia-specific genes, like SCN3A and NPY (SCG) versus SCN10A and GPX1 (DRG), offering specific therapeutic targets for autonomic dysfunction or pain. Our findings provide a transcriptomic characterization of human SCG, revealing molecular signatures that underlie diabetic autonomic dysfunction. This work lays a foundation for the development of therapies to restore sympathetic function and avoid unintended autonomic effects in the development of analgesics.","NA","biorxiv",1751062156279

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

A fundamental yet largely unresolved question is which stimulus features the brain predicts, and therefore, what kind of surprise drives neural responses. Here, we investigated this question using EEG and computational modelling based on deep neural networks (DNNs). Participants viewed object images whose identity was probabilistically predicted by preceding cues. We then quantified trial-by-trial surprise at both low-level (early DNN layers) and high-level (late DNN layers) visual feature representations. Results showed that stimulus-evoked responses around 200ms post-stimulus onset over parieto-occipital electrodes were increased by high-level, but not by low-level visual surprise. These findings demonstrate that high-level visual predictions are rapidly integrated into perceptual inference, suggesting that the brains predictive machinery is finely tuned to utilize expectations abstracted away from low-level sensory details to facilitate perception.","NA","biorxiv",1751062156279

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

However, despite the available transcriptomic data, no focused phylotranscriptomic study has been conducted to characterize the patterns of molecular evolution in this group. In this study, we leverage a dataset composed predominately of publicly available transcriptomes to infer relationships within Apocynaceae and explore the molecular processes that have shaped their divergences.

MethodsWe extracted nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial genes from 47 publicly available and one newly sequenced transcriptome to assemble and infer species relationships across Apocynaceae. Leveraging the gene-rich nuclear phylotranscriptomic data, we inferred molecular dates and investigated the complex history of gene tree conflict, molecular rate shifts, and gene duplications. To investigate the genomic basis of adaptations, we analyzed the inferred 14,838 gene duplications at the base of Apocynaceae for shared functional enrichment of genes related to evolutionary innovations.

Key ResultsThe Apocynaceae topology inferred from our phylotranscriptomic analysis is highly concordant with the current consensus. Notably, a genome-wide acceleration in molecular rate subtends the Ceropegieae tribe. We observed that a decreased time between divergences is associated with a higher rate of gene tree conflict, a pattern especially prevalent across the Apocynaceaes historically recalcitrant backbone relationships. Furthermore, gene duplications may underlie evolutionary innovations, such as immunity-related gene expansion in the genus Asclepias and duplications associated with trichome modifications in the epiphytic Hoya.

Finally, we discuss the contentious history of whole-genome duplication (WGD) within the Apocynaceae and emphasize the need for further investigation into the placement of WGDs.

ConclusionsRepurposing transcriptomes is a powerful means of accumulating data for novel insights in plant evolution, especially during uncertain funding and cases where budget restrictions exist. Leveraging this gene-dense dataset, we obtained novel insights into the molecular evolution of Apocynaceae and identified areas for future investigations.","NA","biorxiv",1751062156279

This study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying interoceptive attention by examining beta-band power suppression during heartbeat and auditory discrimination tasks. Fifty-one healthy participants engaged in interoceptive (heartbeat detection) and exteroceptive (auditory discrimination) tasks while their brain activity was measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The results revealed significant beta suppression time-locked to the R-peak in the somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, mid-cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 310 to 530 ms post-R-peak. Beta suppression was more pronounced during interoceptive attention, correlating positively with interoceptive accuracy. The findings support the notion that beta suppression in fronto-cingulo- somatosensory network may serve as a neural marker of interoceptive processing, contributing to predictive coding models of interoception. This study highlights the potential for using beta suppression as an objective measure of interoceptive accuracy and suggests that neural oscillations play a critical role in the brains regulation of heartbeat-related information. Furthermore, the study proposes that interoceptive attention involves a top-down mechanism that dynamically adjusts the brains response to cardiac afferent signals, enhancing the precision of interoceptive processing. These findings have implications for understanding how the brain integrates interoceptive signals and may provide insights into clinical applications targeting interoceptive dysfunctions.","NA","biorxiv",1751062156279

An infectious etiology is strongly suspected, but no causative microorganism has yet been identified. We therefore conducted an age- and sex-matched case-control culturomics study to isolate bacterial species associated with noma and assess their cytotoxicity, their genomic toxin content, and their antibiotic susceptibility. Methods: A case-control study was conducted in 2023 in the Diourbel region (Senegal) among children aged 5 to 9 years. Gingival plaque samples were analyzed by microbial culturomics. In addition, cytotoxic tests were performed on MRC5 cells, followed by analysis of the toxin genomic content. Results: A total of five cases of noma and five age- and sex-matched controls were included. 102 species were isolated, including five previously unknown species. The cariogenic species Streptococcus mutans and Scardovia wiggsiae were only detected in noma cases. Interestingly, all seven strains of S. wiggsiae were cytotoxic. Similarly, eight strains of the Bacillus cereus group were only identified in cases, including six cytotoxic strains. After genomic sequencing, six strains of Bacillus pacificus and two strains of Bacillus anthracis (pXO1 and pXO2 negative) were identified. Genes encoding typical toxins for the Bacillus cereus group (hbl, nhe, ces, entFM, bceT, hlyIII) were found in all eight strains of the B. cereus group, but the necrotizing cytotoxins K1 (cytK-1) and K2 (cytK-2) were only identified in B. anthracis. Among the five new species, Ferdinandcohnia sokhnae sp. nov. was isolated from a child with noma and was cytotoxic. Overall, at least one cytotoxic strain was isolated from each case, but none were found in the controls. B. anthracis, B. pacificus and F. sokhnae strains were all susceptible to clindamycin and vancomycin but resistant to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid and metronidazole. In contrast, all S. wiggsiae strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, but resistant to metronidazole. Conclusion: A microbial specificity was observed in noma characterized by cytotoxic strains with the unexpected isolation of B. anthracis whose genome encoded a previously described necrotizing toxin (CytK1). Antibiotic susceptibility results did not support the use of metronidazole. Microbiota analysis using microbial culturomics was instrumental in these findings, which opens new avenues for understanding the mechanisms of the disease, and for improving WHO and UNICEF guidelines.

Many organisms with symbiotic microorganisms have developed elaborate vertical transmission mechanisms, which are thought to be important for the evolution of intimate symbiotic relationships with microorganisms. One such case is the cockroach-Blattabacterium endosymbiosis, in which the symbiotic bacteria have been evolutionarily conserved and co-speciated with the host insects with stable vertical symbiont transmission via ovarial passage. While classical histological descriptions and recent electron microscopic observations have reported the vertical symbiont transmission processes in some cockroach-Blattabacterium associations, the full picture of the infection dynamics has not been fully understood. In this study, we conducted detailed histological and cytological observations of the localization of the bacteriocytes and the symbiotic bacteria during the postembryonic development of the German cockroach Blattella germanica. We found that the symbiont-filled bacteriocytes migrate into and associate with nymphal ovaries and are subsequently eliminated from adult ovaries, suggesting that symbiont infection to the ovaries may only occur during nymphal stages. We also found that the symbiotic bacteria are localized in the space between each oocyte and surrounding follicle cells, the symbiont-localized space is interconnected between neighboring oocytes, and therefore the symbiotic bacteria can move across oocytes within the same ovariole, suggesting the possibility that the symbiont-infected oocytes may serve as the source of symbiont supply to developing young oocytes upstream in the same ovariole. Based on these observations, we provide a hypothesis as to how the postembryonic developmental dynamics of the bacteriocytes are integrated into the vertical symbiont transmission and functioning in the cockroach-Blattabacterium endosymbiosis.","NA","biorxiv",1751062156279

MORU works closely with a network of community advisory boards (CABs), with members drawn from communities served by its research sites. In 2019, we set up the Bangkok Health Research and Ethics Interest Group (HREIG). HREIG is an urban CAB composed of Bangkok residents from all walks of life who have an interest in health research, but do not have a professional health research background. HREIG advises on clinical research and broader societal issues, complementing MORUs rural CABs in areas such as the Thai-Myanmar border and Cambodia. In 2022, the group had 14 members aged 22 to 51. Initially, meetings were held in person and in English, to support discussion with international researchers. During COVID-19 restrictions, meetings moved online and adopted Thai as the main language.

Main bodyTo evaluate the groups first two years, we conducted a mixed-methods study using focus group discussions and anonymous online surveys with group members, researchers and facilitators. We found that members joined to contribute to research and society, and for personal benefits such as learning about health research or meeting new people. While some valued practicing English, it made harder for members to contribute equally, and even those with good conversational English struggled with technical terms. Researchers reported that engaging with the group helped improve their communication skills, and that they valued hearing lay perspectives. Facilitators strengthened their skills in areas such as facilitation, online collaboration, and explaining research in lay terms. As HREIG is not tied to a specific study, its contributions have ranged from improving malaria messaging for the Thai public to testing COVID-19 surveys, or sharing opinions on vaccines and clinical trial participation.

ConclusionOur findings offer an in-depth insight into the experiences of HREIG members, researchers and facilitators. We share the outcomes of the groups activities, and the lessons learnt from running a CAB in an international research environment. We hope that our findings will help others who would like to set up a CAB in a similar context.

Plain English summaryThe Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU), headquartered in Bangkok, carries out research on tropical medicine and global health. MORU works closely with a network of community advisory boards (CABs). In 2019, we set up the Bangkok Health Research and Ethics Interest Group (HREIG). Its members are Bangkok residents from all walks of life who have an interest in health research, but do not have a professional health research background. HREIG advises on clinical research and broader societal issues, such as data sharing or artificial intelligence. By 2022, the group had 14 members aged 22 to 51. Initially, meetings were held in English and in person; during COVID-19 restrictions, they shifted online and adopted Thai as the main language.

After two years, we asked members, researchers and facilitators for their feedback on the group. HREIG members had joined the group to contribute to research and society, and for personal benefits, such as learning about health research or meeting new people. Although some members enjoyed practicing English, it made harder for members to contribute equally. Researchers had improved their communication skills, and valued hearing from non-scientists. Facilitators had expanded their professional skills as well. The groups feedback was important for many studies, including improving communications about malaria for the Thai public, testing COVID-19 survey questions or sharing views about vaccines.

Our findings offer an in-depth insight into the experiences of HREIG members, researchers and facilitators. We hope that our findings will help others who would like to set up a CAB in a similar setting.

Yet, the effectiveness across different patient subgroups is often poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate how one can use causal machine learning (ML) together with real-world data to identify which patient groups are most likely to benefit from off-label use. Specifically, we assessed the effectiveness of off-label use of amiodarone in patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF). NOAF can often lead to hemodynamic instability and rapid ventricular response, so that hemodynamic stability should be restored. We developed a causal ML model to predict individualized treatment effects (ITEs) of off-label amiodarone use on the probability of returning to hemodynamic stability. We used real-world data from the U.S. to develop the causal ML model and externally evaluated that model on real-world data from the Netherlands. Our predicted ITEs show that 44.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38.4% to 51.0%) of patients benefit from off-label use of amiodarone with large heterogeneity: amiodarone is predicted to increase the probability of restoring hemodynamic stability by a mean of 0.5 percentage points (pp), with an interquartile range (IQR) of -1.1 pp to 1.0 pp, in the external dataset from the Netherlands. Using these ITEs, we defined a personalized treatment rule, which could increase the number of patients achieving hemodynamic stability by 4.4% (95% CI: 1.0% to 7.8%) compared to current practice. Additionally, we studied which biomarkers are predictive of treatment effect heterogeneity and found that patients with higher blood pressure may benefit most from off-label use of amiodarone. Altogether, our study shows the potential of causal ML together with real-world data in identifying patients who benefit from off-label drug use.","NA","medrxiv",1751062156279

Dynamic prediction models update survival curves as new disease progression data become available, often by summarizing the data into scalar values. To reduce data compression, we propose a sparse multivariate functional Cox landmarking model. At each landmark time, our approach first applies sparse multivariate functional principal component analysis (FPCA) to estimate individual disease progression trajectories and then uses a linear functional Cox model to dynamically predict individual survival curves. Simulation studies demonstrate the model's ability to recover functional coefficients in different scenarios and its superior predictive performance. Our model is applied to Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) National History Consortium (NHC) data to dynamically predict risk incorporating the full trajectory of disease progression. External validation using data from Emory University's ALS Clinic further confirms its predictive advantage over non-functional counterparts.","NA","medrxiv",1751062156279

To address this, we systematically analyzed all LOAD-associated regions reported by Bellenguez et al. using the FILER functional genomics catalog across 174 datasets, including enhancers, transcription factors, and quantitative trait loci. We identified 42 candidate causal variant-effector gene pairs and assessed their impact using enhancer-promoter interaction data, variant annotations, and brain cell-type-specific gene expression. Notably, the LOAD risk allele of rs74504435 at the SEC61G locus was computationally predicted to increase EGFR expression in LOAD related cell types: microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Functional validation using promoter-focused Capture C, ATAC-seq, and CRISPR interference in the HMC3 human microglia cell line confirmed this regulatory relationship. Our findings reveal a microglial enhancer regulating EGFR in LOAD, suggesting EGFR inhibitors as a potential therapeutic avenue for the disease.","NA","medrxiv",1751062156279

Here, we describe two individuals carrying monoallelic de novo variants in PSMB8, both presenting with early-onset systemic autoinflammation and features of immunodeficiency, accompanied by a marked type I interferon response. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we performed complexome profiling on interferon-{gamma}-stimulated fibroblasts harboring the p.(Ala235Asp) variant. This variant, located at the {beta}-ring interface, disrupted proper assembly of the immunoproteasome, resulting in reduced levels of fully assembled 20S and 26S immunoproteasomes and accumulation of assembly intermediates.

This pattern, known as biological motion, is instantly recognizable and conveys ""animacy,"" even when body shape is removed and only a cloud of moving dots is shown. The motion alone is so informative that some animals can reconstruct the original shape. Jumping spiders, highly visual arthropods, divide motion detection and shape recognition between their four pairs of eyes. Previous studies showed that they can distinguish biological from non-biological motion using only their anterior lateral eyes, yet seemed unable to extract shape from motion. In this study, we examined how the anterior medial eyes of jumping spiders-which are used for shape recognition-respond to dot clouds depicting biological or non-biological motion. Using a custom eye tracker, we monitored retinal movements during presentation of static and moving stimuli. We found spiders change their retinal shifting pattern based on both the target's motion (biological or not) and implied structure (i.e., whether dots suggest a coherent shape). These results reveal that jumping spiders analyze motion with more complexity than previously thought, suggesting a deeper integration of motion and form processing within their minuscule, modular brains.","NA","biorxiv",1751062156279

Understanding how the Healthy Eating Index-2020 (HEI-2020) can be used as a measure of diet quality to create benchmarks for national nutrition monitoring can assist in surveillance and improve the design of nutrition programs and policies.

ObjectiveTo examine the utility of the HEI-2020 to create benchmarks for national diet quality monitoring.

MethodsThis serial cross-sectional study used data from the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Nationally representative data for 22,168 US adults ([&ge;]20 years) who completed two 24-hour recalls were analyzed. We derived HEI-2020 scores (0-100) from participants two 24-hour dietary recalls. Diet quality categories were established: high diet quality (>70-100), marginal (>60-70), low (>50-60), and very low (0-50).

ResultsOnly 13% of US adults had high diet quality while nearly two-thirds had low or very low diet quality. Diet quality was higher for older adults, female, ""Other"" race or ethnicity, born outside of the US, have higher education attainment, higher income, and food security. Compared to adults with high diet quality, adults with very low diet quality had lower intakes of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and seafood and the highest intakes of ultra-processed foods, refined grains, and red and processed meats (all P-trends <0.01). Adults with very low diet quality were more likely to have elevated adiposity, lower HDL cholesterol, and higher triglycerides, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c (all P-trends [&le;]0.01).

ConclusionsThe HEI-2020 is a robust measure of diet quality that can be directly linked to biological measures associated with chronic disease risk. Using evidence-based HEI categories could allow policymakers, public health practitioners, and nutrition professionals to set benchmarks and nationwide targets for achieving improved diet quality.","NA","medrxiv",1751062156279

Rationally predicting individual-specific success or failure of probiotic and prebiotic interventions remains an outstanding challenge. In this study, we leverage microbial community-scale metabolic models (MCMMs) to predict probiotic engraftment and shifts in microbiota-mediated short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in response to a synbiotic intervention. Using data from a placebo-controlled synbiotic intervention trial, involving a cocktail of five probiotic strains and the prebiotic inulin, we validate model engraftment predictions with quantitative PCR (qPCR), demonstrating that MCMMs accurately predict probiotic engraftment outcomes in the treatment group with over 85% accuracy. Engraftment varied by species, with Akkermansia muciniphila and Bifidobacterium infantis displaying higher engraftment rates than Clostridium beijerinckii, Anaerobutyricum hallii, and Clostridium butyricum. Furthermore, MCMMs predicted significant increases in butyrate and propionate production following synbiotic treatment. MCMM-predicted changes in propionate production in the treatment group were negatively associated with changes in C-reactive protein (CRP), a blood marker of systemic inflammation, from baseline to 12 weeks after the synbiotic intervention. Finally, we explore MCMM-predicted responses to a wider range of synbiotic combinations in a larger observational cohort, suggesting that personalized prebiotic selection can augment probiotic efficacy. These findings highlight the potential of metabolic modeling to inform precision microbiome therapeutics.","NA","medrxiv",1751062156279

This study details the clinical process development and application of an OSC product, known as Fertilo, to improve the in vitro maturation (IVM) of human oocytes, a method referred to as OSC-IVM. First, transcription factor (TF) mediated OSC differentiation using research-grade raw materials was shown to produce granulosa-like cells that improve the MII maturation rate of human oocytes. To support clinical application, several raw material upgrades were initiated, including substitution of the differentiation matrix with a higher-quality alternative, laminin-521, and the generation of a clinically suitable hiPSC seed bank and master cell bank. Single cell RNA sequencing of OSCs generated using the updated protocol for clinical translation demonstrated the consistency and reproducibility of cellular outcomes. Next, analytical release testing of the clinical product was performed and a murine oocyte maturation assay was developed to establish the potency of OSCs for use in OSC-IVM. Finally, the qualified Fertilo product was applied in a two-phase longitudinal cohort analysis, with the results showing improvement in key outcomes compared to traditional IVM treatment.

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1751062156279

DesignMatched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]). Negative control outcomes did not show any indication of meaningful unobserved residual confounding.

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. They underscore the need to evaluate vaccines using clinical endpoints that extend beyond their targeted diseases.

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1751062156279

This qualitative study explores the lived experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) following the implementation of Covid-19 vaccine mandates in Albertas health sector. It draws on 80 responses to a single open-ended question from a survey of 190 HCWs in the province across vaccination statuses. We performed a manual sentiment analysis, classifying entries as positive, neutral, or negative - depending on their normative orientation towards vaccination mandates - using Weberian ideal types as a conceptual framework.

Most respondents (82.5%) expressed negative sentiments, with close to one fifth (17.5%) offering positive views; no entries were coded as neutral. Themes within negative responses included coercion, ethical conflict, professional exclusion, institutional betrayal, and suppression of dissent. Many vaccinated HCWs described complying under duress, challenging the assumption that uptake signals endorsement. The most salient theme was that of moral injury - defined as the distress caused by acting against ones conscience, witnessing perceived harm, or remaining silent under institutional pressure. In contrast, positive responses emphasized professional duty and public safety, often rejecting the legitimacy of dissenting perspectives.

Our findings underscore the deeply polarizing nature of vaccination mandates and complicate dominant narratives that equate compliance with consent. Further, in contrast to clinical conceptions rooted in combat or bedside trauma, our analysis situates moral injury in the structural conditions created by public health policies, offering a lens for assessing their implications for the wellbeing of HCWs, quality care, and ethical healthcare practice and policy. We conclude that future public health policies, especially those justified under claims of emergency, must include built-in safeguards for ethical integrity and democratic participation.","NA","medrxiv",1751062156279

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1751062156279
