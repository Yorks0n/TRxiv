We estimated population-level immunity to SARS-CoV-2 for each of the fifty United States (U.S.) and the District of Columbia from January 2020 through December 2023.

MethodsWe updated a model of SARS-CoV-2 infections to align with the latest evidence on SARS-CoV-2 natural history and waning of immunity, and to integrate various data sources available throughout the pandemic. We used this model to produce population estimates of effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease.

ResultsOn December 30, 2023, 99.9% of the U.S. population had experienced immunological exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through infection and/or vaccination, with 99.4% (95% credible interval (CrI): 92.4-100%) having had at least one SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite this high exposure, the average population-level protection against infection was 53.6% (95% CrI: 38.7-71.5%). Population-level protection against severe disease was 82.6% (95% CrI: 71.5-91.7%).

DiscussionA new wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-associated hospitalizations began near the end of 2023, with the introduction of the JN.1 variant. This upturn suggests that the U.S. population remains at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease despite the high level of cumulative exposure in the United States. This decline in effective protection is likely due to both waning and continued viral evolution.","NA","medrxiv",1730153368678

Previous research has predominantly focused on the cognitive aspects of mind-wandering, overlooking the potential embodied or interoceptive components that contribute to our ongoing thought patterns. In this study, we addressed this gap by exploring ""body-wandering""-thoughts related to internal bodily sensations such as breathing, heartbeat, and gastrointestinal functions. To assess body-wandering, we applied a retrospective multi-dimensional interoceptive experience sampling approach in 536 healthy participants concurrently with resting-state functional brain imaging. Our findings revealed that body-wandering is distinct from cognitively focused thoughts, underscoring the unique role of embodied processes in ongoing experience. Embodied thought patterns were associated with increased negative affect, heightened physiological arousal, and reduced ADHD symptoms. In contrast, cognitive-focused thoughts were linked to decreased negative affect, lower arousal, and higher depression symptoms. Notably, body-wandering corresponded with a unique neural signature involving increased connectivity between somatomotor, interoceptive, and thalamocortical brain networks. These results emphasise the importance of incorporating embodied processes into theoretical models of mind-wandering and suggest that individual differences in body-wandering significantly impact emotional states and mental health.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Here, we found that both KP.3.1.1 and XEC maintained the high ACE2-Spike binding affinity and pseudovirus infectivity of KP.3. Importantly, compared to KP.3, KP.3.1.1, and especially XEC, could further evade the neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma, even those elicited by KP.2-like breakthrough infections. Interestingly, both variants demonstrated increased resistance against monoclonal neutralizing antibodies targeting various epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD). These suggest that the additional NTD glycosylation of KP.3.1.1 and XEC could enhance immune evasion via allosteric effects, and supports the future prevalence of XEC.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Yet, the distantly related early branching fungi, ciliates and the algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibit robust 6mA methylation patterns, but the origin and evolution of 6mA remain unknown. Here we use Oxford Nanopore modified base calling to profile 6mA at base pair resolution in 18 unicellular eukaryotes spanning all major eukaryotic supergroups. Our results reveal that only species encoding the adenine methyltransferase AMT1 display robust genomic 6mA patterns. Notably, 6mA consistently accumulates downstream of transcriptional start sites, aligning with H3K4me3-enriched nucleosomes, suggesting a conserved role in placing transcriptionally permissive nucleosomes. Intriguingly, the recurrent loss of the 6mA pathway across eukaryotes, particularly in major multicellular lineages, implies a convergent alteration in the dual methylation system of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor, which featured transcription-associated 6mA and repression-associated 5mC.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

However, like many prokaryotic anti-phage systems, R-M systems pose a significant risk of auto-immunity, exacerbated by the presence of hundreds to thousands of potential cleavage sites in the bacterial genome. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, restriction inactivation upon growth at high temperatures was previously described, however, which system is being inactivated, the underlying mechanism, as well as the timing of recovery, remain unknown. Here, we report that P. aeruginosa Type I methyltransferase (HsdMS) and restriction endonuclease (HsdR) components are degraded by two Lon-like proteases when replicating above 41 {degrees}C, which induces partial genome hypomethylation and simultaneously prevents self-targeting, respectively. Interestingly, upon return to 37 {degrees}C, methyltransferase activity returns gradually, with restriction activity not fully recovering for over 60 bacterial generations, representing the longest bacterial memory to our knowledge. Forced expression of HsdR over the first 45 generations is toxic, demonstrating the fitness benefit of HsdR inactivation. Our findings demonstrate that type I R-M is tightly regulated post-translationally with a remarkable memory effect to ensure genomic stability and emphasize the importance of mitigating auto-toxicity for bacterial defense systems.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Ontogeny has therefore become a problematic confounding variable in vertebrate paleontology, especially in study systems distant from extant crown clades, rendering taxonomic hypothesis testing (a fundamental process in evolutionary biology) rife with difficulty. Paleontologists have adopted quantitative methods to compensate for the perception that juvenile specimens lack diagnostic apomorphies seen in their adult conspecifics. Here, I critically evaluate these methods and the assumptions that guide their interpretation using a CT dataset comprising growth series of American and Chinese alligator. I find that several widespread assumptions are scientifically unjustifiable, and that two popular methods--geometric morphometrics and cladistic analysis of ontogeny--have unacceptably high rates of type II error and present numerous procedural difficulties. However, I also identify a suite of ontogenetically invariant characters that differentiate the living species of Alligator throughout ontogeny. These characters overwhelmingly correspond to anatomical systems that develop prior to (and play a signaling role in) the development of the cranial skeleton itself, suggesting that their ontogenetic invariance is a consequence of the widely conserved vertebrate developmental program. These observations suggest that the architecture of the cranium is fixed early in embryonic development, and that ontogenetic remodeling does not alter the topological relationships of the cranial bones or the soft tissue structures they house. I propose a general model for future taxonomic hypothesis tests in the fossil record, in which the hypothesis that two specimens different ontogenetic stages of a single species can be falsified by the discovery of character differences that cannot be attributed plausibly to ontogenetic variation.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

However, real-time in vivo imaging of mitochondria in the brain is limited by existing dyes like MitoTrackers, which struggle with poor tissue penetration, phototoxicity, and inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This study introduces Cy5-PEG4, a novel mitochondrial-targeting dye that overcomes these limitations, enabling high-resolution, non-invasive imaging of mitochondrial dynamics. Cy5-PEG4 effectively labels mitochondria in primary neuronal cells exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 RNYIAQVD peptide, revealing dose-dependent alterations in mitochondrial function that may contribute to COVID-19-related neurodegeneration. Importantly, Cy5-PEG4 crosses the BBB without causing neuroinflammation or toxicity, making it a safe tool for in vivo brain imaging and detailed studies of mitochondrial responses. In 3D cultured cells, Cy5-PEG4 captures dynamic changes in mitochondrial distribution and morphology as cell structures mature, highlighting its potential in neurobiological research, diagnostics, and therapeutic development. These findings support Cy5-PEG4 as a powerful tool for studying disease progression, identifying early biomarkers, and evaluating therapeutic strategies in neurodegenerative disorders and COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Diminished capacity for DNA repair is linked to many human diseases, therefore understanding the molecular pathways responding to DNA damage is key for developing novel therapies. Lack of unbiased probes to report DNA damage dynamics and the associated proteins in living cells and animals limit our current efforts to completely understand DNA repair processes. In this study we overcome these limitations by engineering protein probes containing the tandem-BRCT domain of MCPH1, which we show to have a specific affinity for the DNA-damage-associated histone mark {gamma}H2AX. We employ these probes to track DNA damage dynamics in living cells exposed to a panel of different genotoxic insults and to visualize programmed double strand breaks during gametogenesis in living animals. We further utilize the binding selectivity of our probe to tether TurboID biotin ligases to chromatin and identify the DNA damage-associated proteome via proximity ligation. By comparing five different DNA damaging agents, we reveal the proteome associated with specific lesions, and identify multiple novel proteins with potential implications in damage response and repair. Among these novel proteins, we characterize the ubiquitin ligase UBE3A, the methyl-binding and proteasome-recruiting protein L3MBTL3, and the spliceosomal factor U2SURP, as previously uncharacterized effectors of DNA damage response. These functional datasets reveal the DNA damage-dependent proteomes and reveal novel insights into DNA damage response.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Foxi1 functions were predominantly studied in the context of ISC specification, however, reports indicate additional functions in early and ectodermal development. Here, we re-investigated the functions of Foxi1 in Xenopus laevis embryonic mucociliary epidermis development and found a novel function for Foxi1 in the generation of Notch-ligand expressing mucociliary multipotent progenitors (MPPs). We demonstrate that Foxi1 has multiple concentration-dependent functions: At low levels, Foxi1 confers ectodermal competence through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms, while at high levels, Foxi1 induces a multi-step process of ISC specification and differentiation. We further describe how foxi1 expression is affected through auto- and Notch-regulation, how Ubp1 and Dmrt2 regulate ISC subtype differentiation, and how this developmental program affects Notch signaling as well as mucociliary patterning.

ObjectiveAssess the duration and severity of autonomic dysfunction in adults with Long COVID and evaluate its impact on function and quality of life.

DesignA follow-up survey of a subset of participants from a cross-sectional online survey of adults with Long COVID. Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction.

Participants526 adults (ages 20-65) with a history of Long COVID

Main measuresThe Composite Autonomic Symptom 31 (COMPASS-31) score, the RAND 36-Item Health Survey, the prevalence of new postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and predictors of autonomic dysfunction, including POTS

Key results71.9% of Long COVID patients had a COMPASS-31 score >20, suggestive of moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction. The median symptom duration was 36 [30-40] months, reaching up to 3.5 years after SARS-CoV-2 infection. 37.5% of Long COVID patients could no longer work or had to drop out of school due to their Long COVID illness. 40.5% were newly diagnosed with POTS following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ConclusionsEvidence of persistent moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction was seen in 71.9% of Long COVID patients in our study, with a 36-month median symptom duration, suggesting that enduring autonomic dysfunction is highly prevalent in the Long COVID population. Moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction was significantly correlated with impaired function and capacity, highlighting the need to address POTS and other manifestations of autonomic dysfunction as a key component of Long COVID management.","NA","medrxiv",1730153368678

In maximising the predictive performance of PGS, neural-network (NN) based deep learning has emerged as a method of intense interest to model complex, nonlinear phenomena, which may be adapted to exploit gene-gene (GxG) and gene-environment (GxE) interactions.

MethodsTo infer the amount of nonlinearity present in a phenotype, we present a framework for using NNs, which controls for the potential confounding effect of correlation between genetic variants, i.e. linkage disequilibrium (LD). We fit NN models to both simulated traits and 28 real disease and anthropometric traits in the UK Biobank.

ResultsSimulations confirmed that our framework adequately controls LD and can infer nonlinear effects, when such effects genuinely exist. Using this approach on real data, we found evidence for small amounts of nonlinearity due to GxG and GxE which mildly improved prediction performance (r2) by [~]7% and [~]4%, respectively. Despite evidence for nonlinear effects, NN models were outperformed by linear regression models for both genetic-only and genetic+environmental input scenarios with [~]7% and [~]5% differences in r2, respectively. Importantly, we found substantial evidence for confounding by joint tagging effects, whereby inferred GxG was actually LD with due to unaccounted for additive genetic variants.

ConclusionOur results indicate that the usefulness of NNs for generating polygenic scores for common traits and diseases may currently be limited and may be confounded by joint tagging effects due to LD.","NA","medrxiv",1730153368678

Recently, a novel  pre-atrophy muscle weakness was identified during early-stage cancer. While mitochondrial stress responses are associated with early-stage pre-atrophy weakness, a causal relationship has not been established. Using a robust mouse model of metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC)-induced cachexia, we found the well-established mitochondrial-targeted plastoquinone SkQ1 partially prevents pre-atrophy weakness in the diaphragm. Furthermore, SkQ1 improved force production during atrophy without preventing atrophy itself in the tibialis anterior and diaphragm. EOC reduced flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) force production and myoplasmic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) during contraction in single muscle fibers, both of which were prevented by SkQ1. Remarkably, changes in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and pyruvate metabolism were heterogeneous across time and between muscle types which highlights a considerable complexity in the relationships between mitochondria and muscle remodeling throughout EOC. These discoveries identify that muscle weakness can occur independent of atrophy throughout EOC in a manner that is linked to improved calcium handling. The findings also demonstrate that mitochondrial-targeted therapies exert a robust effect in preserving muscle force during the early pre-atrophy period and in late-stage EOC once cachexia has become severe.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Most organisms have a life cycle with unicellular bottlenecks during reproduction. However, some organisms like plants, fungi, or colonial animals can grow indefinitely, changing the manner in which mutations spread throughout both the individual and the population. Furthermore, clonally reproducing organisms may also achieve exceedingly long lifespans, making somatic mutation an important mechanism of creating heritable variation for Darwinian evolution by natural selection. Yet, little is known about intra-organism mutation rates and evolutionary trajectories in long-lived species. Here, we study the Pando aspen clone, the largest known quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) clone founded by a single seedling and thought to be one of the oldest studied organisms. Aspen reproduce vegetatively via new root-borne stems forming clonal patches, sometimes spanning several hectares. To study the evolutionary history of the Pando clone, we collected and sequenced over 500 samples from Pando and neighboring clones, as well as from various tissue types within Pando, including leaves, roots, and bark. We applied a series of filters to distinguish somatic mutations from the pool of both somatic and germline mutations, incorporating a technical replicate sequencing approach to account for uncertainty in somatic mutation detection. Despite root spreading being spatially constrained, we observed only a modest positive correlation between genetic and spatial distance, suggesting the presence of a mechanism preventing the accumulation and spread of mutations across units. Phylogenetic models estimate the age of the clone to between ~16,000-80,000 years. This age is generally corroborated by the near-continuous presence of aspen pollen in a lake sediment record collected from Fish Lake near Pando. Overall, this work enhances understanding of mutation accumulation and dispersal within and between ramets of long-lived, clonally-reproducing organisms.

Significance StatementThis study enhances our understanding of evolutionary processes in long-lived clonal organisms by investigating somatic mutation accumulation and dispersal patterns within the iconic Pando aspen clone. The authors estimated the clone to be between 10,000 and 80,000 years old and uncovered a modest spatial genetic structure in the 42.6-hectare clone, suggesting localized mutation build-up rather than dispersal along tissue lineages. This work sheds light on an ancient organism and how plants may evolve to preserve genetic integrity in meristems fueling indefinite growth, with implications for our comprehension of adaptive strategies in long-lived perennials.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Recently, the string-pulling task - which involves cyclically reaching, grasping and pulling a string - has been used to study coordinated hand movements in rodents and humans. Here we characterize how adult common marmosets perform the string-pulling task and describe changes in performance across the lifespan. Marmosets (n=15, 7 female) performed a string-pulling task for a food reward using an instrumented apparatus attached to their home-cage. Movement kinematics were acquired using markerless video tracking and we assessed individual hand movements and bimanual coordination using standard metrics. Marmosets appeared to guide their actions with vision and readily performed the string-pulling task regardless of sex or age. The task required very little training and animals routinely engaged in multiple pulling trials per session despite not being under water or food control. All marmosets showed consistent pulling speed and similar hand movements regardless of age. Adult marmosets exhibited a clear hand effect, performing straighter and faster movements with their right hand despite showing idiosyncratic hand preference according to a traditional food retrieval assay. Hand effects were also evident for younger animals but seemed attenuated in the older animals. In terms of bimanual coordination, all adult marmosets demonstrated an alternating movement pattern for vertical hand positions. Two younger and two older marmosets exhibited idiosyncratic coordination patterns even after substantial experience. In general, younger and older animals exhibited higher variability in bimanual coordination than did adults.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Here, sampling healthy individuals, we profiled the kinetics and polyfunctionality of T cell immunity elicited by mRNA vaccination. Modeling of anti-spike T cell responses against ancestral and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that epitope immunodominance and cross-reactivity are major predictive determinants of T cell immunity. To identify immunodominant epitopes across the viral proteome, we generated a comprehensive map of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes within non-spike proteins that induced polyfunctional T cell responses in convalescent patients. We found that immunodominant epitopes mainly resided within regions that were minimally disrupted by mutations in emerging variants. Conservation analysis across historical human coronaviruses combined with in silico alanine scanning mutagenesis of non-spike proteins underscored the functional importance of mutationally-constrained immunodominant regions. Collectively, these findings identify immunodominant T cell epitopes across the mutationally-constrained SARS-CoV-2 proteome, potentially providing immune surveillance against emerging variants, and inform the design of next-generation vaccines targeting antigens throughout SARS-CoV-2 proteome for broader and more durable protection.

We introduce new tools that use AlphaFold3's ""predicted local-distance difference test"" (pLDDT), ""predicted aligned error"" (PAE), and ""predicted distance error"" (PDE) matrices in a graph-based community clustering approach to label sequence motifs involved in binary interactions. The resulting ""interaction image"" is processed through a multidimensional image algorithm to cluster interacting sequence motifs in three-dimensional binary interfaces. This method allows us to present the interaction information between multiple proteins and nucleic acids back to two-dimensional space using chord diagrams. These ""AlphaBridge"" diagrams summarise predicted interfaces and intermolecular interactions, including prediction confidence and sequence conservation scores. They are valuable for efficient screening of predictions, ranking, and scoring the confidence of predicted interactions, prior to more detailed (and resource intensive) analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

However, empirical studies on the evolutionary aspects of host-microbe relationships are rare. Here, we used experimental evolution on laboratory populations of D. melanogaster to understand how a host can evolve without its microbiome. For this, we compared replicate Drosophila populations reared without the microbes (labeled as MBL1-4, for ""Microbiota-less"") for 54 host generations with their corresponding controls (labeled as MB1-4), whose microbiome was reconstituted every generation. This comparison was done in two common-garden assay environments: with microbes and microbe-free. We found that contrary to what we expected, only modest adaptations were seen in the MBL populations. When looking at the phenotypic plasticity of MB-MBLs across with-microbe and microbe-free environments, we saw that MBLs had lesser plasticity than MBs. This might hint at MBLs reducing their dependence on microbes. We performed RNA-Seq on MBL1 and MB1 populations to see if there were changes in gene expression patterns. We found that a cluster of anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) was up-regulated, and another cluster of heat shock proteins (HSPs) was down-regulated in MBL1 compared to MB1. These results show that while the host's homeostasis is perturbed by microbiome manipulation on short timescales, the host-microbiome integration seems more labile on longer timescales, with hosts showing potential for adaptation without the microbes.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Tools such as standardized cognitive tests and symptom inventories have played a crucial role in informing neuroimaging studies, helping to uncover the underlying brain systems associated with these measures. Substantial strides have been taken in developing models, such as connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), that establish connections between external measures and the human connectome, offering insights into how the functional organization of the brain varies in relation to scores on external measures. Here, we depart from the conventional feed-forward approach and introduce a feed-back approach that allows testing of the tests. Since the inception of cognitive psychology over 60 years ago, cognitive tests have been meticulously developed to measure specific components of cognition. These tests, which have undergone extensive validation and have been standardized and administered to millions, operate on explicit assumptions about the cognitive components they assess. Rather than using external tests to identify the circuits supporting test scores, we a priori define networks of interest and quantify the extent to which these circuits support the test measure. To demonstrate this, we define functional connectivity networks for six cognitive constructs and quantify their contribution to performance across a spectrum of standardized cognitive tests and clinical measures. Employing robust machine learning in a predictive modeling framework, we show how this approach can be used to select tests according to the networks they rely upon. This establishes a biologically grounded metric for test comparison. This approach also yields a brain-driven process for forming composite tests by selecting test combinations that depend on the same proportional brain systems, or for a single network of interest, combining tests with the highest predictive power for that network. This brain-driven approach results in more robust behavioral assessments and enhanced predictive power for the network of interest. We illustrate how this methodology can be applied to evaluate the inclusion of specific sub-tests within a composite score, revealing instances where composite scores are reinforced or weakened by subtest inclusion in terms of the specificity of the brain network they interrogate. The brain-test score modeling approach presented here provides a biologically driven approach to the selection of external cognitive and symptom measures directed at specific brain systems. It opens new avenues of research by providing a framework for the development of new tests and measures guided by quantitative brain metrics.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

The metabolome of COVID-19 patients has been studied sparsely, with most research focusing on a limited number of plasma metabolites or small cohorts. This is the first study to test saliva metabolites in COVID-19 patients in a comprehensive way, revealing significant changes linked to disease severity and highlighting saliva is potential as a non-invasive diagnostic tool. Methods. We included 30 asymptomatic subjects with no prior COVID-19 infection or vaccination, 102 patients with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 61 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 status. Saliva samples were analyzed using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) in positive and negative ionization modes. Results. Significant changes in metabolites were identified in COVID-19 patients, with distinct patterns based on disease severity. Healthy individuals exhibited a well-regulated bacterial network, while severe cases showed disordered microbial networks. Elevated dipeptides such as Val-Glu and Met-Gln in moderate cases suggest specific protease activity related to SARS-CoV-2. Increased acetylated amino acids like N-Acetylserine and N-Acetylhistidine indicate potential biomarkers for stress and disease severity. Bacterial metabolites, including muramic acid and indole-3-carboxaldehyde, were higher in mild-moderate cases, indicating oral microbiota changes. In severe cases, polyamines and organ damage-related metabolites, such as N-acetylspermine and 3-methylcytidine, were significantly increased. Interestingly, metabolites reduced in moderate cases were elevated in severe cases. Conclusions. Saliva metabolomics offers insight into disease progression and potential biomarkers for COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Here, we identify the WRAD (WDR5/RBBP5/ASH2L/DPY30) core as a modulator of DNA replication in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models. Molecular analyses demonstrated that the WRAD core interacts with the replisome complex, with disruption of DPY30 resulting in DNA re-replication, DNA damage, and chromosomal instability (CIN) without affecting cancer cell proliferation. Consequently, in immunocompetent models, DPY30 loss induced T cell infiltration and immune-mediated clearance of highly proliferating cancer cells with complex karyotypes, thus improving anti-tumor efficacy upon anti-PD-1 treatment. In PDAC patients, DPY30 expression was associated with high tumor grade, worse prognosis, and limited response to immune checkpoint blockade. Together, our findings indicate that the WRAD core sustains genome stability and suggest that low intratumor DPY30 levels may identify PDAC patients who will benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Of all cortical layers, layer 6b (L6b) is by far the least-studied, despite exhibiting direct sensitivity to orexin and having widespread connectivity, suggesting an important role in regulating cortical oscillations and brain state. We performed chronic electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in mice in which a subset of L6b neurons was conditionally silenced, during undisturbed conditions, after sleep deprivation (SD), and after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of orexin. While the total amount of waking and sleep or the response to SD were not altered, L6b-'silenced' mice showed a slowing of theta-frequency (6-9 Hz) during wake and REM sleep, and a marked reduction of total EEG power, especially in NREM sleep. The infusion of orexin A increased wakefulness in both genotypes, but the effect was more pronounced in L6b-silenced mice, while the increase in theta-activity by orexin B was attenuated in L6b silenced animals. In summary, we show the role of cortical L6b in state-dependent brain oscillations and global vigilance state control, which could be mediated by orexinergic neurotransmission.

A Virtual Brain Twin (VBT) is a personalized digital replica of an individual's brain, integrating structural and functional brain data into advanced computational models and inference algorithms. By bridging the gap between molecular mechanisms, whole-brain dynamics, and imaging data, VBTs enhance the understanding of (patho)physiological mechanisms, advancing insights into both healthy and disordered brain function. Central to VBT is the network modeling that couples mesoscopic representation of neuronal activity through white matter connectivity, enabling the simulation of brain dynamics at a network level. This transformative approach provides interpretable predictive capabilities, supporting clinicians in personalizing treatments and optimizing interventions. This manuscript outlines the key components of VBT development, covering the conceptual, mathematical, technical, and clinical aspects. We describe the stages of VBT construction--from anatomical coupling and modeling to simulation and Bayesian inference--and demonstrate their applications in resting-state, healthy aging, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. Finally, we discuss potential extensions to other neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, and explore future applications in consciousness research and brain-computer interfaces, paving the way for advancements in personalized medicine and brain-machine integration.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Diversion of interferon IFN signaling was associated with increased expression of inflammatory markers, enhanced release of inflammatory cytokines, and delayed contraction of infection-induced CD4+ T cells.

Fission, in particular, depends on the accumulation of the mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) and subsequent recruitment of the dynamin-related protein Drp1. We used cryo-scanning transmission electron tomography (cryo-STET) to investigate mitochondrial morphologies in MFF mutant cells (MFF-/-) in ATP-depleting conditions that normally induce fission. The capability of cryo-STET to image through the cytoplasmic volume to a depth of 1 m provides visualization of mitochondria and their surroundings intact. We imaged changes in mitochondrial morphology and cristae structure and contacts with endoplasmic reticulum, degradative organelles, and cytoskeleton at stalled fission sites. We found disruption of the outer membrane at contact sites with endoplasmic reticulum and degradative organelles at sites of mitophagy. We identified fission sites where the inner mitochondrial membrane is already separated while the outer is still continuous. While MFF is a general fission factor, these observations demonstrate that mitochondrial fission can proceed to the final stage in its absence. The use of cryo-STET allays concerns about the loss of structures due to sample thinning required for cryo-TEM tomography.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Here I argue that how the basal ganglia do what they do is a less-asked but equally important question. I show that the output regions of the basal ganglia create a stringent computational bottleneck, both structurally, because they have far fewer neurons than do their target regions, and dynamically, because of their tonic, inhibitory output. My proposed solution to this bottleneck is that the activity of an output neuron is setting the weight of a basis function, a function defined by that neurons synaptic contacts. I illustrate how this may work in practice, allowing basal ganglia output to shift cortical dynamics and control eye movements via the superior colliculus. This solution can account for troubling issues in our understanding of the basal ganglia: why we see output neurons increasing their activity during behaviour, rather than only decreasing as predicted by theories based on disinhibition, and why the output of the basal ganglia seems to have so many codes squashed into such a tiny region of the brain.

Significance statementThe basal ganglia are implicated in an extraordinary range of functions, from action selection to timing, and dysfunctions, from Parkinsons disease to obsessive compulsive disorder. Yet however the basal ganglia cause these functions and dysfunctions they must do so through a group of neurons that are dwarfed in number by both their inputs and their output targets. Here I lay out this bottleneck problem for basal ganglia computation, and propose a solution to how their outputs can control their many targets. That solution rethinks the output connections of the basal ganglia as a set of basis functions. In doing so, it provides explanations for previously troubling data on basal ganglia output, and strong predictions for how that output controls its targets.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

However, the stability-plasticity dilemma, i.e., how to exploit stable schemas to facilitate learning while remaining flexible towards possible changes, is not well understood. We hypothesize that restricting schemas to specific functional, e.g., decision-making, subspace and making it orthogonal to other subspaces allows the brain to balance stability and plasticity. To test it, we trained three macaques on visuomotor mapping tasks and recorded neural activity in the dorsolateral premotor cortex. By delineating decision and stimulus subspaces, we identified a schema-like manifold within only the decision subspace. The reuse of decision schemas significantly facilitated subsequent learning. In addition, the decision subspace exhibited a trend to be orthogonal to the stimulus subspace, minimizing interference between these two domains. Our results revealed that restricting schemas to specific functional domains can preserve useful knowledge while maintaining orthogonality with other subspaces, allowing for flexible adaptation to new environments, thereby resolving the stability-plasticity dilemma. This finding provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying brain's capability to learn both fast and flexibly, which can also inspire more efficient learning algorithms for artificial intelligence systems towards working in open, dynamic environments.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Here we show that the RNA-targeting type VI-A CRISPR system of Listeria seeligeri acquires spacers from DNA substrates through the action of a promiscuous Cas1-2 integrase encoded by a co-occurring type II-C system, in a transcription-independent manner. We further demonstrate that the type II-C integration complex is strongly stimulated by preexisting spacers in a third CRISPR system (type I-B) which imperfectly match phage targets and prime type VI-A adaptation.

Despite their importance, most of all current ecological theories have been formalized focusing on negative interactions such as competition or predation. The role of cooperation, or other types of positive interactions including facilitation and mutualism, has not been fully addressed, or, if so, always in combination with negative interactions. This fact limits our understanding of the unique features by which cooperation as opposed to competition promotes biodiversity. To address this gap, we introduce here cooperation into structural stability, a general framework to understand how species interactions and environmental variability determine the long-term persistence of species within communities. Compared to a pure competitive case, cooperation promotes three distinctive features. First, cooperation increases the opportunities for species to coexist. This feature increases the persistence of species with contrasted phylogenetic, functional, and demographic strategies that the environment would otherwise filter. Second, cooperation creates intertwined biodiversity where the existence of some species begets the presence of others. Third, cooperation promotes multistability by changing the dynamics of community assembly due to variations in environmental conditions. In conclusion, we present a fully operational framework to understand the unique ecological roles of cooperation in nature. It indicates that cooperation as opposed to competition maximizes the maintenance of biodiversity.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Theoretical models of PC often rely on high-level approaches, and therefore implementations detailing which neurons or pathways are used to compute prediction errors or adapt the internal representations, as well as their level of agreement with biological circuitry, are currently missing. Here we propose a computational model of PC, which integrates a neuroanatomically informed hierarchy of cortical areas with a precise laminar organization and cell-type-specific connectivity between pyramidal, PV, SST and VIP cells. Our model efficiently performs PC, even in the presence of external and internal noise, by forming latent representations of naturalistic visual input (MNIST, fashion-MNIST and grayscale CIFAR-10) via Hebbian learning and using them to predict sensory input by minimizing prediction errors. The model assumes that both positive and negative prediction errors are computed by stereotypical pyramidal-PV-SST-VIP circuits with the same structure but different incoming input. During sensory inference, neural oscillatory activity emerges in the system due to interactions between representation and prediction error microcircuits, with optogenetics-inspired inactivation protocols revealing a differentiated role of PV, SST and VIP cell types in such dynamics. Finally, our model shows anomalous responses to deviant stimuli within series of same-image presentations, in agreement with experimental results on mismatch negativity and oddball paradigms. We argue that our model constitutes an important step to better understand the circuits mediating PC in real cortical networks.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

The popularity of this technique stems from its simplicity. Patch-clamp recording is used to observe spontaneous transmission occurring at synapses throughout a neuron's dendritic tree. These events are analysed in an attempt to determine quantal synaptic parameters and changes during experimental manipulation. For decades, changes in the amplitude or frequency of mPSCs have been interpreted as evidence for specific synaptic modifications, including changes in presynaptic release sites, postsynaptic receptor abundance or even nanoscale changes in the alignment of synaptic machinery. However, at the majority of brain synapses, these events are small, with many undetectable due to recording noise. Here, using both simulated and experimental data, we demonstrate that interpreting synaptic changes from mPSC datasets is fundamentally fallible. Due to incomplete detection of event distributions, seemingly specific changes in mPSC amplitude or frequency falsely report actual synaptic changes. In addition, probabilistic detection of small events gives false confidence in the completeness of detection and inaccurate determination of quantal size. We not only demonstrate the dense pitfalls of mini analysis, but also establish a method for experimental detection of the detection limit, allowing more robust data analysis and scientific interpretation.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

This molecule specifically activates the bacterial caspase-like protease which then indiscriminately degrades cellular proteins to halt phage replication. The TIR-caspase defense system, which we denote as type IV Thoeris, is abundant in bacteria and efficiently protects against phage propagation.

We compared the mortality rates, viral loads, and histopathological changes in lung and tracheal tissues, as well as alterations in the lung and intestinal microbiota following infection. We observed significant differences in disease severity, with the Wuhan strain causing higher mortality and more severe lung damage than the Omicron variant. Furthermore, microbiome analyses revealed distinct shifts in microbiota associated with infection by each variant, suggesting that microbiome-related mechanisms might influence disease outcomes. This comprehensive comparison enhances our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and highlights the importance of microbiome dynamics in viral infections, providing insights for future therapeutic and preventive strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Multiple types of ecDNA are often observed within the same cancer cell, promoting high levels of complexity. While the study of multiple ecDNA types is still in its early stages with exciting new clinical and experimental studies in human cancers, few theoretical models have been proposed to understand the mechanisms enabling the maintenance of multiple ecDNA types (mix cells). Here, based on our general framework of modeling multiple ecDNA types, we explore the conditions that allow for a stable coexistence of multiple ecDNA types within single cancer cells. We study how genetic mutations or phenotypic switching among different ecDNA types contribute to the maintenance of ecDNA diversity under different fitness regimes. We show that either positive epistasis or switching is required to stably maintain mix cell populations. Counter-intuitively, intermediate rather than high switching rates lead to the highest fraction of mix cells, which is further confirmed by our analysis of sub-population compositions, transition probabilities between pure and mix states as well as single-cell Shannon indices.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

An impairment in the ability to understand and generate the correct grammatical structures (syntactic deficit) has been suggested as a key contributor; but studies have been underpowered, often with conflicting findings. It is also unclear if syntactic deficits are restricted to a subgroup of patients, or generalized across the broad spectrum of patients irrespective of symptom profiles, age, sex, and illness severity. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, registered on OSF, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, searching multiple databases up to May 1, 2024. We extracted effect sizes (Cohen's d) and variance differences (log coefficient of variation ratio) across 6 domains: 2 in comprehension (understanding complex syntax, detection of syntactic errors) and 4 in production (global complexity, phrasal/clausal complexity, utterance length, and integrity) in patient-control comparisons. Study quality/bias was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Bayesian meta-analysis was used to estimate domain-specific effects and variance differences. We tested for potential moderators with sufficient data (age, sex, study quality, language spoken) using conventional meta-regression to estimate the sources of heterogeneity between studies. Findings Overall, 45 studies (n=2960 unique participants, 64.4% English, 79 case-control contrasts, weighted mean age(sd)=32.3(5.6)) were included. Of the patient samples, only 29.2% were women. Bayesian meta-analysis revealed extreme evidence for all syntactic domains to be affected in schizophrenia with a large-sized effect (model-averaged d=0.65-1.01, with overall random effects d=0.86, 95% CrI [0.67-1.03]). Syntactic comprehension was the most affected domain. There was notable heterogeneity between studies in global complexity (moderated by the age), production integrity (moderated by study quality), and production length. Robust BMA revealed weak evidence for publication bias. Patients had a small-to-medium-sized excess of inter-individual variability than healthy controls in understanding complex syntax, and in producing long utterances and complex phrases (overall random effects lnCVR=0.21, 95% CrI [0.07-0.36]), hinting at the possible presence of subgroups with diverging syntactic performance. Interpretation There is robust evidence for the presence of grammatical impairment in comprehension and production in schizophrenia. This knowledge will improve the measurement of communication disturbances in schizophrenia and aid in developing distinct interventions focussed on syntax - a rule-based feature that is potentially amenable to cognitive, educational, and linguistic interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1730153368678

By differentiating a panel of mouse embryonic stem cells lacking major chromatin regulators towards neuronal cells, we identified their requirement at different stages of cellular differentiation. We show that the H3K36me3 methyltransferase SETD2 is important for the establishment of neuronal gene expression during late stages of differentiation, but is dispensable once the cells have fully differentiated. This function is largely independent of the histone methyltransferase activity. By measuring the protein interaction network of elongating RNA Pol II, we identify a novel role for SETD2 in mediating interactions between the PAF1 complex and the elongating RNA Pol II, which is required to ensure optimal transcriptional processivity of neuronal genes.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

While some satellite DNA types have well-established roles in centromere biology, other abundant satellite DNAs have poorly characterized functions. For example, Human Satellite 3 (HSat3), which makes up roughly 2% of the human genome, forms enormous arrays up to tens of megabases, but these arrays play no known roles in centromere function and were almost fully excluded from genome assemblies until recently. As a result, these massive genomic regions have remained relatively understudied, and the potential functional roles of HSat3 have remained largely unknown. To address this, we performed a systematic screen for novel HSat3 binding factors. Our work revealed HSat3 arrays contain high densities of transcription factor (TF) motifs that are bound by factors related to multiple, highly conserved signaling pathways. Unexpectedly, the most enriched TFs in HSat3 belong to the Hippo pathway transcription effector family TEAD. We found that TEAD recruits the co-activator YAP to HSat3 regions in a cell-state specific manner. Using RNA polymerase-I reporter assays, targeted repression of HSat3, inducible degradation of YAP, and super-resolution microscopy, we show that HSat3 arrays can localize YAP/TEAD inside the nucleolus, where YAP regulates RNA Polymerase-I activity. Beyond revealing a direct relationship between the Hippo pathway and ribosomal DNA regulation, this work demonstrates that satellite DNA can encode multiple transcription factor binding motifs, defining a new role for these enormous genomic elements.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

However, immune efficiency is constrained by Cas9 off-target cleavages and toxicity. How bacteria regulate Cas9 to maximize protection while preventing autoimmunity is not understood. Here, we show that the master regulator of virulence, CovR, regulates CRISPR-Cas9 immunity against mobile genetic elements in Streptococcus agalactiae, a pathobiont responsible for invasive neonatal infections. We show that CovR binds to and represses a distal promoter of the cas operon, integrating immunity within the virulence regulatory network. The CovR-regulated promoter provides a controlled increase in off-target cleavages to counteract mutations in the target DNA, restores the potency of old immune memory, and stimulates the acquisition of new memory in response to recent infections. Regulation of Cas9 by CovR is conserved at the species level, with lineage specificities suggesting different adaptive trajectories. Altogether, we describe the coordinated regulation of immunity and virulence that enhances the bacterial immune repertoire during host-pathogen interaction.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Lesion expansion contributes to progression and increased disability, while remyelination can recover neurological deficits. However, mechanisms driving lesion dynamics are largely unclear, hindering the development of effective therapeutics. We propose that distinct states of microglia are involved in lesion expansion and remyelination 2,3. Using Stereo-seq, an RNA capture based high-resolution spatial transcriptomics technology with single-cell resolution, on post-mortem human brain tissue, we compared mixed active/inactive lesions with lipid-laden foamy microglia with lesions containing ramified microglia. We identified distinct cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying lesion activity and remyelination, linked to microglia phenotypes and states. Lesions with foamy microglia were characterized by elevated immune activation, increased lymphocyte densities, upregulated immunoglobulin production (IGHG1, IGHG3), increased complement system activity, indication of iron dysregulation (FTL, FTH1), and increased demyelination. In contrast, lesions with ramified microglia exhibited gene expression profiles indicative of myelin stability (ABCA2, QKI) and neuro-axonal protection, fostering an environment conducive to repair and remyelination. Our findings highlight the role of microglial states in lesion expansion and repair in MS and offer promising avenues for the development of therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing MS disability progression.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Suppression of ADAR1 overcomes immunotherapy resistance in preclinical models, but has not yet been translated to clinical settings. By conducting a screening of a subset of the FDA-approved drugs, we found that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, also known as tretinoin) caused ADAR1 protein degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome pathways and concomitantly increased PD-L1 expression in pancreatic and breast cancers. In addition, the combination of ATRA and PD-1 blockade reprogrammed the tumor microenvironment and unleashed antitumor immunity and thereby impeded tumor growth in pancreatic cancer mouse models. In a pilot clinical trial, a higher dose of ATRA plus the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab prolonged median overall survival in patients with chemotherapy-resistant pancreatic cancer compared to a lower dose of the same regimen.

However, the defining triggers underlying these responses remain poorly understood. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has emerged as a primary risk factor for MS, suggesting a potential role for molecular mimicry in which EBV-specific immune responses cross-react with myelin antigens. In this study, we analyzed the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of MS patients (n = 129) and controls (n = 94) from public datasets, to explore the relationship between EBV-specific and myelin-specific T cell responses. Our analysis identified clusters of TCRs that were significantly depleted among MS patients, many of which were associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV). By generating a library of myelin-reactive TCRs from stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from MS patients and mapping these sequences to the public TCR repertoire database, we also uncovered a lower frequency of myelin-reactive TCRs in MS samples compared to controls in the public datasets. In addition, epitope-specificity prediction revealed a broader response to EBV-, but not CMV-derived epitopes. Collectively, these findings underscore the complex role of chronic viral infections in MS. Particularly, they suggest that EBV-specific immune responses contribute to the dysregulation of the immune system in MS patients, potentially through mechanisms of molecular mimicry. While the broader response to EBV-derived epitopes and the lower frequency of myelin-reactive TCRs in MS samples are both associated with the disease, further research is needed to clarify the nature of this relationship. These observations suggest that viral and autoimmune mechanisms may contribute independently or interact in MS pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

A Clever-1--targeting humanized IgG4 antibody, bexmarilimab, is investigated in clinical trials as a macrophage-reprogramming therapy to treat solid tumors (NCT03733990) and hematological malignancies (NCT05428969).

We demonstrate that sClever-1 binds to insulin growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) on T cells via its mannose-6-phosphate modification and further show that sClever-1 contributes to the immunosuppressive properties of macrophage-secreted extracellular vesicles, driving T cell tolerance and impairing anti-PD-1 efficacy.

The ZSF1-obese rat model recapitulates numerous clinical features of HFpEF including hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome, exercise intolerance, and LV diastolic dysfunction. Here, we utilized a systems-biology approach to define the early metabolic and transcriptional signatures to gain mechanistic insight into the pathways contributing to HFpEF development. Methods: Male ZSF1-obese, ZSF1-lean hypertensive controls, and WKY (wild-type) controls were compared at 14w of age for extensive physiological phenotyping and LV tissue harvesting for unbiased metabolomics, RNA-sequencing, and assessment of mitochondrial morphology and function. Utilizing ZSF1-lean and WKY controls enabled a distinction between hypertension-driven molecular changes contributing to HFpEF pathology, versus hypertension + metabolic syndrome. Results: ZSF1-obese rats displayed numerous clinical features of HFpEF. Comparison of ZSF1-lean vs WKY (i.e., hypertension-exclusive effects) revealed metabolic remodeling suggestive of increased aerobic glycolysis, decreased {beta}-oxidation, and dysregulated purine and pyrimidine metabolism with few transcriptional changes. ZSF1-obese rats displayed worsened metabolic remodeling and robust transcriptional remodeling highlighted by the upregulation of inflammatory genes and downregulation of the mitochondrial structure/function and cellular metabolic processes. Integrated network analysis of metabolomic and RNAseq datasets revealed downregulation of nearly all catabolic pathways contributing to energy production, manifesting in a marked decrease in the energetic state (i.e., reduced ATP/ADP, PCr/ATP). Cardiomyocyte ultrastructure analysis revealed decreased mitochondrial area, size, and cristae density, as well as increased lipid droplet content in HFpEF hearts. Mitochondrial function was also impaired as demonstrated by decreased substrate-mediated respiration and dysregulated calcium handling. Conclusions: Collectively, the integrated omics approach applied here provides a framework to uncover novel genes, metabolites, and pathways underlying HFpEF, with an emphasis on mitochondrial energy metabolism as a potential target for intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

The non-chromosomal inheritance of ecDNA during cell division is a major contributor to intratumoral genetic heterogeneity. At present, the spatial dynamics of ecDNA, and the impact on tumor evolutionary trajectories, are not well understood. Here, we investigate the spatial-temporal evolution of ecDNA and its clinical impact by analyzing tumor samples from 94 treatment-naive human IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients. We developed a spatial-temporal computational model of ecDNA positive tumors ( SPECIES) that integrates whole-genome sequencing, multi-region DNA FISH, and nascent RNAscope, to provide unique insight into the spatial dynamics of ecDNA evolution. Random segregation in combination with positive selection of ecDNAs induce large, predictable spatial patterns of cell-to-cell ecDNA copy number variation that are highly dependent on the oncogene encoded on the circular DNA. EGFR ecDNAs often reach high mean copy number (mean of 50 copies per tumor cell), are under strong positive selection (mean selection coefficient, s > 2) and do not co-amplify other oncogenes on the same ecDNA particles. In contrast, PDGFRA ecDNAs have lower mean copy number (mean of 15 copies per cell), are under weaker positive selection and frequently co-amplify other oncogenes on the same ecDNA. Evolutionary modeling suggests that EGFR ecDNAs often accumulate prior to clonal expansion. EGFR structural variants, including vIII and c-terminal deletions are under strong positive selection, are found exclusively on ecDNA, and are intermixed with wild-type EGFR ecDNAs. Simulations show EGFRvIII ecDNA likely arises after ecDNA formation in a cell with high wild-type EGFR copy number (> 10) before the onset of the most recent clonal expansion. This remains true even in cases of co-selection and co-amplification of multiple oncogenic ecDNA species in a subset of patients. Overall, our results suggest a potential time window in which early ecDNA detection may provide an opportunity for more effective intervention.

Structure is conserved between distantly-related proteins where amino acid similarity is weak or undetectable, suggesting that structure-informed sequence alignments might offer advantages over alignments constructed from amino acid sequences alone. The advent of the AI folding era has unleashed millions of high-quality predicted structures, motivating the development and assessment of scalable multiple structure alignment (MStA) methods.

We show that Muscle-3D readily scales to thousands of structures. Comparative validation on several benchmark datasets using different quality metrics shows Muscle-3D to be among the higher-scoring methods, but we find that algorithm rankings from different metrics disagree despite low P-values according to the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We suggest that these conflicts arise from the inherently fuzzy nature of structural alignment, and argue that a universal standard of MStA accuracy is not possible in principle. We describe contact map profiles for visualizing variation in inter-residue distances, and introduce a novel measure of local conformation similarity, LDDT-muw.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of how diurnal regulatory circuits interface with sensing and response to various light intensities, we performed a systems analysis of synchronized Chlamydomonas populations acclimated to low, moderate, and high diurnal light. Transcriptomic and proteomic data revealed that Chlamydomonas' rhythmic gene expression program is resilient to limiting and excess light. Although gene expression and photodamage are dynamic over the diurnal cycle, Chlamydomonas populations acclimated to low and high diurnal light exhibit constitutive phenotypes with respect to photosystem abundance, thylakoid architecture, and non-photochemical quenching that persist through the night. This suggests that cells ''remember'' or anticipate the daylight environment. The integrated data constitute an excellent resource for understanding gene regulatory mechanisms and photoprotection in eukaryotes under environmentally relevant conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

However, little is known about where visual objects are encoded in the mouse brain or how visual objects impact processing within the spatial navigation system. Using functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging in mice, we conducted a brain-wide screen and identified brain areas that were preferentially activated by images of objects compared to scrambled versions of the same stimuli. While visual cortical areas did not show a significant preference, regions associated with spatial navigation were preferentially activated by visual objects. Electrophysiological recordings in the postsubiculum, the primary cortical area of the head direction (HD) system, further confirmed a preference for visual objects, which was present in both HD cells and fast-spiking interneurons. Finally, we found that visual objects dynamically modulate HD cells, selectively increasing firing rates for HD cells aligned with a visual landmarks direction, while suppressing activity in HD cells coding for other directions. These results reveal that visual objects refine population-level coding of head direction.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Individual defense systems are gained and lost by genomes of the same species, depending on their fitness advantage. Thus, some genomes have a certain combination of defense systems, while other genomes act as a reservoir for the rest of the systems, thus constituting the so-called pan-immune system of the species. The study of this system, also called defensome, requires a good representation of genomes of the same species. Here we have analyzed thousands of genomes of the bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii, an opportunistic pathogen of humans of great clinical concern. We have found 81 different defense systems, heterogeneously distributed. By analyzing how these systems combine, we have found that restriction-modification (R-M) systems can act synergistically with CRISPR-Cas systems, in addition to other combinations not described so far. Notably, more than half of the genomes lack the universal DNA-methylating R-M systems and have the alternative innate SspBCDE system that made a DNA phosphorothioate modification. The presence of one or the other could modulate the evolution of the genomes of this species, causing them to present a different profile of phages integrated or prophages. Finally, we found that the presence of many defense systems is associated with the presence of a greater number of prophages, which may be due to the fact that the prophage carries the system, as in the case of PD-T4 systems, or that the bacterium would not need these systems in environments where the phage is absent.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Rodent tails are an abundantly diverse and more tractable system to understand mechanisms of vertebral growth and proportion. In many rodents, disproportionately long mid-tail vertebrae form a 'crescendo-decrescendo' of lengths in the tail series. In bipedal jerboas, these vertebrae grow exceptionally long such that the adult tail is 1.5x the length of a mouse tail, relative to body length, with four fewer vertebrae. How do vertebrae with the same regional identity elongate differently from their neighbors to establish and diversify adult proportion? Here, we find that vertebral lengths are largely determined by differences in growth cartilage height and the number of cells progressing through endochondral ossification. Hypertrophic chondrocyte size, a major contributor to differential elongation in mammal limb bones, differs only in the longest jerboa mid-tail vertebrae where they are exceptionally large. To uncover candidate molecular mechanisms of disproportionate vertebral growth, we performed intersectional RNA-Seq of mouse and jerboa tail vertebrae with similar and disproportionate elongation rates. Many regulators of posterior axial identity and endochondral elongation are disproportionately differentially expressed in jerboa vertebrae. Among these, the inhibitory natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPR3) appears in multiple studies of rodent and human skeletal proportion suggesting it refines local growth rates broadly in the skeleton and broadly in mammals. Consistent with this hypothesis, NPR3 loss of function mice have abnormal tail and limb proportions. Therefore, in addition to genetic components of the complex process of vertebral evolution, these studies reveal fundamental mechanisms of skeletal growth and proportion.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

This study investigated the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations, clinical outcomes and patient demographics in the Sylhet region of Bangladesh. We looked at the full genome sequences of 37 SARS-CoV-2 samples that were collected between January and June 2020. Specifically, we looked at five major spike protein mutations: D614G, A570D, D1118H, A222V, and P681R. The D614G mutation was the most prevalent (94.6%), followed by A570D and D1118H (both 32.4%), A222V (29.7%), and P681R (13.5%). Despite their high prevalence, we found no statistically significant associations between these mutations and clinical outcomes or demographic variables, except for possible trends for the P681R mutation. We found that age played a decisive role in recovery from COVID-19, with older patients exhibiting slower recovery rates. In terms of predictors of outcome, gender differences were observed: clinical symptoms and viral genetic mutations were more influential for men, while age and disease progression were more important for women. Common nucleotide substitutions (A23403G, C3037T, and C14408T) associated with European strains were identified, suggesting possible routes of transmission. This study contributes to our understanding of the genetics, clinical manifestations and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the Sylhet region and emphasizes the need for continuous genomic surveillance and adaptive public health strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

ObjectiveTo assess how genetics and other -omics information are used in the most cited recent clinical trials, and to evaluate industry involvement and transparency patterns.

Design, Setting, ParticipantsMeta-research evaluation using a previously constructed database of the 600 most cited clinical trials published from 2019 to 2022.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Utilization of genetic or other -omics information in the trial design, analysis, and results; industry involvement and transparency.

Results132 (22%) trials used genetic or other -omics information, predominantly for detection of cancer mutations (n=101). Utilization included eligibility criteria (n=59), subgroup analysis (n=82), and stratification factor in randomization (n=14). Authors addressed the relevance in the conclusions in 82 studies (62%). 102 studies (77%) provided data availability statements and 6 had data already available. Most studies had industry funding (n=111 [84.0%]). Oncology trials were more likely to be industry-funded (90.1% vs 64.5%, p=0.001), to have industry-affiliated analysts (43.6% vs 22.6%, p=0.036) and to favor industry-sponsored interventions (83.2% vs 58.1% p=0.004). When compared to other trials, genetic and other -omics trials were more likely to be funded by industry (84% vs 63.9%, p<0.001) and tended to be less likely to have full protocols (p=0.018) and statistical plans (p=0.04) available.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur study highlights the current underutilization of genetic and other-omics technologies beyond testing for cancer mutations. Industry involvement in these trials appears to be more substantial and transparency is more limited, raising concerns about potential bias.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow are genetics and other -omics information used in highly impactful clinical trials, and what is the involvement of the industry in their development?

Findings22% of the trials employed genetic or -omics information, with the vast majority being oncology-related and focusing on testing for mutations. Industry was more heavily involved in the funding and in the design of these trials, in particular for oncology trials.

MeaningThe use of genetics and -omics is limited and needs to become more common in non-oncology trials. Industry involvement is intense in this context, highlighting the need for improvements in transparency and independence.","NA","medrxiv",1730153368678

However, it remains unclear if specific characteristics of major life stressors and functional network disruptions differentially predict anxiety and depression symptoms over time and, if so, whether they act independently or jointly. We collected baseline lifetime stressor exposure data and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data in a longitudinal sample of 107 adolescents enriched for anxiety and depressive disorders. We examined five stressor characteristics: physical danger, interpersonal loss, humiliation, entrapment, and role change/disruption. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed at baseline, 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. Linear mixed effect models tested if these stressor characteristics, functional connectivity within and between frontoparietal, default, and ventral attention networks, and their interactions differentially predicted anxiety and depression symptoms at 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. Greater lifetime severity of physical danger and humiliation prospectively predicted increased anxiety symptoms at both follow-ups, whereas greater lifetime entrapment severity prospectively predicted higher anxiety and depression symptoms. Only the effects of lifetime entrapment severity were robust to including within- and between-network functional connectivity metrics and other significantly predictive stressor characteristics. Lifetime entrapment severity more strongly predicted anxiety symptoms in youth with higher default network connectivity. Greater functional connectivity between frontoparietal and default networks prospectively predicted increased depression symptoms. Taken together, these results underscore the critical importance of using stressor characteristics and functional connectivity jointly to study predictors for adolescent anxiety and depression.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368678

Existing tools primarily rely on electrophiles that are constitutively ""on"" or triggered by UV light, often resulting in high background reactivity. We developed an alternative, chemically triggered approach to crosslink RNAs using bioorthogonal cyclopropenones (CpOs). These reagents selectively react with phosphines to provide ketenes--electrophiles that can trap neighboring nucleophiles to forge covalent crosslinks. As proof-of-concept, we synthesized a panel of CpOs and appended them to thiazole orange (TO-1). The TO-1 conjugates bound selectively to a model RNA aptamer (Mango) with nanomolar affinity, confirmed by fluorescence turn-on. After phosphine administration, covalent crosslinks were formed between the CpO probes and RNA. The degree of crosslinking was both time and dose-dependent. We further applied the chemically triggered tools to model RNAs in biologically relevant conditions.

Despite the widely held perception that ancient symbionts have stable genomes, even tiny genomes experience ongoing pseudogenization. Whether these tiny genomes also experience bursts of rapid gene loss is, however, less understood. Giant scale insects (Monophlebidae) feed on plant sap and rely on the symbiotic bacterium Walczuchella which provides them with essential nutrients. When compared to other ancient symbionts with similar genome sizes such as Karelsulcia, Walczuchella's genome was previously reported as unusually pseudogene-rich (10 % of coding sequences). However, this result was based on only one genome assembly raising questions about the assembly quality or a recent ecological shift such as co-symbiont acquisition driving the gene loss. Here, we generated six complete genomes of Walczuchella from three genera of giant scales, each with distinct co-symbiotic partners. We show that all the genomes are highly degraded and particularly genes related to the cellular envelope and energy metabolism seem to be ongoing pseudogenization. Apart from general mechanisms driving genome reduction such as the long-term intracellular lifestyle with transmission bottlenecks, we hypothesize that a more profound loss of DNA replication and repair genes together with recent co-obligate symbiont acquisitions likely contribute to the accelerated degradation of Walczuchella genomes. Our results highlight that even ancient symbionts with small genomes can experience significant bursts of gene loss when stochastic processes erase a gene that accelerates gene loss or when the selection pressure changes such as after co-symbiont acquisition.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Recent advancements in transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) have shown promise in modulating these attentional processes by targeting electrical oscillations in specific brain areas. Despite evidence of the online effects of tACS on the task performance of visuo-spatial attention, whether tACS can produce lasting after-effects on the behavioral performance and neural activity during the visuo-spatial attention task remains unknown. This study aims to explore these after-effects on visuo-spatial attention by implementing a single-blind, sham-controlled, between-group experiment design. Twenty young and healthy participants were equally divided into two groups receiving either sham or active gamma tACS at 40 Hz targeted at the right parieto-occipital region. Each participant engaged in a version of the Posner cueing task, conducted with EEG recording before and after the tACS intervention. The results revealed that the active tACS group exhibited significant reductions in reaction time compared to the sham group. These changes were not uniform across different attention types, suggesting specific enhancements in cognitive processing. Additionally, EEG analysis showed that gamma tACS influenced various aspects of neural activity, including event-related potentials to the target, as well as the oscillatory power and long-range temporal correlations of EEG signal during the cue-target interval. The amplitude and latency of N1 and P3 components were modulated by gamma tACS. Notably, there was a decrease in alpha power and an increase in gamma power during the cue-target interval, alongside a decrease in long-range temporal correlations. These findings revealed the after-effect of gamma tACS on modulating the behavioral performance and neural activity in the visuo-spatial attention task, paving the way for future applications in cognitive enhancement and therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

However, we still know little about the metabolic interaction networks that occur within many microbiota. This is particularly true for the nasal microbiota, and current efforts towards this end are hampered by a lack of microbial consortia that would enable the mapping of metabolic interactions between nasal microbiota members under in vitro conditions. To tackle these issues, we developed the Porcine Nasal Consortium (PNC8), a rationally designed microbial consortium of eight strains representing the most in vivo abundant genera in the nasal microbiota of healthy piglets. We used this consortium to systematically examine the metabolic capabilities of nasal microbiota members, as well as the metabolic interactions occurring between them. We found that PNC8 strains differ substantially in their metabolic pathway repertoire and ability to grow across various in vitro conditions. Nevertheless, spent-media experiments revealed that most metabolic interactions between PNC8 strains are negative, and exometabolomics data pointed to co-depletion of sugars as a key driver of this interaction network. Finally, direct co-cultivation experiments showed that, as a result of this largely negative metabolic interaction network, competition is common among pairs of PNC8 strains and leads to a complex competition hierarchy in which only few strains are able to consistently outcompete all others. Overall, this work provides a valuable resource for studying the nasal microbiota under experimentally tractable in vitro conditions and is a key step towards mapping its metabolic interaction network.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Among the four main pectin domains, the structural intricacies of rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) remain the least understood, especially in widely employed plant models. We Using highly purified RG-I from different tissues, we conducted comparative linkage and NMR analyses, complemented by mass spectrometry of enzymatically digested RG-I oligosaccharides. Our findings present the most comprehensive structural overview of Arabidopsis RG-I to date, revealing novel structural features. Notably, we identified O-acetylation of rhamnose backbone residues as a predominant feature, a modification previously unreported in this species. The combined results present a comprehensive structural overview of Arabidopsis thaliana RG-I that will serve as a roadmap for studying pectin biosynthesis and function.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Little is known about this process's neural substrates or how visual attention affects the representations of accumulated evidence. We conducted a simultaneous eye-tracking and fMRI experiment in which human subjects gradually learned about the value of two food-lotteries. With this design we were able to extend decisions over a prolonged time-course, manipulate the temporal onset of evidence, and therefore dissociate sampled and accumulated evidence. Consistent with past work, we found correlates of sampled evidence in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and correlates of accumulated evidence in the prefrontal and parietal cortex. We also found that more gaze at an option increased its choice probability and that gaze amplified sampled-value signals in the vmPFC and ventral striatum. Most importantly, we found that gaze modulated accumulated-value signals in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), providing novel evidence that visual attention has lasting effects on decision variables and suggesting that activity in the pre-SMA reflects accumulated evidence and not decision conflict. These results shed new light on the neural mechanisms underlying gaze-driven decision processes.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

HASTY (HST), a karyopherin protein, has been implicated in miRNA biogenesis and movement, though its role in non-cell-autonomous miRNA movement remains unclear. Through a genetic screen, we identified that mutations in the HAWAIIAN SKIRT (HWS) gene suppress the developmental defects of hst mutants by restoring miRNA movement. Our findings show that HWS interacts with nuclear transport factors and nuclear pore complex (NPC) components, including NUP1, positioning HWS as a regulator of miRNA nuclear export. Using microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we showed that pri-miRNA transcription, and likely their co-transcriptional processing, occurs at the nuclear pore. Notably, we uncovered an antagonistic relationship between HST and HWS in regulating MIRNA transcription at the NPC and AGO1 loading, which could explain the observed changes in miRNA movement. HST promotes the association of MIRNA loci with the NPC, likely facilitating co-transcriptional processing, while HWS negatively regulates this process by targeting MEDIATOR complex subunits to degradation detaching, consequently, the processing complex from the NPC. Furthermore, our data provides evidence of spatial coordination of miRNA transcription, biogenesis, and movement highlighting a novel role for the NPC in the miRNA pathway.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

We investigated SARS-CoV-2 evolution and host-specific adaptation during an outbreak in Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica), African lions (Panthera leo), and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) at Denver Zoo in late 2021. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from longitudinal samples collected from 16 individuals were evaluated for within-host variation and genomic signatures of selection. The outbreak was likely initiated by a single spillover of a rare Delta sublineage subsequently transmitted from tigers to lions to hyenas. Within-host virus populations rapidly expanded and diversified. We detected signatures of purifying and positive selection, including strong positive selection in hyenas and in the nucleocapsid (N) gene in all animals.

Herpesvirus infection relies on receptor engagement by a gH/gL glycoprotein complex which induces large-scale conformational changes of the gB glycoprotein to mediate fusion of the viral and host membranes and infection. The instability of all herpesvirus gBs have hindered biochemical and functional studies, thereby limiting our understanding of the infection mechanisms of these pathogens and preventing vaccine design. Here, we computationally stabilized and structurally characterized the Epstein-Barr virus prefusion gB ectodomain trimer, providing an atomic-level description of this key therapeutic target.

Still, the mechanisms for these headache types are unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess levels of amyloid related biomarkers in patients with persistent headache after COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

MethodsIn this prospective observational cohort, patients with severe headache as the dominating symptom after COVID-19 disease (n=29) and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (n=31), had neurological assessments with reassessments after 6 months. Plasma levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), pregnancy zone protein (PZP), cathepsin L1 (CTSL) and serum Amyloid A (SAA1) were measured by ELISA in relation to levels in healthy controls (n=16).

ResultsWe found a strong and persistent upregulation of APP in patients with headache after COVID-19 as compared to the two other groups. At both inclusion and after 6 months APP levels were also increased in those with accompanying cognitive symptoms. In contrast, plasma levels of PZP were elevated in both headache groups as compared to healthy controls at inclusion and after 6 months follow-up, but with no relation to cognitive symptoms. CTSL was only elevated in those with COVID-19 associated headache at baseline, whereas SAA1 showed levels comparable in all groups.

ConclusionAltered plasma levels of soluble markers potentially reflecting changes in amyloid processing was found in patients with persistent headache after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and particular in those with persistent headache after COVID-19 disease where we also found some association with cognitive symptoms.

Here, we develop an experimentally-constrained biophysical network model of neocortical circuit motifs, focusing on layers 2-3 of the primary visual cortex (V1). We investigate the role of four major cortical interneuron classes in a competitive-cooperative computational primitive and validate these circuit motifs implemented soft winner-take-all (sWTA) computation for gain modulation, signal restoration, and context-dependent multistability. Using a novel parameter mapping technique, we configured IBMs TrueNorth (TN) chip to implement sWTA computations, mirroring biological neural dynamics. Retrospectively, we observed a strong correspondence between the biophysical model and the TN hardware parameters, particularly in the roles of four key inhibitory neuron classes: Parvalbumin (feedforward inhibition), Somatostatin (feedback inhibition), VIP (disinhibition), and LAMP5 (gain normalization). Moreover, the sparse coupling of this sWTA motif was also able to simulate a two-state neural state machine on the TN chip, replicating working memory dynamics essential for cognitive tasks. Additionally, integrating the sWTA computation as a preprocessing layer in the Vision Transformer (ViT) enhanced its performance on the MNIST digit classification task, demonstrating improved generalization to previously unseen data and suggesting a mechanism akin to zero-shot learning. Our approach provides a framework for translating brain-inspired computations to neuromorphic hardware, with potential applications on platforms like Intels Loihi2 and IBMs Northpole.

Male mosquitoes, on the other hand, are thought to rely exclusively on plant sugars for their energetic needs; indeed, this dichotomy is one of the central tenets of medical entomology. Here, we show that male Culex tarsalis and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes will readily take blood from a membrane feeder when reared under dehydration conditions with no toxic effects. Mosquitoes with impaired humidity detection do not increase their bloodfeeding rates when dehydrated compared to wild-type controls. While conventionally reared males ignore a human host, dehydrated males are attracted to and attempt to probe, with some success, although they cannot access host capillaries. However, they will take blood from a vertebrate host wound. When fed a blood meal containing West Nile virus, male mosquitoes can become infected with and orally transmit the pathogen at rates and titers equivalent to females. Finally, vertebrate DNA, likely from blood, was detected in wild-caught specimens of male Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes from Texas. These data suggest that under some circumstances male mosquitoes may be able to probe and/or ingest blood and transmit pathogens to vertebrate hosts, and that their role in maintaining pathogen transmission cycles should be re-examined.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Senolytics have emerged as a promising therapeutic intervention to extend healthspan and treat age-related diseases. Through a senescent cell-based phenotypic drug screen, we identified a class of conjugated polyunsaturated fatty acids, specifically -eleostearic acid and its methyl ester derivative, as novel senolytics that effectively killed a broad range of senescent cells, reduced tissue senescence, and extended healthspan in mice. Importantly, these novel lipids induced senolysis through ferroptosis, rather than apoptosis or necrosis, by exploiting elevated iron, cytosolic PUFAs and ROS levels in senescent cells.

This review summarises reported contact- tracing data and evaluates the secondary attack rates (SAR) and factors associated with SARS- CoV-2 transmission in aircraft, to provide insight for future decision making in the context of future respiratory pandemics.

MethodsThis scoping literature review assessed studies published between December 2020 to November 2023 in Ovid Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. The inclusion criteria were based on the PCC framework (P-Population, C-Concept, C-Context). The study population was restricted to passengers and crew (population) to assess transmission (concept) in an aircraft setting (context).

ResultsThirty-one studies which assess SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 521 domestic and international flights were included in this systematic review. The SAR reported in the studies with an identified index case ranged from 0% to 16%. Significant variation in the reporting across studies was noted. Overall, the studies reported that using face masks or respirators by passengers and crew members during flight seemed to be a possible strategy for mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission while sitting within close proximity to index cases ([&le;]2 seats in every direction) was associated with a higher SAR.

ConclusionsOur results are consistent with sporadic clusters happening onboard aircraft. Close proximity to COVID-19 cases within the aircraft was associated with a higher SAR. Our findings further underscore the need for a systematic approach to examining and reporting SARS-CoV-2 transmission onboard aircraft. This evidence may assist policymakers and transportation authorities in the development of emergency preparedness measures and travel guidance during the post-pandemic COVID-19 era.","NA","medrxiv",1730153368679

Alongside these introductions, inhabited and agricultural areas are spreading, and correspondingly most animal introductions occur in populated areas. Commensal species which can live alongside humans by making use of specific conditions, structures, or prey, have a significant advantage. Introduced mammal species often use anthropogenic features in their environment and demonstrate a higher tolerance of human disturbance, but their importance remains understudied in ectotherms. The Aesculapian snake (Zamenis longissimus) is an ectotherm which has been introduced beyond the northern extremities of its natural range. To understand their persistence, we radio-tracked snakes daily over two active seasons, including high-frequency tracking of a subset of males. We investigated snake home range size using Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimators (AKDE). Using AKDE-weighted Habitat Selection Functions we identified preferences for habitat features in a mosaic of habitats, and we used Integrated Step Selection Functions to further explore how these features influence movement. We revealed a particular preference for buildings in male snakes, while females preferred woodland. We demonstrate that the success of this ectothermic predator is likely tied to a willingness to use human features of the landscape.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

ObjectiveThis study aimed to verify the association between SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of Stroke, based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, in order to assess the inclusion of the virus as a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases.

MethodsA metaumbrella was conducted, which included 34 systematic reviews, of which 4 were selected for the final analysis based on methodological quality and consistency. The analysis aggregated the results of 70 primary studies, considering different stroke subtypes and outcomes associated with COVID-19. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} index, and significance bias was verified using Eggers test.

ResultsThe analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 is significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 1.55 - 3.95), particularly for ischemic stroke (eOR = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.11 - 2.80) and hemorrhagic stroke (eOR = 3.86; 95%CI: 1.79 - 8.33). Additionally, patients with cerebrovascular comorbidities had higher mortality (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 2.48 - 19.63), as did those who had previously suffered a stroke (eOR = 6.08; 95%CI: 3.73 - 9.91).

ConclusionThe association between SARS-CoV-2 and stroke was consistent and significant, suggesting that COVID-19 should be considered a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. However, the high heterogeneity among the studies analyzed reinforces the need for further research to consolidate this relationship.","NA","medrxiv",1730153368679

Maternal urinary tract infection (UTI) during pregnancy increases risk for preterm birth; however, biological processes mediating UTI-associated preterm birth are not well-described. We established a murine maternal UTI model in which challenge with uropathogenic E. coli resulted in preterm birth in about half of dams. Dams experiencing preterm birth displayed excessive bladder inflammation and altered uteroplacental T cell polarization compared to non-laboring infected dams, with no differences in bacterial burdens. Additional factors associated with preterm birth included higher proportions of male fetuses and lower maternal serum IL-10. Furthermore, exogenous maternal IL-10 treatment absolved UTI-associated preterm birth but contributed to fetal growth restriction in this model. Using urine samples from a cohort of human pregnancies with or without UTI, we correlated urinary cytokines with birth outcomes and urine culture status. These analyses yielded a non-invasive, highly predictive three-model system for evaluating preterm birth risk implicating cytokines IL-10, IL-15, IL-1{beta}, and IL-1RA. Our unique bimodal murine model coupled with patient samples provides a platform to investigate immunological and microbial factors governing UTI-associated preterm birth, revealing novel therapeutic opportunities to predict or prevent preterm birth.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Historically, fossils typically spent years in preparation to be freed from the enclosing rock. Now, X-ray and synchrotron tomography reveal structure that is otherwise invisible and data acquisition can be fast. However, manual segmentation of these 3D volumes can still take months to years. This is especially challenging for resource-poor teams, as scanning may be free, but the computing power and (AI-assisted) segmentation software required to handle the resulting large data sets are complex to use and expensive.

Here we present a free, browser-based segmentation tool that reduces computational overhead by splitting volumes into small chunks, allowing processing on low-memory, inexpensive hardware. Our tool also speeds up collaborative ground-truth generation and 3D visualization, all in-browser. We developed and evaluated our pipeline on various open-data scans of differing contrast, resolution, textural complexity, and size. Our tool successfully isolated the Thrinaxodon and Broomistega pair from an Early Triassic burrow. It isolated cranial bones from the Cretaceous acipenseriform Parapsephurus willybemisi on both 45.53 {micro}m and 13.67 {micro}m resolution scanning data. We also isolated bones of the Middle Triassic sauropterygian Nothosaurus and a challenging scan of a squamate embryo inside an egg dating back to the Early Cretaceous. Our tool reliably reproduces expert-supervised segmentation at a fraction of the time and cost, offering greater accessibility than existing tools. Beyond the online tool, all our code is open source, enabling contributions from the palaeontology community to further this emerging machine learning ecosystem.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

The advantage of GD is that it is effective at learning difficult tasks. However, it produces ANNs that are a poor phenomenological fit to biology, making them less relevant as models of the brain. Specifically, it violates Dale's law, by allowing synapses to change from excitatory to inhibitory and leads to synaptic weights that are not log-normally distributed, contradicting experimental data. Here, starting from first principles of optimisation theory, we present an alternative learning algorithm, exponentiated gradient (EG), that respects Dale's Law and produces log-normal weights, without losing the power of learning with gradients. We also show that in biologically relevant settings EG outperforms GD, including learning from sparsely relevant signals and dealing with synaptic pruning. Altogether, our results show that EG is a superior learning algorithm for modelling the brain with ANNs.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

However, the extent to which these relationships develop across all 4 cardiac chambers, particularly during early-stage disease, remains unknown. Here, we discovered that very young D2.mdx mice exhibit fibrosis exclusively in the right ventricle (RV) and left atrium. Concurrent cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and disorganization in the RV were related to a highly specific inflammatory signature of increased infiltrating pro-inflammatory macrophages (CD11b+CD45+CD64+F4/80+CCR2+), myofibre mitochondrial-linked apoptosis, and reduced carbohydrate and fat oxidation. This relationship did not occur in the left ventricle. Short-term daily administration of a peptidomimetic adiponectin receptor agonist, ALY688, completely prevented RV fibrosis, myofibre hypertrophy, infiltrating macrophages and mitochondrial stress as well as left atrial fibrosis. Our discoveries demonstrate early-stage cardiac tissue pathology occurs in a chamber-specific manner and is prevented by adiponectin receptor agonism, thereby opening a new direction for developing therapies that prevent tissue remodeling during DMD.

Dantrolene binds stacked with ATP or ADP in the RY12 domain at the corner of the receptor, inducing a conformational change in this domain which is allosterically coupled to pore closure. Functional analyses revealed that ATP or ADP was required for dantrolene inhibition, and a single point mutation that disrupts the peripheral ATP binding site abolished ATP/ADP-dependent dantrolene inhibition. Strikingly, in the absence of dantrolene, this site selectively binds two ADP molecules, suggesting a possible role in ATP/ADP ratio sensing.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Here, we discovered an unforeseen two-tier mechanism of neutrophil recruitment during infections, in which mechanosensing is key to initiating innate immunity. Leveraging a skin infection model and pathogenic bacteria and fungi, we demonstrate that the early recruitment of neutrophils is mainly danger-driven and partly reminiscent of sterile inflammation. Mechanistically, neutrophil recruitment is initiated by a mechanosensor-dependent pathway, involving the activation of PIEZO1 channels. This leads to LTB4 production, which, along with IL-1, induces the release of CXCL1, promoting neutrophil arrival to the site of infection. In contrast, later neutrophil recruitment is TLR- and CXCL2-dependent, highlighting a shift towards a pathogen-driven response to sustain inflammation. These findings advance our understanding of innate immunity by uncovering that mechanical and biochemical signals integrate into a circuit that initiates innate immune responses to microbial infections.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

An example of swift contextual generalization is observed in conditioning tasks, where performance is quickly generalized from one context to another. A key question in identifying the neural substrate underlying this ability is how the hippocampus (HPC) represents task-related stimuli across different environments, given that HPC cells exhibit place-specific activity that changes across contexts (remapping). In this study, we used calcium imaging to monitor hippocampal neuron activity as animals performed a conditioning task across multiple spatial contexts. We investigated whether hippocampal cells, which encode both spatial locations (place cells) and task-related information, could maintain their task representation even when their spatial encoding remapped in a new spatial context. To assess the consistency of task representations, we used advanced dimensionality reduction techniques combined with machine learning to develop manifold representations of population level HPC activity. The results showed that task-related neural representations remained stable even as place cell representations of spatial context changed, thus demonstrating similar embedding geometries of neural representations of the task across different spatial contexts. Notably, these patterns were not only consistent within the same animal across different contexts but also significantly similar across different animals, suggesting a standardized neural encoding or  neural syntax in the hippocampus. These findings bridge a critical gap between memory and navigation research, revealing how the hippocampus maintains cognitive consistency across different spatial environments. These findings also suggest that hippocampal function is governed by a neural framework shared between animals, an observation that may have broad implications for understanding memory, learning, and related cognitive processes. Looking ahead, this work opens new avenues for exploring the fundamental principles underlying hippocampal encoding strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Tau pathology spreads cell-to-cell2 but the exact mechanisms of tau release and intercellular transmission remain poorly defined. Tau is released from neurons as free protein or in extracellular vesicles (EVs)3-5 but the role of these different release mechanisms in intercellular tau transmission is unclear. Here, we show that the neuronal gene Arc is critical for packaging tau into EVs. Brain EVs purified from human tau (hTau) transgenic rTg4510 mice (rTgWT) contain high levels of hTau that are capable of seeding tau pathology. In contrast, EVs purified from rTgWT crossed with Arc knock-out mice (rTgArc KO) have significantly less hTau and cannot seed tau aggregation. Arc facilitates the release of hTau in EVs produced via the I-BAR protein IRSp53, but not free tau. Arc protein directly binds hTau to form a fuzzy complex that we identified in both mouse and human brain tissue. We find that pathological intracellular hTau accumulates in neurons in rTgArc KO mice, which correlates with accelerated neuron loss in the hippocampus. Finally, we find that intercellular tau transmission is significantly abrogated in Arc KO mice. We conclude that Arc-dependent release of tau in EVs plays a significant role in intracellular tau elimination and intercellular tau transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

However, the enzymes responsible for their turnover in plants remain largely unknown. Using a non-hydrolysable PP-InsP analog in a pull-down approach, we identified a family of Arabidopsis Nudix hydrolases (NUDTs) that group into two closely related subclades. Through in vitro assays, heterologous expression systems, and higher-order gene-edited mutants, we explored the substrate specificities and physiological roles of these hydrolases. Using a combination of strong anion exchange (SAX)-HPLC, PAGE, and capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS), we found that their PP-InsP pyrophosphatase activity is enantiomer-selective and Mg2+-dependent. Specifically, subclade I NUDTs preferentially hydrolyze 4-InsP7, while subclade II NUDTs target 3-InsP7, with minor activity against other PP-InsPs, including 5-InsP7. In higher-order mutants of subclade II NUDTs, we observed defects in both Pi and iron homeostasis, accompanied by increased levels of 1/3-InsP7 and 5-InsP7, with a markedly larger increase in 1/3-InsP7. Furthermore, ectopic expression of NUDTs from both subclades induced local Pi starvation responses (PSRs). However, RNA-seq analysis of WT and nudt12/13/16 plants suggests that these NUDTs have PSR-independent roles, potentially involving 1/3-InsP7 in the regulation of plant defense. Expanding beyond subclade II NUDTs, we demonstrated susceptibility of the 3PP-position of PP-InsPs to enzymatic activities unrelated to NUDTs, and found that such activities are conserved across plants and humans. Additionally, we found that NUDT effectors from pathogenic ascomycete fungi exhibit a substrate specificity similar to subclade I NUDTs. Collectively, our study provides new insights into the roles of NUDTs in regulating PP-InsP signaling pathways in plants and highlights cross-kingdom conservation of enzymes involved in PP-InsP metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Mendelian randomisation (MR) using molecular traits as exposures is a particularly promising approach for identifying such risk factors.

Here, using data from the UK Biobank, we illustrate the issue of horizontal pleiotropy with two case studies involving glycolysis and vitamin D synthesis pathways. In both cases, we demonstrate that, although the measured metabolites (pyruvate or histidine) do not have a direct causal effect on the outcomes of interest (red blood cell count or vitamin D level), we can still use variants effects on these metabolites to infer how they perturb protein function in different gene regions. This allows us to use variant effects on metabolite levels as proxy exposures in the cis-MR framework, thus rediscovering the causal roles of histidine ammonia lyase (HAL) in vitamin D synthesis and glycolysis pathway in red blood cell survival. We also highlight the assumptions that need to be satisfied for cis-MR with proxy exposures to yield valid inferences and discuss the practical challenges of meeting these assumptions.","NA","medrxiv",1730153368679

MethodsWe employed molecular assays, cell and egg culture, Sanger and next generation sequencing to isolate and characterize viruses from multiple farm specimens (cow nasal swab, milk specimens, fecal slurry, and a dead bird).

ResultsWe detected H5N1 HPAIV in 64% (9/14) of milk specimens, 2.6% (1/39) of cattle nasal swab specimens, and none of 17 cattle worker nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We cultured and characterized virus from eight H5N1-positive specimens. Sanger and next-generation sequencing revealed the viruses were closely related into other recent Texas epizootic H5N1 strains of clade 2.3.4.4b. Our isolates had multiple mutations associated with increased spillover potential. Surprisingly, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in a nasal swab from a sick cow. Additionally, 14.3% (2/14) of the farm workers who donated sera were recently symptomatic and had elevated neutralizing antibodies against a related H5N1 strain.

ConclusionsWhile our sampling was limited, these data offer additional insight into the large H5N1 HPAIV epizootic which thus far has impacted at least 96 cattle farms in twelve US states. Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few. We need to find ways to work with dairy farms in collecting more comprehensive epidemiological data that are necessary for the design of future interventions against H5N1 HPAIV on cattle farms.","NA","medrxiv",1730153368679

However, the role of glial mitochondria in proper brain development is not well understood. We show that astrocyte mitochondria undergo extensive fission while populating astrocyte distal branches during postnatal cortical development. Loss of mitochondrial fission regulator, Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), decreases mitochondrial localization to distal astrocyte processes, and this mitochondrial mislocalization reduces astrocyte morphological complexity. Functionally, astrocyte-specific conditional deletion of Drp1 induces astrocyte reactivity and disrupts astrocyte organization in the cortex. These morphological and organizational deficits are accompanied by loss of astrocytic gap junction protein Connexin 43. These findings uncover a crucial role for mitochondrial fission in coordinating astrocytic morphogenesis and organization, revealing the regulation of astrocytic mitochondria dynamics as a critical step in neurodevelopment.

SummaryDuring cortical astrocyte morphogenesis, mitochondria decrease in size to populate distal astrocyte processes. Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission is necessary for peripheral astrocyte process formation. Astrocyte-specific Drp1 loss induces astrocyte reactivity, disrupts cortical astrocyte organization, and dysregulates gap-junction protein Connexin 43 abundance.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Recombinant CD52 has been shown to act as a broad anti-inflammatory agent, dampening both adaptive and innate immune responses. This short glycopeptide is heavily glycosylated, with a complex sialylated N-linked glycan at N3 and reported O- linked glycosylation possible on several serine and threonine residues. Previously we demonstrated that specific glycosylation features of CD52 are essential for its immunosuppressive function, with terminal -2,3-linked sialic acids required for binding to the inhibitory SIGLEC-10 receptor leading to T-cell suppression. Using high resolution mass spectrometry, we have further characterised the N- and O-linked glycosylation of Expi293 recombinantly produced CD52 at a glycopeptide and released glycan level, accurately determining glycan heterogeneity of both N- and O-linked glycosylation, and localising the site of O-glycosylation to T8 with high confidence and direct spectral evidence. This detailed knowledge of CD52 glycosylation informed the construction of a model system, which we analysed by molecular dynamics simulations to understand the mechanism of recognition and define interactions between bioactive CD52, HMGB1 and the SIGLEC-10 receptor. Our results confirm the essential role of glycosylation, more specifically hyper-sialylation, in the function of CD52, and identify at the atomistic level specific interactions between CD52 glycans and the Box B domain of HMGB1 that determine recognition, and the stability of the CD52/HMGB1 complex. These insights will inform the development of synthetic CD52 as an immunotherapeutic agent.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Liver damage has emerged as a notable feature, yet no systematic review or meta-analysis has comprehensively evaluated the biomarkers confirming liver injury in LC patients.

ObjectiveThe present study aims to examine blood-based biomarkers of liver damage in LC disease.

MethodsA search of PubMed, Google Scholar, SciFinder, and SCOPUS identified 61 eligible studies, including 7172 participants, with 3404 LC patients and 3768 controls.

ResultsOur analysis identified a significant increase in the liver damage index among LC patients, with a moderate effect size (standardized mean difference, SMD = 0.553; confidence intervals; 95% CI: 0.305-0.760) compared to normal controls. Additionally, LC patients exhibited marked elevations in alanine aminotransferase (SMD = 0.615; 95% CI: 0.351;0.878), aspartate aminotransferase (SMD = 0.352; 95% CI: 0.068;0.637), gamma-glutamyl transferase (SMD = 0.969; 95% CI: 0.194;1.745), and lactate dehydrogenase (SMD = 0.666; 95% CI: 0.332;0.999) activities. Moreover, significant reductions were observed in total protein (SMD = -0.326; 95% CI: -0.631; -0.021) and increases in prothrombin time (SMD = 0.633; 95% CI: 0.077;1.189), ferritin (SMD = 0.437; 95% CI: 0.069;0.805), D-dimer (SMD = 0.359; 95% CI: 0.144;0.573). Further studies are needed to confirm reductions in platelet count and elevations in fibrinogen levels

ConclusionThis study suggests that LC is associated with persistent liver damage and coagulopathy, highlighting the need to incorporate liver injury into treatment strategies to reduce potential risks.","NA","medrxiv",1730153368679

Despite its popularity among recreational users and distinct pharmacodynamics, the neural correlates of 2C-B remain unexplored. Using 7T resting-state functional MRI in 22 healthy volunteers, we mapped out the acute effects of matched doses of 20 mg 2C-B, 15 mg psilocybin and placebo across spatiotemporal benchmarks of functional brain organisation. In a within-subjects, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, we evaluated the neuropharmacological and neurobehavioural correlates of an array of connectivity measures - including static (sFC) and global connectivity (gFC), dynamic connectivity variability (dFC), and spontaneous brain complexity. Compared to placebo, 2C-B and psilocybin selectively reduced intra-network sFC, while broadly increasing between-network and subcortical-cortical connectivity. Compared to psilocybin, 2C-B exhibited less pronounced reductions in between-network FC but elicited elevations in transmodal sFC. Both compounds yielded spatially divergent increases in gFC yet produced similar increases in brain complexity. Using PET density modelling, the spatial distribution of neural effects aligned with documented differences in monoaminergic transporter and serotonergic receptor binding affinity beyond 5-HT2A, highlighting the role of pharmacology in shaping functional dynamics. Lastly, we show behavioural markers of psychedelic effects are non-linearly reflected by the desynchronisation of the transmodal axis of functional brain organisation. Together, our findings highlight 2C-B as a useful new addition to the study of psychedelic neuroscience and may motivate new pharmacotherapy strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Here, we bridge this gap by linking genome to proteome in 800 meiotic progeny from an intercross between two closely related Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates adapted to distinct niches. Modest genetic distance between the parents generated remarkable proteomic diversity that was amplified in the progeny and captured by 6,476 genotype-protein associations, over 1,600 of which we resolved to single variants. Proteomic adaptation emerged through the combined action of numerous cis- and trans-regulatory mutations, a regulatory architecture that was conserved across the species. Notably, trans-regulatory variants often arose in proteins not traditionally associated with gene regulation, such as enzymes. Moreover, the proteomic consequences of mutations predicted fitness under various stresses. Our study demonstrates that the collective action of natural genetic variants drives dramatic proteome diversification, with molecular consequences that forecast phenotypic outcomes.

Highlights- Proteome diversity arises from natural genetic variants, with divergent proteomes in closely related parents and progeny.
- Cis-regulatory elements had strong individual impacts, but coherent trans effects combined to dominate protein expression.
- Directional selection and frequent transgression suggest much of the proteome is under selective pressure.
- Many trans-regulators are enzymes or transporters, with fewer than 4% of pQTLs linking known interactors.
- Genome-to-proteome connections predicted the fitness impact of mutations under various stresses, including a strong but hidden causal variant in IRA2/NF1.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

However, there is a lack of reliable large-scale predictive frameworks to quantify how much genetic diversity has already been lost, let alone to quantitatively predict future losses under different conservation scenarios in the 21st century. Combining spatio-temporal population genetic theory with population genomic data of 18 plant and animal species, we studied the dynamics of genetic diversity after habitat area losses. We show genetic diversity reacts slowly to habitat area and population declines, but lagged losses will continue for many decades even after habitats are fully protected. To understand the magnitude of this problem, we combined our predictive method with species habitat area and population monitoring reported in the Living Planet Index, the Red List, and new GBF indicators. We then project genetic diversity loss in 13,808 species with a short-term genetic diversity loss of 13-22% and long-term loss of 42-48% with substantial deviations depending on the level of habitat fragmentation. These results highlight that protection of only current habitats is insufficient to ensure the genetic health of species and that continuous genetic monitoring alone likely underestimates long term impacts.

We applied our method to stress-test a highly effective gene drive that has evaded resistance in all laboratory-contained releases to date, known as Ag(QFS)1. We showed that previously undetected resistant alleles can arise at low frequency, and discovered novel, partially resistant alleles that can perturb drive-invasion dynamics. We then engineered next-generation gene drives that can actively remove resistant alleles by targeting several highly conserved and non-overlapping sites in the female-specific exon of the doublesex gene. Our models predict that such gene drive designs could suppress large, natural populations of the malaria mosquito in the field.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

These cellular interactions can be considered to be representative of evolutionary steps in plastid acquisition in eukaryotes, but the underlying cellular mechanisms and dynamics are not fully understood. Here, we studied a kleptoplastidic dinoflagellate (RSD: Ross Sea Dinoflagellate), which is known to steal plastids of the microalga Phaeocystis antarctica. We tracked the morphology and activity of stolen plastids over several months by combining multimodal subcellular imaging and photophysiology. Upon integration inside a host vacuole, the volume of plastids and pyrenoids significantly increased and photosynthetic activity was boosted along with carbon fixation and transfer to the host. This may be supported by the retention of a 50-fold larger algal nucleus for [~]1 week. Once the algal nucleus was lost, there was a decrease in plastid volume and photosynthesis, but plastids were still beneficial for the host after > 2 months. Unlike other kleptoplastidic interactions, we showed that the algal mitochondrion was also stolen and retained for several months, transforming into an extensive network in close proximity with plastids. This highlights a new strategy in plankton along the continuum of plastid symbioses where both the energy-producing plastid and mitochondrion of a microalga are hijacked for several months by a host. This symbiosis that we found to be widely-distributed in polar regions suggests that plastid-mitochondrion interaction may have played a role in the evolution of plastid acquisition.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Here, we use long-read nanopore sequencing technology to develop a crossover mapping pipeline, COmapper, for high-resolution mapping of genome-wide crossovers from pooled DNA of F1 hybrid pollen and F2 recombinant seedlings derived from a cross between Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col and Ler. We validate the high accuracy of COmapper by applying nanopore long-read sequencing to pooled DNA of Arabidopsis F2 individuals with crossovers mapped by short-read sequencing. Using the COmapper, we constructed high-resolution genomic maps of crossovers using F1 hybrid pollen and F2 seedlings in wild type and crossover-elevated recq4a recq4b mutant, showing results comparable to short-read sequencing. Crossovers were enriched at gene-proximal promoters in wild type and increased but reshaped by high polymorphism density in recq4a recq4b.

PAD12 tau can be used for both nucleation-dependent and multiple rounds of seeded assembly in vitro, as well as for the seeding of tau biosensor cells. PAD12 tau can be assembled into paired helical filaments under various shaking conditions, with the resulting filaments being stable for extended periods of time. They can be labelled with fluorophores and biotin. Tau filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with Alzheimers disease brains have been known to be made of hyperphosphorylated and abnormally phosphorylated full-length tau, but it was not known if the presence of this post-translational modification is more than a mere correlation. Our findings suggest that hyperphosphorylation of tau may be sufficient for the formation of the Alzheimer tau fold. PAD12 tau will be a useful tool for the study of molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Defined as the use of tools to provide clear practical benefits to individuals, well-documented examples of material culture include nut-cracking2 and termite fishing3 in chimpanzees. Additionally, there is growing interest in animal social traditions, which appear crucial for social interaction and group cohesion. We have previously documented such a tradition, in which chimpanzees copied inserting blades of grass in their ears from one persistent inventor4. Now, over a decade later, we have observed an unrelated group of chimpanzees where 5/8 individuals began wearing grass in their ears and 6/8 from their rectums. As of 2024, one newly introduced chimpanzee has adopted the grass-in-ear behavior. Given that the behaviors were not observed in seven other groups in the same sanctuary (N=148), we conclude that social learning of arbitrary behavior occurred and discuss our findings considering the larger scope of animal culture.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Similar to AM symbiosis, multiple other intracellular symbiotic interactions have evolved in a variety of land plants. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis contrasts with these relationships as there is no intracellular accommodation of the symbiont inside the plant cell, but only intercellular colonization. This symbiotic relationship is common in a variety of seed plants, mostly trees and shrubs such as pines, willows and oaks.

Although it is known which plant lineages are involved in ECM symbiosis, there has been little investigation into the evolutionary origin of ECM symbiosis in these lineages. Furthermore, the genetic innovations and transcriptomic response related to this symbiosis have been studied largely in a genus or species-specific context, which hinders the study of their evolutionary origins. In this study, we reconstruct the origin of ECM in the rosid clade, showing at least 16 independent origins, resulting in the 17 known extant ECM rosid lineages. Moreover, comparative genomics of these lineages highlight genes involved in cell wall remodeling which underwent duplications in a convergent manner across ectomycorrhizal lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Capturing this structure remains a significant scientific challenge. Using information theory, we apply Dynamical Independence (DI) to uncover the emergent dynamical structure in a minimal 5-node biophysical neural model, shaped by the interplay of two key aspects of brain organisation: integration and segregation. In our study, functional integration within the biophysical neural model is modulated by a global coupling parameter, while functional segregation is influenced by adding dynamical noise, which counteracts global coupling. DI defines a dimensionally-reduced macroscopic variable (e.g., a coarse-graining) as emergent to the extent that it behaves as an independent dynamical process, distinct from the micro-level dynamics. We measure dynamical dependence (a departure from dynamical independence) for macroscopic variables across spatial scales. Our results indicate that the degree of emergence of macroscopic variables is relatively minimised at balanced points of integration and segregation and maximised at the extremes. Additionally, our method identifies to which degree the macroscopic dynamics are localised across microlevel nodes, thereby elucidating the emergent dynamical structure through the relationship between microscopic and macroscopic processes. We find that deviation from a balanced point between integration and segregation results in a less localised, more distributed emergent dynamical structure as identified by DI. This finding suggests that a balance of functional integration and segregation is associated with lower levels of emergence (higher dynamical dependence), which may be crucial for sustaining coherent, localised emergent macroscopic dynamical structures. This work also provides a complete computational implementation for the identification of emergent neural dynamics that could be applied both in silico and in vivo.

Author summaryUnderstanding how complex neural systems give rise to emergent macroscopic patterns is a central challenge in neuroscience. Emergence, where macroscopic structures appear from underlying microscopic interactions, plays a crucial role in brain function, yet identifying the specific dynamics involved remains elusive. Traditionally, methods have quantified the extent of emergence but have struggled to pinpoint the emergent dynamical structure itself. In this study, we develop and apply a method, based on a quantity called Dynamical Independence (DI), which simultaneously captures the extent of emergence and reveals the underlying dynamical structure in neurophysiological data. Using a minimal 5-node biophysical neural model, we explore how a balance between functional integration and segregation--two key organisational principles in the brain--affects emergent macroscopic dynamics. Our results show that a finely balanced system produces highly localised, coherent macroscopic structures, while extreme deviations lead to more distributed, less localised dynamics. This work provides a computational framework for identifying emergent dynamical structure in both theoretical models and potentially in empirical brain data, advancing our understanding of the brains complex organisation across higher-order scales.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Several human cases have been reported with clinical signs ranging from conjunctivitis to respiratory illness. However, most of those infected report mild to moderate symptoms, while previously reported HPAI H5Nx infections in humans have had mortality rates upwards of 50%. We recently reported that mice with pre-existing immunity to A/Puerto Rico/08/1934 H1N1 virus were protected from lethal challenge from highly pathogenic clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 influenza virus. Here, we demonstrate that mice infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus strain A/California/04/2009 (Cal09) or vaccinated with a live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) were moderately-to-highly protected against a lethal A/bovine/Ohio/B24OSU-439/2024 H5N1 virus challenge. We also observed that ferrets with mixed pre-existing immunity--either from LAIV vaccination and/or from Cal09 infection--showed protection against a HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus isolated from a cat. Notably, this protection occurred independently of any detectable hemagglutination inhibition titers (HAIs) against the H5N1 virus. To explore factors that may contribute to protection, we conducted detailed T cell epitope mapping using previously published sequences from H1N1 strains. This analysis revealed a high conservation of amino acid sequences within the internal proteins of our bovine HPAI H5N1 virus strain. These data highlight the necessity to explore additional factors that contribute to protection against HPAI H5N1 viruses, such as memory T cell responses, in addition to HA-inhibition or neutralizing antibodies.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

Prior research finds contradictory results, which may be due to age differences between the studied offspring.

MethodsHere, we studied the entire Norwegian population aged 10 to 40 between 2006 and 2018 (N = 2,468,503). By linking tax registries to administrative health registries, we describe prevalence rates by age, sex, and parental income rank. Next, we used kinship-based models with extended families of twins and siblings to distinguish direct effects of parents from shared genetic and environmental risk factors.

ResultsWe show that lower parental income rank was associated with more psychiatric disorders at all ages from age 10 to 40 (r between -.06 and -.15). The kinship-based models indicated that direct effects of parental income played a large role (38%) in explaining the parent-offspring correlation among adolescents, while shared risk factors accounted for the entire parent-offspring correlation among adults.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that social causation plays a significant role during adolescence, while social selection fully explains the parent-offspring association in adulthood.","NA","medrxiv",1730153368679

Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1730153368679

We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679

We describe this burden and compare it to the burden of influenza in the first two post-pandemic years in Denmark.

MethodsA cohort study including residents in Denmark from May 16, 2022, to June 7, 2024. Data were obtained from national registries, including information on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-positive COVID-19 and influenza admissions, mortality within 30 days of admission, sex, age, COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, comorbidity, and living in long-term care facility for elderly. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to compare rates of admissions between COVID-19 and influenza. To assess severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 30-day mortality between COVID-19 and influenza.

ResultsAmong 5,899,170 individuals, admissions with COVID-19 (n=24,687) were more frequent than admissions with influenza (n=8,682; aIRR 2.01, 95%CI 1.37-2.95), in particular during the first year (p=0.01), in the summer (p<0.001) and among people above 65 years of age (p<0.001). The number of deaths were also higher (COVID-19, n=2,393; influenza, n=522). Among patients, the risk of mortality of COVID-19 was higher than influenza in the 12-30 days following admission (0-11 days, aHR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.25; 12-30 days, aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.21-1.84), in particular among non-vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza (aHR 1.81, 95%CI 1.25-2.62), while it was similar to influenza among patients without comorbidities (aHR 1.07, 95%CI 0.63-1.80).

ConclusionCOVID-19 represented a greater disease burden than influenza, with more hospitalisations and deaths, and more severe disease primarily among non-vaccinated and comorbid patients.

However, high-fat diets are typically provided freely to animals in obesity experiments, so it remains unclear if high-fat diets would still cause obesity if they required more effort to obtain. We hypothesized that unrestricted and easy access is necessary for high-fat diet induced over-eating, and the corollary that requiring mice to perform small amounts of work to obtain high-fat diet would reduce high-fat diet intake and associated weight gain. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel home-cage based feeding device that either provided high-fat diet freely, or after mice poked their noses into a port one time, a simple action that is easy for them to do. We tested the effect of this intervention for six weeks, with mice receiving all daily calories from high-fat diet, modifying only how they accessed it. Requiring mice to nose-poke to access high-fat diet reduced intake and nearly completely prevented the development of obesity. In follow up experiments, we observed a similar phenomenon in mice responding for low-fat grain-based pellets that do not induce obesity, suggesting a general mechanism whereby animals engage with and consume more food when it is freely available vs. when it requires a simple action to obtain. We conclude that unrestricted access to food promotes overeating, and that a simple action such as a nose-poke can reduce over-eating and weight gain in mice. This may have implications for why over-eating and obesity are common in modern food environments, which are often characterized by easy access to low-cost unhealthy foods.","NA","biorxiv",1730153368679
