Only a limited number of Clade I MPXV genomes have been characterized so far, and they are not representative across different regions and time periods. Methods: We conducted whole genome sequencing of 603 mpox-positive samples that were collected from 581 patients between 2018-2024 in 17/26 provinces of the DRC. Results: For 423 (70.1%) samples the genome coverage was at least 70%, and near full-length MPXV genomes (>90% coverage) were obtained for 348 (57.7%) samples collected from 337 patients. All newly generated MPXV sequences belong to Clade I among which 17 are Clade Ib strains, all from patients infected in 2024 in the South-Kivu province. The remaining new strains fall in previously described Clade Ia groups and potential new groups have also been observed. Genetically diverse MPXV lineages co-circulate in small geographic areas during the same outbreak suggesting multiple zoonotic introductions over a short time period from one or multiple reservoir species. The low number of APOBEC3 mutations in Clade Ia suggests that most human mpox cases are probably linked to zoonotic spillover events. Recent identification of mpox cases in Kinshasa shows that multiple lineages circulate in a large urban center, indicating separate introduction events. Conclusion: The mpox epidemic in the DRC exhibits two distinct patterns. In traditional endemic regions, the epidemic in DRC is predominated by zoonotic spillover events involving Clade Ia. Conversely, in the eastern part of the country, the Clade Ib outbreak is driven by human-to-human transmission highlighting the need for a coordinated response effort at the national, regional and international levels","NA","medrxiv",1723759666401

Additionally, we provided sufficient conditions for the stability of the model around the disease-free equilibrium points. Finally, using a few simulation studies, we demonstrate our theoretical results. In particularly, we derived threshold values for HBV only, COVID-19 only, and co-infection for the stochastic model around disease-free equilibrium point. Next, the conditions for stability in the stochastic sense for HBV only, COVID-19 only submodels, and the full model are established. Furthermore, we devote our concentrated attention to sufficient conditions for extinction and persistence using each of these reproductive numbers. Finally, by using the Euler Murayama scheme, we demonstrate the dynamics of the coinfection by means of numerical simulations.","NA","medrxiv",1723759666401

Guidelines from organizations such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend several screening strategies, including endoscopic, radiologic, and stool-based options such as the multi-target stool DNA (mt-sDNA) test. In this analysis, we analyzed the estimated clinical, social, and economic impacts of mt-sDNA screening over the inaugural 10-year period for test availability.

MethodsTo assess the effectiveness of CRC screenings with the mt-sDNA test, published rates of advanced precancerous lesions (APL) and cancer prevalence by stage, as well as the transition rate of APL to CRC for the average-risk population in the US were used for a simulated population. The mt-sDNA tests sensitivity and specificity for APL and CRC were derived from previously published data. To assess the economic impact of screening with mt-sDNA compared to colonoscopy, we utilized data from literature regarding the time and resources required to prepare and complete each test. Furthermore, the costs of treatment according to the stage of colorectal cancer are considered, to show the value of CRC prevention and early detection.

ResultsOur analysis indicates that mt-sDNA screening detected an estimated 98,000 cases of CRC and 525,000 individuals were found to have APLs, precursors to CRC. When using 10-year survival rate from CRC, it is estimated that the mt-sDNA test led to more than 34,000 patients surviving due to earlier intervention compared to no screening. Furthermore, the mt-sDNA test demonstrated approximately $22.3 billion cost savings compared to no screening, including an estimated $9.7 billion in cancer treatment costs through early CRC detection and an additional $12.6 billion resulting from cancer prevention through APL detection and management.

ConclusionClinical availability, adoption, and growth of stool-based CRC screening have significantly increased overall screening rates in the US. It is estimated that mt-sDNA utilization will continue to grow, providing a home-based CRC screening solution for millions of screen-eligible US adults over the next decade and beyond.","NA","medrxiv",1723759666401

AIM-NASH demonstrated high repeatability and reproducibility compared to manual scoring. AIM-NASH-assisted reads by expert MASH pathologists were superior to unassisted reads in accurately assessing inflammation, ballooning, NAS >= 4 with >=1 in each score category, and MASH resolution, while maintaining non-inferiority in steatosis and fibrosis assessment. These findings suggest AIM-NASH could mitigate reader variability, providing a more reliable assessment of therapeutics in MASH clinical trials.","NA","medrxiv",1723759666401

Exploitation of this largely unexplored molecular space requires identification and functional characterisation of genes that act at the phage-host interface. To date, this is restricted to few model phage-host systems that are amenable to genetic manipulation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a non-genetic mRNA targeting approach using exogenous delivery of programmable antisense oligomers (ASOs) to silence genes of both DNA and RNA phages. A systematic knockdown screen of core and accessory genes of the nucleus-forming jumbo phage {Phi}KZ, coupled to RNA-sequencing and microscopy analyses, reveals previously unrecognised proteins that are essential for phage replication and that, upon silencing, elicit distinct phenotypes at the level of the phage and host response. One of these factors is a {Phi}KZ-encoded nuclease that acts at a major decision point during infection, linking the formation of the protective phage nucleus to phage genome amplification. The non-genetic ASO-based gene silencing used here promises to be a versatile tool for molecular discovery in phage biology, will help elucidate defence and anti-defence mechanisms in non-model phage-host pairs, and offers potential for optimising phage therapy and biotechnological procedures.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

As a notable example, growth plate hypertrophic chondrocytes use cellular biogenesis and disproportionate fluid uptake to expand 10 to 20 times in size to drive lengthening of endochondral bone. Similarly, notochordal cells expand to one of the largest cell types in the developing embryo to drive axial extension. In zebrafish, the notochord vacuolated cells undergo vacuole fusion to form a single large, fluid-filled vacuole that fills the cytoplasmic space and contributes to vacuolated cell expansion. When this process goes awry the notochord lacks sufficient hydrostatic pressure to support vertebral bone deposition resulting in adult spines with misshapen vertebral bones and scoliosis. However, it remains unclear whether endochondral bone and the notochord share common genetic and cellular mechanisms for regulating cell and tissue expansion. Here, we demonstrate that the 5'inositol phosphatase gene, inppl1a, regulates notochord expansion, spine morphogenesis, and endochondral bone lengthening in zebrafish. Furthermore, we show that inppl1a regulates notochord expansion independent of vacuole fusion, thereby genetically decoupling these processes. We demonstrate that inppl1a dependent notochord expansion is essential to establish normal mechanical properties of the notochord to facilitate the development of a straight spine. Finally, we find that inppl1a is also important for endochondral bone lengthening in fish, as has been shown in the human INPPL1 related endochondral bone disorder Opsismodysplasia. Overall, this work reveals a conserved mechanism of cell size regulation that influences disparate tissues critical for skeletal development and short stature disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

Analysis of distinct exercise modalities (aerobic and resistance exercise) revealed unique gene pathways, contrasting with patterns observed in inactivity (muscle disuse) studies.

However, the translation from patterns of allele frequency change to rapid adaptation of complex traits remains unresolved. We used abdominal pigmentation in Drosophila melanogaster as a model phenotype to address the nature, genetic architecture, and repeatability of rapid adaptation in the field. We show that D. melanogaster pigmentation evolves as a highly parallel and deterministic response to shared environmental gradients across latitude and season in natural North American populations. We then experimentally evolved replicate, genetically diverse fly populations in field mesocosms to remove any confounding effects of demography and/or cryptic structure that may drive patterns in wild populations; we show that pigmentation rapidly responds, in parallel, in fewer than ten generations. Thus, pigmentation evolves concordantly in response to spatial and temporal climatic gradients. We next examined whether phenotypic differentiation was associated with allele frequency change at loci with established links to genetic variance in pigmentation in natural populations. We found that across all spatial and temporal scales, phenotypic patterns were associated with variation at pigmentation-related loci, and the sets of genes we identified in each context were largely nonoverlapping. Therefore, our findings suggest that parallel phenotypic evolution is associated with an unpredictable genomic response, with distinct components of the polygenic architecture shifting across each environmental gradient to produce redundant adaptive patterns.

Significance StatementShifts in global climate conditions have heightened our need to understand the dynamics and pace of adaptation in natural populations. In order to anticipate the population-level response to rapidly changing environmental conditions, we need to understand whether trait evolution is predictable over short timescales, and whether the genetic basis of adaptation is shared or distinct across multiple timescales. Here, we explored parallelism in the adaptive response of a complex phenotype, D. melanogaster pigmentation, to shared conditions that varied over multiple spatiotemporal scales. Our results demonstrate that while phenotypic adaptation proceeds as a predictable response to environmental gradients, even over short timescales, the genetic basis of the adaptive response is variable and nuanced across spatial and temporal contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

We have uncovered a sex chromosome in California two-spot octopus (Octopus bimaculoides) in which males/females have ZZ/ZO karyotypes respectively. We show that the octopus Z chromosome is an evolutionary outlier with respect to divergence and repetitive element content as compared to autosomes and that it is present in all cephalopods that we have examined including Nautilus, the outgroup to squids and octopuses. Our results suggest that the cephalopod Z chromosome system originated before the split of all extant cephalopod lineages, over 480 million years ago and has been conserved to the present, making it the among the oldest conserved animal sex chromosome systems known.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

Here we survey four commonly used plasmid backbones for occurrence of multimers in cloning (JM109) and wild-type (MG1655) strains. We find that multimers occur appreciably only in MG1655, with the fraction of plasmids existing as multimers increasing with both plasmid copy number and culture passaging.

We found that the branched actin nucleator Arp2/3 regulates t-tubule organisation in myofibers. Cortical actin limits t-tubule growth, suggesting that it must be locally disassembled to allow the t-tubule to grow. T-tubule overgrowth is limited by Arpc5-containing Arp2/3 iso-complexes, but not those containing Arpc5L. Loss of Arpc5 results in malformed t-tubule clusters, impaired triads, and asynchronous muscle contraction, as found in multiple muscle disorders.

In Eurasia, prehistoric migration and population replacement have affected present-day humans. The available high-quality genetic evidence for prehistoric migration in eastern Eurasia, particularly in the Far East, is still limited. We succeeded in obtaining low-contaminant, high-coverage genomes from middle-Yayoi (>46-fold coverage) and Initial Jomon (>67-fold coverage) individuals from mainland Japan. This study demonstrated that the Yayoi individual exhibited a genetic profile distinct from that of the indigenous Jomon population of the Japanese archipelago, suggesting that Yayoi ancestry was connected to the peopling of the Eurasian continent. Our high-coverage genome provides interesting insights into the evolution of copy number polymorphisms related to the dietary styles of ancient Japanese people. The copy number estimates of the amylase gene for the Yayoi individual were comparable to those of present-day East Asians who have diets high in starch. This suggests that the population in the middle Yayoi period may have already adapted to high-starch diets, which may have been related to paddy rice agriculture introduced from the continent. Furthermore, the individual from the initial Jomon period showed high amylase copy numbers comparable to those from modern East Eurasia, including modern Japanese. This suggests that some Jomon people may have consumed a high-starch diet then. The high-coverage whole-genome sequence also revealed differences in the demographic backgrounds of the two ancestral populations during the Yayoi and Jomon periods. Our results shed light on the prehistorical events and origins of related migrations from Eurasia at that time and their genetic background, cultural transformations, and links to modern Japanese people.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

Previous studies, including our own research, have shown that specific interneuron subtypes are closely associated with particular pyramidal neuron types, forming stereotyped local inhibitory microcircuits. However, the developmental processes that establish these precise networks are not well understood. Here we show that pyramidal neuron types are instrumental in driving the terminal differentiation and maintaining the survival of specific associated interneuron subtypes. In a wild-type cortex, the relative abundance of different interneuron subtypes aligns precisely with the pyramidal neuron types to which they synaptically target. In Fezf2 mutant cortex, characterized by the absence of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons and an expansion of layer 6 intratelencephalic neurons, we observed a corresponding decrease in associated layer 5b interneurons and an increase in layer 6 subtypes. Interestingly, these shifts in composition are achieved through mechanisms specific to different interneuron types. While SST interneurons adjust their abundance to the change in pyramidal neuron prevalence through the regulation of programmed cell death, parvalbumin interneurons alter their identity. These findings illustrate two key strategies by which the dynamic interplay between pyramidal neurons and interneurons allows local microcircuits to be sculpted precisely. These insights underscore the precise roles of extrinsic signals from pyramidal cells in the establishment of interneuron diversity and their subsequent integration into local cortical microcircuits.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

However, the scalability of microalgae as a bioresource has been hindered by challenges such as costly biomass production related to vulnerability to pond crashes during large-scale cultivation. This study presents a pipeline for the genetic engineering and pilot-scale production of biodiesel and thermoplastic polyurethane precursors in the extremophile species Chlamydomonas pacifica. This extremophile microalga exhibits exceptional resilience to high pH, high salinity, and elevated temperatures. Initially, we evolved this strain to also have a high tolerance to high light intensity through mutagenesis, breeding, and selection. Subsequently, we genetically engineered C. pacifica to produce high levels of lipids and starch without compromising growth. We demonstrated the scalability of these engineered strains by cultivating them in pilot-scale raceway ponds and converting the resulting biomass into biodiesel and thermoplastic polyurethanes. This study showcases the complete cycle of transforming a newly discovered species into a commercially relevant commodity production strain. This research underscores the potential of extremophile algae, including C. pacifica, as a key species for the burgeoning sustainable bioeconomy, offering a viable path forward in mitigating environmental challenges and supporting global bioproduct demands.

Here, we sought to study the effects of a modified version of inflammatory soup on the excitability of human stem-cell derived sensory neurons. For this, we used a pre-existing and a novel stem cell line, modified to stably express the calcium sensor GCamP6f. Upon treatment with inflammatory soup, we observed no changes in neuronal transcription or functional responses upon calcium imaging, and only a very minor increase in resting membrane potential via whole cell patch clamping. Similarly small changes were observed when treating mouse primary sensory neurons with inflammatory soup. A semi-systematic re-examination of past literature further indicated that observed effects of inflammatory mediators on dissociated sensory neuron cultures are generally very small. We conclude that modelling inflammation-induced peripheral sensitization in vitro is non-trivial and will require careful selection of mediators and/or more complex, longitudinal multi-cellular setups. Especially in the latter, our novel GCamP6f induced-pluripotent stem cell line may be of value.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

In combination with phylogenomics analyses, hybrid zone studies may illuminate the role of ancient and contemporary gene flow in shaping variation of phylogenetic signals across the genome, but this avenue has not been explored yet. We combined phylogenomic and geographic cline analyses in a Pogoniulus tinkerbird clade to determine whether contemporary introgression through hybrid zones contributes to gene-tree heterogeneity across the species ranges. We found diverse phylogenetic signals across the genome with the most common topologies supporting monophyly among taxa connected by secondary contact zones. Remarkably, these systematic conflicts were also recovered when selecting only individuals from each taxon's core range. Using analyses of derived allele sharing and ""recombination aware"" phylogenomics, we found that introgression shapes gene-tree heterogeneity, and the species tree most likely supports monophyletic red-fronted tinkerbirds, as recovered in previous reconstructions based on mitochondrial DNA. Furthermore, by fitting geographic clines across two secondary contact zones, we found that introgression rates were lower in genomic regions supporting the putative species tree compared to those supporting the two taxa in contact as monophyletic. This demonstrates that introgression through narrow contact zones shapes gene-tree heterogeneity even in allopatric populations. Finally, we did not find evidence that mitochondria-interacting nuclear genes acted as barrier loci. Our results show that species can withstand important amounts of introgression while maintaining their phenotypic integrity and ecological separation, raising questions regarding the genomic architecture of adaptation and barriers to gene flow.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

Academic publishers are adapting to the transformative role of AI chatbots in producing or facilitating scientific research. This study aimed to examine the policies established by scientific, technical, and medical academic publishers for defining and regulating the responsible authors use of AI chatbots.

MethodsThis study performed a cross-sectional audit on the publicly available policies of 163 academic publishers, indexed as members of the International Association of the Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers (STM). Data extraction of publicly available policies on the webpages of all STM academic publishers was performed independently in duplicate with content analysis reviewed by a third contributor (September 2023 - December 2023). Data was categorized into policy elements, such as  proofreading and  image generation. Counts and percentages of  yes (i.e., permitted),  no, and  N/A were established for each policy element.

ResultsA total of 56/163 (34.4%) STM academic publishers had a publicly available policy guiding the authors use of AI chatbots. No policy allowed authorship accreditations for AI chatbots (or other generative technology). Most (49/56 or 87.5%) required specific disclosure of AI chatbot use. Four policies/publishers placed a complete ban on the use of AI tools by authors.

ConclusionsOnly a third of STM academic publishers had publicly available policies as of December 2023. A re-examination of all STM members in 12-18 months may uncover evolving approaches toward AI chatbot use with more academic publishers having a policy.","NA","medrxiv",1723759666401

Immunoglobulin and T cell receptor loci of most bat species have not been annotated, despite the recurrent role of bats as viral reservoirs and sources of zoonotic pathogens. We investigated the genetic structure and function of IgH loci across the largest bat family, Vespertilionidae, focusing on big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). We discovered that E. fuscus and ten other species within Vespertilionidae have two complete, functional, and distinct immunoglobulin heavy chain loci on separate chromosomes. This locus organization is previously unknown in mammals, but is reminiscent of more limited duplicated loci in teleost fish. Single cell transcriptomic data validate functional rearrangement and expression of immunoglobulin heavy chains of both loci in the expressed repertoire of Eptesicus fuscus, with maintenance of allelic exclusion, bias of usage toward the smaller and more compact IgH locus, and evidence of differential selection of antigen-experienced B cells and plasma cells varying by IgH locus use.

Establishing methods to induce membrane rupture of organelles of interest is essential to analyze the downstream effects of membrane rupture; however, the spatiotemporal induction of rupture of specific membranes remains challenging. Here, we develop a series of optogenetic tools to induce organelle membrane rupture by using engineered Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), whose primary function is to form membrane pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) during apoptosis. When BAX is forced to target mitochondria, lysosomes, or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by replacing its C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) with organelle-targeting sequences, the BAX mutants rupture their target membranes. To regulate the activity of organelle-targeted BAX, the photosensitive light-oxygen-voltage-sensing 2 (LOV2) domain is fused to the N-terminus of BAX. The resulting LOV2-BAX fusion protein exhibits blue light-dependent membrane-rupture activity on various organelles, including mitochondria, the ER, and lysosomes. Thus, LOV2-BAX enables spatiotemporal induction of membrane rupture across a broad range of organelles, expanding research opportunities on the consequences of organelle membrane disruption.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

Recent biogeographic work has provided global snapshots of NCLDV diversity and community composition across the world's oceans, yet little information exists about the guiding 'rules' underpinning their community dynamics over time. We leveraged a five-year monthly metagenomic time-series to quantify the community composition of NCLDVs off the coast of Southern California and characterize these populations' temporal dynamics. NCLDVs were dominated by Algavirales (Phycodnaviruses, 59%) and Imitervirales (Mimiviruses, 36%). We identified clusters of NCLDVs with distinct classes of seasonal and non-seasonal temporal dynamics. Overall, NCLDV population abundances were often highly dynamic with a strong seasonal signal. The Imitervirales group had highest relative abundance in the more oligotrophic late summer and fall, while Algavirales did so in winter. Generally, closely related strains had similar temporal dynamics, suggesting that evolutionary history is a key driver of the temporal niche of marine NCLDVs. However, a few closely-related strains had drastically different seasonal dynamics, suggesting that while phylogenetic proximity often indicates ecological similarity, occasionally phenology can shift rapidly, possibly due to host-switching. Finally, we identified distinct functional content and possible host interactions of two major NCLDV orders- including connections of Imitervirales with primary producers like the diatom Chaetoceros and widespread marine grazers like Paraphysomonas and Spirotrichea ciliates. Together, our results reveal key insights on season-specific effect of phylogenetically distinct giant virus communities on marine protist metabolism, biogeochemical fluxes and carbon cycling.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

AtSERKs act as co-receptors for many LRR-RLKs, including BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) and FLAGELLIN SENSITIVE 2 (FLS2). The conserved tyrosine (Y) residue in AtSERK3 is crucial for signaling specificity in differentiating BRI1- and FLS2-mediated pathways.5 BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (BAK1)-INTERACTING RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASES (BIRs) interact with SERKs under resting conditions, negatively regulating SERK-mediated pathways. SERK and BIR are highly conserved in land plants, whereas BRI1 and FLS2 homologs are absent or poorly conserved in bryophyte lineages. The biological functions of SERK homologs in non-flowering plants are largely unknown. The genome of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha encodes single homologs for SERK and BIR, namely MpSERK and MpBIR. We here show that Mpserk disruptants display growth and developmental defects with no observable sexual or vegetative reproduction. Complementation analysis revealed a contribution of the conserved Y residue of MpSERK to growth. Proximity labelling-based interactomics identified MpBIR as a MpSERK interactor. Mpbir disruptants displayed defects in reproductive organ development. Patterns of development- and immunity-related gene expression in Mpserk and Mpbir were antagonistic, suggesting that MpBIR functions as a MpSERK repressor. The pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 grew poorly on Mpbir, indicating a significant role of the MpSERK-MpBIR module in immunity. Taken together, we propose that the SERK-BIR functional module was already regulating both development and immunity in the last common ancestor of land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

The most predictive features were enriched in gene families related to cell wall organization and included two reductase gene families. We estimated the quantitative contributions of features to each species' classification to guide experimental validation and showed that overexpression of the old yellow enzyme (OYE) reductase increased ROS resistance in Kluyveromyces lactis, while Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants lacking multiple mannosyltransferase-encoding genes were hypersensitive to ROS.

Despite their tight companionship with humans, yeast species that are domesticated or pathogenic can also live on trees. Here we used over 300 genomes of S. cerevisiae from oaks and other trees to determine whether tree-associated populations are genetically distinct from domesticated lineages and estimate the timing of forest lineage divergence. We found populations on trees are highly structured within Europe, Japan, and North America. Approximate estimates of when forest lineages diverged out of Asia and into North America and Europe coincide with the end of the last ice age, the spread of agriculture, and the onset of fermentation by humans. It appears that migration from human-associated environments to trees is ongoing. Indeed, patterns of ancestry in the genomes of three recent migrants from the trees of North America to Europe could be explained by the human response to the Great French Wine Blight. Our results suggest that human-assisted migration affects forest populations, albeit rarely. Such migration events may even have shaped the global distribution of S. cerevisiae. Given the potential for lasting impacts due to yeast migration between human and natural environments, it seems important to understand the evolution of human commensals and pathogens in wild niches.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

Loss of CHD8 function is hypothesized to perturb gene regulatory networks in the developing brain, thereby contributing to ASD etiology. However, insight into the cell type-specific transcriptional effects of CHD8 loss of function remains limited. We used single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to globally profile gene expression and identify dysregulated genes in the embryonic and juvenile wild type and Chd8+/- mouse cortex, respectively. Chd8 and other ASD risk-associated genes showed a convergent expression trajectory that was largely conserved between the mouse and human developing cortex, increasing from the progenitor zones to the cortical plate. Genes associated with risk for neurodevelopmental disorders and genes involved in neuron projection development, chromatin remodeling, signaling, and migration were dysregulated in Chd8+/- embryonic day (E) 12.5 radial glia. Genes implicated in synaptic organization and activity were dysregulated in Chd8+/- postnatal day (P) 25 deep- and upper-layer excitatory cortical neurons, suggesting a delay in synaptic maturation or impaired synaptogenesis due to CHD8 loss of function.

This study leverages Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-based Protein Language Models (PLMs) to decode the complex grammar of proteins prone to liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). We trained three distinct GPT models on datasets comprising amino acid sequences with varying LLPS propensities: highly predisposed (LLPS+ GPT), moderate (LLPS-GPT), and resistant (PDB* GPT). As training progressed, the LLPS-prone model began to learn embeddings that were distinct from those in LLPS-resistant sequences. These models generated 18,000 protein sequences ranging from 20 to 200 amino acids, which exhibited low similarity to known sequences in the SwissProt database. Statistical analysis revealed subtle but significant differences in amino acid occurrence probabilities between sequences from LLPS-prone and LLPS-resistant models, suggesting distinct molecular grammar underlying their phase separation abilities. Notably, sequences from LLPS+ GPT showed fewer aromatic residues and a higher fraction of charge decoration. Short peptides (20-25 amino acids) generated from LLPS+ GPT underwent computational and wet-lab validation, demonstrating their ability to form phase-separated states in vitro. The generated sequences enriched the existing database and enabled the development of a robust classifier that accurately distinguishes LLPS-prone from non-LLPS sequences. This research marks a significant advancement in using computational models to explore and engineer the vast protein sequence space associated with LLPS-prone proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

Some of the genomes detected exhibited regions rich in BrdU that were predicted to represent prophages in their lytic cycle. Ultimately, this novel means of monitoring the replication responses of microbes, and deciphering their genomes and active mobile genetic elements will advance and empower strategies aimed at isolating previously uncultivated microbes in pure culture.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

However, the visualisation of lymphatic vessels deep within an intact organ remains a challenge. We hypothesised that nanobodies, single-domain antibodies raised in camelid species, would result in improved labelling of lymphatics in intact mouse organs, without loss of information due to organ sectioning or inadequate penetration. We generated and characterised nanobody clones targeting lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE1), a marker of lymphatic capillaries. Nanobodies were superior at penetrating whole mouse organs and enhanced labelling of lymphatics compared with a conventional anti-LYVE1 polyclonal antibody. Utilising this new tool, we found that kidney lymphatics; an organ in which labelling of lymphatics is challenging, have spatially restricted LYVE1 expression compared with lymphatics of skin, heart, and lung. The timing of this LYVE1 spatial restriction coincides with the early postnatal period in mice.

One protein implicated in a major growth-defense trade-off in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana is ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 6 (ACD6), an ion channel that modulates salicylic acid (SA) synthesis to potentiate a wide range of defenses. Wild plant populations maintain significant functional variation in the ACD6 gene, with some alleles making the protein hyperactive. In the greenhouse, plants with hyperactive ACD6 alleles are resistant to diverse pathogens, yet are of smaller stature, their leaves senesce earlier, and they set fewer seeds. We hypothesized that such hyperactive alleles would not only affect the growth of microbial pathogens, but also more generally leaf microbiome assembly in the wild. To test this, we grew plants with hyperactive, standard, and defective ACD6 alleles in the same field-collected soil, both in climate-controlled conditions and outdoors. We surveyed visual phenotypes, gene expression, hormone levels, seed production, and the microbiome in each environment. To our surprise, we discovered that mature field plants, in stark contrast to greenhouse plants, were unaffected by their ACD6 genotype, suggesting that additional abiotic and/or microbial signals present outdoors -- but not in the greenhouse -- greatly modulate ACD6 activity.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

Here, we provide evidence that mitochondrial activity is controlled in a tissue-specific manner through a non-canonical cytoplasmic function of the transcription factor FOXG1. Using zebrafish and human models of the neurodevelopmental disorder, FOXG1 Syndrome, we found that FOXG1 mutations inducing a premature stop codon unexpectedly lead to the production of a short C-terminal peptide. The expression of this truncated protein is responsible for an excess of excitatory neurons and a structural, functional, and translational mitochondrial phenotype in mutants. We demonstrate that this activity is a gain of function, normally carried out by a cleavage product in wildtype. Both peptides promote the translation of mitochondrially-encoded transcripts, are preferentially transported to the mitochondria, and interact with mito-ribosomal proteins. These findings unveil a mechanism that integrates cell fate decisions with metabolic output. Adjusting the dosage of the mutant peptide rescues aspects of FOXG1 Syndrome, offering a new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of disorders involving mitochondrial dysfunctions.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

We previously demonstrated that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can enhance or suppress entrainment to rhythmic auditory stimuli, depending on the timing between the electrical and auditory signals, although tACS effects are primarily modulatory. This study further investigated entrainment to tACS and auditory rhythms when the electrical and auditory signals were presented together (Experiment 1, N = 34) or independently (Experiment 2, N = 24; Experiment 3, N = 12). We hypothesized that tACS effects would be more pronounced when the auditory rhythm was made less perceptually salient to reduce the competition with the electrical rhythm. Participants detected silent gaps in modulated or unmodulated noise stimuli. In Experiment 1, auditory stimuli predominated in entraining behavior. While behavioral entrainment to sound rhythms was affected by the modulation depth of the auditory stimulus, entrainment to tACS was not. In Experiment 2, with no rhythmic information from the sound, 16 of 24 participants showed significant behavioral entrainment to tACS, although the most effective tACS frequency varied across participants. An oscillator model with a free parameter for the individual resonance frequency produced profiles similar to those we observed behaviorally. In Experiment 3, both neural and behavioral entrainment to rhythmic sounds were affected by the auditory stimulus frequency, but again the most effective entraining frequency varied across participants. Our findings suggest that tACS effects depend on the individuals preferred frequency when there is no competition with sensory stimuli, emphasizing the importance of targeting individual frequencies in tACS experiments. When both sensory and electrical stimuli are rhythmic and compete, sensory stimuli prevail, indicating the superiority of sensory stimulation in modulating behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

SummaryAmong 47561 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine was 23% effective against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1723759666401

T cells fine-tune their sensitivity to and consumption of IL2 by regulating surface expression and composition of the IL2 receptor. Following antigen recognition, IL2 receptor signalling is shared through polarized interactions in T cell aggregates. However, how IL2 function is integrated during earlier antigen-dependent T cell synapses is unknown. Here, we demonstrate a synergistic effect between the T cell receptor (TCR) and IL2 receptor signalling at the immunological synapse of CD8+ T cells with supported lipid bilayers. TCR and IL2 signalling overlapped in space and time, potentiating each other when simultaneously triggered. Immuno-STATs, a safe and effective new class of immunotherapeutics, which fuse IL2 and peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) in a single molecule to expand antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, enhanced both TCR and IL2 signalling and promoted antigen specific T-T immunological synapses.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

In aged mice, partial reprogramming, characterized by pulsed expression of reprogramming factors, has shown promise in improving function in various tissues, but its impact on the aging brain remains poorly understood.

Using two different approaches - a neuron-specific transgenic reprogrammable mouse model and neuron-specific targeted lentiviral delivery of OSKM reprogramming factors - we demonstrated that in vivo partial reprogramming of mature neurons in the dentate gyrus, a neurogenic niche in the adult mouse brain, can influence animal behavior, and ameliorate age-related decline in memory and learning.

Accurate simulation of nanopore sequencing signals from nucleotide sequences is crucial for method development and for complementing experimental data. Most existing approaches rely on predefined statistical models, which may not adequately capture the properties of experimental signal data. Furthermore, these simulators were developed for earlier versions of nanopore chemistry, which limits their applicability and adaptability to the latest flow cell data. Results To enhance the quality of artificial signals, we introduce seq2squiggle, a novel transformer-based, non-autoregressive model designed to generate nanopore sequencing signals from nucleotide sequences. Unlike existing simulators that rely on static k-mer models, our approach learns sequential contextual information from the signal data. We benchmark seq2squiggle against state-of-the-art simulators on real experimental R10.4.1 data, evaluating signal similarity, basecalling accuracy, and variant detection rates. Seq2squiggle consistently outperforms existing tools across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior similarity to real data and offering a robust solution for simulating nanopore sequencing signals with the latest flow cell generation.

Hence, technologies for producing authentically glycosylated IgGs are in high demand. While attempts to engineer Escherichia coli for this purpose have been described, they have met limited success due in part to the lack of available oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) enzymes that can install N-linked glycans within the QYNST sequon of the IgG CH2 domain. Here, we identified a previously uncharacterized single-subunit OST (ssOST) from the bacterium Desulfovibrio marinus that exhibited greatly relaxed substrate specificity and, as a result, was able to catalyze glycosylation of native CH2 domains in the context of both a hinge-Fc fragment and a full-length IgG. Although the attached glycans were bacterial in origin, conversion to a homogeneous, asialo complex-type G2 N-glycan at the QYNST sequon of the E. coli-derived hinge-Fc was achieved via chemoenzymatic glycan remodeling. Importantly, the resulting G2-hinge-Fc exhibited strong binding to human Fc{gamma}RIIIa (CD16a), one of the most potent receptors for eliciting antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Taken together, the discovery of DmPglB provides previously unavailable biocatalytic capabilities to the bacterial glycoprotein engineering toolbox and opens the door to using E. coli for the production and glycoengineering of human IgGs and fragments derived thereof.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

Striatal dopamine and acetylcholine are powerful modulators of goal-directed behavior, but it is unclear whether and how neuromodulator dynamics at landmarks incorporate relative motion for effective behavioral guidance. Using optical measurements in mice, we demonstrate that cue-evoked striatal dopamine release encodes bi-directional 'trajectory errors' reflecting relationships between ongoing speed and direction of locomotion and visual flow relative to optimal goal trajectories. Striatum-wide micro-fiber array recordings resolved an anatomical gradient of trajectory error signaling across the anterior-posterior axis, distinct from trajectory error independent cue signals. Dynamic regression modeling revealed that positive and negative trajectory error encoding emerges early and late respectively during learning and over different time courses in the medial and lateral striatum, enabling region specific contributions to learning. Striatal acetylcholine release also encodes trajectory errors, but encoding is more spatially restricted, opposite polarity, and delayed relative to dopamine, supporting distinct roles in modulating striatal output and behavior. Dopamine trajectory error signaling and task performance were reproduced in a reinforcement learning model incorporating a conjunctive state space representation, suggesting a potential neural substrate for trajectory error generation. Our results establish region specific neuromodulator signals positioned to guide the speed and direction of locomotion to reach goals based on environmental landmarks during navigation.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

While work- and collision-based models do a reasonable job of relating mechanical work to metabolic cost at a system level, these models may not map to the underlying force and work demands of muscle, which directly affects energy expenditure. We collected motion capture, force, electromyography and ultrasound data from the main power producing muscles during uphill and downhill walking between +/- 15% grade. These data were used to evaluate a musculoskeletal modelling approach to simulate muscle force- and work-related costs that could be compared to metabolic power that we measured using indirect calorimetry. Muscle force-related costs (activation heat rate + maintenance heat rate) increased at steeper up- and down-hill grades and were moderately correlated with mean joint moments. Muscle work-related costs (mechanical work rate + shortening / lengthening heat rate) increased as grade became more positive and were strongly correlated with net joint work. Compared to traditional models, the inclusion of a term to account for muscle force-related costs should lead to a more explanatory cost model that maps directly to the mechanical demands of muscle.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

We found that T cells in most sites migrated with f-actin-rich leading-edge pseudopods, matching how they migrate in vitro. T cells notably deviated from this strategy in the epidermis, where they instead migrated using a rearward concentration of f-actin and stable leading-edge blebs. This mode of migration occurs under planar confinement in vitro, and we correspondingly found the stratified keratinocyte layers of the epidermis impose planar-like confinement on leukocytes in vivo. By imaging the same cell type across the body, our data collectively indicates that cells adapt their migration strategy to navigate different tissue geometries in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666401

The mechanisms of lineage restriction remain enigmatic. We previously defined occlusion as a mode of gene silencing wherein affected genes lack the transcriptional potency to be activated by their cognate transcription factors (TFs). Here, we present a comprehensive mechanistic basis of lineage restriction as driven by gene occlusion. Specifically, we show that genes can become occluded simply by the default action of chromatinization in the absence of TF binding, that naive pluripotent stem cells establish full developmental potency via their capacity to erase occlusion, that primed pluripotent cells shut down this deocclusion ability in preparation for differentiation, that differentiating cells become increasingly restricted in their fate potency by the irreversible occlusion of lineage-inappropriate genes, and that stem cells employ placeholder factors (PFs) to protect silent genes needed for later activation from premature occlusion. Collectively, these mechanisms drive lineage restriction whereby the transcriptionally potent portion of the genome shrinks progressively during differentiation, rendering the fate potency of developing cells to also dwindle progressively.

We additionally re-examine the spatial positioning of skeletal material and associated sediments within the Puzzle Box area, from which abundant H. naledi remains representing a minimum of six individuals were recovered in 2013 and 2014. Multiple lines of evidence exclude the hypothesis that skeletal remains from these three areas come from bodies that decomposed on the floor of the chamber or within a shallow depression prior to burial by sediments. The spatial positioning of skeletal material, the topography of the subsystem, and observations on sediments within and surrounding features exclude the hypothesis that rapid burial by sediment was a result of gravity-driven slumping or spontaneous movement of sediments. We present a minimal hypothesis of hominin cultural burial and test the evidence from all three areas, finding that this hypothesis is most compatible with the pattern of evidence. These results suggest that mortuary behavior including cultural burial was part of the repertoire of Homo naledi.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666402

Using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behaviour (COM-B) model for behaviour change, the aim of this research was to explore the barriers and facilitators of community pharmacy PrEP delivery, for pharmacists and community members.

MethodsCommunity members at elevated risk of acquiring HIV and community pharmacists were recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analysed within the framework of the COM-B model.

Results17 interviews with pharmacists (pharmacy owners n=7; employed pharmacists n=6; locums n=4) and 24 with community members (Black African women n=6; other women n=2; young adults aged 18-25 years n=6; transgender people n=6; female sex workers n=4) were carried out. Capability barriers included sub-optimal awareness and knowledge of PrEP, pharmacy facilities, and pharmacist roles in delivering public health services. Opportunity barriers included lack of staff capacity, privacy and pharmacy screening and monitoring facilities. Motivational barriers included a concern that increased access could increase sexually transmitted infections and involve a financial cost. Capability facilitators included awareness raising, HIV and PrEP training and education. Opportunity facilitators included PrEP appointments and the accessibility of pharmacies. Motivational facilitators included a preference for pharmacy delivery over other models (e.g., sexual health, GP), and a belief that it would be discrete and less stigmatising.

ConclusionPharmacy PrEP delivery is acceptable but for it to be feasible, results point to the need for the development of a behaviour change intervention focusing on education, training and awareness raising, targeting pharmacists and community members to stimulate patient activation and de-stigmatise HIV. This intervention would need to be facilitated by system and environmental changes (e.g., commissioning service).

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSLocation, sigma of sexual health clinics and lack of PrEP awareness limits PrEP access for key groups among whom new HIV acquisitions remain high. Previous research and the UK government suggests PrEP provision via community pharmacies as a potential way of improving PrEP access and health equity.

What this study addsThis is the first research study to explore the barriers to and facilitators of pharmacy PrEP delivery for pharmacists and community members in the UK. To increase capabilities and motivation, training and awareness raising is needed. To increase opportunities and motivation, environmental and system level changes are needed.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyResults point to the acceptability of pharmacy PrEP delivery, but for it to be feasible behaviour change interventions supported by system and environmental changes are needed.","NA","medrxiv",1723759666402

GroEL also binds translating ribosomes in vivo, suggesting an additional role in cotranslational folding. Here, we used biochemical reconstitution, structural proteomics and electron microscopy to study the mechanism by which GroEL/ES engages nascent polypeptides. We show that GroEL binds nascent chains on the inside of its cavity via the apical domains and disordered C-terminal tails, resulting in local structural destabilization of the substrate. Ribosome-tethered nascent proteins are partially encapsulated upon GroES binding to GroEL, and refold in the chaperonin cavity. Reconstitution of chaperone competition at the ribosome shows that both Trigger factor and GroEL can be accommodated on long nascent chains, but GroEL and DnaK are mutually antagonistic. Our findings extend the role of GroEL/ES in de novo protein folding, and reveal an unexpected plasticity of the chaperonin mechanism that allows cotranslational substrate encapsulation.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666402

Ten extant subfamilies are currently described and Macropathinae, which comprises the entirety of the fauna in South America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, is thought to be the most ancient of these. The New Zealand rhaphidophorid fauna supports high phylogenetic diversity throughout its mesic zone, with most species occurring above-ground. In contrast, the Australian fauna is poorly known, with an apparently greater relative proportion of species utilising caves as refugia. A robust phylogenetic framework is needed to underpin future taxonomic work on the group and potentially contrasting patterns of taxonomic diversity within Macropathinae. Here, we performed fossil-calibrated phylogenetic analysis using whole mitochondrial genomes and nuclear markers to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Macropathinae, with a focus on the Australian fauna. By dramatically increasing taxon sampling relative to past studies, we recover the Australian fauna as rampantly polyphyletic, with the remaining Macropathinae nested amongst six distinct Australian lineages. Deep divergences between major clades imply additional Australian lineages remain undetected, either due to extinction or sampling bias, and have likely confounded past biogeographic signal. We infer the radiation of Macropathinae began during the Lower Jurassic prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana with a potential Pangaean origin for Rhaphidophoridae. Finally, we find evidence for several undescribed taxa of Australian Rhaphidophoridae, all of which qualify as short-range endemics, and discuss the conservation implications of these restricted distributions.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666402

We investigated the intricate relationship between modification status and the decoding activity of the ribosome. We found that the level of 2-O-methylation at specific nucleotides in the rRNA affects the properties of the ribosome, with consequences for both Saccharomyces. cerevisiae cell growth and antibiotic sensitivity. More precisely, we demonstrate that methylations within the peptide exit tunnel play an important role in nascent peptide folding. We also demonstrate the modulation of IRES-driven translation by variable methylation at the intersubunit surface of the 60S ribosomal subunit.

Using a chemical-genetic approach, we identified genes in Escherichia coli that are important for growth in G4-stabilizing conditions. Reducing levels of elongation factor Tu or slowing translation elongation with chloramphenicol suppress the effects of G4 stabilization. In contrast, reducing expression of certain translation termination or ribosome recycling proteins is detrimental to growth in G4-stabilizing conditions. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses demonstrate that ribosome assembly factors and other proteins involved in translation are less abundant in G4-stabilizing conditions. Our integrated systems approach allowed us to propose a model for how RNA G4s can present barriers to E. coli growth and that reducing the rate of translation can compensate for G4-related stress.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666402

There is evidence that distinct movements can be generated by changes in activity dynamics within a common pool of motoneurons, or by selectively engaging specific subsets of motoneurons in a task-dependent manner. However, in most cases we have an incomplete understanding of the patterns of motoneuron activity that generate distinct actions and how upstream premotor circuits select and assemble such motor programmes. In this study, we used two closely related but kinematically distinct types of saccadic eye movement in larval zebrafish as a model to examine circuit control of movement diversity. In contrast to the prevailing view of a final common pathway, we found that in oculomotor nucleus, distinct subsets of motoneurons were engaged for each saccade type. This type-specific recruitment was topographically organised and aligned with ultrastructural differ-ences in motoneuron morphology and afferent synaptic innervation. Medially located motoneu-rons were active for both saccade types and circuit tracing revealed a type-agnostic premotor pathway that appears to control their recruitment. By contrast, a laterally located subset of motoneurons was specifically active for hunting-associated saccades and received premotor in-put from pretectal hunting command neurons. Our data support a model in which generalist and action-specific premotor pathways engage distinct subsets of motoneurons to elicit varied movements of the same body part that subserve distinct behavioural functions.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666402

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1723759666402

MethodsData from 4,825 users of sleep and nutrition apps for at least 7 days were analyzed. Multivariable regression analysis investigated associations between quartiles of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate, and total fat, including saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats), dietary components (sodium, potassium, dietary fiber, and sodium-to-potassium ratio), and sleep variables (total sleep time [TST], sleep latency [SL], and % wakefulness after sleep onset [%WASO]). Nutrients were divided into quartiles, with the lowest intake group as the reference. Compositional data analysis accounted for interdependencies among macronutrients. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI).

ResultsHigher protein intake was associated with longer TST in the 3rd (B = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.26) and 4th quartiles (B = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.27).

This bias can be mitigated by aligning to pangenome graphs to incorporate documented organismic variation, but this approach still suffers from substitution patterns due to chemical damage. We introduce a novel methodology introducing the RYmer index, a variant of the commonly-used minimizer index which represents purines (A,G) and pyrimidines (C,T) as R and Y respectively. This creates an indexing scheme robust to the aforementioned chemical damage. We implemented SAFARI, an ancient DNA damage-aware version of the pangenome aligner vg giraffe which uses RYmers to rescue alignments containing deaminated seeds. We show that our approach produces more correct alignments from ancient DNA sequences than current approaches while maintaining a tolerable rate of spurious alignments. In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithm improves the estimate of the rate of ancient DNA damage, especially for highly damaged samples. Crucially, we show that this improved alignment can directly translate into better insights gained from the data by showcasing its integration with a number of extant pangenome tools.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666402

Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1723759666402

To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Warm White Light-Emitting Diode (LED), Cool White LED, Blue LED, and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic Puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation, and husbandry programs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic Puffin strandings remains to be the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine if aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666402

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1723759666402

Specifically, we enter n variations of k pattern classes (n*k patterns) onto a cortex-like balanced inhibitory-excitatory network with heterogeneous neurons, and let the pattern spread within the recurrent network. We show that we can identify high mutual-information (MI) neurons as major information-bearing elements within each pattern representation. We employ a simple one-shot adaptive (learning) process focusing on high MI neurons and inhibition. Such  localist plasticity has high efficiency, because it requires only few adaptations for each pattern. Specifically, we store k=10 patterns of size s=400 in a 1000/1200 neuron network. We stimulate high MI neurons and in this way recall patterns, such that the whole network represents this pattern. We assess the quality of the representation (a) before learning, when entering the pattern into a naive network and (b) after learning, on the adapted network, during recall. The recalled patterns could be easily recognized by a trained classifier. The pattern  unfolds over the recurrent network with high similarity, albeit compressed, with respect to the original input pattern. We discuss the distribution of neuron properties in the network, and find that an initial Gaussian or uniform distribution changes into a more heavy-tailed, lognormal distribution during the adaptation process. The remarkable result is that we are able to achieve reliable pattern recall by stimulating only high information neurons. This work has interesting technical applications, and provides a biologically-inspired model of cortical memory.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666402

MethodsThis study uses the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to investigate the potential relationship between vaccinations and the incidence of NMOSD, AE, and MOGAD. Potential risk factors, such as age, sex, type of vaccine, and previous history of autoimmune diseases, were examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

ResultsOur analysis included 161 cases: 72 NMOSD, 82 AE, and 7 MOGAD. The COVID-19 vaccine was implicated in 19/72 (26.3%) NMOSD, 43/82 (52.4%) of AE and 6/7 (85.7%) of MOGAD. The subacute temporal profile (OR 24.4, p = 0.004) and the presence of any comorbidity (OR 12.49, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with hospitalization for those with NMOSD. The subacute onset of symptoms and encephalopathy was statistically significant for hospitalization (OR 6.15, p = 0.048) and (OR 10.3, p = 0.005) respectively for patients with AE. Anti-NMDAR (N-methyl D-aspartate) antibodies were observed in 16/24 (66.7%) of AE. Treatment often involved high-dose corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

ConclusionsMost cases of vaccine induced NMOSD, AE, and MOGAD occurred secondary to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The subacute onset of symptoms and the presence of encephalopathy was most associated with hospitalization.","NA","medrxiv",1723759666402

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666402

The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g. upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% and 14% of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56.

Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666402

Identifying and controlling dose-dependent transgenes require tools for precisely titrating expression. To this end, we developed a highly modular, extensible framework called DIAL for building editable promoters that allow for fine-scale, heritable changes in transgene expression. Using DIAL, we increase expression by recombinase-mediated excision of spacers between the binding sites of a synthetic zinc finger transcription factor and the core promoter. By nesting varying numbers and lengths of spacers, DIAL generates a tunable range of unimodal setpoints from a single promoter. Through small-molecule control of transcription factors and recombinases, DIAL supports temporally defined, user-guided control of transgene expression that is extensible to additional transcription factors. Lentiviral delivery of DIAL generates multiple setpoints in primary cells and iPSCs. As promoter editing generates stable states, DIAL setpoints are heritable, facilitating mapping of transgene levels to phenotypes. The DIAL framework opens new opportunities for tailoring transgene expression and improving the predictability and performance of gene circuits across diverse applications.

HighlightsPromoter editing generates unimodal setpoints from a single synthetic promoter

DIAL setpoints are tuned by the length of an excisable spacer within the promoter

DIAL setpoints are uniform and robust to varying levels of the transcription factor

However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role. Our data show that the clonal dynamics of blood are consistent with a set of remarkably simple evolutionary rules which strike a balance between chance and determinism.","NA","biorxiv",1723759666402
