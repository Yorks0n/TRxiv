In North America, infections in novel avian and mammalian species suggest the potential for changing ecology and establishment of new animal reservoirs. Outbreaks among domestic birds have persisted despite aggressive culling, necessitating a re-examination of how these outbreaks were sparked and maintained. To recover how these viruses were introduced and disseminated in North America, we analyzed 1,818 Hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences sampled from North American wild birds, domestic birds and mammals from November 2021-September 2023 using Bayesian phylodynamic approaches. Using HA, we infer that the North American panzootic was driven by [~]8 independent introductions into North America via the Atlantic and Pacific Flyways, followed by rapid dissemination westward via wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, shorebirds, and Galliformes, while species such as songbirds, raptors, and owls mostly acted as dead-end hosts. Unlike the epizootic of 2015, outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by [~]46-113 independent introductions from wild birds, with some onward transmission. Backyard birds were infected [~]10 days earlier on average than birds in commercial poultry production settings, suggesting that they could act as ""early warning signals"" for transmission upticks in a given area. Our findings support wild birds as an emerging reservoir for HPAI transmission in North America and suggest continuous surveillance of wild Anseriformes and shorebirds as crucial for outbreak inference. Future prevention of agricultural outbreaks may require investment in strategies that reduce transmission at the wild bird/agriculture interface, and investigation of backyard birds as putative early warning signs.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of AIV infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We identified 607 AIV infections in felines, including 302 associated deaths, comprising 18 countries and 12 felid species. We observed a drastic flux in the number of AIV infections among domestic cats in 2023 and 2024, commensurate with the emergence of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b.

Although the behavioral manifestations of sequence learning are clear, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Motor sequence learning may arise from three distinct processes: (1) improved execution of individual movements independent of their sequential context; (2) enhanced anticipation of ""what"" movement should be executed next, enabling faster initiation; and (3) the development of motoric sequence-specific representations that encode ""how"" movements should be optimally performed within a sequence. However, many existing paradigms conflate the ""what"" and ""how"" components of learning, as participants often acquire both the sequence content (what to do) and its execution (how to do it). This overlap obscures the distinct contributions of each mechanism to motor sequence learning. In this study, we disentangled these mechanisms using a continuous reaching task. Performance in trained sequences was compared to random sequences to rule out improvements attributable solely to isolated movement execution. By also varying how many upcoming targets were visible we assessed the role of anticipation in learning. When participants could only see one future target, improvements were mostly due to them learning which target would come next. When they could see four future targets, participants immediately demonstrated fast movement times and increased movement smoothness, surpassing late-stage performance in the one target condition. Crucially, even with full visibility of future targets, participants showed further sequence-specific learning caused by a continuous optimization of movement trajectories. Follow-up experiments revealed that the learned sequence representations were effector-specific and encoded contextual information of four movements or longer. Our paradigm enables a clear dissociation between the ""what"" and ""how"" components of motor sequence learning and provides compelling evidence for the development of effector-specific sequence representations that guide optimal movement execution.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

First we validate the approach with acute mouse brain slices to demonstrate that axons parallel to the electrical field can be stimulated to produce calcium signaling. Next we show that ultrafast endocytosis is induced and can be captured in both mouse and human brain slices.

Classification of the heterogeneous population of tetramers into different subsets reveals opening-closing motions and sorting of individual subunits resolves the occupancy of the cofactor and substrate binding pockets. Maps show that ligand binding to the glutamate binding pocket is accompanied by structural changes in a distant region that mediates a novel interaction between the catalytic domains of neighboring subunits in closed tetrameric states.

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1735337356181

Human cortical neurons differ from those of other species, such as rodents, in both their morphological and physiological characteristics. Could the distinct properties of human cortical neurons help explain the superior cognitive capabilities of humans? Understanding this relationship requires a metric to quantify how neuronal properties contribute to the functional complexity of single neurons, yet no such standardized measure currently exists. Here, we propose the Functional Complexity Index (FCI), a generalized, deep learning-based framework to assess the input-output complexity of neurons. By comparing the FCI of cortical pyramidal neurons from different layers in rats and humans, we identified key morpho-electrical factors that underlie functional complexity. Human cortical pyramidal neurons were found to be significantly more functionally complex than their rat counterparts, primarily due to differences in dendritic membrane area and branching pattern, as well as density and nonlinearity of NMDA-mediated synaptic receptors. These findings reveal the structural-biophysical basis for the enhanced functional properties of human neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Methodology/Principal findings 288 adult female patients were recruited from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Sri Lanka. All clinical features and laboratory investigations were recorded throughout the duration of hospital admission along with treatment received. 28/288 (9.72%) reported PV bleeding, with 12/28 (42.85%) developing dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) compared to 65/260 (25%) of those who did not have bleeding.

However, the mechanisms that separate TADs remain incompletely understood. Most boundaries between TADs contain CTCF binding sites (CBSs), which individually contribute to the blocking of Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. Using genome-wide classification, we show here that TAD boundary width forms a continuum from narrow to highly extended and correlates with CBS distribution, chromatin features, and gene regulatory elements. To investigate how these boundary widths emerge, we modified the Random Cross-Linker (RCL) polymer model to incorporate specific boundary configurations, enabling us to evaluate the differential impact of boundary composition on TAD insulation. Our analysis identifies three generic boundary categories, each influencing TAD insulation differently, with varying local and distal effects on neighboring domains. Notably, we find that increasing boundary width reduces long-range inter-TAD contacts, as confirmed by Hi-C data. While blocking loop extrusion at boundaries indirectly promotes spurious intermingling of neighboring TADs, extended boundaries counteract this effect, emphasizing their role in maintaining genome structure. In conclusion, TAD boundary width not only enhances the efficiency of loop extrusion blocking but may also modulate enhancer-promoter contacts over long distances across TADs boundaries, providing a mechanism for transcriptional regulation.

Significance statementTopologically Associating Domains (TADs) compartmentalize vertebrate genomes to limit cross-domain enhancer-promoter loops. Our study reveals that boundaries between TADs are diverse genomic entities that range from narrow to highly extended. Using an interdisciplinary approach that combines genome-wide data analysis with biophysical polymer modeling, we find that wider TAD boundaries reduce spurious long-range interactions between neighboring domains. Moreover, we reveal how different boundary components can create this difference in insulating capacity. Our identification and characterization of TAD boundary width and composition suggests they have the potential to regulate the formation of enhancer-promoter loops across TAD boundaries at close and long distance.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Recently, a proxy for DNA mechanics, cyclizability, was measured by loop-seq and enabled genome-scale investigation of DNA mechanics. Here, we use this dataset to build a computational model predicting bias-corrected intrinsic cyclizability, with near-perfect accuracy, solely based on DNA sequence. Further, the model predicts intrinsic bending direction in 3D space. Using this tool, we aimed to probe mechanical selection - that is, the evolutionary selection of DNA sequence based on its mechanical properties - in diverse circumstances. First, we found that the intrinsic bend direction of DNA sequences correlated with the observed bending in known protein-DNA complex structures, suggesting that many proteins co-evolved with their DNA partners to capture DNA in its intrinsically preferred bent conformation. We then applied our model to large-scale yeast population genetics data and showed that centromere DNA element II, whose consensus sequence is unknown, leaving its sequence-specific role unclear, is under mechanical selection to increase the stability of inner-kinetochore structure and to facilitate centromeric histone recruitment. Finally, in silico evolution under strong mechanical selection discovered hallucinated sequences with cyclizability values so extreme that they required experimental validation, yet, found in nature in the densely packed mitochondrial(mt) DNA of Namystynia karyoxenos, an ocean-dwelling protist with extreme mitochondrial gene fragmentation. The need to transmit an extraordinarily large amount of mtDNA, estimated to be > 600 Mb, in combination with the absence of mtDNA compaction proteins may have pushed mechanical selection to the extreme. Similarly extreme DNA mechanics are observed in bird microchromosomes, although the functional consequence is not yet clear. The discovery of eccentric DNA mechanics in unrelated unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes suggests that we can predict extreme natural biology which can arise through strong selection. Our methods offer a way to study the biological functions of DNA mechanics in any genome and to engineer DNA sequences with desired mechanical properties.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Nineteen mosquito-borne pathogens were identified, including three arboviruses: dengue, West Nile and MPoko viruses, 13 putative plasmodia species including Plasmodium matutinum and P. relictum, three filariids, including Pelecitus spp., 27 insect-specific viruses and 5 non-mosquito-borne pathogens (e.g., Trypanosoma theileri). Confirmed head-thorax (disseminated) infections of multiple pathogens in multiple mosquito species, eg., Culex perexiguus, Coquilletidia metallica, Mansonia uniformis, and Anopheles squamosus provides evidence that pathogens carried by high-altitude windborne mosquitoes are infectious and likely capable of infecting naive hosts far from their starting location. This traffic of sylvatic pathogens may be key to their maintenance among foci as well as initiating outbreaks away from them.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

However, no current computational model explains V4 responses under natural conditions. To address this, we developed a new hierarchical convolutional energy (HCE) model reflecting computations thought to occur in areas V1, V2, and V4, but which consists entirely of simple- and complex-like units like those found in V1. In contrast to prior models, the HCE model is trained end-to-end on neurophysiology data, without relying on pre-trained network features. We recorded 313 V4 neurons during full-color nature video stimulation and fit the HCE model to each neuron. The model's predicted optimal patterns (POPs) revealed complex spatiotemporal pattern selectivity in V4, supporting its role in representing space, time, and color. These findings indicate that area V4 is crucial for image segmentation and grouping operations that are essential for complex vision. Thus, responses of V4 neurons under naturalistic conditions can be explained by a hierarchical three-stage model where each stage consists entirely of units like those found in area V1.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Core genes are traditionally identified by the analysis of amino acid similarities among proteomes, but can also be defined using structures, which bear potential in deep clades beyond the twilight zone of amino acids. Despite breakthroughs in accurate AI-driven protein structure prediction, obtaining full 3D structural models on a proteomic scale is still prohibitively slow. Here, we present Unicore, a novel method for identifying structural core genes at a scale suitable for downstream phylogenetic analysis. By applying the ProstT5 protein language model to the input proteomes to obtain their 3Di structural strings, Unicore saves over three orders of magnitude in runtime compared to a full 3D prediction. Using Foldseek clustering, Unicore identifies single-copy structures universally present in the species and aligns them using Foldmason. These structural core gene alignments are projected back to amino acid information for downstream phylogenetic analysis. We demonstrate that this approach defines core genes with linear run-time scaling over the number of species, up to 56 times faster than OrthoFinder, while reconstructing phylogenetic relationships congruent with conventional approaches. Unicore is universally applicable to any given set of taxa, even spanning superkingdoms and overcoming limitations of previous methods requiring orthologs of fixed taxonomic scope, and is available as a free and open source software at https://github.com/steineggerlab/unicore.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Traditionally we assess fusion and fission by snapshots of protein markers at distinct time points or in vitro models to infer outcomes in vivo. Recent technological advancements enable visualization of mitochondrial dynamics in vivo using fluorescent microscopy. Our study modified this technique to evaluate mitochondrial dynamics in skeletal muscle, comparing young (6mo) and old (24mo) mice in vivo and contrasting this to ex vivo and in vitro models. We hypothesized that in vitro and ex vivo models would have higher rates of dynamics than in vivo models and that young animals would have higher rates than old animals. We electroporated mitochondrial matrix-targeted photo-activatable GFP into the tibialis anterior (TA) of young and old C57Bl6 mice and imaged using multiphoton microscopy. We also measured rates of mitochondrial dynamics using single fibers isolated from the TA of the electroporated mice, as well as C2C12 myotubes transfected with the same plasmids. We found that the rates of dynamic events in vivo are slower than previously indicated, with the C2C12 myoblasts having the fastest rates of dynamic events across all models. We also observed that dynamic rates are slower in old animals compared to young animals. Finally, we found that rates of dynamic events were higher in old animals after an acute bout of exercise. Our data demonstrate it is possible to directly measure rates of mitochondrial dynamics in vivo. This technique provides a powerful tool to answer experimental questions about mitochondrial dynamics of skeletal muscle.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

To demonstrate the platforms capabilities, we created and implemented pipelines to reanalyze two distinct biological datasets. First, we recreated a population genomics analysis of the socially flexible halictid bee, Lasioglossum albipes, using pipemake-generated workflows for de novo genome annotation, processing of variant data, dimensionality reduction, and a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We then used pipemake to analyze behavioral tracking data from the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. In both cases, pipemake workflows produced results consistent with published findings while substantially reducing hands-on analysis time. Overall, pipemakes modular design allows researchers to easily modify existing pipelines or develop new ones without software development expertise. Beyond streamlining workflow creation, pipemake leverages the full Snakemake ecosystem to enable parallel processing, automated error recovery, and comprehensive analysis documentation.

Many species are motile, despite having no appendages and a completely rigid cell body. Cells move to seek out nutrients, locate mating partners, and undergo vertical migration. To explore the natural diversity of diatom motility, we perform a comparative study across five common biofilm-forming species. Combining morphological measurements with high-resolution cell tracking, we establish how gliding movements relate to the morphology of the raphe - a specialised slit in the cell wall responsible for motility generation. Our detailed analyses reveal that cells exhibit a rich but species-dependent phenotype, switching stochastically between four stereotyped motility states. We model this behaviour and use stochastic simulations to predict how heterogeneity in microscale navigation patterns leads to differences in long-time diffusivity and dispersal. In a representative species, we extend these findings to quantify diatom gliding in complex, naturalistic 3D environments, suggesting that cells may exploit these distinct motility signatures to achieve niche segregation in nature.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

The network property is defined by the network density and the species of the actin-binding proteins. However, the relationship between the actin network density, the penetration ability of actin-binding proteins into the network, and resulting network dynamics remains elusive. Here, we report an in vitro optogenetic system, named OptoVCA, which induces Arp2/3-mediated actin network assembly on a lipid membrane. By changing the illumination power, duration, and pattern, the OptoVCA flexibly manipulates the density, thickness, and shape of the actin network. Taking these advantages, we examine the effects of the network density on the two representative actin-binding proteins, myosin and ADF/cofilin. We find that the penetration of myosin filaments into the network is strictly inhibited by only a several-fold increase in network density due to the steric hindrance. Furthermore, penetrated myosin filaments induce directional actin flow when the network has a density gradient. On the other hand, ADF/cofilin penetrates into the network regardless of network density, however, network disassembly is dramatically inhibited by only a several-fold increase in network density. Thus, the OptoVCA contributes to understanding cell mechanics through the examination of the network density-dependent effect on the actin-binding proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Here, using ex vivo tissues and different cell lines, we have discovered an unknown form of cell competition that is regulated by differences in force transmission capabilities, favoring cell types with stronger intercellular adhesion. Direct force measurements reveal increased mechanical activity at the interface of the two competing cell types in the form of large stress fluctuations which can lead to upward forces and cell elimination. We show how a winning cell type endowed with a stronger intercellular adhesion exhibits a higher resistance to elimination while benefiting from efficient force transmission to neighboring cells. This cell elimination mechanism could have broad implications of keeping strong force transmission ability for maintaining tissue boundaries and cell invasion pathology.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

CD4 T cell deficiency during persistent infection incurs a shift from a T-dependent (TD) to T-independent (TI) Ab response, resembling the pre-existing TI Ab response. CD4 T cell loss before infection or during persistent infection is conducive for emergence of Ab-escape variants. Cryo-EM reconstruction of complexes of MuPyV virions with polyclonal IgG directly from infected mice with pre-existing or acquired CD4 T cell deficiency enabled visualization of shortfalls in TI IgG binding.

In an OPM, the sample space is mapped to a distortion free image space via remote focusing, and the oblique light-sheet plane is mapped via a tilted tertiary imaging system onto a camera. As a result, the 3D point-spread function and optical transfer function are tilted to the optical axis of the tertiary imaging system. To satisfy Nyquist sampling, small scanning steps are required to encompass the tilted 3D OTF, slowing down acquisition and increasing sample exposure. Here we show that a judicious amount of under-sampling can lead to a form of aliasing in OPM that can be recovered without a loss of spatial resolution or introducing artifacts. The resulting speed gain depends on the optical parameters of the system and can reach 2-4-fold in our demonstrations.

The emergence of high-throughput, long-read DNA sequencing has enabled recovery of microbial genomes from environmental samples at scale. However, expanding the microbial genome catalogue of soils and sediments has been challenging due to the enormous complexity of these environments. Here, we performed deep, long-read Nanopore sequencing of 154 soil and sediment samples collected across Denmark and through an optimised bioinformatics pipeline, we recovered genomes of 15,314 novel microbial species, including 4,757 high-quality genomes. The recovered microbial genomes span 1,086 novel genera and provide the first high-quality reference genomes for 612 previously known genera, expanding the phylogenetic diversity of the prokaryotic tree of life by 8 %. The long-read assemblies also enabled the recovery of thousands of complete rRNA operons, biosynthetic gene clusters and CRISPR-Cas systems, all of which were underrepresented and highly fragmented in previous terrestrial genome catalogues. Furthermore, the incorporation of the recovered MAGs into public genome databases significantly improved species-level classification rates for soil and sediment metagenomic datasets, thereby enhancing terrestrial microbiome characterization. With this study, we demonstrate that long-read sequencing and optimised bioinformatics, allows cost-effective recovery of high-quality microbial genomes from highly complex ecosystems, which remain the largest untapped source of biodiversity for expanding genome databases and filling in the gaps of the tree of life.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

ATM leverages the superior quality and minimal distortion of anatomical MRI, learning from multi-subject datasets to deliver robust, subject-specific streamline bundles while accurately preserving structural connectivity. This paradigm-shifting approach overcomes challenges associated with complex configurations, such as crossing, kissing, bending, and bottlenecks, providing anatomically precise reconstructions. Beyond individual-level mapping, ATM facilitates the creation of population-level streamline bundles aligned to average anatomical templates derived from diverse datasets. By offering global connectivity insights less affected by local uncertainties, ATM complements diffusion tractography, advancing white matter pathway reconstruction with a more reliable, anatomy-driven perspective.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Across 75 individuals including 25 patients with cancer, we prepared conventional DBS, and plasma-separating DBS (psDBS) from whole blood samples, prior to plasma separation.

While case studies suggest that population history can also affect specific structures of languages, such as patterns in their sound systems and grammars, results are conflicting, and it remains unknown whether such effects hold globally. Here we show that, adjusting for geography, phylogeny, and environment, genetic diversity is inversely correlated with diversity in linguistic structures. Low genetic diversity (i.e. excess homozygosity) results from relative isolation, and this promotes diversification in language. High genetic diversity results from contact and migration, and this promotes homogenization in language. These effects are particularly pronounced in Asia and, under some conditions, also in a few other areas, suggesting sociocultural factors contributing to differences in how strongly isolation favors linguistic diversity and how strongly contact promotes linguistic homogenization. Our results suggest that present-day hotspots of linguistic diversity, which are characterized by relative isolation, may provide a privileged window on the dynamics of linguistic evolution as they are less affected by the vast demographic expansions, migrations, and extinctions that characterize the Neolithic age.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

However, current approaches are limited in their ability to generalize to peptides with novel post-translational modifications (PTMs) due to insufficient training data. To address this challenge, we introduce MoSTERT (Molecular Structure Transformer Encoder for Retention Time prediction) and its enhanced variant, MoSTERT-2S, two transformer-based models designed for zero-shot prediction of retention times of peptides with unseen PTMs. Unlike conventional models, MoSTERT encodes peptide residues at the molecular structure level, allowing it to handle diverse PTMs. MoSTERT-2S further improves accuracy by employing a two-step strategy: first predicting the retention time of the unmodified peptide, then estimating the retention time shift induced by the PTMs. Evaluation on an external dataset demonstrates that MoSTERT-2S achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing prediction errors compared to existing methods. Its ability to accurately predict retention times for peptides with a wide variety of PTMs not seen during training highlights its potential for advancing proteomic workflows analyzing proteoforms and protein modifications.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

In pond snails and Caenorhabditis elegans, cell division plays a critical role in regulating both levels of L-R asymmetries. However, the precise mechanism by which cell division breaks cellular-level L-R symmetry remains elusive. Here, we show that cytokinesis-induced cortical flow twists the cell-cell adhesion pattern, which in turn controls the L-R asymmetrical constriction of the contractile ring, thereby breaking the first L-R body symmetry in C. elegans. During the second mitosis of C. elegans embryos, we discovered the twisting of the HMR-1/cadherin patch at the cell-cell contact site. The HMR-1 patch twisting occurs within a few minutes upon cytokinesis onset, with individual cadherin foci within the patch exhibits directional flow and coalescence. This cell type exhibits chiral cortical flow, characterized by counter-rotational surface flows in the two halves of the dividing cell. We found that this chiral cortical flow plays a critical role in regulating HMR-1 patch twisting by inducing cadherin flow. As the HMR-1 patch twists, the contractile ring preferentially associates with HMR-1 on the right side of the embryo. We demonstrate that HMR-1 patch twisting regulates the L-R asymmetric ring closure. This study uncovers an interplay between three fundamental cellular processes--cell-cell adhesion, cytokinesis, and cell polarity-- mediated by cadherin flow, shedding light on cadherin flows role in cellular patterning during development.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

The cytoplasm-exposed multidomain fragment of RyRs integrates multiple cellular signals that regulate channel gating and small deviations from the physiological open probability of RyRs leads to life-threatening diseases. While cryo-EM has been instrumental in revealing near-atomic details of RyR gating mechanisms, the open probability of RyR1 under cryo-EM conditions is notably lower than that observed in electrophysiological studies, complicating structural investigations of RyR1 gating modulation. Here, we present a cryo-EM study examining the open probability of RyR1 solubilized in CHAPS with varying lipid concentrations. We found that increasing lipid concentration from 0.001% to 0.05% raised the RyR1 open probability from 16 to 84%; however, RyR1 reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs remained closed.

Existing tools for uncovering co-evolutionary signals primarily rely on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), often neglecting considerations of phylogenetic relatedness and shared evolutionary history. Here, we present a novel approach based on the substitution mapping of amino acid changes onto the phylogenetic tree. We categorize amino acids into two groups: 'tolerable' and 'intolerable,' and assign them to each position based on the position dynamics concerning the observed amino acids. Amino acids deemed 'tolerable' are those observed phylogenetically independently and multiple times at a specific position, signifying the position's tolerance to that alteration. Gaps are regarded as a third character type, and we only consider phylogenetically independent altered gap characters. Our algorithm is based on a tree traversal process through the nodes and computes the total amount of substitution per branch based on the probability differences of two groups of amino acids and gaps between neighboring nodes. We employ an MSA-masking approach to mitigate misleading artifacts from poorly aligned regions. When compared to tools utilizing phylogeny (CAPS and CoMap) and state-of-the-art MSA-based approaches (DCA, GaussDCA, PSICOV, and MIp), our method exhibits significantly superior accuracy in identifying co-evolving position pairs, as measured by statistical metrics including MCC, AUC, and F1 score.

Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the only treatment option capable of modifying the natural history of the disease, but current AIT schemes present safety and efficacy limitations. One possible strategy to address these limitations is to encapsulate the allergen in nanoparticle carriers that can deliver it to antigen presenting cells while hiding it from effector cells responsible for the allergic reaction. In this work, we evaluate the use of allergen-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) as AIT agents. MSNs of different pore sizes were prepared and characterized, evaluating their capacity to load and release ovalbumin (OVA) as a model allergen. Extra-large pore MSNs (XL-MSNs) showed the optimal loading and release behavior, presenting also enhanced activation of the dendritic cell line DC2.4 and reduced allergenic capacity in pre-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells, both compared to free OVA. After evaluating their biodistribution following subcutaneous, sublingual or intravenous administration, their therapeutic potential in AIT was further assessed in an in vivo murine model of OVA systemic anaphylaxis. The results showed that intravenous administration of OVA-loaded XL-MSNs significantly protected the mice from anaphylaxis and induced a Th1/Treg-immune profile, while administration through other routes failed to prevent the development of an anaphylactic reaction upon provocation with OVA. These findings establish MSNs, particularly via intravenous administration, as a promising platform to develop safer and more effective AIT.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Yet, early embryogenesis is also strikingly conserved in some groups, like Spiralia (e.g., snails, clams, and many marine worms). In this large clade, a shared cleavage program -- the so-called spiral cleavage -- and similar cell lineages are ancestral to at least seven animal phyla. Why early development is so conserved in specific groups and plastic in others is not fully understood. Here, we investigated two annelid species -- Owenia fusiformis and Capitella teleta -- with spiral cleavage but different modes of specifying their primary progenitor cells. By generating high-resolution transcriptomic time courses from the oocyte and fertilisation until gastrulation, we show transcriptional dynamics are markedly different between these species during spiral cleavage and instead reflect their distinct timings of embryonic organiser specification. However, the end of cleavage and gastrulation exhibit high transcriptomic similarity. At these stages, orthologous transcription factors share gene expression domains, suggesting this period is a previously overlooked mid-developmental transition in annelid embryogenesis. Together, our data reveal hidden developmental plasticity in the genetics underpinning spiral cleavage, indicating an evolutionary decoupling of morphological and transcriptomic conservation during early animal embryogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

The periosteum is typically quiescent, but upon fracture, periosteal cells proliferate and contribute to bone fracture repair. The expansion of the periosteum is regulated by gene transcription; however, the molecular mechanisms behind periosteal expansion are unclear. Here, we show that Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) mediate periosteal expansion and periosteal cell proliferation. Bone fracture increases the number of YAP-expressing periosteal cells, and deletion of YAP and TAZ from Osterix (Osx) expressing cells impairs early periosteal expansion. Mechanistically, YAP regulates both  cell-intrinsic and  cell-extrinsic factors that allow for periosteal expansion. Specifically, we identified Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) as a cell extrinsic factor regulated by YAP, that rescues the impairment of periosteal expansion upon YAP/TAZ deletion. Together, these data establish YAP mediated transcriptional mechanisms that induce periosteal expansion in the early stages of fracture repair and provide new putative targets for therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Similarly, APEX2 shows high labeling efficiency within its direct contact range. In parallel, it exhibits a low-level diffusive labeling towards more distant phenols. These findings reframe our understanding in the mechanism of proximity labeling enzymes, at the same time highlight the potential of DNA nanotechnology in spatially profiling reactive species.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

The regeneration of myelin, or remyelination, occurs spontaneously following demyelination. The lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced focal demyelination model enables investigations into the mechanisms of remyelination, providing insight into the molecular basis underlying an evolving remyelinating microenvironment over a tractable time course. Here, we present a detailed analysis using high-resolution single nucleus RNA sequencing to investigate gene expression dynamics across multiple cell populations involved in the remyelination process. We examine three specific time points following focal demyelinating injury in mice, and by delineating activation states within the heterogeneous cell populations of demyelinated lesions, we highlight changes in gene expression within subclusters of each cell population from the early stages of injury response to the initiation and maintenance of remyelination. Our findings reveal how shifts in microglial, astrocytic and fibroblast activities within lesions are associated with efficient oligodendrocyte differentiation during remyelination.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Here, we report that the adaptive immune system CRISPR-Cas supervises the expression of diverse immune systems by exploiting the regulatory CRISPR RNA-like RNAs (crlRNAs). The crlRNAs target and inhibit the promoters of various immune systems, including the newly characterized Nezha and Gabija, as well as eight previously unrecognized systems that feature distinct defensive domains. Notably, CRISPR regulation balances the expression level of these systems to ensure effective anti-phage activity while avoiding their autoimmunity risks. In return, the supervised immune systems trigger abortive infections when CRISPR-Cas is inhibited by viral anti-CRISPR proteins, thereby offering an anti-anti-CRISPR protection at the population level. Moreover, these systems complement CRISPR immunity with a differing anti-phage profile. These findings highlight the pivotal role of CRISPR-Cas in orchestrating a diverse range of immune systems and showcase the delicate synergy among the multilayered defense strategies in prokaryotes.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Thus, inferring single-cell phenotypes with the leverage of bulk data is practical. Here we proposed an algorithm for Single Cells Phenotype Prediction based on the expression profiles of phenotype-associated marker genes in bulks and single cells (ScPP). ScPP first analyzes bulk data to identify phenotype-associated marker genes. Next, ScPP evaluates the enrichment scores of the phenotype-associated marker gene sets in single cells using the AUCell algorithm. The single cells with the phenotype are defined as the intersection of the single cells with top  ranks according to the phenotype-associated AUC values and the single cells with bottom  ranks according to the opposite phenotype-associated AUC values. Finally, all single cells are determined as phenotype+, phenotype- or background. We demonstrated that ScPP could effectively recognize cell subpopulations with specific phenotypes, including tumor malignancy, estrogen receptor status, microsatellite instability, copy number variation, survival and immunotherapy response. Compared to the established algorithms (Scissor and scAB), ScPP displays more excellent predictive performance and needs less running time. Thus, ScPP is an effective and competitive tool for inferring cell phenotypes.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

However, existing tools primarily focus on detecting localized, highly-concentrated, interactions. Furthermore, the wide variety of available chromatin conformation datasets is rarely utilized in developing effective loop callers. Here, we present Polaris, a universal tool that integrates axial attention with a U-shaped backbone to accurately detect loops across different 3D genome assays.

Poor water quality, inadequate sanitation, poverty, undernutrition, and limited healthcare access contribute to this lingering problem, along with emerging environmental stressors driven by climate change. We analysed long-term spatial relationships between environmental, socioeconomic, and maternal/child factors using Demographic and Health Surveys and WorldClim data across eight South and Southeast Asian countries (n = 66,545 clusters; 3,143,811 child-level observations). We employed boosted regression trees to assess variable importance across five thematic phases: socio-economic, maternal, child, climate, and combined. We selected variables based on biological plausibility, collinearity checks, and completeness. We addressed uncertainty through multiple imputation and stochastic resampling, and we evaluated model performance using cross-validation. The main predictors of diarrhoea incidence included annual temperature variability, precipitation in the wettest month, maternal education, and household size. Higher annual temperature range (30-40 C) was associated with a ~ 39% increase in diarrhoea probability, while lower precipitation in the wettest month (< 600 mm) increased risk by ~ 29%, highlighting the role of drier conditions. We found that maternal education < 8 years increased diarrhoea probability by ~ 18%, and household sizes exceeding six members increased it by ~ 9%. Our findings emphasise the need for climate-resilient public-health policies that integrate social and environmental determinants of diarrhoea. Targeted interventions including improved maternal education, water and sanitation infrastructure, and resource management in densely populated households are necessary to mitigate diarrhoea risk in vulnerable regions under changing climate conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1735337356181

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a key pathogen from this group associated with chronic lung infections that has been extensively studied in this context, but the mechanism driving its adaptation towards chronic colonisation in the CF lung is not fully understood.

This work focuses on the adaptations of P. aeruginosa to long-term hypoxia, one of the important environmental pressures present in the CF lung, to investigate whether it drives the development of persistence in CF patients. We examined how an early CF isolate adapted to 6% oxygen over 28 days using an experimental evolution approach and showed that two distinct P. aeruginosa small colony variants (SCVs) emerged, one exclusively in hypoxia exposure cultures. Importantly, SCVs were more prevalent in hypoxia-adapted cultures than in normoxia-adapted cultures (98% vs <35%). Proteomic analysis revealed significant changes in the abundance of >200 proteins within 28 days, including proteins involved in antibiotic resistance, stress response, iron acquisition, biofilm formation and those previously associated with chronic infection. Importantly the observed changes in the proteome were distinct from changes reported after short-term exposure to hypoxia. Phenotypic characterisation of adapted cultures supported these findings, showing that hypoxia-adapted cultures developed higher resistance to 8 of 13 antibiotics tested; increased biofilm (1.8-4.1-fold (p<0.0001) and decreased pyocyanin production (2.6-fold, p<0.0001). All hypoxia-adapted cultures showed decreased siderophore production (2.9-3.6-fold, p<0.02). Two distinct patterns of adaptation to hypoxic conditions were observed, with the phenotypes of one culture being markedly different from the other two. Overall, we demonstrate that long-term hypoxia exposure contributes to multiple phenotype and proteome changes that are also observed in P. aeruginosa CF lung chronic infection, possibly opening the path to treatment of chronic infections.

Author SummaryOpportunistic antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections emerging from the natural environment are an increasing threat, particularly for immunocompromised individuals such as people with cystic fibrosis (CF). These infections increase disease severity, the number of deaths and healthcare costs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major pathogen in this context, causing long-term infections, yet the mechanisms driving its adaptation towards chronic colonisation in the CF lung are not understood.

We investigated the adaptations of P. aeruginosa exposed to low oxygen conditions (an important environmental pressure in the CF lung), for 28 days, to examine whether it drives the process of persistence. We found that prolonged exposure to hypoxia induced changes in the pathogens characteristics, which were distinct from those reported after short term exposure. We observed multiple adaptations in hypoxia adapted cultures, many of which were associated with important signalling networks linked to lifestyle shifts in most bacteria and several of them are also observed in isolates that had adapted to chronic infection. Similar adaptive responses in other opportunistic environmental pathogens suggest that this adaptation could be targeted to create universal therapeutic approaches preventing antibiotic overuse and improving patient outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Initially, GP-ML-DC reduces feature dimensionality by characterizing genes as features. Building on big data methodologies, it employs a divide-and-conquer approach to segment gene regions into multiple haplotypes, further decreasing dimensionality. Each haplotype segment is processed by a sub-task based on traditional ML, followed by integration via a neural network that synthesizes the results of all sub-tasks. Our experiments, conducted on four cattle milk-related traits using ten-fold cross-validation and independent testing, show that GP-ML-DC significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art genome predictors in prediction performance.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

A foundational question is whether social observation and experience engage common circuit mechanisms that enable behavioral change. While classic studies on social learning have shown that aggressive behaviors can be learned through observation, it remains unclear whether aggression observation promotes persistent neural changes that generalize to new contexts. Here, to directly compare the effects of aggression experience and observation at brain-wide scale, we develop a strategy to perform large-scale cell-type specific recordings across subcortical networks for social behavior control and learning. We record longitudinally while animals train through direct experience or observation, then probe shared differences in behavior and neural activity in a novel hard aggression context. Using supervised and unsupervised methods for behavioral quantification, we detect unique signatures of a shared behavioral strategy not present in animals with no training. During observation, we find widespread activation that mimics experience in networks for behavior generation, with critical differences in signals associated with reward and threat learning. After observation, we observe that changes persist into the novel aggression context, with increased similarity in the neural dynamics between experience and observation groups. Network-level modeling reveals persistent shared changes to a core aggression network, with widespread decoupling of inhibition from a key hypothalamic output region. This demonstrates that experience-like activity during observation can recruit a shared plasticity mechanism that biases behavior toward adaptive defensive strategies in new contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Senescence is defined as an irreversible growth arrest observed when cells are exposed to a variety of stressors including DNA damage, oxidative stress, or nutrient deprivation. While senescence is a well-established driver of aging and age-related diseases, it is a highly heterogeneous process with significant variations across organisms, tissues, and cell types. The relatively low abundance of senescence in healthy aged tissues represents a major challenge to studying senescence in a given organ, including the human lung. To overcome this limitation, we developed a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning framework to generate a comprehensive senescence marker gene list in human lungs (termed SenSet) using the largest publicly available single-cell lung dataset, the Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA). We validated SenSet in a highly complex ex vivo human 3D lung tissue culture model subjected to the senescence inducers bleomycin, doxorubicin, or irradiation, and established its sensitivity and accuracy in characterizing senescence. Using SenSet, we identified and validated cell-type specific senescence signatures in distinct lung cell populations upon aging and environmental exposures.

We use ACCESS-ATAC to perform genome-wide allelic occupancy and co-occupancy imputation for 64 TFs each in HepG2 and K562, revealing that the propensity of a majority of TFs to co-occupy nearby motifs oscillates with a period approximating the helical turn of DNA. Altogether, ACCESS-ATAC expands the resolution and capabilities of bulk and single-cell epigenomic profiling.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Presence of expanded CTG repeats in DMPK-mRNAs leads to the sequestration of RNA binding factors such as the Muscleblind like (MBNL) proteins resulting in widespread splicing defects contributing to progressive muscle weakness and myotonia. Here, we show that abnormal splicing of SORBS1 exon 25 found in skeletal muscle of myotonic dystrophy type 1 patients is a critical contributor to neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation and maintenance. Forced exclusion of SORBS1 exon 25 in mice results in NMJ degeneration with marked denervation and postsynaptic destabilization. In zebrafish, misregulation of sorbs1 exon 25 results in reduced motor function and abnormal AChR cluster morphology. Finally, we observed that forcing SORBS1 exon 25 exclusion in hiPSC-derived skeletal muscle cells reduces the formation of large AChR clusters upon agrin stimulation. Thus, our study identifies MBNL regulated SORBS1 alternative splicing during skeletal muscle development as a critical event for NMJ formation and maintenance. The aberrant splicing of SORBS1 exon 25 in DM1 expands our understanding of how splicing dysregulation compromises neuromuscular system communication, shedding light on the broader impact of mRNA splicing regulation on NMJ integrity.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Recently, the MFSD12 transmembrane protein was shown to be necessary to import cysteine into lysosomes (and melanosomes), enabling the study of these processes using genetic tools. Here, we find that mice lacking Mfsd12 die between embryonic days 10.5-12.5, suggesting that MFSD12 is essential for organogenesis. Within lysosomes, it is well known that a significant fraction of the cysteine is converted into cystine (oxidized cysteine), which accumulates and can be released into the cytosol via the CTNS (cystinosin) transporter.However, in contrast to Mfsd12, loss of Ctns results in live animals, indicating that it is not an essential gene. This suggests that the essential function of MFSD12 is not to enable cystine storage for use in the cytosol but rather to supply reduced cysteine to the lysosomal lumen itself. Consistent with this idea, the treatment of breeding heterozygous mice with cysteamine, a lysosome-penetrant thiol, rescued the development of Mfsd12 knockout mice and resulted in live births. Our work implicates lysosomal thiol import as an essential metabolic pathway and provides tools for deciphering its complex genetic and metabolic interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Here, we sought to express recombinant PFKFB2 and develop a robust protocol to measure its kinase activity. These studies resulted in the unexpected finding that bacterially expressed PFKFB2 is phosphorylated in situ on Ser483 but is not a result of autophosphorylation. Recombinant PFKFB2 was used to develop an enzymatic assay to test a library of molecules selected by the Atomwise AtomNet(R) AI platform. This resulted in the identification of a new inhibitor, B2, that inhibits PFKFB2 (IC50 3.29 M) and PFKFB3 (IC50 11.89 M). A-498 cells, which express both PFKFB2 and PFKFB3, were treated with B2. Seahorse XFe analysis revealed B2 inhibited cellular glycolysis and glycolytic capacity. Targeted LC/MS analysis showed B2 decreased fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and downstream glycolytic intermediates but increased fructose-6-phosphate levels, which is consistent with an inhibitory effect on PFK-1 activity. The LC/MS metabolic profile of A-498 cells treated under identical conditions with the known PFKFB3 inhibitor, PFK158, was distinct from that induced by B2. These results thus demonstrate the identification and validation of a new PFKFB kinase inhibitor.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

There have been limited investigations of post-COVID sequelae in pwMSRD.

ObjectiveWe assessed whether pwMSRD were more susceptible to post-COVID sequelae when compared to controls.

DesignThis cross-sectional study leveraged a multi-center cohort of pwMSRD and controls.

SettingA one-time web-based survey was conducted between August and December 2022.

ParticipantsOut of the 2,156 participants who consented, the analysis included 1,972 after excluding 184 due to missing data.

Main ExposureDiagnosis of MSRD.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresWe surveyed 71 symptoms that emerged at least 1 month after the initial acute COVID-19 and were either new onset or worsening from the pre-COVID baseline. We assessed whether each participant experienced (1) [&ge;]1 new symptom, (2) [&ge;]1 worsening symptom from baseline.

ResultsThe study included 969 pwMSRD (799 [82.5%] women, mean age 51.8 [SD 12.1] years) and 1,003 controls (796 [79.4%] women, mean age 45.2 [SD 10.3] years). 613 pwMSRD (63.5%) and 614 controls (61.2%) experienced acute COVID-19. Compared to controls, pwMSRD had higher odds of developing a new symptom (OR=1.55; 95%CI=1.22-1.98; p<.01) and experiencing a worsening symptom from baseline (OR=3.39; 95%CI=2.64-4.36; p<.01). PwMSRD were more likely to develop new symptoms involving the pulmonary as well as head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat systems, and have worsening systemic, musculoskeletal, and neuropsychiatric symptoms from baseline. Acute COVID-19 severity mediated >20% of the association between MSRD diagnosis and post-COVID sequelae. In the subgroup of pwMS, having post-COVID sequelae was associated with worse functional disability.

Conclusions and RelevanceCompared to controls, pwMSRD experienced an increased risk of post-COVID sequelae involving multiple organ systems. Post-COVID sequelae was associated with greater disability in pwMS. The findings highlighted the importance of recognizing and managing long-term symptoms following acute COVID-19 in this vulnerable population.

Key PointsQuestion: Are people with multiple sclerosis and related disorders (pwMSRD) more susceptible to post-COVID sequelae?

Findings: In this cross-sectional study that included 969 patients and 1,003 controls, pwMSRD had higher odds of experiencing post-COVID sequelae than controls after acute COVID-19. The association was mediated by the severity of acute COVID-19. Post-COVID symptoms, both new and worsening symptoms from baseline, were associated with worse neurological disability.

Meaning: These findings highlight the importance of recognizing and effectively managing post-COVID sequelae in pwMSRD.","NA","medrxiv",1735337356181

The global dissemination of heartworms is believed to have occurred alongside the dispersal of domesticated dogs. To test this theory, we performed the largest population genetics study of heartworms to date, based on whole-genome sequencing of 127 modern adult individuals collected from mammalian carnivore hosts across four continents. Population structure and demographic analyses of the nuclear genome reveal distinct genetic differences between heartworms from different continents, indicating a deeper ancient origin and dispersal in canid hosts than previously recognised. Using admixture analyses, we find an Asian origin for Australian heartworms consistent with the arrival of dingoes thousands of years ago. Finally, the genetic relatedness between European and Central American heartworms suggests that modern dispersal, likely associated with human colonisation of the Americas by Europeans, occurred with domesticated dogs. Our findings shed light on the global population dynamics and evolutionary history of heartworms, which can aid future surveillance and control efforts for this important veterinary parasite.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

To understand mechanisms of UTI pathogenesis and find new treatments, researchers often use animal models, such as mice or rats. However, studying certain phenotypes in animals can be difficult. Additionally, using animals in research comes with significant administrative and ethical challenges. To address these challenges, we developed a simple, reproducible, and cost-effective model to study UTI using donated mouse bladder tissue that would otherwise be discarded. This model allows researchers of all experience levels to study interactions between the host and pathogen in a controlled environment. We tested uropathogenic E. coli colonization and invasion of isolated urothelial sheets from 30 minutes to 24 hours, finding that bacterial burden in our ex vivo model was comparable to in vivo UTI mouse models. To optimize reproducibility, we tested multiple variables, including technical parameters, such as incubator conditions, and biological factors, such as biological sex or prior pregnancy in the donor mouse. This method offers several advantages, including assessment of early host-pathogen interactions, immune cell uptake of bacteria, the impact of age and sex of donor animals in infection, and diverse bacterial strains, mutants, or treatments. In addition, in some countries, sharing material recovered from animals sacrificed for other reasons does not require additional ethical approval by the receiving laboratory, providing a resource for labs without access to animals and reducing administrative burden. Given the breadth of the model with respect to sex, age, mouse and bacterial strain, and the ability to test any parameter that can be included in a 96-well plate, we believe this model will be useful to UTI researchers, with potential application beyond infection or even beyond the bladder to other tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

These 3D stem cell-derived models exist in a newer space at the intersection of in vivo and 2D in vitro models. Functional benchmarking has so far remained largely uncharacterised however, leaving the extent to which these models may accurately portray in vivo processes still yet to be fully realised. Here we present a standardised unguided protocol to generate brain organoids from mice, the most commonly-used in vivo mammalian model; and in parallel establish a guided protocol for generating region-specific choroid plexus mouse organoids. Both unguided and guided mouse organoids progress through neurodevelopmental stages with an in vivo-like tempo and recapitulate species-specific characteristics of neural and choroid plexus development, respectively. Neuroepithelial cells generate neural progenitors that give rise to different neural subtypes including deep-layer neurons, upper-layer neurons, and glial cells. We further adapted protocols to prolong mouse cerebral organoid (CO) cultures as slices at the air-liquid interface (ALI), enhancing accessibility for long-term studies and functional investigations. In mature mouse ALI-COs, we observed mature glia, as well as synaptic structures and long-range axon tracts projecting to distant regions, suggesting an establishment and maturation of neural circuitry. Indeed, functional analyses with high-density multi-electrode arrays (HD-MEAs) indicate comparable activity to ex vivo organotypic mouse brain slices. Having established protocols for both region-specific and unpatterned mouse brain organoids, we demonstrate that their neurodevelopmental trajectories, and resultant mature features, closely mimic the in vivo models to which they are benchmarked across multiple biochemical, morphological, and functional read-outs. We propose that mouse brain organoids are a valuable model for functional studies, and provide insight into how closely brain organoids of other species, such as human, may recapitulate their own respective in vivo development.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1735337356181

However, there are other reorganizations of the network that do not involve fission and fusion. One such exception is the elusive, beads-on-a-string morphological transition of mitochondria. During such transitions, the cylindrical tubes of the mitochondrial membrane transiently undergo shape changes to a string of pearls connected along thin tubes. These dynamics have been anecdotally observed in many contexts and given disparate explanations. Here we unify these observations by proposing a common underlying mechanism based on the biophysical properties of tubular fluid membranes for which it is known that, under particular regimes of tension and pressure, membranes reach an instability and undergo a shape transition to a string of connected pearls. First, we use high-speed light-sheet microscopy to show that transient, short-lived pearling events occur spontaneously in the mitochondrial network in every cell type we have examined, including primary fibroblasts, T-cells, neurons, and budding yeast. We present evidence that transient mitochondrial pearling occurs during important biological events, particularly during T cell activation and neuronal firing. Using our high-temporal resolution data, we identify two distinct categories of spontaneous pearling, i) internal pressure-driven pearling regulated by ionic flux, and ii) external tension-driven pearling regulated by molecular motors. By applying live-cell STED microscopy we document the structural reorganization of inner cristae membranes during mitochondrial pearling. We then compare numerous methods for inducing pearling, including the ability to induce these dynamics with single mitochondrion precision. These methods include ionophores, channel activators, osmotic shock, detergents, laser stimulation, membrane intercalating molecules, chemical fixation, and micro-needle force. These disparate inducers establish three main physical causes of pearling, i) ionic flux amplifying internal osmotic pressure, ii) membrane packing lowering bending elasticity, and iii) external mechanical force increasing membrane tension. Pearling dynamics thereby reveal a fundamental biophysical facet of mitochondrial biology. We suggest that pearling should take its place beside fission and fusion as a key process of mitochondrial dynamics, with implications for physiology, disease, and aging.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Mixotrophy in ciliates is commonplace, but has been investigated at a cellular and molecular level almost entirely in one organism, Paramecium bursaria. Reliance on just one model system makes it difficult to know which cell biological aspects of this system represent general features of ciliate mixotrophy versus accidental features of the specific organism. Here we describe the cell biology and genome of the giant heterotrichous ciliate Stentor pyriformis. We show that this giant unicellular organism contains Chlorella variabilis as its endosymbiont, that the Chlorella can live freely outside the host, that within the host the Chlorella cells are docked near the cell surface, surrounded by microtubule ""baskets"", and that the photosynthetic efficiency of the Chlorella is reduced inside the Stentor cell compared to when it is free-living outside the host, with photon energy instead being shunted to non-photochemical quenching. Compared to the non-mixotrophic Stentor coeruleus, S. pyriformis has several distinct cellular features that may be related to endosymbiosis: the presence of microtubule baskets, which are absent in S. coeruleus; positive rather than negative phototaxis, which is likely an adaptation to allow the photosynthetic symbionts access to sufficient light; and a lack of pigment in the host cell, which may be an adaptation to tolerate high light levels. Compared to P. bursaria, S. pyriformis has several similar cellular features: in both organisms, the symbiont is a strain of Chlorella variabilis; the Chlorella endosymbiont retains the ability to live freely when separated from the host; and the algal symbionts contained in perialgal vesicles are docked at the cell surface. One potentially informative difference between P. bursaria and S. pyriformis is that S. pyriformis employs a standard genetic code, similar to other Stentor species but different from most other ciliates, including P. bursaria, which use a non-standard code in which one or more stop-codons are respecified to encode amino acids. This difference in genetic code could serve as a barrier to impede gene transfer from symbiont to host in other ciliates, but this would not be a factor in S. pyriformis. A second cell biological difference is that whereas P. bursaria performs phototaxis by a kinetic accumulation mechanism, in which swimming is non-directional but cells slow down in regions of higher light intensity, S. pyriformis performs directed swimming towards the direction of high light intensity. However, as in P. bursaria, phototaxis in S. pyriformis requires the presence of the Chlorella, implying a potential flow of information from the symbiont to direct the orientation and swimming of the host cell. We propose that S. pyriformis will serve as a useful model system for studying the evolution of mixotrophy and endosymbiosis, with unique advantages in terms of size and regenerative ability as well as distinct cellular and genomic features compared with other mixotrophic ciliate models.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

While contemporary research has somewhat advanced our understanding of DMT, and psychedelics more broadly, there is little research that integrates time-resolved measures of subjective experience with temporally fine-grained brain imaging. We therefore present the current study, a repeated-measures dose-dependent study of the subjective and neural dynamics induced through DMT under naturalistic conditions. Nineteen participants received either a 20mg or 40mg dose of freebase DMT across two dosing sessions in a blinded, counterbalanced order, with blinding rates consistent across doses. Electroencephalography (EEG) data was collected, as well as time-resolved retrospective measures of subjective experience (Temporal Experience Tracing). Both doses of DMT induced rapid changes in experience dimensions. However, the 40mg dose induced significantly more extreme visual hallucinations and emotionally intense experiences. Further, we computed a variety of neural markers on the EEG data, and found that oscillatory alpha power and permutation entropy were most strongly associated with continuous subjective experience dimensions. Strikingly, lempel-ziv complexity, a previously hailed as a robust correlate of subjective experiences within the psychedelic-state, was the least strongly associated neural marker. These findings provide an important insight into how distinct neural dynamics may contribute to this radical and intense altered state of consciousness.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

To resolve the most complex repeats, this project relied on the semi-manual combination of long, accurate PacBio HiFi and ultra-long Oxford Nanopore sequencing reads. The Verkko assembler later automated this process, achieving complete assemblies for approximately half of the chromosomes in a diploid human genome. However, the first version of Verkko was computationally expensive and could not resolve all regions of a typical human genome. Here we present Verkko2, which implements a more efficient read correction algorithm, improves repeat resolution and gap closing, introduces proximity-ligation-based haplotype phasing and scaffolding, and adds support for multiple long-read data types. These enhancements allow Verkko to assemble all regions of a diploid human genome, including the short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes and both sex chromosomes. Together, these changes increase the number of telomere-to-telomere scaffolds by twofold, reduce runtime by fourfold, and improve assembly correctness. On a panel of 19 human genomes, Verkko2 assembles an average of 39 of 46 complete chromosomes as scaffolds, with 21 of these assembled as gapless contigs. Together, these improvements enable telomere-to-telomere comparative and pangenomics, at scale.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

However, bacteria in nature experience flowing environments that are nutrient limited. Using microfluidics and single cell imaging, we discover that flow promotes growth of the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa at surprisingly low nutrient concentrations. In static environments, cells require high nutrient concentrations as they steadily consume non-renewable resources. In flowing environments, cells grow robustly at very low nutrient concentrations that are constantly replenished. Our simulation-guided experiments show how stopping flow halts growth within minutes and varying flow impacts growth gradients across bacterial populations. By precisely delivering nutrients using microfluidics, we learned that cells in flow can grow on glucose concentrations 1,000 times lower than those observed in typical laboratory experiments. The ultralow glucose concentrations sufficient for growth in flow closely align with the affinity of bacterial glucose transporters, suggesting that bacteria have evolved in flowing environments with scarce nutrients. Collectively, our results emphasize the limits of traditional culturing approaches and highlight how depleted environments can unexpectedly support bacterial growth.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Upon autophagy induction, a unique double-membraned structure, called a phagophore, forms and expands into a cup shape to engulf these cytosolic substrates. ATG8 proteins are covalently conjugated to autophagic membranes by lipidation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and are thought to localise on both sides of the phagophore membrane. ATG8 conjugated on the inner membrane of the phagophore recruits autophagy cargo receptors, such as p62. To recapitulate events on the inner membrane, we used giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as a model membrane and encapsulated proteins of interest inside GUVs, thus generating a membrane platform to which ATG8 proteins could be localised on the inner leaflet of the vesicles. We reconstituted WIPI2b-directed and cargo-directed ATG8 lipidation inside the GUVs and revealed distinct roles of WIPI2b and p62 in initiating the ATG conjugation cascade. Furthermore, we showed that p62 or p62 droplets were recruited to the inner membrane of the GUVs though interaction with membrane-bound ATG8s. Using a bead-based membrane expansion assay, we demonstrated a redistribution and local enrichment of membrane-bound ATG8s across the membrane upon interaction with p62 and p62 droplets. Our study provides novel model systems to investigate the interactions on the inner membrane of the phagophore and reveals fundamental molecular insights into phagophore membrane bending. This process is directed by ATG8-cargo interaction, during which cargo receptors concentrate ATG8 proteins on the inner surface of the phagophore membrane.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Gastruloids, self-organizing stem cell-based models of post-implantation mammalian development, provide a powerful platform to address this question. Here, we show that physical parameters, particularly system size, critically influence the timing and outcomes of morphogenetic processes. Larger gastruloids exhibit delayed symmetry breaking, increased multipolarity, and prolonged axial elongation, with morphogenesis driven by system size. Despite these variations, transcriptional programs and cell fate composition remain remarkably stable across a broad size range. Notably, extreme sizes show distinct transcriptional modules and clear shifts in gene expression patterns. Intriguingly, size perturbation experiments rescued the morphogenetic and pattern phenotypes observed in extreme sizes, demonstrating the remarkable adaptability of gastruloids to their effective system size. These findings establish gastruloids as versatile models for studying spatiotemporal dynamics in mammalian embryogenesis and reveal how physical constraints decouple transcriptional from morphogenetic programs.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

PRISM leverages the SpatialData framework to standardise data storage and ensure interoperability with single cell and spatial analysis tools. It consists of two main components: TMA Image Analysis for marker-based tissue masking, TMA dearraying, cell segmentation, and single cell feature extraction; and AnnData Analysis for quality control, clustering, iterative cell-type annotation, and spatial analysis. Integrated as a plugin within napari, PRISM provides an intuitive and purely interactive graphical interface for real-time and human-in-the-loop analyses. PRISM supports efficient multi-resolution image processing and accelerates bioinformatics workflows using efficient scalable data structures, parallelisation and GPU acceleration.

Here we establish a standardized evaluation framework and systematically assess 9 single-cell perturbation prediction models on 17 diverse datasets, spanning multiple cell types and perturbation modalities. Leveraging a multifaceted suite of 24 evaluation metrics, we find that models often excel in capturing global expression profiles yet struggle to predict the nuanced effects of perturbed genes, or vice versa.

Research into natural variation and the evolution of plasticity frequently studies cis-regulatory elements with theory suggesting they are more important evolutionarily than trans-regulatory elements. Genome-wide association studies have supported this idea, observing a predominance of cis-loci affecting plasticity. However, studies in structured populations provide a contrasting image, raising questions about the genetic architecture of natural variation in plasticity. To circumvent potential statistical difficulties present in genome-wide association studies, we mapped loci underlying transcriptomic plasticity in response to salicylic acid using recombinant inbred lines generated from two random Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. We detected extensive transgressive segregation in the salicylic acid response, suggesting that plasticity to salicylate in Arabidopsis is polygenic. Most loci (>75%) underlying this variation act in trans, especially for loci influencing plasticity. Trans-acting loci were enriched in genome hotspots, with predominantly small effect sizes distributed across many genes. This could potentially explain their under-discovery in genome-wide association studies. This work reveals a potentially important role for trans-acting loci in plastic expression responses, with implications for understanding plant adaptation to different environments.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

However, these computational methods are often tailored to specific scenarios and validated on limited datasets and metrics, making their evaluation and comparison challenging.

SHM allows B cells to rapidly evolve new antibody sequences without compromising their fitness as a consequence of genome-wide mutations.

Despite decades of major advances and key insights from molecular systematics, organismal anatomical features remain a key source of biological data for both inferring phylogenies and investigating patterns of trait evolution among fossil and extant species. In paleobiology, morphologic characters are typically the only source of information available for reconstructing evolutionary trees. Systematists working with fossil data must make decisions regarding how morphological characters are modeled, whether they are continuous or categorical, and how to address biological sources of rate variation. To determine the impact of how different models of morphological evolution influence phylogenetic inferences and downstream comparative analyses of fossil data, we competed a series of increasingly complex model configurations of character evolution to a dataset of Cambrian-Ordovician trilobites containing both discrete morphological characters and continuous traits. Competed models vary in complexity, ranging from simple constant rate scenarios with only discrete categorical traits, to complex evolutionary models including both discrete and quantitative traits across multiple ecological partitions while accounting for multiple sources of rate variation. We compared topological distributions across competed models by visualizing their distances in multidimensional treespace. Results indicate the addition of continuous traits dramatically improves support for complex evolutionary scenarios. Remarkably, we find model complexity also has a major impact on which regions of treespace are explored, which suggests a critical need to carefully model morphologic evolution even when systematists are only interested in patterns of phylogenetic relationships alone.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Here, we demonstrate in vitro and in Drosophila cells that the mitotic kinase POLO phosphorylates PP187B at a conserved residue (T286) within a pocket implicated in the recognition of RVxF-containing target proteins. Phosphorylation of T286 inhibits PP187B binding to the RVxF motif of the SAC kinase MPS1, dampening the dephosphorylation of MPS1 T-loop. Phosphorylation of T286 is dynamically regulated during mitosis. It occurs at unattached/tensionless kinetochores and decreases as chromosomes congress. Expression of phosphomimetic PP187BT286D prevents MPS1 inactivation in metaphase and causes a SAC-dependent delay of anaphase onset. Conversely, an unphosphorylatable PP187BT286A mutant impairs MPS1 activation at unattached kinetochores and weakens the SAC. In vivo, larval neuroblasts expressing PP187BT286 phosphomutants exhibit frequent chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy. Thus, our findings identify POLO-mediated phosphorylation of PP187B as a critical regulatory strategy that fine-tunes phosphatase activity to ensure a robust and timely SAC and prevent genome instability.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

GeneSetCluster clusters gene-sets based on shared genes, providing a high-level overview of the involved biological pathways, thereby facilitating interpretability. However, the original version faced limitations in managing redundancies across multiple gene sets. Additionally, programmatic tools like GeneSetCluster can be challenging for users with limited coding expertise.

ResultsWe introduce GeneSetCluster 2.0 which substantially improves upon its predecessor. This update presents a new methodology for addressing duplicated gene-sets and incorporates a seriation-based clustering algorithm that reorders data, enabling the identification of patterns. The updated version is optimized for faster computational performance through parallelization, reducing execution times. Furthermore, the 2.0 version also enhances cluster annotation by identifying relevant tissues and biological processes associated with each cluster. Finally, to improve accessibility and usability, we have developed a user-friendly web application, making GeneSetCluster 2.0 suitable for a broader audience, including those without programming expertise. We also ensured the interplay between the R package, targeting users with programming knowledge, and the web-application, which targets the rest of the users.

ConclusionGeneSetCluster 2.0 significantly improves the original version by providing a more comprehensive, intuitive, and efficient exploration of GSA results. On the other hand, it bridges the gap between bioinformaticians and clinicians in multidisciplinary teams.

How transitions in endothelial cell (EC) number and shape are coordinated to define vessel diameter during development remains an open question. In this study, we discovered EC deformations, rearrangements and transient formation of self-seam junctions as key mechanisms that explain a negative relationship between cell number and vessel diameter. High-resolution analysis of actin cytoskeleton organization disclosed the generation of tension-bearing, circumferential actomyosin bundles in the endothelial cortex that drive EC deformation and vessel constriction. Importantly, the loss of circumferential actin bundles in krit1/ccm1-deficient ECs causes cell enlargement and impaired vessel constriction that culminate in dilated vessels, characteristic of cerebral cavernous malformation. Our multiscale study therefore underpins circumferential actomyosin-driven EC deformations in controlling vessel size and in the prevention of vascular malformations.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

However, existing computational methods often struggle to simultaneously disentangle shared and condition-specific transcriptional patterns, particularly in experimental designs with missing data, unmatched cell populations, or complex attribute combinations. To address these challenges, Patches identifies universal transcriptomic features alongside condition-dependent variations in scRNA-seq data. Using conditional subspace learning, Patches enables robust integration, cross-condition prediction, and biologically interpretable representations of gene expression. Unlike prior methods, Patches excels in experimental designs with multiple attributes, such as age, treatment, and temporal dynamics, distinguishing general cellular mechanisms from condition-dependent changes. We applied Patches to both simulated data and real transcriptomic datasets from skin injury models, focusing on the effects of aging and drug treatment. Patches revealed shared wound healing patterns and condition-specific changes in cell behavior and extracellular matrix remodeling. These insights deepen our understanding of tissue repair and can identify potential biomarkers for therapeutic interventions, particularly in contexts where the experimental design is complicated by missing or difficult-to-collect data.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356181

Models invoke phase separation of conformational ensembles of chromatin fibers as a mechanism regulating chromatin organization in vivo. Here we combine biochemistry and molecular dynamics simulations to examine, at single base-pair resolution, how nucleosome spacing controls chromatin phase separation. We show that as DNA linkers extend from 25 bp to 30 bp, as examplars of 10N+5 and 10N (integer N) bp lengths, chromatin condensates become less thermodynamically stable and nucleosome mobility increases. Simulations reveal that this is due to trade-offs between inter- and intramolecular nucleosome stacking, favored by rigid 10N+5 and 10N bp linkers, respectively. A remodeler can induce or inhibit phase separation by moving nucleosomes, changing the balance between intra- and intermolecular stacking. The intrinsic phase separation capacity of chromatin enables fine tuning of compaction and dynamics, likely contributing to heterogeneous chromatin organization in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

However, movements are regularly triggered and constantly corrected based on sensory inputs caused by disturbances to the body or environment. Since such disturbances are often predictable and since preparing for disturbances would make movements better, we hypothesized that expectations about sensory inputs also influence preparatory activity in motor circuits. Here we show that when humans and monkeys are probabilistically cued about the direction of a future mechanical perturbation, they incorporate sensory expectations into their movement preparation and improve their corrective responses. Using high-density neural recordings, we establish that sensory expectations are widespread across the brain, including the motor cortical areas involved in preparing self-initiated actions. The geometry of these preparatory signals in the neural population state is simple, scaling directly with the probability of each perturbation direction. After perturbation onset, a condition-independent perturbation signal shifts the neural state leading to rapid responses that initially reflect sensory expectations. Based on neural networks coupled to a biomechanical model of the arm3, we show that this neural geometry emerges through training, but only when the incoming sensory information indicating perturbation direction coincides with - or is preceded by - a condition-independent signal indicating that a perturbation has occurred. Thus, motor circuit dynamics are shaped by future sensory inputs, providing clear empirical support for the idea that movement is governed by the sophisticated manipulation of sensory feedback4.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

Currently known phage counter-defense systems are specific to (the activity of) the targeted bacterial defense system. Here, we uncover a mechanism by which the T7 bacteriophage broadly counteracts bacterial defenses using protein phosphorylation. We show that the T7 protein kinase (T7K), which was believed to specifically redirect the function of a few host proteins, is in fact a hyper-promiscuous, dual-specificity kinase enacting a massive wave of phosphorylation on virtually all host and phage proteins during infection. The scale of phosphorylation vastly exceeds the number of previously known phosphorylation events in E. coli, has no sequence motif specificity, and results in a higher proteome-wide phosphorylation density than that of mammalian cells which encode [~] 500 kinases. Stoichiometry analysis of phosphorylation sites revealed a strong bias of T7K activity towards nucleic acid-binding substrates, which we show is mediated by its C-terminal DNA-binding domain. This specificity for highly stoichiometric phosphorylation of nucleic acid-binding proteins enables the deactivation of DNA-targeting or - containing bacterial defense systems. We provide mechanistic insight into how T7K weakens two such defense systems, Retron-Eco9 and DarTG1, through specific phosphorylation events, with single phosphomimetic mutations in key sites of the toxins abolishing defense. Finally, by screening a large collection of E. coli strains, we provide evidence of broad counter-defense capacities for T7K in nature, as strains counteracted contain diverse bacterial defense systems.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

Remarkably, in the absence of such signals, collections of pluripotent stem cells can still self-organise and break symmetry in vitro. One such example is gastruloids, three-dimensional stem cell aggregates that form an anterior-posterior axis through the polarised expression of the gene Brachyury/T. How robust and reproducible cell proportions are achieved in these self-organised embryo-like structures is not understood. Here, through quantitative experiments and theoretical modelling, we dissect tissue rheology and cellular feedback in gastruloids. We show that the initial population of Brachyury-expressing cells critically influences the timing of symmetry-breaking. We propose a cell differentiation model, whereby pluripotent cells inhibit mesoderm differentiation, accounting for the observed cell fate dynamics. Our findings suggest that cell-cell communication dictates temporal cell proportions, while differential tissue mechanics governs spatial pole formation.

The emergence of single-cell multi-omics technologies has driven the development of several methods that integrate transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility data to infer GRNs. While these methods provide examples of their utility in discovering new regulatory interactions, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating their mechanistic and predictive properties as well as their ability to recover known interactions is lacking. To address this, we built a comprehensive framework, Gene Regulatory nETwork Analysis (GRETA), available as a Snakemake pipeline, that includes state of the art methods decomposing their different steps in a modular manner. With it, we found that the GRNs were highly sensitive to methods choices, such as changes in random seeds, or replacing steps in the inference pipelines, as well as whether they use paired or unpaired multimodal data. Although the obtained networks performed moderately well in predictive evaluation tasks and partially recovered known interactions, they struggled to capture causal relationships from perturbation assays. Our work brings attention to the challenges of inferring GRNs from single-cell omics, offers guidelines, and presents a flexible framework for developing and testing new approaches.

However, due to the high noise in the unspliced/spliced data for individual genes, existing RNA velocity models often fail to accurately capture the dynamics between unspliced and spliced abundance in the phase portraits of many genes. In addition, optimizing the high dimensional dynamics of all genes within a global framework and effectively handling multi-lineage data still require further exploration in RNA velocity modeling. Inspired by the role of transcriptional regulation in linking genes into complex networks and providing additional context for gene dynamics modeling, we propose TSvelo. TSvelo integrates cross-gene transcriptional regulation and gene-specific splicing processes of all genes into one neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)-based framework. By incorporating cell-specific transcriptional rates with the unspliced-spliced data, TSvelo precisely models the dynamics of velocity genes, learns global pseudotime, and can be extended to multi-branch datasets. Experiments on six scRNA-seq datasets, including two multi-branch datasets, demonstrate that TSvelo outperforms existing methods in modeling gene dynamics, inferring cell pseudotime and trajectories, and analyzing gene expression patterns across branches.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

However, these techniques involve enzymatic cleavage of DNA, which cannot be easily carried out with other genome-wide DNA profiling simultaneously. While methyltransferase-based methods like NOMe-seq and Fiber-seq have been used for chromatin profiling free of DNA cleavage, their processing requires bisulfite sequencing or amplification-free third generation sequencing. We recently reported the use of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) deaminases for footprinting of transcription factors. Here, we present a variant of FOODIE, chromatin accessibility by footprinting with deaminase (caFOODIE), for detecting open chromatin regions in eukaryotic nucleus. caFOODIE exhibits high degree of consistency with ATAC-seq and DNase-seq. Notably, after caFOODIE deamination, genomic DNA remains unfragmented, and the cytosine conversion is preserved after amplification. The versatility of this technique offers potential for easy integration with other genomic profiling methods, such as 3D genome.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

They infect and cause disease in humans, animals and plants but also play crucial roles in the ecology of microbial communities. Tolerance to genetic change, high-mutation rates, adaptations to hosts and immune escape has driven high divergence of viral genes, hampering their functional annotation and phylogenetic inference. The protein structure is more conserved than sequence and can be used for searches of distant homologs and evolutionary analysis of divergent proteins. Structures of viral proteins are traditionally underrepresented in public databases, but recent advances in protein structure prediction allows us to address this issue. Combining two state-of-the-art approaches, AlphaFold2-ColabFold and ESMFold, we predicted models for 85,000 proteins from 4,400 human and animal viruses, expanding the structural coverage for viral proteins by 30 times compared to experimental structures. We also performed structural and network analyses of the models to demonstrate their utility for functional annotation and inference of distant phylogenetic relationships. Taking this approach, we examined the deep evolutionary history of viral class-I fusion glycoproteins, gaining insights on the origins of coronavirus spike protein. To enable further discoveries, we have created Viro3D (https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/), a virus species-centred protein structure database. It allows users to search, browse and download protein models from a virus of interest and explore similar structures present in other virus species. This resource will facilitate fundamental molecular virology, investigation of virus evolution, and may enable structure-informed design of therapies and vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

However, opioids are prone to side effects which limit their effectiveness as analgesics and can lead to opioid use disorders or, even, lethal overdose. The systemic administration of opioid agonists makes it both very difficult to decipher their underlying circuit mechanisms of action and to limit drug action to specific receptor subpopulations to isolate therapeutic effects from adverse side effects. Here we design, synthesize, and characterize a reversibly photoswitchable morphinan agonist termed azo-morphine-3 (AM-3) which interconverts from low to high efficacy in response to different wavelengths of light to enable optical control of MOR signaling. Cryo-EM structures of the low efficacy trans and high efficacy cis states of AM-3 bound to the MOR reveal distinct binding modes of the photoswitchable azobenzene moiety, each inducing unique structural dynamics, providing insight into the molecular basis of agonist efficacy. In mice, AM-3 drives reversible and repeatable optical control of anti-nociception with a reduced side effect profile owing to its restriction to the periphery and its ability to be locally activated at the site of pain.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

However, the mechanism(s) by which changes in LD composition and dynamics contribute to pathophysiology of these disorders remains unclear. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a droplet associated protein with a common risk variant (E4) that confers the largest increase in genetic risk for late-onset AD. E4 is associated with both increased neuroinflammation and excess LD accumulation. In the current study, we sought to quantitatively profile the lipid and protein composition of LDs between the neutral E3 and risk variant E4, to gain insight into potential LD-driven contributions to AD pathogenesis. Targeted replacement mice expressing human E3 or E4 were injected with saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and after 24 hours, hepatic lipid droplets were isolated for proteomic and lipidomic analyses. Lipidomics revealed a shift in the distribution of glycerophospholipids in E4 LDs with a concomitant increase in phosphatidylcholine species, and overall, the baseline profile of E4 LDs resembled that of the LPS-treated groups. Quantitative proteomics showed that LDs from E4 mice are enriched for proteins involved in protein/vesicle transport but have decreased levels of proteins involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation. Interestingly, proteins associated with LDs showed substantial overlap with previously published lists of AD postmortem tissue and microglia -omics studies, suggesting a potential role for LDs in modulating AD risk or progression. Given this, we exposed primary microglia from the same E3 or E4 mice to exogenous lipid, inflammatory stimulation, necroptotic N2A cells (nN2A), or a combination of treatments to evaluate LD formation and its impact on the cells immune state. Microglia from E4 mice accumulated more LDs in every condition tested, at baseline, and following addition of fatty acids, LPS stimulation, or nN2As. E4 microglia also secreted significantly more cytokines (TNF, IL-1b, IL-10) than E3 microglia in the control, oleic acid, and nN2A treatment conditions, yet showed a blunted response to LPS. In sum, these results suggest that E4 microglia accumulate more LDs compared to E3 microglia and that E4 is associated with a basal LD composition that resembles a pro-inflammatory cell. Together with the high overlap of the LD proteome with established AD-associated datasets, these data further support the idea that alterations in LD dynamics, particularly within microglia, may contribute to the increased risk for AD associated with APOE4.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

As such early identification of emerging bacterial strains capable of rapidly evolving AMR is key. Although antimicrobial tolerance and persistence are precursor phenotypes for AMR, little evidence exists to support their importance in real-world settings. Here we used bacterial genome wide association on national genomic surveillance data of the diarrhoeal pathogen Shigella sonnei (n=3745) to agnostically identify common genetic signatures among lineages convergently evolving toward AMR (n=15). This revealed an association of an AMR trajectory with a multi- and highly variable second copy of metG, borne by a phage-plasmid we called pWPMR2. Further analyses revealed that pWPMR2 was present across clinically relevant enteric pathogens globally, including past and contemporary outbreaks, and that the additional-metG mechanism was present across multiple bacterial phyla. Functional microbiology, experimental evolution, and single-cell physiology studies confirmed that the expression of auxiliary metG, particularly the mutated version on pWPMR2, created a sub population of persister cells predisposed to survival in, and evolving resistance against, third generation cephalosporins. Thus, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of auxiliary metG carriage that predisposes bacteria to AMR with real world impacts. Furthermore, our approach is a timely example of using genomic epidemiology to rapidly guide functional microbiology studies in the era of routine genomic surveillance, and also highlights several deficiencies in current AMR surveillance practices.","NA","medrxiv",1735337356182

Through a combination of phenotypic, cytological and transcriptomic approaches, combined with genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identified key defense-related genes and pathways. Transcriptomic analyses performed on two lines with contrasting suceptibilities to the pathogen revealed a strong overlap in immune responses between M. polymorpha and angiosperms, including the upregulation of PR proteins, transcription factors typically associated with biotic stresses, and enzymes involved in specialized metabolism.

A popular method to generate surrogate maps with preserved spatial autocorrelation is the spin test.

These distortions result in surrogate maps that imperfectly preserve spatial autocorrelation, yielding inflated false positive rates. We then confirm that targeted removal of individual spins with high distortion reduces false positive rates.

Viral sequencing during the pandemic allowed us to track disease spread, quickly identify new variants, and guide the development of vaccines. Tiled amplicon sequencing, in which a panel of primers is used for multiplex amplification of fragments across an entire genome, was the cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. The speed, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of this method led to its implementation in academic and public health laboratories across the world and adaptation to a broad range of viral pathogens. However, similar methods are not available for larger bacterial genomes, for which whole-genome sequencing typically requires in vitro culture. This increases costs, error rates and turnaround times. The need to culture poses particular problems for medically important bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which are slow to grow and challenging to culture.

Here, we reveal a bacterial anti-phage system that mediates immune signaling through nucleobase modification. Immunity is triggered by phage nucleotide kinases, which, combined with the system-encoded adenosine deaminase, produce deoxyinosine 5'-triphosphate (dITP) as immune messengers. The dITP signal activates downstream effector to mediate cellular NAD+ depletion, resulting in population-level defense through the death of infected cells. To counteract immune signaling, phages deploy specialized enzymes that deplete cellular dAMP, the precursor of dITP messengers.

By learning semantic relationships across multiple genes, Evo enables a genomic ""autocomplete"" in which a DNA prompt encoding a desired function instructs the model to generate novel DNA sequences that can be mined for similar functions. We term this process ""semantic mining,"" which, unlike traditional genome mining, can access a sequence landscape unconstrained by discovered evolutionary innovation. We validate this approach by experimentally testing the activity of generated anti-CRISPR proteins and toxin-antitoxin systems, including de novo genes with no significant homology to any natural protein. Strikingly, in-context protein design with Evo achieves potent activity and high experimental success rates even in the absence of structural hypotheses, known evolutionary conservation, or task-specific fine-tuning. We then use Evo to autocomplete millions of prompts to produce SynGenome, a first-of-its-kind database containing over 120 billion base pairs of AI-generated genomic sequences that enables semantic mining across many possible functions.

Despite the critical importance of antibodies in a wide range of areas of biomedical significance, the traditional process of antibody discovery is limited by inefficiency, high costs and failure rates, fundamental logistical hurdles, limited scalability potential, and long turnaround times. Recent computational biology efforts, including machine learning/artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, have proven to have critical capabilities and advantages over purely experimental techniques, disrupting a number of areas that have traditionally met with limited success, such as protein structure modeling, enzyme engineering, drug design, and others (1-3). In the context of antibodies, AI-based approaches have been developed to optimize existing antibodies and generate novel antibody sequences in a target-agnostic manner (4-6). However, the ability of AI approaches to generate novel paired antibody sequences against a specific target (antigen) of interest has not been validated. In this work, we present MAGE (Monoclonal Antibody GEnerator), a sequence-based protein Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned for the task of generating paired variable heavy and light chain antibody sequences against antigens of interest. Here we show that MAGE is capable of efficiently generating diverse antibody sequences that are distinct from the antibody sequences found in the training datasets, with experimentally validated binding specificity against SARS- CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), an emerging avian influenza H5N1 viral hemagglutinin (H5), and respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV-A) prefusion F. MAGE is trained on protein sequence alone and requires only an antigen sequence as input for antibody design, with no need for a preexisting antibody template. MAGE represents a first-in-class model capable of designing human antibodies with demonstrated functionality against multiple targets. AI models for generation of human antibodies will provide unique and disruptive capabilities in the far-reaching field of antibody science.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

Coral bleaching, the disruption of the symbiosis between stony corals and zooxanthellate algae, is driven by climate change-induced seawater warming and further exacerbated by pathogenic microbes. However, how pathogens, especially viruses, contribute to accelerated bleaching remains poorly understood. The present study utilizes the model sea anemone Nematostella vectensis to explore these dynamics by creating a transgenic line with a reporter gene regulated by sequences from two RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) genes involved in antiviral responses. Under heat stress, the reporter gene showed significant upregulation, indicating that these regulatory sequences are indeed responsive to thermal stress. Analyses of transcriptome data of N. vectensis, Exaiptasia diaphana (another sea anemone), and the stony coral Stylophora pistillata revealed stress-induced activation of a set of bona fide immune-related genes conserved between the three species. Population-specific differences in stress-induced transcriptional responses of immune-related genes were evident in both Nematostella and Stylophora, depending on geographic origin. In Exaiptasia, the presence or absence of zooxanthellae also influenced stress-induced immune gene expression. To test whether the viruses themselves may contribute to this immune response under stress, we subjected Nematostella polyps to variable periods of heat stress and measured the transcript levels of resident viruses as well as selected antiviral genes. While the antiviral genes responded within 1-3 hours of heat stress, viral gene expression was already upregulated within 30 minutes, suggesting that their increase might be contributing to the elevated immune response under stress, and consequentially, the further demise of organismal homeostasis. These findings highlight the complex interplay between environmental stress, viruses, immune responses, and symbiotic states in Hexacorallia. Better understanding of these mechanisms could provide insights into the role of immune pathways in coral resilience and bleaching in a changing climate.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

To date, almost all megaphages have evaded cultivation, with only phage G being in active culture for over 50 years. We examined with multiomics this five decades long cultivated history from nine different laboratories with five different lab variants to the modern era. In this work, we resolved the five complete phage G genomes, the particle proteome, de novo methylome, and used artificial intelligence (AI) to annotate the genome of phage G. Phage G is one of the largest phages with a size of >0.6 {micro}m, about half the width of the host cell, and a 499 kbp, non-permuted, linear genome that has, uniquely among known phages, two pairs of ends. Its closest known relative is Moose phage W30-1 which was metagenomically assembled without cultivation from a moose rumen sample. Phage G has >650 protein-coding open reading frames (ORFs), with >65% being hypothetical proteins with no known function, with the rest of the genome geared towards nucleic acid replication (e.g., helicases, polymerases, endonucleases) and are structural in nature (e.g., capsid, tail, portal, terminase). The genome encodes a 35 kbp stretch with 66 ORFs without any known functional homology, a cryptic genomic region that is roughly the size of phage lambda. Phage G has an expansive repertoire of auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) acquired from its bacterial host, including a phoH,ftsZ,UvsX/RecA-like, gyrA, gyrB,and DHFR. Furthermore, AMGs discovered in phage G could manipulate host sporulation (sspD, RsfA, spoK) and antiviral escape genes (e.g., anti-CBass nuclease and Anti-Pycsar protein). Phage proteomics found >15% of the protein ORFs were present in either the wild-type or mutant variants of phage G, including genes involved in replication (e.g.,UvsX/RecA-like), host sporulation, as well as structural genes (e.g., capsid, tail, portal). The methylome of phage G was localized to the cryptic region with limited functional homology, with supervised machine learning (i.e., HMMs) was unable to resolve this region, but was resolved with protein structural AI. This cryptic region was a hot spot for methylation at 32%, where many of the functions of the ORF are still unknown. Our study represents a doorway into the complexity of the genomic repertoire of the only cultivated megaphage, highlighting five decades of continuous cultivation for the first time.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

Here we introduce 'acoustic tumor paint', an approach to labeling brain tumors for ultrasound imaging, a widely accessible imaging modality. We show that gas vesicles (GVs), natural air filled protein nanostructures, preferentially accumulate in brain tumors following systemic administration in syngeneic and xenograft mouse models of GBM. This enables real-time tumor visualization during surgery and postoperative monitoring of recurrence. We characterize GV uptake and breakdown by tumors and their resident cells and support clinical translatability by documenting non toxic repeated administration. We also demonstrate the potential for post-operative monitoring in humans by imaging GVs through a human skull and an FDA approved skull prosthesis. Acoustic tumor paint has the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve surgical outcomes, make monitoring more accessible, and extend survival in GBM patients.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

This way, new sarcomeres can be inserted into contractile and mechanically intact myofibrils. We propose that sarcomere division is triggered by tension and local sarcomere damage originating from skeletal growth and muscle contractions.

Using the golden hamster as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persist in the central nervous system, as we found viral RNA and replicative virus in the brainstem after 80 days of infection. Infected hamsters presented a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, with overexpression of innate immunity genes, impacted dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, altered energy metabolism. Finally, the infected hamsters manifested persistent signs of depression and impaired short-term memory, as well as late-onset signs of anxiety, as a valuable model to study long Covid.

In this study, we elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of triculamin through heterologous expression and show that the biosynthesis proceeds in the presence of a precursor (triA), macrocyclase (triC), and acetyltransferase (triT). Through in vitro triT acetylation and bioactivity assays, we show that acetylation functions as a resistance mechanism. Genomic searches of triculamin BGC genes across bacteria show that triculamin is more widely distributed than previously anticipated, as triculamin-like core peptides are found in at least three phyla in contrast to previously described lasso peptides that are typically restricted to one phylum. Triculamin BGCs with both canonical and non-canonical RiPP biosynthetic genes were identified. Two strains containing canonical triculamin-like BGCs were chemically characterized and shown to produce the novel triculamin-like lasso peptides palmamin and gelatinamin, the latter of which appears to have an unprecedented additional ring formation. Detailed phylogenetic investigation of the macrocyclases from triculamin-like BGCs suggests that these molecules are products of convergent evolution. These findings broaden the evolutionary and functional landscape of lasso peptides, revealing their unexpected diversification and cross-phylum distribution.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

We found that the translation initiation factor EIF4A1, which unwinds complex mRNA structures in the 5 UTR of oncogenic transcripts, is highly expressed in AML stem- and progenitor-like cells. Inhibiting eIF4A with the small molecule Zotatifin reduces translation of transcripts related to the cell cycle and survival. This results in downregulation of AKT, STAT-5, and MCL-1 and underlies synergy of Zotatifin with Venetoclax. The drug combination promotes apoptosis across AML genotypes, while the effect on healthy blood cells is limited. Using in vivo relapsed and refractory AML patient-derived xenograft models, the combination significantly suppressed tumor burden and prolonged survival of xenografted mice. These results support eIF4A-mediated protein translation as a therapeutic target in AML.

An example of an important social association is that between breeding partners - a key social connection in monogamously breeding species. The selection of a breeding partner begins well before reproduction for many species, and this process can have consequences for subsequent reproductive success. Thus, the non-breeding season can shape behaviour during the breeding season. However, it is currently unknown how outcomes in the breeding season can impact associate choice during the non-breeding season, as studying this has been limited due to requiring high volumes of individual social data across both contexts. This study used three years of wild great tit social data from Wytham Woods, Oxford, UK, to examine social associations between pairs classified with respect to prior and future relationship status. We found a distinct behavioural pattern in divorced pairs, which was present from early in the winter, suggesting that the act of divorce occurs soon after the completion of the breeding season. Pairs forming for the first time behaved similarly to divorced pairs earlier in the season, but became similar to faithful pairs throughout the winter. On a finer spatiotemporal scale the behaviour of faithful and divorced birds diverged over the winter. These results provide the first evidence of when divorce occurs in paired great tits, while suggesting that different behaviours may drive behavioural divorce at different times.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

Despite its clinical success, the mechanism through which daptomycin exerts its antibacterial properties has remained controversial. Much of the debate is focused around daptomycin's ability to depolarise the cytoplasmic membrane, potential formation of large membrane pores, and its more recently discovered capability to inhibit cell wall synthesis and disturb membrane lipid domain organisation through interactions with cell wall precursor lipids. Here we show that, rather than representing different facets of a single underlying activity, daptomycin exhibits two independent antibacterial mechanisms of action: (i) targeting of cell wall precursor lipids that leads to cell wall synthesis inhibition and (ii) membrane depolarisation that does not rely on interactions with cell wall precursor lipids. This dual mechanism of action provides an explanation for the frequently disagreeing findings obtained through in vivo and in vitro studies and explains why resistance development towards daptomycin is slow and multifactorial. In a broader context, this demonstrates that dual mechanism antibiotics can be clinically successful and exhibit favourable characteristics in terms of real-world, clinically relevant resistance development.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

These latter mechanisms are mediated by defence systems, including DNA-degrading systems such as Restriction- Modification (RM) and CRISPR-Cas, as well as abortive infection systems that induce cell death or dormancy. Computational studies suggest that bacterial genomes encode several defence systems, which may act synergistically to enhance phage resistance. However, the regulation, interactions, and ecological roles of these systems in native hosts remain poorly understood. This study explored the role of eight predicted defence systems in the clinical isolate NILS69 of E. coli by testing its susceptibility to 93 phages. Infectivity and adsorption assays using mutants defective in these systems revealed that only PD-T4-3 and RM systems restricted phages able to adsorb. The RM system acted via a predicted Type IV endonuclease and was also able to limit plasmid conjugation if the plasmid was transferred from a donor strain lacking a methylase, which is the hallmark of Type I, II or III RM systems. Other defence systems showed no detectable activity, likely due to phage specificity, environmental regulation, or cofactor requirements. These findings underscore the need for further studies to investigate the regulation and ecological roles of bacterial defence systems in their native host contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

We support this approach with experimental evidence that joint optimization is superior for (1) designing stable proteins using a joint model (TrROS (TrRosetta) and TrMRF) (2) achieving high accuracy in stability prediction when jointly modeling (half-masked ESMFold pLDDT+ ESM2 Pseudo-likelihood).

Nonlinear Hawkes process models can capture a large range of spiking dynamics, but remain difficult to interpret, due to their discontinuous and stochastic nature. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework based on a piecewise deterministic Markov process representation of the nonlinear Hawkes process (NH-PDMP) followed by a diffusion approximation. We analytically derive stability conditions and dynamical properties of the obtained diffusion processes for single-neuron and network models. We established the accuracy of the diffusion approximation framework by comparing it with exact continuous-time simulations of the original neuronal NH-PDMP models. Our framework offers an analytical and geometric account of the neuronal dynamics repertoire captured by nonlinear Hawkes process models, both for the canonical responses of single-neurons and neuronal-network dynamics, such as winner-take-all and traveling wave phenomena. Applied to human and nonhuman primate recordings of neuronal spiking activity during speech processing and motor tasks, respectively, our approach revealed that task features can be retrieved from the dynamical landscape of the fitted models. The combination of NH-PDMP representations and diffusion approximations thus provides a novel dynamical analysis framework to reveal single-neuron and neuronal-population dynamics directly from models fitted to spiking data.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) isolate genes and their regulatory elements within the same topological neighborhood, avoiding crosstalk between regulatory elements. Perturbation of domain boundaries causes aberrant genomic contacts and gene expression misregulation. Architectural proteins such as CTCF and the cohesin complex are critical to form boundaries. However, we still lack a complete understanding of what makes a boundary more effective at insulating genomic contacts than others. To understand how domains are structured, we experimentally classified boundaries according to their chromatin accessibility as a proxy of protein occupancy in K562 human cells. We found that highly accessible boundaries are occupied by more proteins, are more robust contact insulators, have a more conserved CTCF DNA-binding motif and are more conserved across cell types in contrast to less accessible ones. By exploring the proteins enriched at boundaries with different accessibility, we found that CTCF and cohesin, together with REST, form a module, and ZFN316, together with EMSY, form another module, and both modules occupy boundaries very frequently. Finally, by using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genetic edition of ZNF316 DNA-binding motif at a robust domain boundary, we demonstrate that ZNF316 can block chromatin contacts in the absence of CTCF. Our results emphasize the importance of protein combination and abundance to support boundary strength and propose ZNF316 as a novel architectural protein.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

Here, we profiled the 3D enhancer-promoter networks of primary patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) in comparison with neuronal stem cells (NSCs) to identify potential central nodes and vulnerabilities in the regulatory logic of this devastating cancer. Specifically, we focused on hyperconnected 3D regulatory hubs and demonstrated that hub-interacting genes exhibit high and coordinated expression at the single-cell level and strong association with oncogenic programs that distinguish IDH-wt glioblastoma patients from low-grade glioma. Epigenetic silencing of a recurrent 3D enhancer hub--with an uncharacterized role in glioblastoma--was sufficient to cause concordant downregulation of multiple hub-connected genes along with significant shifts in transcriptional states and reduced clonogenicity. By integrating published datasets from other cancer types, we also identified both universal and cancer type-specific 3D regulatory hubs which enrich for varying oncogenic programs and nominate specific factors associated with worse outcomes. Genetic alterations, such as focal duplications, could explain only a small fraction of the detected hyperconnected hubs and their increased activity. Overall, our study provides computational and experimental support for the potential central role of 3D regulatory hubs in controlling oncogenic programs and properties.

HIGHLIGHTS- 3D regulatory ""hubs"" in glioblastoma enrich for highly coregulated genes at a single-cell level and expand oncogenic regulatory networks.
- Targeted perturbation of a highly recurrent 3D regulatory hub in GSCs results in altered transcriptional states and cellular properties.
- 3D regulatory hubs across cancer types associate with tumor-specific and universal oncogenic programs and worse outcomes.
- The majority of hyperconnected hubs do not overlap with structural variants, suggesting epigenetic mechanisms.

We present data obtained with nominal isotropic resolutions ranging from 0.65 to 0.35 mm for partial brain coverage for stimulus evoked responses, and 0.75 mm for whole brain coverage to capture the spontaneous fluctuations that are the source of functional connectivity measures. The increasingly higher nominal resolutions (i.e. smaller voxel volumes and dimensions) employed in image acquisition were shown to correspond to real gains in resolution using image reconstruction methods developed to minimize blurring. Existence of supralinear gains in stimulus-evoked percent signal change and major improvements in statistical significance were evident relative to 7 Tesla, the most advanced commercially available ultrahigh magnetic field platform currently employed in human brain studies. These results were feasible due to gains in intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio, BOLD contrast, and image acceleration provided by the uniquely high magnetic field of 10.5 Tesla, and the use of novel high channel count arrays to capture these gains.

Although these methods are conceptually similar, we show by analyzing association studies of 209 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank that they systematically prioritize different genes. This raises the question of how genes should ideally be prioritized. We propose two prioritization criteria: 1) trait importance -- how much a gene quantitatively affects a trait; and 2) trait specificity -- a genes importance for the trait under study relative to its importance across all traits. We find that GWAS prioritize genes near trait-specific variants, while burden tests prioritize trait-specific genes. Because non-coding variants can be context specific, GWAS can prioritize highly pleiotropic genes, while burden tests generally cannot. Both study designs are also affected by distinct trait-irrelevant factors, complicating their interpretation. Our results illustrate that burden tests and GWAS reveal different aspects of trait biology and suggest ways to improve their interpretation and usage.","NA","biorxiv",1735337356182

We used individual-level data on disease timing and nightly room assignments in these prisons to reconstruct locations and pathways of transmission statistically, and from that estimated reproduction numbers, locations of unobserved infection events, and the subsequent magnitude and distribution of long COVID prevalence. Where earlier work has recommended smaller cells over large dormitory housing to reduce transmission, recommended use of cells with solid doors over those with bars only, and cautioned against reliance on solid doors (e.g., in cold months when HVAC systems can circulate aerosols), we found evidence of substantial transmission in both dorms and cells regardless of the door and season. Effective reproduction numbers were found to range largely between 0 and 5, in both cells and dorms of all door types. Our estimates of excess case rates suggest that as a result of disparities in incarceration, prison outbreaks contributed to disproportionate disease burden on Black and Indigenous people in California. We estimated that 9,100-11,000 people have developed long COVID as a result of infection in these prison outbreaks, 1,700-2,000 of them with disabling consequences, and that this burden is disproportionately on Black and Indigenous people in comparison to the state as a whole.

Mormon Fritillary butterflies (Speyeria mormonia) exhibit a striking wing color polymorphism throughout their range: typical morphs bear silver spots on their ventral surfaces, and can co-occur with unsilvered morphs displaying a dull coloration1. Through genome-wide association studies in two polymorphic populations, we fine-map this difference in silvering to the 3 region of the transcription factor gene optix. The expression of optix is confined to the unsilvered regions that surround the spots, and these patterns are transformed to a silver identity upon optix RNAi knockdown, implicating optix as a repressor of silver scales in this butterfly. We show that the unsilvered optix haplotype shows signatures of recent selective sweeps, and that this allele is shared with the monomorphic, unsilvered species Speyeria hydaspe, suggesting that introgressions facilitate the exchange of variants of adaptive potential across species. Remarkably, these findings parallel the role of introgressions and cis-regulatory modulation of optix in shaping the aposematic red patterns of Heliconius butterflies2-7, a lineage that separated from Speyeria 45 million years ago8. The genetic basis of adaptive variation can thus be more predictable than often presumed, even for traits that appear divergent across large evolutionary distances.
