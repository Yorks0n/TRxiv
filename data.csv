Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

This review summarises reported contact-tracing data and evaluates the secondary attack rates (SAR) and factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission in aircraft, to provide insight for future decision making in the context of future respiratory pandemics. Methods: This scoping literature review assessed studies published between December 2020 to November 2023 in Ovid Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. The inclusion criteria were based on the PCC framework (P-Population, C-Concept, C-Context). The study population was restricted to passengers and crew (population) to assess transmission (concept) in an aircraft setting (context). Results: Thirty-one studies which assess SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 521 domestic and international flights were included in this systematic review. The SAR reported in the studies with an identified index case ranged from 0% to 16%. Significant variation in the reporting across studies was noted. Overall, the studies reported that using face masks or respirators by passengers and crew members during flight seemed to be a possible strategy for mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission while sitting within close proximity to index cases ([&le;]2 seats in every direction) was associated with a higher SAR. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with sporadic clusters happening onboard aircraft. Close proximity to COVID-19 cases within the aircraft was associated with a higher SAR. Our findings further underscore the need for a systematic approach to examining and reporting SARS-CoV-2 transmission onboard aircraft. This evidence may assist policymakers and transportation authorities in the development of emergency preparedness measures and travel guidance during the post-pandemic COVID-19 era.","NA","medrxiv",1729721372690

Accurate estimates of COVID-19 infections based on finalized data can improve understanding of the pandemic and provide more meaningful quantification of disease patterns and burden. Therefore, we retrospectively estimate daily incident infections for each U.S. state prior to Omicron. To this end, reported COVID-19 cases are deconvolved to their date of infection onset using delay distributions estimated from the CDC line list. Then, a novel serology-driven model is used to scale these deconvolved cases to account for the unreported infections. The resulting infections incorporate variant-specific incubation periods, reinfections, and waning antigenic immunity. They clearly demonstrate that the reported cases fail to reflect the full extent of disease burden in all states. Most notably, infections were severely underreported during the Delta wave, with an estimated reporting rate as low as 6.3% in New Jersey, 7.3% in Maryland, and 8.4% in Nevada. Moreover, in 44 states, fewer than 1/3 of infections appear as cases reports. Therefore, while reported cases offer a convenient proxy of disease burden, they fail to capture the full extent of infections, and can severely underestimate the true disease burden. This retrospective analysis also estimates other important quantities for every state, including variant-specific deconvolved cases, time-varying case ascertainment ratios, and infection-hospitalization ratios.","NA","medrxiv",1729721372690

Fiscal levers are used in several countries to combat the rise in obesity and diet-related diseases. This study aims to investigate public attitudes, knowledge, and policy preferences regarding food taxes for promoting healthy eating in the UK.

MethodsA survey was administered through YouGov Plc to a nationally representative sample of 2,125 adults, gathering information on: acceptability and support for different types of food taxes, awareness and knowledge of existing taxes, and preferences for the characteristics of possible new taxes.

ResultsOverall, 48% of respondents support higher taxes on unhealthy foods, rising to 72% if taxes made healthy foods more affordable. Respondents with high socio-economic status and those living in London showed the highest support. Respondents had limited awareness of existing food and beverage taxes, and prioritised discretionary items such as cakes and crisps for possible increased taxation.

ConclusionsThe survey shows a high level of support for taxing unhealthy foods, as well as concern for the affordability of healthy foods. A carefully designed holistic approach to food taxation can be part of a wider public health strategy and can be favourably met by the general population in the UK.","NA","medrxiv",1729721372690

Tau pathology spreads cell-to-cell2 but the exact mechanisms of tau release and intercellular transmission remain poorly defined. Tau is released from neurons as free protein or in extracellular vesicles (EVs)3-5 but the role of these different release mechanisms in intercellular tau transmission is unclear. Here, we show that the neuronal gene Arc is critical for packaging tau into EVs. Brain EVs purified from human tau (hTau) transgenic rTg4510 mice (rTgWT) contain high levels of hTau that are capable of seeding tau pathology. In contrast, EVs purified from rTgWT crossed with Arc knock-out mice (rTgArc KO) have significantly less hTau and cannot seed tau aggregation. Arc facilitates the release of hTau in EVs produced via the I-BAR protein IRSp53, but not free tau. Arc protein directly binds hTau to form a fuzzy complex that we identified in both mouse and human brain tissue. We find that pathological intracellular hTau accumulates in neurons in rTgArc KO mice, which correlates with accelerated neuron loss in the hippocampus. Finally, we find that intercellular tau transmission is significantly abrogated in Arc KO mice. We conclude that Arc-dependent release of tau in EVs plays a significant role in intracellular tau elimination and intercellular tau transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

We defined functional modules by clustering genes based on their phenotypic signatures. In-depth studies leveraged these data in two ways. First, we defined and investigated new components of key signaling pathways, which revealed animal-like pathways/components not predicted from studies of model yeasts. Second, we identified environmental adaptation mechanisms repurposed to promote mammalian virulence by C. neoformans, which lacks a known animal reservoir.

Still, the mechanisms for these headache types are unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess levels of amyloid related biomarkers in patients with persistent headache after COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Methods: In this prospective observational cohort, patients with severe headache as the dominating symptom after COVID-19 disease (n=29) and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (n=31), had neurological assessments with reassessments after 6 months. Plasma levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), pregnancy zone protein (PZP), cathepsin L1 (CTSL) and serum Amyloid A (SAA1) were measured by ELISA in relation to levels in healthy controls (n=16). Results: We found a strong and persistent upregulation of APP in patients with headache after COVID-19 as compared to the two other groups. At both inclusion and after 6 months APP levels were also increased in those with accompanying cognitive symptoms. In contrast, plasma levels of PZP were elevated in both headache groups as compared to healthy controls at inclusion and after 6 months follow-up, but with no relation to cognitive symptoms. CTSL was only elevated in those with COVID-19 associated headache at baseline, whereas SAA1 showed levels comparable in all groups. Conclusion: Altered plasma levels of soluble markers potentially reflecting changes in amyloid processing was found in patients with persistent headache after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and particular in those with persistent headache after COVID-19 disease where we also found some association with cognitive symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1729721372690

Here, we bridge this gap by linking genome to proteome in 800 meiotic progeny from an intercross between two closely related Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates adapted to distinct niches. Modest genetic distance between the parents generated remarkable proteomic diversity that was amplified in the progeny and captured by 6,476 genotype-protein associations, over 1,600 of which we resolved to single variants. Proteomic adaptation emerged through the combined action of numerous cis- and trans-regulatory mutations, a regulatory architecture that was conserved across the species. Notably, trans-regulatory variants often arose in proteins not traditionally associated with gene regulation, such as enzymes. Moreover, the proteomic consequences of mutations predicted fitness under various stresses. Our study demonstrates that the collective action of natural genetic variants drives dramatic proteome diversification, with molecular consequences that forecast phenotypic outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

However, the role of glial mitochondria in proper brain development is not well understood. We show that astrocyte mitochondria undergo extensive fission while populating astrocyte distal branches during postnatal cortical development. Loss of mitochondrial fission regulator, Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), decreases mitochondrial localization to distal astrocyte processes, and this mitochondrial mislocalization reduces astrocyte morphological complexity. Functionally, astrocyte-specific conditional deletion of Drp1 induces astrocyte reactivity and disrupts astrocyte organization in the cortex. These morphological and organizational deficits are accompanied by loss of astrocytic gap junction protein Connexin 43. These findings uncover a crucial role for mitochondrial fission in coordinating astrocytic morphogenesis and organization, revealing the regulation of astrocytic mitochondria dynamics as a critical step in neurodevelopment.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

We have previously documented such a tradition, in which chimpanzees copied inserting blades of grass in their ears from one persistent inventor4. Now, over a decade later, we have observed an unrelated group of chimpanzees where 5/8 individuals began wearing grass in their ears and 6/8 from their rectums. As of 2024, one newly introduced chimpanzee has adopted the grass-in-ear behavior.

Our understanding of their function is informed by the study of ciliopathies, hereditary diseases linked to cilia dysfunction. These disorders present a wide array of symptoms, highlighting the tissue-specific roles of cilia. However, cell-state and cell-type specific functions remain poorly understood due to limited tools for analyzing individual ciliary protein composition. Here, we utilize antibody-based spatial proteomics to expand the Human Protein Atlas with a dedicated section for primary cilia. We identify the subciliary locations of 654 proteins across three cell lines, analyzing 218,412 individual cilia. Our findings reveal that 67% of the ciliary proteins are cell-type specific and that 78% of ciliary proteins show heterogeneous localization patterns within cell populations, suggesting that the functional tuning of individual cilia is substantially driven by protein trafficking rather than gene expression. Our atlas portrays the cilium as a dynamic sensory organelle, suggesting that individual cells can fine-tune their ciliary structure - both in terms of receptors and signaling components - to sense and integrate diverse signals, computing a response to relay to the cell body. We identify 71 novel cilia proteins, establish CFAP300 as a specific and broad marker for cilia, and suggest multiple potential ciliopathy genes including CREB3, where we show that a coding genetic variant can be linked to blindness and skeletal abnormalities. In summary, our spatially resolved cilia atlas paves new avenues for basic and clinical research on cilia and ciliopathies.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Here, we present a genome-wide association study for 249 circulating metabolite traits quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy across various genetic ancestry groups from the Estonian Biobank and the UK Biobank. We generated mixed model associations in the Estonian Biobank and six major genetic ancestry groups of the UK Biobank and performed two separate meta-analyses across the predominantly European genetic ancestry samples (n = 599,249) and across all samples (n = 619,372). In total, we identified 89,489 locus-metabolite pairs and 8,917 independent lead variants, out of which 4,184 appear to be novel associated loci. Moreover, 12.4% of the independent lead variants had a minor allele frequency of less than 1%, highlighting the importance of including low-frequency and rare variants in metabolic biomarker studies. Our publicly available results provide a valuable resource for future GWAS interpretation and drug target prioritisation studies.","NA","medrxiv",1729721372690

However, there is a lack of reliable large-scale predictive frameworks to quantify how much genetic diversity has already been lost, let alone to quantitatively predict future losses under different conservation scenarios in the 21st century. Combining spatio-temporal population genetic theory with population genomic data of 18 plant and animal species, we studied the dynamics of genetic diversity after habitat area losses. We show genetic diversity reacts slowly to habitat area and population declines, but lagged losses will continue for many decades even after habitats are fully protected. To understand the magnitude of this problem, we combined our predictive method with species' habitat area and population monitoring reported in the Living Planet Index, the Red List, and new GBF indicators. We then project genetic diversity loss in 13,808 species with a short-term genetic diversity loss of 13-22% and long-term loss of 42-48% with substantial deviations depending on the level of habitat fragmentation. These results highlight that protection of only current habitats is insufficient to ensure the genetic health of species and that continuous genetic monitoring alone likely underestimates long term impacts. We provide an area-based spatio-temporal predictive framework to develop quantitative scenarios of global genetic biodiversity.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

In this study, we used SARS-CoV-2 as a model system to explore whether the intrahost diversity of viral infections could provide clues on the relative fitness of single amino acid variants (SAVs). To do so, we analysed [~]15 million complete genomes and nearly [~]8000 sequencing libraries generated from SARS-CoV-2 infections, which were collected at various timepoints during the COVID-19 pandemic. Across timepoints, we found that many successful SAVs were detected in the intrahost diversity of samples collected prior, with a median of 6-40 months between the initial collection dates of samples and the highest frequency seen for these SAVs. Additionally, we found that the co-occurrence of intrahost SAVs significantly captures genetic linkage patterns observed at the interhost level (Pearsons r=0.28-0.45, all p<0.0001). Further, we show that machine learning models can learn highly generalisable intrahost, physiochemical and phenotypic patterns to forecast the future fitness of intrahost SAVs (r2=0.48-0.63). Most of these models performed significantly better when considering genetic linkage (r2=0.53-0.68).

This is exemplified by the telomere biology disorders (TBDs), which exhibit tremendous clinical heterogeneity despite their presumed monogenic nature, even among individuals harboring the same pathogenic variant. Here, we studied cohorts of patients with TBDs and population biobanks to demonstrate that common genome-wide polymorphisms associated with variation in telomere length in the general population combine with large-effect causal variants to significantly impact TBD expressivity. We go on to show that polygenic variation can contribute to expressivity within a single family with a shared large-effect causal variant, and that common and rare variation converge on a shared set of genes implicated in telomere maintenance. By elucidating the role of common genetic variation in rare disease expressivity in TBDs, these results provide a framework for understanding phenotypic variability in other presumed monogenic disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1729721372690

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a potential treatment, but outcomes vary, possibly due to differences in patient characteristics, electrode placement, or stimulation of specific brain networks. We studied 40 patients with DoC who underwent DBS targeting the thalamic centromedian-parafascicular complex. Better-preserved gray matter, especially in the striatum, correlated with consciousness improvement.

Stimulation was most effective when electric fields extended into parafascicular and subparafascicular nuclei--ventral to the centromedian nucleus, near the midbrain-- and when it engaged projection pathways of the ascending arousal network, including the hypothalamus, brainstem, and frontal lobe. Moreover, effective DBS sites were connected to networks similar to those underlying impaired consciousness due to generalized absence seizures and acquired lesions. These findings support the therapeutic potential of DBS for DoC, emphasizing the importance of precise targeting and revealing a broader link between effective DoC treatment and mechanisms underlying other conscciousness-impairing conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1729721372690

Capturing this structure remains a significant scientific challenge. Using information theory, we apply Dynamical Independence (DI) to uncover the emergent dynamical structure in a minimal 5-node biophysical neural model, shaped by the interplay of two key aspects of brain organisation: integration and segregation. In our study, functional integration within the biophysical neural model is modulated by a global coupling parameter, while functional segregation is influenced by adding dynamical noise, which counteracts global coupling. DI defines a dimensionally-reduced macroscopic variable (e.g., a coarse-graining) as emergent to the extent that it behaves as an independent dynamical process, distinct from the micro-level dynamics. We measure dynamical dependence (a departure from dynamical independence) for macroscopic variables across spatial scales. Our results indicate that the degree of emergence of macroscopic variables is relatively minimised at balanced points of integration and segregation and maximised at the extremes. Additionally, our method identifies to which degree the macroscopic dynamics are localised across microlevel nodes, thereby elucidating the emergent dynamical structure through the relationship between microscopic and macroscopic processes. We find that deviation from a balanced point between integration and segregation results in a less localised, more distributed emergent dynamical structure as identified by DI. This finding suggests that a balance of functional integration and segregation is associated with lower levels of emergence (higher dynamical dependence), which may be crucial for sustaining coherent, localised emergent macroscopic dynamical structures. This work also provides a complete computational implementation for the identification of emergent neural dynamics that could be applied both in silico and in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Chromatin in the cell varies greatly, from euchromatin to heterochromatin, in its genome functions. It is important to understand how heterochromatin is physically different from euchromatin. However, their specific labeling methods in living cells are limited. To address this, we have developed replication-dependent histone labeling (Repli-Histo labeling) to label nucleosomes in euchromatin and heterochromatin based on DNA replication timing. We investigated local nucleosome motion in the four chromatin classes from euchromatin to heterochromatin of living human and mouse cells. We found that more euchromatic regions (earlier replicated regions) show greater nucleosome motion. Notably, the motion profile in each chromatin class persists throughout interphase. Genome chromatin is essentially replicated from regions with greater nucleosome motions, even though the replication timing program is perturbed. Our findings, combined with computational modeling, suggest that earlier replicated regions have more accessibility and local chromatin motion can be a major determinant of genome-wide replication timing.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Despite its popularity among recreational users and distinct pharmacodynamics, the neural correlates of 2C-B remain unexplored. Using 7T resting-state functional MRI in 22 healthy volunteers, we mapped out the acute effects of matched doses of 20 mg 2C-B, 15 mg psilocybin and placebo across spatiotemporal benchmarks of functional brain organisation. In a within-subjects, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, we evaluated the neuropharmacological and neurobehavioural correlates of an array of connectivity measures - including static (sFC) and global connectivity (gFC), dynamic connectivity variability (dFC), and spontaneous brain complexity. Compared to placebo, 2C-B and psilocybin selectively reduced intra-network sFC, while broadly increasing between-network and subcortical-cortical connectivity. Compared to psilocybin, 2C-B exhibited less pronounced reductions in between-network FC but elicited elevations in transmodal sFC. Both compounds yielded spatially divergent increases in gFC yet produced similar increases in brain complexity. Using PET density modelling, the spatial distribution of neural effects aligned with documented differences in monoaminergic transporter and serotonergic receptor binding affinity beyond 5-HT2A, highlighting the role of pharmacology in shaping functional dynamics. Lastly, we show behavioural markers of psychedelic effects are non-linearly reflected by the desynchronisation of the transmodal axis of functional brain organisation. Together, our findings highlight 2C-B as a useful new addition to the study of psychedelic neuroscience and may motivate new pharmacotherapy strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

PRMT5 is a type II protein arginine methyltransferase that regulates several tumorigenic events in many cancer types. However, the regulation of PRMT5 and its direct implication on aberrant alternative splicing under hypoxia remains unexplored. In this study, we observed hypoxia induced upregulation of PRMT5 via the CCCTC binding factor, CTCF. Further, PRMT5-mediated symmetric arginine dimethylation H4R3me2s and H3R8me2s directly regulated the alternative splicing of Transcription Factor 3 (TCF3). Under hypoxia, PRMT5-mediated histone dimethylation at the intronic conserved region (ICR) present between TCF3 exon 18a and exon 18b recruits DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), resulting in DNA methylation. DNA methylation at the TCF3-ICR is recognized and bound by Methyl CpG binding protein (MECP2) resulting in RNA-Pol II pausing, promoting the recruitment of the negative splicing factor PTBP1 to the splicing locus of TCF3 mRNA. PTBP1 promotes the exclusion of exon 18a which results in the production of the pro-invasive TCF3-18B (E47) isoform which promotes EMT and invasion of breast cancer cells under hypoxia. Collectively, our results indicate PRMT5-mediated symmetric arginine dimethylation of histones regulates alternative splicing of TCF3 gene thereby enhancing EMT and invasion in breast cancer hypoxia.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Here, we use long-read nanopore sequencing technology to develop a crossover mapping pipeline, COmapper, for high-resolution mapping of genome-wide crossovers from pooled DNA of F1 hybrid pollen and F2 recombinant seedlings derived from a cross between Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col and Ler. We validate the high accuracy of COmapper by applying nanopore long-read sequencing to pooled DNA of Arabidopsis F2 individuals with crossovers mapped by short-read sequencing. Using the COmapper, we constructed high-resolution genomic maps of crossovers using F1 hybrid pollen and F2 seedlings in wild type and crossover-elevated recq4a recq4b mutant, showing results comparable to short-read sequencing.

We report that the histone reader YEATS2 is responsible for increased invasive potential in head and neck cancer in an SP1-dependent manner. YEATS2 functions by maintaining histone crotonylation, and its abrogation leads to a global decrease in the H3K27Cr mark. Mechanistically, we report that YEATS2 maintains high H3K27Cr levels at the promoter of the EMT-promoting gene SPARC. Further, we found that the addition of the H3K27Cr mark is also dependent on the crotonyl-CoA-producing enzyme GCDH.

Rates of OA publications continue to grow, including for research carried out by pharmaceutical companies. To help drive more openness in the pharmaceutical industry, we aimed to compare the OA publication rates of pharmaceutical companies with those of academic institutions.

MethodsWe assessed OA publication rates from the 40 largest pharmaceutical companies by earnings and 40 comparator academic institutions that publish the largest number of medical research articles in their geographical region. Using the Lens, we built a live public dashboard that presents the OA publication rates for articles with authors affiliated to the pharmaceutical companies and comparator academic institutions of interest, detailed by OA model and licence, and by medical therapy area. We performed further analysis on data downloaded from the dashboard.

ResultsIn our primary analysis of articles 12-24 months since publication date, 76.6% of pharmaceutical company (pharma) and 69.5% of academic institution (academia) publications were OA. The most common OA models were gold (pharma, 37%; academia, 41%) and hybrid (pharma, 22%; academia, 11%). Oncology had lower rates of OA publications than other therapy areas. Growth in the OA publication rate was generally more rapid for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions, regardless of field.

ConclusionsThe OA publication rate was higher for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions and continues to increase. With the pharmaceutical industry focused on encouraging authors to publish OA and increasingly aware of the different types of OA licences, we expect and welcome further changes. Our new report provides data on pharmaceutical company and academic institution publications that are updated every 2 weeks. We encourage others to use this open resource and report their results.

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSOpen access (OA) publication rates for pharmaceutical companies have been steadily growing. However, previous methods for analysing pharmaceutical company OA publication rates have not been conducive to automation and have not facilitated easy comparison between pharmaceutical companies and other research-intensive environments, such as academic institutions.

What this study addsWe built an online dashboard that presents continually and automatically updated OA publication rates for articles with authors affiliated to several large pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. We found that the OA publication rate was higher for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions and that growth in OA publications was generally more rapid for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyOur dashboard allows ongoing monitoring, and we encourage the use of this free tool to capture evolving OA publishing behaviours and the disclosure of these results to help drive greater adoption of OA publishing practices.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIAs expected with large-scale bibliometrics sampling, there are various points at which error and/or information loss may have entered this analysis, for example, during the parsing of author affiliations or categorisation of topics and article types.
C_LIO_LIThe comparator set (a globally representative group of research-intensive academic institutions) may not represent academic institutions in general because it includes only the largest academic institutions (in terms of publication counts) from each global region.
C_LIO_LIThere is overlap between the pharmaceutical company and academic institution analysis sets because first, pharmaceutical company publications often include academic authors, and second, academic institution publications may include pharmaceutical company authors.

Plain Language SummaryBiotechnology and pharmaceutical companies develop and deliver most of the worlds new medicines. To ensure important information about these medicines is shared transparently with audiences across the world, more and more often, pharmaceutical companies are choosing to publish their research open access. Open access publishing allows anyone to read and, in some cases, reuse the contents of research publications for free. In medical journals, an increasing proportion of articles are published open access every year. However, at the moment, we dont understand how the open access publication rates of medical publications from pharmaceutical companies compare with those of medical publications from academic institutions. Understanding this could help the scientific community assess how open access publication practices are changing over time.

We made an online platform that provides a free, live report of the open access publication rates for pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. We found that 77% of pharmaceutical company research publications and 70% of academic institution research publications were published open access. Open access publication rates increased each year for both pharmaceutical company and academic institution research publications, but the rates were increasing faster for pharmaceutical companies.

Our results are similar to those from other studies of open access publication rates. We encourage users to explore our free online live report and share their results publicly.

These findings point to widespread associations between bullying victimization and brain development, offering a potential neurobiological framework to explain the emotional and behavioral difficulties observed. Importantly, this study emphasizes the need for a sex-sensitive approach in future research and interventions related to bullying.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Since then, 6 eligible RCTs have completed, including one large trial (n=15,804).

MethodsUpdated systematic review and meta-analysis of data from RCTs of vitamin D for ARI prevention using a random effects model. Sub-group analyses were done to determine whether effects of vitamin D on risk of ARI varied according to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration, dosing regimen or age. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched between May 2020 (previous search) and April 2024. No language restrictions were imposed. Double-blind RCTs supplementing vitamin D for any duration, with placebo or low-dose vitamin D control, were eligible if approved by Research Ethics Committee and if ARI incidence was collected prospectively and pre-specified as an efficacy outcome. Aggregate data, stratified by baseline 25(OH)D concentration and age, were obtained from study authors. The study was registered with PROSPERO (no. CRD42024527191).

FindingsWe identified 6 new RCTs (19,337 participants). Data were obtained for 16,086 (83.2%) participants in 3 new RCTs and combined with data from 48,488 participants in 43 previously identified RCTs. For the primary comparison of any vitamin D vs. placebo, the intervention did not significantly affect overall ARI risk (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00, P=0.057; 40 studies; I2 26.4%). Pre-specified subgroup analysis did not reveal evidence of effect modification by age, baseline vitamin D status, or dosing regimen. Vitamin D did not influence the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.04; 38 studies; I2 0.0%). A funnel plot showed left-sided asymmetry (P=0.002, Eggers test).

InterpretationThis updated meta-analysis yielded a similar point estimate for the overall effect of vitamin D supplementation on ARI risk to that obtained previously, but the 95% CI for this effect estimate now spans 1.00, indicating no statistically significant protection.

Our previous meta-analysis of 43 randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation for prevention of acute respiratory infections (ARI) conducted in 2021 revealed a statistically significant protective effect of the intervention (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99). A further 6 eligible RCTs, contributing data from 19,337 participants have now completed, including one large trial (n=15,804).

Added value of this studyOur meta-analysis of aggregate data from 64,086 participants in 46 randomised controlled trials, stratified by baseline 25(OH)D concentration and age, provides an updated estimate of the protective effects of vitamin D against acute respiratory infection overall (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00), and in sub-groups defined by baseline vitamin D status, age, and dosing frequency, amount and duration.

Implications of all the available evidenceUpdated meta-analysis including the latest available RCT data shows no statistically significant protective effect of vitamin D supplementation against ARI, either overall or in sub-group analyses.","NA","medrxiv",1729721372690

However, conventional MALDI-MSI platforms are typically limited to spatial resolutions of 5-20 m, restricting their ability to visualize fine subcellular structures. Here, we present a novel ten-fold expansion MALDI-MSI (10X ExMSI) method that attains 500 nm spatial resolution without the need for specialized optics or customized instrumentation. By physically expanding biological samples using a swellable hydrogel matrix, our method maintains high retention and broadens the detection range of lipids, ensuring comprehensive lipid profiling. We demonstrated the effectiveness of 10X ExMSI by visualizing intricate subcellular structures within mouse brain tissues, including individual nuclei, astrocytes, Purkinje cells, and, notably, dendritic arborizations-features previously unresolvable using mass spectrometry imaging. Applying 10X ExMSI to single-cell analysis of cultured cells revealed detailed spatial distributions of lipids at the subcellular to organelle level. Notably, the method is fully compatible with standard commercial MALDI-MSI platforms, enabling widespread adoption without significant additional investment. The 10X ExMSI offers a transformative tool for high-resolution molecular imaging, opening new avenues for molecular analysis in diverse biological and biomedical fields, including neuroscience, pathology, and cellular biology.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Yet, despite its essential role, the technology remains bound by the inherent limitations of quadrupole filters, which throw away up to 99% of the useful ion signal and caps the speed at which fragmentation data can be generated. These deficiencies often force compromises in data depth and accuracy, hindering breakthroughs that tie genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics together. A new technology is poised to break through these performance barriers, unlocking unprecedented capabilities in precision, sensitivity and throughput. This step-change in how mass spectrometry fragmentation analysis is performed will reshape the future of scientific discovery, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. The solution is high resolution ion mobility (HRIM), which offers a means to quickly and efficiently isolate ions prior to fragmentation and detection by a high resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) while also resolving challenging isomeric and isobaric compounds that lead to chimeric MS/MS spectra. HRIM isolates ions in time as a result of a high speed separation rather than acting as a filter that discards ion signal like the pervasive quadrupole mass analyzer, allowing higher sensitivity analysis to be achieved. Also, since HRIM eliminates the need to hop or sweep electronics control parameters, as is the case with a quadrupole, fragmentation spectral generation can occur at a much faster rate, upwards of 500 Hz. This whitepaper describes an IM/MS methodology first contemplated over twenty years ago and today being positioned as the fastest method for high resolution fragmentation analysis. Revisiting this concept using the latest generation ion mobility technology based on structures for lossless ion manipulation (SLIM), which is the only HRIM technology that delivers similar resolution and range of analysis as a quadrupole, realizes the full potential of this approach to deliver benefits in both speed and sensitivity for high performance MS/MS measurements. This new way of achieving ion fragmentation in complex samples is set to revolutionize the mass spectrometry space, starting in the growing field of proteomics where all researchers are seeking faster methods to achieve more comprehensive proteomic coverage. Due to the advantages of HRIM physics, we predict this will set the bar for high throughput -omics within the coming years and will eventually be as ubiquitous as the quadrupole is today.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Accordingly, studies of perceptual decision-making have historically relied on tasks with fixed choice-response mappings, in which choice and motor response are inextricably linked. Although several studies have since dissociated choice and response, they have typically involved dynamic switching of the choice-response mapping on a trial-by-trial basis. Thus, it remains unclear if abstract choice representations arise specifically when choice-response relationships change dynamically, or if they reflect a more general property of the decision-making process. Here, we show that in the human brain, choices are represented abstractly, even when the association between choice and motor response remains stable over time. We measured neural activity in humans using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while participants performed a motion discrimination task. Importantly, the associations between perceptual choice and motor response were balanced across experimental conditions and remained stable over many trials. We found neural information about the participants perceptual choice, independent of both the motor response and the visual stimulus. This abstract choice information increased during the stimulus period and peaked after the response had been made. Furthermore, choice and response information showed distinct cortical distributions, with strongest choice information in frontoparietal regions. Our results suggest that abstract choice representations are not restricted to action-independent contexts or those with dynamic choice-response associations and may therefore reflect a general role in perceptual decision-making.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

We hypothesized that these two phenomena, known as gaze reinstatement and neural reactivation, are linked through a common process that underlies the reinstatement of past experiences during memory retrieval. Here, we tested this proposal based on the viewing and recall of a narrative movie, which we assessed through fMRI, deep learning-based gaze prediction, and language modeling of spoken recall. In line with key predictions, gaze behavior adhered to the same principles as neural activity; it was event-specific, robust across individuals, and generalized across viewing and recall. Additionally, gaze-dependent brain activity overlapped substantially across tasks. Collectively, these results suggest that retrieval engages mechanisms that direct our eyes during natural vision, reflecting common constraints within the functional organization of the nervous system. Moreover, they highlight the importance of considering behavioral and neural reinstatement together in our understanding of remembering.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

We made use of two maize lines, which differ in their ability to exude benzoxazinoids, to condition two contrasting soil microbiomes in the same starting soil. Based on these conditioned soils we have established a model system with Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) to investigate the mechanisms of microbiome feedbacks. Arabidopsis plants grown on the benzoxazinoids conditioned soil developed larger rosettes, for which the soil microbiome was required. Arabidopsis roots also harbored differential bacterial communities. Further, these plants showed enhanced defense signatures in their shoot and were more resistant to the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. We could establish Arabidopsis as a model to study benzoxazinoid-mediated microbiome feedbacks, which will allow future studies to investigate underlying mechanisms. Arabidopsis also responded with both improved growth and enhanced resistance to a complex benzoxazinoids conditioned microbiome, and we hypothesize that this simultaneous increase of growth and defense is mediated by priming of defenses.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Patients with MCT8 mutations suffer from a severe neurodevelopmental and metabolic disorder, however, the molecular mechanism underlying thyroid hormone transport is unknown. Using cryogenic-sample electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined the ligand-free and thyroxine-bound human MCT8 structures in the outward-open state and the thyroxine-bound human MCT10 in the inward-facing state. Our structural analysis revealed a network of conserved gate residues involved in conformational changes upon thyroxine binding, triggering ligand release on the opposite compartment. We then determined the structure of a folded, but inactive patient-derived MCT8 mutant, indicating a subtle conformational change which explains its reduced transport activity. In addition, we determined the structure of MCT8 bound to its inhibitor silychristin, revealing an interaction with residues essential to drive transition to the inward-facing state, thereby locking the protein in the outward-facing state.

A prime example is organ regeneration, whereby despite intrinsically stochastic damage, organs are rebuilt via controlled cellular proliferation. Here, we use a mathematical approach to understand how a cell decides to re-enter and exit mitosis during organ repair. Using empirical data from regenerating neuromasts in larval zebrafish, we identify a minimal model based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Remarkably, the ODEs model reproduces the regeneration kinetics by assuming a cell-proliferation switch that depends on the type and the number of the neuromast cells. Additionally, a two-dimensional Cellular Potts Model (CPM) predicts that cell proliferation is a delayed response to injury. The CPM recapitulates the experimental results qualitatively and quantitatively, showing that cell proliferation is locally controlled by a switch, where each cell division stops when the type-dependent number of neighbouring cells exceeds a deterministic critical value. An intriguing corollary of our results is that a local negative feedback loop among identical cells may be a general property of organ-level proportional homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

While some of these colonization genes were shared between the two host plant species, most were highly specific, benefiting the colonization of a single host and organ. We characterized an efflux pump that specifically contributes to Arabidopsis shoot colonization. This efflux pump is prevalent across Pseudomonadota genomes, yet benefits the bacterial association with only a small subset of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Leveraging genomic diversity within Arabidopsis thaliana, we confirmed that specific glucosinolate breakdown products are detoxified by this family of efflux pumps. The broad prevalence of this efflux pump family suggests that its members contribute to protection of commensal bacteria from collateral damage of plant glucosinolate-based defense responses to herbivores and necrotrophic pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

However, the reconstitution of mtDNA deletions responsible for severe mitochondrial myopathies and age-related diseases has not yet been achieved in human cells. Here, we developed a method to engineer specific mtDNA deletions in human cells by co-expressing end-joining (EJ) machinery and targeted endonucleases. As a proof-of-concept, we used mito-EJ and mito-ScaI to generate a panel of clonal cell lines harboring a [~]3.5 kb mtDNA deletion with the full spectrum of heteroplasmy. Investigating these isogenic cells revealed a critical threshold of [~]75% deleted genomes, beyond which cells exhibited depletion of OXPHOS proteins, severe metabolic disruption, and impaired growth in galactose-containing media. Single-cell multiomic analysis revealed two distinct patterns of nuclear gene deregulation in response to mtDNA deletion accumulation; one triggered at the deletion threshold and another progressively responding to increasing heteroplasmy. In summary, the co-expression of mito-EJ and programable nucleases provides a powerful tool to model disease-associated mtDNA deletions in different cell types. Establishing a panel of cell lines with a large-scale deletion at varying levels of heteroplasmy is a valuable resource for understanding the impact of mtDNA deletions on diseases and guiding the development of potential therapeutic strategies.

In mice, NK cells can kill T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, decreasing somatic hypermutation and vaccine responses. Although human NK cell activation correlates with poor vaccine response, the mechanisms of human NK cell regulation of adaptive immunity are poorly understood. We found that in human ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection, broad neutralizers, who were capable of neutralizing Alpha, Beta, and Delta, had fewer NK cells that expressed inhibitory and immaturity markers whereas NK cells from narrow neutralizers were highly activated and expressed interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISG-mediated activation in NK cells from healthy donors increased cytotoxicity and functional responses to induced Tfh-like cells. This work reveals that NK cell activation and dysregulated inflammation may play a role in poor antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 and opens exciting avenues for designing improved vaccines and adjuvants to target emerging pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Our findings reveal that cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility and motif syntax are key determinants for TF binding. While Neurog2 binding primarily leads to chromatin opening, DNA demethylation and increased chromatin interactions, we also uncovered strong indirect, cell-type-specific effects, which ultimately result in vastly different epigenetic landscape. Furthermore, we identify shared and cell-type-specific Neurog2 interactors, including the SWI/SNF and NuRD complexes.

Notably, archaeal tissues undergo a coenocytic stage followed by a tubulin-independent cellularization, orchestrated by active membrane tension at a critical cell size. Past cellularization, tissues are organized into two cell types - apical and basal scutoids - with junction elasticity akin to animal tissues, with actin and protein glycosylation as fiducial polarity markers.

Sandhoff disease (SD) is an LSD caused by a deficiency in the {beta} subunit of the {beta}-hexosaminidase enzyme (Hexb). Although Hexb expression in the brain is specific to microglia, SD primarily affects neurons. To understand how a microglial gene is involved in maintaining neuronal homeostasis, we demonstrated that {beta}-hexosaminidase is secreted by microglia and integrated into the neuronal lysosomal compartment. To assess therapeutic relevance, we treated SD mice with bone marrow transplant and colony stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibition, which broadly replaced Hexb-/- microglia with Hexb-sufficient cells. This intervention reversed apoptotic gene signatures, improved behavior, restored enzymatic activity and Hexb expression, ameliorated substrate accumulation, and normalized neuronal lysosomal phenotypes. These results underscore the critical role of myeloid-derived {beta}-hexosaminidase in neuronal lysosomal function and establish microglial replacement as a potential LSD therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

The presence of interfaces can affect their aggregation mechanism, often speeding up aggregation. -Synuclein (Syn) can adsorb to biomolecular condensates, leading to heterogenous nucleation and faster aggregation. Understanding the mechanism underlying localization of amyloidogenic proteins at condensate interfaces is crucial for developing strategies to prevent or reverse their binding. We show that Syn localization to the surface of peptide-based heterotypic condensates is an adsorption process governed by the protein's condensate-amphiphilic nature. Adsorption occurs in multiple layers and levels off at micromolar concentrations. Based on these findings, we design three strategies to modulate Syn accumulation: (i) addition of biomolecules that decrease the condensate {zeta}-potential, such as NTPs and RNA, (ii) competitive adsorption of proteins targeting the condensate interface, such as G3BP1, DDX4-YFP, EGFP-NPM1, Hsp70, Hsc70, and (iii) preferential adsorption of Syn to membranes. Removing Syn from the condensate interface slows aggregation, highlighting potential cellular control over protein adsorption and implications for therapeutic strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Similar to AM symbiosis, multiple other intracellular symbiotic interactions have evolved in a variety of land plants. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis contrasts with these relationships as there is no intracellular accommodation of the symbiont inside the plant cell, but only intercellular colonization. This symbiotic relationship is common in a variety of seed plants, mostly trees and shrubs such as pines, willows and oaks. Although it is known which plant lineages are involved in ECM symbiosis, there has been little investigation into the evolutionary origin of ECM symbiosis in these lineages. Furthermore, the genetic innovations and transcriptomic response related to this symbiosis have been studied largely in a genus or species-specific context, which hinders the study of their evolutionary origins. In this study, we reconstruct the origin of ECM in the rosid clade, showing at least 16 independent origins, resulting in the 17 known extant ECM rosid lineages. Moreover, comparative genomics of these lineages highlight genes involved in cell wall remodeling which underwent duplications in a convergent manner across ectomycorrhizal lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Direct RNA nanopore sequencing offers a unique advantage by observing these modifications through characteristic alterations in ionic current signals. Various computational tools have been developed to detect RNA modifications, typically by comparing a sample of interest with a control lacking the target modification, often achieved through enzyme knockdown or knockout. We have developed a robust in vitro transcription protocol to generate a modification-free copy of any input RNA to detect all modifications that alter the raw ionic current signal relative to the canonical nucleotides during nanopore sequencing. We generated an in vitro transcribed sample from K562 cells and used Nanocompore to detect 26,619 modified RNA sites across 2,520 transcript isoforms from 1,742 genes. Of these, 56% are consistent with the well-characterized m6A modification. By inferring the identities of these modifications, we assessed differential usage and correlation patterns, revealing a significant co-occurrence between m6A and m5C modifications within the same transcripts. Additionally, some modifications were non-randomly associated with alternative splicing events. This study provides a comprehensive survey of RNA modifications across the transcriptome, demonstrating the utility of in vitro transcription coupled with direct RNA nanopore sequencing to simultaneously detect multiple modifications without the need for additional independent biochemical assays. The protocol is consistent in the future with more complex experimental designs, for example for differential modification usage between samples.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

We demonstrate this by predicting a role for 12 Arabidopsis thaliana RBPs in RNA stability and identifying rapid and recent evolution of post-transcriptional regulatory networks in worms and plants.

Until now, it has been widely accepted that the most distant relationships that can be detected are around fifteen degrees (approximately 8th cousins) and that practical relationship estimates have a ceiling around ten degrees (approximately 5th cousins). However, we show that these assumptions are incorrect and that they are due to a misapplication of relationship estimators. In particular, relationship estimators are applied almost exclusively to putative relatives who have been identified because they share detectable tracts of DNA identically by descent (IBD). However, no existing relationship estimator conditions on the event that two individuals share at least one detectable segment of IBD anywhere in the genome. As a result, the relationship estimates obtained using existing estimators are dramatically biased for distant relationships, inferring all sufficiently distant relationships to be around ten degrees regardless of the depth of the true relationship. Existing relationship estimators are derived under a model that assumes that each pair of related individuals shares a single common ancestor (or mating pair of ancestors). This model breaks down for relationships beyond 10 generations in the past because individuals share many thousands of cryptic common ancestors due to pedigree collapse. We first derive a corrected likelihood that conditions on the event that at least one segment is observed between a pair of putative relatives and we demonstrate that the corrected likelihood largely eliminates the bias in estimates of pairwise relationships and provides a more accurate characterization of the uncertainty in these estimates. We then reformulate the relationship inference problem to account for the fact that individuals share many common ancestors, not just one. We demonstrate that the most distant relationship that can be inferred using IBD may be 200 degrees or more, rather than ten, extending the time-to-common ancestor from approximately 300 years in the past to approximately 3,000 years in the past or more. This dramatic increase in the range of relationship estimators makes it possible to infer relationships whose common ancestors lived before historical events such as European settlement of the Americas, the Transatlantic Slave Trade, and the rise and fall of the Roman Empire.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Removing external egg microbiota via sterilization profoundly impacted insect viability but did not disrupt the vertical transmission of Sodalis and Pantoea symbionts.

The composition and maturation of this specialised, macroendocytic compartment has not been fully defined, but ultimately, the inner cell is killed and digested by host lysosomes. Here, we investigate the molecular characteristics and maturation profile of the entotic vacuole. Like phagosomes and macropinosomes, this vacuole undergoes a series of phospholipid modifications, but its maturation profile bears distinctive dynamics. While PI(4,5)P2 is lost rapidly during phagosome maturation, entosis yields an unusual, intracellular PI(4,5)P2-positive compartment, that can persist for hours, suggesting vacuole maturation is uncoupled from membrane scission. Loss of PI(4,5)P2 is eventually triggered, a requisite step for lysosomal killing of the internalised cell. More broadly, PI(4,5)P2-positive vacuoles also form during T-cell engulfment by thymic nurse cells, dependent on ROCK activity, suggesting this distinctive compartment represents a shared feature of entosis-like cell engulfments.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are one of the main sources of AMR pollutants discharged into water bodies. One important factor for assessing the risks associated with such pollution is the colonization potential of the resistant bacteria (ARB) and resistance genes (ARGs) from the environment into human or animal microbiomes upon exposure. This study explores whether fish can act as sentinels for surveillance of AMR pollution in general and specifically the human colonization potential of ARB in rivers impacted by WWTP effluents. Two riverine fish species, Brown trout, and European bullhead, were sampled up- and downstream a German WWTP. The two fish species were chosen due to their different lifestyles: Trout are mainly actively swimming in the water phase, while bullheads are sedentary and river sediment-associated. The bacterial microbiomes and resistomes of fish gills, skin, and feces were compared with those of the respective river water and sediment up- and downstream of the WWTP. Microbiomes of both fish mirrored the changes in river water and sediment downstream of the WWTP, with significant shifts in bacterial community composition, particularly an increase in Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. However, increases in ARG abundances observed in water and sediment downstream of the WWTP were not reflected in any of the fish-associated resistomes. This indicates that while the fish microbiome is sensitive to environmental changes, resistomes of poikilothermic animals such as fish are less responsive to colonization by ARB originating from WWTPs and may not serve as effective sentinels for assessing AMR pollution and colonization risks in freshwater environments. This study highlights the complexity of using wildlife as indicators for environmental AMR pollution and suggests that other species are better suited for surveillance efforts.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Gene drives designed to disrupt the reproductive capacity of females can suppress laboratory populations of the malaria mosquito. However, any suppressive intervention will inevitably exert an evolutionary pressure for resistance. Here, we present a pipeline for the accelerated discovery, engineering, and testing of both natural and drive-induced variants that could reverse gene drive spread. We applied our method to stress-test a highly effective gene drive that has evaded resistance in all laboratory-contained releases to date, known as Ag(QFS)1. We showed that previously undetected resistant alleles can arise at low frequency, and discovered novel, partially resistant alleles that can perturb drive-invasion dynamics. We then engineered next-generation gene drives that can actively remove resistant alleles by targeting several highly conserved and non-overlapping sites in the female-specific exon of the doublesex gene. Our models predict that such gene drive designs could suppress large, natural populations of the malaria mosquito in the field.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Here we tested whether these neural dynamics of speech encoding are altered for individuals with a language disorder. We recorded EEG responses from individuals with post-stroke aphasia and healthy age-matched controls (i.e., older adults) during 25 min of natural story listening. We estimated the duration of phonetic feature encoding, speed of evolution across neural populations, and the spatial location of encoding over EEG sensors. First, we establish that phonetic features are robustly encoded in EEG responses of healthy older adults. Second, when comparing individuals with aphasia to healthy controls, we find significantly decreased phonetic encoding in the aphasic group after shared initial processing pattern (0.08-0.25s after phoneme onset). Phonetic features were less strongly encoded over left-lateralized electrodes in the aphasia group compared to controls, with no difference in speed of neural pattern evolution. Finally, we observed that phonemes with high uncertainty about word identity were encoded longer in controls than in individuals with aphasia. This indicates that encoding phonetic information until word identity is resolved might be a crucial mechanism for successful speech comprehension. Together, our results suggest that aphasia may entail failure to maintain lower-order information long enough to recognize lexical items.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

All components of the translation machinery, including the ribosomes, translation factors and aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, are made of proteins and are therefore involved in their own synthesis, posing a unique challenge for self-biogenesis. Here, we created physicochemical conditions for autonomous biogenesis of all the translation machinery, excluding the ribosome. We surface-immobilized synthetic genes coding for all thirty components as densely packed DNA brushes forming a reaction center that localizes, concentrates and catalyzes their simultaneous synthesis. To demonstrate their activity, we first determined empirically the minimal critical concentration of each translation protein required to initiate its own self-biogenesis in bulk solution. We then assembled a minimal gene expression reaction with all translation proteins at their critical concentrations. Under these dilute conditions, reporter proteins were not synthesized unless the DNA brushes encoded all the translation proteins, thereby demonstrating their co-synthesis, functionality and engagement in their own synthesis. This scenario of a complex biochemical process that amplifies itself can be generalized and extended to impact our understanding toward the design of autonomous self-replicating biological system.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Classical reliance on case-control comparisons of group means that ignore the inter-individual heterogeneity autism may be a key drive of this inconsistency. Here, we used normative modelling to examine FC heterogeneity at the level of pair-wise inter-regional connections, specific brain regions, and broader functional networks in 1,824 participants (796 autistic) aged 5-58 years recruited across 32 different sites. Connection-level heterogeneity was high in both groups, with no single connection deviating in more than 4% of participants. However, deviant connections tended to converge on common regions and networks in autistic individuals more than in controls. In particular, autistic individuals showed significantly greater overlap for positive deviations (i.e., atypically increased FC) in transmodal systems and negative deviations (atypically decreased FC) in sensory-motor areas. FC deviation patterns across coarser levels correlated with social functioning symptoms and intellectual ability. This work suggests that clinical variability in autism may be associated with extreme heterogeneity in the specific functional connections, whereas commonalities may be driven by convergence of atypical FC increases in transmodal systems and atypical decreases in sensorimotor networks, pointing to an imbalance in the functional organization of the brain's sensorimotor-association axis","NA","medrxiv",1729721372690

Our findings indicate that synaptic gene dysfunction is the common molecular hallmark of fALS, which might result in neuronal susceptibility and progressive motor neuron degeneration. Analysis of upstream splicing factors revealed that differentially expressed RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in ALS iMNs may cause abnormal AS events, suggesting the importance of studying RBP defects in ALS research.

Resistance is often caused by mobile antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) shared horizontally between bacterial genomes. Many ARGs originate from environmental and commensal bacteria and are transferred between divergent bacterial hosts before they reach pathogens. This process remains, however, poorly understood, which complicates the development of countermeasures that reduce the spread of ARGs. In this study, we aimed to systematically analyze the ARGs transferred between the most evolutionary distant bacteria, here defined based on their phylum. We implemented an algorithm that identified inter-phyla transfers (IPTs) by combining ARG-specific phylogenetic trees with the taxonomy of the bacterial hosts. From the analysis of almost 1 million resistance genes identified in >400,000 bacterial genomes, we identified 661 IPTs, which included transfers between all major bacterial phyla. The frequency of IPTs varies substantially between ARG classes and was highest for the aminoglycoside resistance gene AAC(3) while the levels for beta-lactamases were, generally, lower. ARGs involved in IPTs also differed between phyla where, for example, tetracycline resistance genes were commonly transferred between Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, but rarely between Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. The results, furthermore, show that conjugative systems are seldom shared between bacterial phyla, suggesting that other mechanisms drive the dissemination of ARGs between divergent hosts. We also show that bacterial genomes involved in IPTs of ARGs are either over- or under-represented in specific environments. These IPTs were also found to be more recent compared to transfers associated with bacteria isolated from water, soil, and sediment. While macrolide and tetracycline resistance genes involved in ITPs almost always were +95% identical between phyla, corresponding {beta}-lactamases showed a median identity of < 60%. We conclude that inter-phyla transfer is recurrent and our results offer new insights into how resistance genes are disseminated between evolutionary distant bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Here we present Path2Space, a deep learning model trained on spatial transcriptomics data to predict spatial gene expression directly from histopathology slides. Studying breast cancer, the model was first trained on one ST breast cancer patients cohort and further independently tested and validated on two other ST cohorts. Path2Space identifies 4,500 genes whose spatial expression is robustly predicted in all three cohorts, markedly more accurate than existing ST predictors. Second, we show that based on the inferred ST, Path2Space accurately infers cell-type abundances in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Thirdly, Applying Path2Space to the TCGA breast cancer cohort we identify three TME spatially grounded subsets of patients that have markedly different survival rates. Fourth, analyzing two large breast cancer patients cohorts treated with trastuzumab, we show that the heterogeneity of the inferred HER2 levels across the tumor microenvironment is predictive of response, concordant with the bystander hypothesis. Finally, we developed a spatially interpretable model for predicting trastuzumab response directly from the H&E-slides. This models performance surpasses that of existing response prediction models that use measured bulk multi-omics data.

This is particularly relevant when local adaptation occurs despite gene flow, where clustering of differentiated loci can maintain locally adapted variants by reducing recombination between them. However, the limited genomic resources for non-model species, including reference genomes and recombination maps, has constrained our understanding of these patterns. In this study, we leverage the Atlantic silverside -- a non-model fish with extensive local adaptation across a steep latitudinal gradient -- as an ideal system to explore how genome structure influences adaptation under varying levels of gene flow, using a newly available reference genome and multiple recombination maps. Analyzing 168 genomes from four populations, we found a continuum of genome-wide differentiation increasing from south to north, reflecting higher connectivity among southern populations and reduced gene flow at northern latitudes. With increasing gene flow, the number and clustering of FST outlier loci also increased, with differentiated loci tightly clustered in large haploblocks harboring inversions and smaller peaks overlapping putative centromeres. Notably, sequence divergence was only evident in inversions, supporting their role in adaptive divergence with gene flow, whereas centromeres appeared differentiated because of low recombination and reduced diversity, with no indication of elevated sequence divergence. Our results support the hypothesis that clustered genomic architectures evolve with high gene flow and enhance our understanding of how inversions and centromeres are linked to different evolutionary processes.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

This activity was produced when cells were grown in 5% CO2 and in M17 media supplemented with galactose; however, evaluation of the phenotype with the addition of alternative sugars coupled with genome sequencing experiments revealed the antimicrobial phenotype was not related to classical bacteriocins. To further determine genes involved in the production of this activity, a transposon mutant library in S. pyogenes MGAS8232 was generated. The transposon screen identified the mannose phosphotransferase system (Man-PTS), a major sugar transporter in S. pyogenes, as important for the antimicrobial phenotype. Additional loss-of-function transposon mutants linked to the antimicrobial activity were identified to also be involved in alternative sugar utilization and additionally, the Man-PTS was also further identified from a secondary mutation in a bacteriocin operon mutant. Sugar utilization profiles in all the Man-PTS mutants demonstrated that galactose, mannose, and N-acetylglucosamine utilization was impaired in different Man-PTS mutants. In vitro RNA-seq experiments in high and low glucose concentrations further identified the Man-PTS as a glucose transporter; however, there was no transcriptional regulators or virulence factors affected with the loss of the Man-PTS.

This indicates no large-scale admixture between East and West Mound Catalhoyuk, and possibly that the post-Neolithic U+201CeasternU+201D gene flow event into Anatolia may have initiated only by the mid-6th millennium BCE.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

In this study, we conduct a systematic review of vector competence experiments with Oropouche virus (OROV, Orthobunyavirus) that were published prior to the 2023-24 epidemic season. Only seven studies were published by September 2024, highlighting the chronic neglect that Oropouche virus (like many other orthobunyaviruses) has been subjected to since its discovery in 1954. Two species of midge (Culicoides paraensis and C. sonorensis) consistently demonstrate a high competence to transmit OROV, while mosquitoes (including both Aedes and Culex spp.) exhibited an infection rate consistently below [~]20%, and showed limited OROV transmission. Further research is needed to establish which vectors are involved in the ongoing outbreak in Cuba, and whether local vectors create any risk of establishment in regions with frequent travel to Latin America and the Caribbean.

Author SummaryOropouche virus has recently become a major threat to public health in Central and South America. While OROV is mainly transmitted by biting midges, some public health agencies and scientific sources note that some mosquito species may also transmit the virus. We conducted a systematic review of literature prior to the current epidemic, and identified seven studies that experimentally tested the ability of vectors to become infected with, and transmit OROV (i.e., that assessed their vector competence). These studies have consistently found that biting midges become infected at higher rates than mosquitoes, which rarely transmit the virus. It is unclear which vectors are responsible for transmitting OROV in the current outbreak. Existing published data support the observation that biting midges are likely to be significant vectors compared to mosquitoes, which are comparatively incompetent. However, increased vector surveillance and pathogen testing, and additional vector competence experiments using current OROV strains, are urgently needed.","NA","medrxiv",1729721372690

However, its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Using young AppNL-F/MAPT double knock-in (dKI) mice, a model of early AD, we examined brain dynamics alterations before amyloid plaque onset. High-density EEG recordings and novel metrics from fields outside neuroscience were used to assess brain dynamics fluidity - a measure of the brain's ability to transition between activity states. We revealed that dKI mice exhibit early, awake state-specific reductions in brain dynamics fluidity associated with cognitive deficits in complex memory tasks. Daily vGENUS sessions over two weeks restored brain dynamics fluidity and rescued memory deficits in dKI mice. Importantly, these effects built up during the stimulation protocol and persisted after stimulation ended, suggesting long-term modulation of brain function. Based on these results, we propose a ""brain dynamics repair"" mechanism for vGENUS that goes beyond current amyloid-centric hypotheses. This dual insight - that brain dynamics are both a target for repair and a potential diagnostic tool - provides new perspectives on early Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

While the survival of E. coli under growth-inhibitory extreme acid stress is well understood, less is known about the physiology of E. coli growth under severe but permissive acidity. Here, we observed that growth of E. coli MG1655 in a rich medium with pH of 4.1 to 4.4 exhibits a characteristic multi-phasic growth pattern, consisting of an initial exponential elongation in the absence of cell division, followed by growth arrest and subsequent resumption of exponential growth. The duration of the growth arrest phase was strongly dependent on the pH of the medium, but also on the initial cell density of the culture, suggesting the collective nature of this phenomenon. Cell-density dependent multiphasic growth at the near-lethal pH, including the initial increase in cell volume associated with either elongation or widening of the cell body, was also observed for all tested natural E. coli isolates and for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Such transient increase in volume apparently enables bacteria to induce acid resistance systems, including the lysine-dependent Cad system, to subsequently modify pH of the medium in the density-dependent manner. Consistent with the collective recovery, even a minor fraction of acid-tolerant cells could fully cross-protect acid-sensitive cells enabling them to resume growth in coculture. Thus, collective dynamics plays a central role in bacterial growth under near-lethal acid stress.

ImportanceSince many E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae isolates are gastrointestinal pathogens for humans, it is important to understand their growth under acidic conditions imposed by the host physiology in the stomach, colon, and inside macrophages. Here we show that E. coli growth under near-lethal acidic conditions is a collective phenomenon that critically depends on cell density. This collective behavior is favored by changes in cell morphology as a response to high acidity. The observed density dependence might have implications for pathogen proliferation in the acidic environment of the human gastrointestinal tract and possibly also for their interactions with immune cells.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

In a circadian-controlled sleep and sleep deprivation study, we investigated how heightened sleep pressure and slow-wave-rich sleep affect physiological brain oscillations in humans, as measured with accelerated neuroimaging. Our study also included a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over administration of the adrenergic antagonist carvedilol, which allowed us to examine the effect of modulating cerebrovascular pulsatility. We report that sleep deprivation increases low frequency brain oscillations (LFOs) more than sleep does, with LFOs during sleep correlating with cognitive measures of sleep pressure. Conversely, slow-wave-rich NREM sleep (stages N2 and N3) enhances respiration- and cardiac-driven brain pulsations - particularly within grey and white matter. The strength of these brain pulsations escalates with sleep depth (N3 > N2) and correlates with EEG delta power. Carvedilol dampens LFOs, supporting that these reflect cerebrovascular oscillations. Altogether, our findings indicate that sleep pressure promotes cerebrovascular oscillations, while sleep slow waves synchronise with respiration- and cardiac-driven brain pulsations.

We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

We lack global and temporally continuous coverage on tree mortality data. Ground-based observations on tree mortality, e.g., derived from national inventories, are very sparse, not standardized and not spatially explicit. Earth observation data, combined with supervised machine learning, offer a promising approach to map tree mortality over time. However, global-scale machine learning requires broad training data covering a wide range of environmental settings and forest types. Drones provide a cost-effective source of training data by capturing high-resolution orthophotos of tree mortality events at sub-centimeter resolution.

In concert with Earth observation data and machine learning it will serve to uncover tree mortality patterns from local to global scales.

CRISPRi screens in iPSC-derived neurons and glia have already been successful in relating gene function to neurological phenotypes; however, loss of dCas9-KRAB expression after differentiation has been observed by many labs and has been largely ascribed to transgene silencing after differentiation. Here, we investigated the expression levels of different CRISPR enzymes in iPSC and Ngn2-derived neurons using piggybac delivery. We found that the commonly used dCas9-KRAB (using the KOX1 domain) displayed dramatic reduction in protein expression levels following neuronal differentiation, yet surprisingly, nCas9 constructs retained comparable protein expression between iPSCs and neurons. We further found that CRISPR constructs, primarily relying on the SV40 Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), fail to efficiently localize to the nuclei of neurons, despite having robust nuclear levels in iPSCs, leading to KRAB-specific cytoplasmic degradation. By adding a neuronal-specific NLS, we were able to correct neuronal nuclear localization and protein expression, confirming the contribution of mislocalization to the instability of dCas9-KRAB in neurons. As the lack of nuclear localization can have a profound impact on editing and gene perturbation efficiency, we suggest further investigation across both cultured and in-vivo postmitotic cell models.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Here, we conducted a comparative structural analysis of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated proteins taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Our study systematically evaluates how phosphorylation affects backbone conformation, protein dynamics, and mechanical strain. We found that phosphorylation commonly induces small, stabilizing conformational changes through conformational selection and frequently modulates local residue fluctuations, influencing overall protein motion. Notably, a small but significant subset of phosphosites shows mechanical coupling with functional sites, aligning with the domino model of allosteric signal transduction. This work provides a foundation for studying phosphorylation and other PTMs in their structural context, which will guide the rational design of synthetic phosphosites and enable the engineering of PTM-driven regulatory circuits in synthetic biology.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

These cellular interactions can be considered to be representative of evolutionary steps in plastid acquisition in eukaryotes, but the underlying cellular mechanisms and dynamics are not fully understood. Here, we studied a kleptoplastidic dinoflagellate (RSD: Ross Sea Dinoflagellate), which is known to steal plastids of the microalga Phaeocystis antarctica. We tracked the morphology and activity of stolen plastids over several months by combining multimodal subcellular imaging and photophysiology. Upon integration inside a host vacuole, the volume of plastids and pyrenoids significantly increased and photosynthetic activity was boosted along with carbon fixation and transfer to the host. This may be supported by the retention of a 50-fold larger algal nucleus for ~1 week. Once the algal nucleus was lost, there was a decrease in plastid volume and photosynthesis, but plastids were still beneficial for the host after > 2 months. Unlike other kleptoplastidic interactions, we showed that the algal mitochondrion was also stolen and retained for several months, transforming into an extensive network in close proximity with plastids. This highlights a new strategy in plankton along the continuum of plastid symbioses where both the energy-producing plastid and mitochondrion of a microalga are hijacked for several months by a host. This symbiosis that we found to be widely-distributed in polar regions suggests that plastid-mitochondrion interaction may have played a role in the evolution of plastid acquisition.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Furthermore, natural epivariants are enriched near genes and we uncovered a novel role for the Paf1 complex as a major facilitator of their prevalence. Conversely, related TE copies limit epiallelic variation, by producing the small RNAs that guide DNA methylation in trans. Crucially, natural epivariants mainly affect stress-responsive genes, making them unique targets for selection.

Furthermore, we found that dark microglia in development notably expressed C-type lectin domain family 7 member A (CLEC7a), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and required TREM2, differently from other microglia, suggesting a link between their role in remodeling during development and central nervous system pathology. Together, these results point towards a previously under-appreciated role for dark microglia in synaptic pruning and plasticity during normal postnatal development.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

For example, YfmR was recently identified as a protein that prevents ribosome stalling at proline-containing sequences in the absence of EF-P. Here, we show that the YebC-family protein YebC2 (formerly YeeI) functions as a translation factor in B. subtilis that resolves ribosome stalling at polyprolines. We demonstrate that YebC2, EF-P and YfmR act independently to support cellular fitness. Moreover, we show that YebC2 interacts directly with the 70S ribosome, supporting a direct role for YebC2 in translation. Finally, we assess the evolutionary relationship between YebC2 and other characterized YebC family proteins, and present evidence that transcription and translation factors within the YebC family have evolved separately. Altogether our work identifies YebC2 as a translation factor that resolves ribosome stalling and provides crucial insight into the relationship between YebC2, EF-P, and YfmR, three factors that prevent ribosome stalling at prolines.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Variation in the human Glp1r gene leading to altered receptor structure, signal transduction, and function might be directly linked to therapeutic responses in patients. A naturally occurring, low-frequency, gain-of-function missense variant, rs10305492 G>A (A316T), protects against T2D and cardiovascular disease. Here we employ CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate a humanised knock-in mouse model bearing the homozygous Glp1r A316T substitution. Human Glp1r A316T/A316T mice displayed lower fasting blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance, as well as increased plasma insulin levels and insulin secretion responses, even under metabolic stress. They also exhibited alterations in islet cytoarchitecture and {beta}-cell identity indicative of compensatory mechanisms under a high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet challenge. Across all models investigated, the human Glp1r A316T variant exhibited characteristics of constitutive activation but blunted incretin-induced responses. Our results are further supported by cryo-EM analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the GLP-1R A316T structure, demonstrating that the A316T Glp1r variant governs basal receptor activity and pharmacological responses to GLP-1R-targeting anti-diabetic therapies, highlighting the importance of the precise molecular characterisation of human Glp1r variants to predict individual therapy responses.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

We previously showed that LCFA degradation impedes oxidative protein folding in the Escherichia coli envelope, an issue that arises due to the insufficiency of ubiquinone, a lipid-soluble electron carrier in the electron transport chain (ETC). To maintain redox homeostasis, E. coli activates the CpxAR two-component system; however, the nature of feedback imparted by this envelope stress response (ESR) remained unknown. Here, we show that contrary to the well-recognized remedial mode of Cpx restoring envelope integrity by upregulating protein quality control factors, in LCFA-grown cells, it uses a preventive measure to maintain homeostasis. Cpx increases ubiquinone availability for oxidative protein folding by suppressing LCFA metabolism and directly increasing ubiquinone levels. Further, rather than using its conventional mode of imparting regulation via CpxR working as a transcriptional regulator, during LCFA metabolism, Cpx mainly uses its non-coding arm to counteract envelope redox stress. The Cpx-regulated small RNA CpxQ represses fad genes involved in LCFA transport and {beta}-oxidation, downregulates components of glyoxylate shunt, gluconeogenesis, and ETC, and increases ubiquinone content. Corroborating with its role in repressing LCFA metabolism and maintaining redox homeostasis, CpxQ overexpression impairs growth of E. coli in LCFAs and CpxQ deletion renders LCFA-grown E. coli hypersensitive to a thiol agent. Our foremost work studying the interconnection between LCFA metabolism, redox stress, and ESR in E. coli provides a rationale for investigating similar networks in other LCFA-utilizing bacteria.

Significance StatementLong-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) are energy-rich nutrients for Escherichia coli; however, their utilization hampers disulfide bond (DSB) formation in secreted proteins, an essential process that occurs in the envelope compartment. Here, we show that an envelope stress response manipulates LCFA metabolism in E. coli and uses a small RNA (sRNA) to restore homeostasis. Several bacteria with a huge impact on human health use host-derived LCFAs during infection. Because many virulence factors require DSB formation, the present study offers a basis to examine whether sRNAs play a role in governing envelope redox balance during LCFA metabolism in pathogens. The sRNA-mediated control is likely an ideal strategy both for rapid response to and quick recovery from LCFA-induced stress.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Current measurement technologies for various neuromodulators (such as dopamine and serotonin) do not bridge timescales of fluctuations, limiting the ability to define the behavioral significance, regulation, and relationship between fast (phasic) and slow (tonic) dynamics. To help resolve longstanding debates about the behavioral significance of dopamine across timescales, we developed a novel quantification strategy, augmenting extensively used carbon-fiber Fast Scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FSCV). We iteratively engineered the FSCV scan sequence to rapidly modify electrode sensitivity within a sampling window and applied ratiometric analysis for wideband dopamine measurement. This allowed us to selectively eliminate artifacts unrelated to electrochemical detection (i.e., baseline drift), overcoming previous limitations that precluded wideband dopamine detection from milliseconds to hours. We extensively characterize this approach in vitro, validate performance in vivo with simultaneous microdialysis, and deploy this technique to measure wideband dopamine changes across striatal regions under pharmacological, optogenetic, and behavioral manipulations. We demonstrate that our approach can extend to additional analytes, including serotonin and pH, providing a robust platform to assess the contributions of multi-timescale neuromodulator fluctuations to cognition, learning, and motivation.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

However, one potential limitation of such screening methods is the risk of overlooking non-essential neosubstrates of potential therapeutic value. To address this concern, we present a high-throughput proteome-wide MGD screening platform utilizing label-free, data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) for integrated proteomics and ubiquitinomics analysis.

The mechanisms driving lesion expansion, however, remain poorly understood. Here, using a multi-omics approach, we identified foamy microglia as primary contributors to the molecular profile of lesions and disease progression in secondary progressive MS. Lesions with foamy microglia are marked by the accumulation of cholesterol esters, bismonoacylglycerolphosphates (BMP), and oxylipins, along with high B-cell infiltration, increased levels of immunoglobulin G1, and elevated expression of Fcgamma- and complement receptors. Lesions with foamy GPNMB+-microglia display markers of enhanced phagocytosis, lipid metabolism, lysosomal dysfunction, and antigen presentation, but lack classical pro-inflammatory markers. Our data suggest that sustained phagocytosis of myelin overwhelms microglial endo-lysosomal capacity, leading to lipid droplet and oxylipin formation. This microglial phenotype may induce further recruitment of adaptive immune cells, axonal damage, drive lesion expansion and prevent remyelination. Monoacylglycerol lipase, involved in producing oxylipin precursors, was identified as a potential therapeutic target to disrupt this cycle and prevent chronic lesion expansion.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Connecting genomic alterations to health outcomes requires extensive computational analysis using accurate algorithms. Over the years, these algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated, but the lack of gold-standard datasets presents a fundamental challenge. Since genomic data is considered personal health information, only a limited number of deeply sequenced cancer genomes are available for distribution. As a result, tool benchmarking is often conducted on a small set of genomes with uncertain ground truths, which makes it difficult to measure the accuracy of analytic workflows.

To address this issue, we developed a novel generative AI tool called OncoGAN to generate synthetic cancer genomes based on training sets derived from large-scale genomic projects by employing generative adversarial networks and tabular variational autoencoders. Our results demonstrate that this approach accurately reproduces the number and frequency of mutations and their characteristics. Furthermore, it captures the genomic position of the mutations following the patterns specifically found for each tumor, and it enables us to replicate tumor-specific mutational signatures. To evaluate the fidelity of the simulations, we tested the synthetic genomes using DeepTumour, a software capable of identifying tumor types based on mutational patterns, and demonstrated a high level of concordance between the synthetic genome tumor type and DeepTumours prediction of the type.

This tool will allow the generation of a large realistic training and testing set of cancer genomes containing known genome alterations. This represents an advance for computational biologists, who will now have access to a publicly available set of realistic synthetic genomes with no privacy concerns, which can be used to develop new algorithms, improve the accuracy of existing tools, and benchmarking.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372690

Despite their importance for epithelial physiology, how microvilli grow during cellular differentiation remains poorly understood. Using genetic and small molecule perturbations, we found that an epithelial cell[&prime]s potential for growing microvilli of normal size is limited by an adjacent actin-dependent process: apical clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Timelapse imaging of individual microvillar growth events revealed tight spatial and temporal coupling to sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Finally, ultrastructural analysis of undifferentiated epithelial monolayers showed that most nascent microvilli are immediately adjacent to or in contact with an apical endocytic pit.

Most transcriptome analyses to date have focused on leaf-derived galls. To better understand gall formation mechanisms, we investigated stem-derived galls induced by the weevil Smicronyx madaranus on the parasitic plant Cuscuta campestris at gene expression, cellular, and physiological levels. RNA-seq across four developmental stages identified differentially expressed genes and associated gene ontology terms. Consistent with histological observations, genes related to cell division and the cell cycle were upregulated early but decreased as the gall matured. Similar to leaf-derived galls, we found high expression of PLETHORA and meristem-related homeobox genes in early gall development, suggesting that stem cell induction and maintenance are involved in various gall types. Like leaf- derived galls, the expression of genes related to floral organ development increased through the gall development. However, their expression patterns were dramatically different: downstream genes in the flowering pathway were highly expressed at the initial gall stage, whereas upstream genes were highly expressed later. This suggests that the weevil might activate the flowering pathway at unconventional stages, potentially rerouting the typical flowering cascade to influence gall development. Unlike the decrease in photosynthesis-related genes in leaf-derived galls, we observed an increase in these genes in galls formed on the stem of the holoparasitic plant. Shading experiments confirmed that photosynthesis is crucial for both gall growth and the weevil. This study highlights how gall-inducers can co-opt host resources and genetic pathways, offering new insights into the complexity of plant-insect interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372691

This study curated an open-source dataset to benchmark rigorously machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) models with each other and with MPO for predicting BBBP. Our analysis demonstrated that AI models, especially attentive NNs using stereochemical features, significantly outperform MPO in predicting BBBP. An attentive graph neural network (GNN), we refer to as CANDID-CNS, achieved a 0.23-0.26 higher AUROC score than MPO on full test sets, and a 0.17-0.19 higher score on stereoisomers filtered subsets. Regarding stereoisomers that differ in BBBP, which MPO cannot distinguish, attentive GNNs correctly classify these with AUROC and MCC metrics comparable to or better than MPOs AUROC and MCC on less difficult test molecules. These findings suggest that integrating attentive GNN models into pharmaceutical drug discovery processes can substantially improve prediction rates, and thereby reduce the timeline, cost, and increase probability of success of designing brain penetrant therapeutics for the treatment of a wide variety of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372691

Accessory genes encoded in the diversity hotspots are involved in anti-MGE defence and counter-defence, virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), thus playing key roles in interactions amongst phages, MGEs, bacteria and eukaryotic hosts. To date the majority of research has been focused on either individual hotspots or on relatively limited sets of hotspots in a small set of genomes, typically from a single species. A global understanding of hotspot diversity and dynamics still lacking. To address this gap, we developed iLund4u, an algorithm for the systematic annotation of hotspots across millions of sequences. Using a proteome composition approach, iLund4u detects proteome communities, annotates accessory proteins and identifies hotspots. By analysing 873K phage genomes and 696K plasmid sequences we identified 13.7K hotspots and 171K diverse protein families encoded there as cargo. Furthermore, iLund4u allows for protein search and proteome annotation functions versus a precomputed iLund4u database. In the protein search mode iLund4u identifies all hotspots that encode homologues of a query protein. In the proteome annotation mode iLund4u annotates hotspots by searching for communities of similar proteomes.

We revealed tissue-specific short- and long-lived proteins, strong correlations between interacting protein lifetimes, and distinct impacts of phosphorylation on protein turnover. Notably, we discovered that peroxisomes are regulated by protein turnover across tissues, and that phosphorylation regulates the stability of neurodegeneration-related proteins, such as Tau and -synuclein.

This heterogeneity highlights limitations in currently applied methodological approaches, which has stagnated our understanding of fundamental skeletal muscle biology in both healthy and myopathic contexts. Here, we developed a novel approach that combines a fluorescence based assay for the biophysical examination of the sarcomeric protein, myosin, coupled with same-myofiber high sensitivity proteome profiling, termed Single Myofiber Protein Function-Omics (SMPFO). Successfully applying this approach to healthy human skeletal muscle tissue, we identify the integrate relationship between myofiber functionality and the underlying proteomic landscape that guides divergent, but physiologically important, behaviour in myofiber sub-types. By applying SMPFO to two forms of human nemaline myopathy (ACTA1 and TNNT1 mutations), we reveal significant reduction in the divergence of myofiber sub-types, across both biophysical and proteomic behaviour.

In this study, we trained a deep learning model to detect plaques in 177,757 carotid ultrasound images from 19,499 UK Biobank (UKB) participants (aged 47-83 years) to assess the prevalence, risk factors, prognostic significance, and genetic architecture of carotid atherosclerosis in a large population-based cohort. The model demonstrated high performance metrics with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 89.3%, 89.5%, 89.2%, and 82.9%, respectively, identifying carotid plaques in 45% of the population. Plaque presence and count were significantly associated with future cardiovascular events over a median follow-up period of up to 7 years, leading to improved risk reclassification beyond established clinical prediction models.

Here, we performed intravital imaging of microglia mitochondria, revealing that microglial processes diverge, with some containing multiple mitochondria while others are completely void. Microglial processes that engage in minute-to-minute surveillance typically do not have mitochondria. Moreover, unlike process surveillance, mitochondrial motility does not change with animal anesthesia. Likewise, the processes that acutely chemoattract to a lesion site or initially engage with a neuron undergoing programmed cell death do not contain mitochondria. Rather, microglia mitochondria have a delayed arrival into the responding cell processes.

We developed a 3D blood-brain barrier model with enhanced barrier properties using primary brain endothelial cells, astrocytes and pericytes. Exposure to parasite egress products increased microvascular permeability, likely due to transcriptional downregulation of junctional and vascular development genes in endothelial cells. In addition, it increased the expression of ferroptosis markers, antigen presentation and type I interferon genes across all BBB cell types. Incubation with cytoadherent schizont-stage P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes induced a similar, but highly localized transcriptional shift, along with inter-endothelial gaps at sites of parasite egress, significantly increasing permeability.

Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods.

We describe this burden and compare it to the burden of influenza in the first two post-pandemic years in Denmark.

MethodsA cohort study including residents in Denmark from May 16, 2022, to June 7, 2024. Data were obtained from national registries, including information on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-positive COVID-19 and influenza admissions, mortality within 30 days of admission, sex, age, COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, comorbidity, and living in long-term care facility for elderly. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to compare rates of admissions between COVID-19 and influenza. To assess severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 30-day mortality between COVID-19 and influenza.

ResultsAmong 5,899,170 individuals, admissions with COVID-19 (n=24,687) were more frequent than admissions with influenza (n=8,682; aIRR 2.01, 95%CI 1.37-2.95), in particular during the first year (p=0.01), in the summer (p<0.001) and among people above 65 years of age (p<0.001). The number of deaths were also higher (COVID-19, n=2,393; influenza, n=522). Among patients, the risk of mortality of COVID-19 was higher than influenza in the 12-30 days following admission (0-11 days, aHR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.25; 12-30 days, aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.21-1.84), in particular among non-vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza (aHR 1.81, 95%CI 1.25-2.62), while it was similar to influenza among patients without comorbidities (aHR 1.07, 95%CI 0.63-1.80).

ConclusionCOVID-19 represented a greater disease burden than influenza, with more hospitalisations and deaths, and more severe disease primarily among non-vaccinated and comorbid patients.

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372691

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","10.1186/s40168-024-01916-8","biorxiv",1729721372691

Fluorescent HaloTag ligands employed in sequential labeling led to the discovery of distinct protein variants for histones, cohesins, and MCM complexes. Nonetheless, an efficient biochemical approach to separate the distinct protein variants to study their biological functions is missing. Principally being a gap in technology, the HaloTag toolbox lacks affinity ligands displaying good cell permeability and efficient affinity capture. Here, we describe the design, synthesis, and validation of a new cell-permeable Biotin-HaloTag ligand, which allows rapid labeling of Halo-tagged proteins in live cells and their efficient separation using streptavidin pull-down. Our work outlines how to use the herein-developed affinity ligand in sequential labeling to biochemically separate distinct protein variants and study their biological properties. The approach holds immense potential for addressing fundamental questions concerning essential cellular processes, including genome duplication and chromatin maintenance.","NA","biorxiv",1729721372691
