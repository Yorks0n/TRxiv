However, similar models for nonhuman primate (NHP) growth are lacking. The rhesus macaque, a widely used NHP in translational neuroscience due to its similarities in brain anatomy, phylogenetics, cognitive, and social behaviors to humans, serves as an ideal NHP model. This study aimed to create normative growth charts for brain structure across the macaque lifespan, enhancing our understanding of neurodevelopment and aging, and facilitating cross-species translational research. Leveraging data from the PRIMatE Data Exchange (PRIME-DE) and other sources, we aggregated 1,522 MRI scans from 1,024 rhesus macaques. We mapped non-linear developmental trajectories for global and regional brain structural changes in volume, cortical thickness, and surface area over the lifespan. Our findings provided normative charts with centile scores for macaque brain structures and revealed key developmental milestones from prenatal stages to aging, highlighting both species-specific and comparable brain maturation patterns between macaques and humans. The charts offer a valuable resource for future NHP studies, particularly those with small sample sizes. Furthermore, the interactive open resource (https://interspeciesmap.childmind.org) supports cross-species comparisons to advance translational neuroscience research.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

We use long-read nanopore sequencing and real-time PCR to observe the synthesis of pools of DNA products derived from a diverse set of natural and engineered DNA polymerases across varying temperatures and buffer compositions. We detail the features of the DNA fragments generated, enrichment of select sequence motifs, and demonstrate that the sequence composition of the synthesized DNA may be altered by modifying environmental conditions.

Here, we investigated the contribution of rare coding variants to DDs by analyzing 13,452 individuals with DDs, 18,613 of their family members, and 3,943 controls using a combination of family-based and case/control analyses. In line with previous studies of other neuropsychiatric traits, we found a significant burden of rare (allele frequency < 1x10-5) predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) and damaging missense variants, the vast majority of which are inherited from apparently unaffected parents. These predominantly inherited burdens are strongest in DD-associated genes or those intolerant of pLoF variation in the general population, however we estimate that ~10% of the excess of these variants in DD cases is found within the DD-associated genes, implying many more risk loci are yet to be identified. We found similar, but attenuated, burdens when comparing the unaffected parents of individuals with DDs to controls, indicating that parents have elevated risk of DDs due to these rare variants, which are overtransmitted to their affected children. We estimate that 6-8.5% of the population attributable risk for DDs are due to rare pLoF variants in those genes intolerant of pLoF variation in the general population. Finally, we apply a Bayesian framework to combine evidence from these analyses of rare, mostly-inherited variants with prior de novo mutation burden analyses to highlight an additional 25 candidate DD-associated genes for further follow up.","NA","medrxiv",1725142203830

However, little is currently known about the role for O-glycosylation, another major class of carbohydrate polymer modifications.

By examining the O-glycans associated with RNA from cell lines and colon organoids we find known and previously unreported O-linked glycan structures. Further, we find that O-linked glycans released from small RNA from organoids derived from ulcerative colitis patients exhibit higher levels of sialylation than glycans from healthy organoids. Together, our work provides flexible tools to interrogate O-linked glycoRNAs (O-glycoRNA) and suggests that they may be modulated in human disease.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

For example, p53 deficiency in some mice has been shown to rescue premature aging while others display significant aging phenotype when p53-deficient. This study seeks to elucidate, structurally and mechanistically, p53s roles in longevity. Through a relative evolutionary scoring (RES) algorithm, we quantify the level of evolutionary change in the residues of p53 across organisms of varying average lifespans in six taxonomic orders. Secondly, we used PEPPI to assess the likelihood of interaction between p53-or p53-linked proteins-and known senescence-regulating proteins across organisms in the orders Primates and Perciformes. Our RES algorithm found variations in the alignments within and across orders, suggesting that mechanisms of p53-mediated regulation of longevity may vary. PEPPI results suggest that longer-lived species may have evolved to regulate induction and inhibition of cellular senescence better than their shorter-lived counterparts. With experimental verification, these predictions could help elucidate the mechanisms of p53-mediated cellular senescence, ultimately clarifying our understanding of p53s connection to aging in a multiple-species context.

Author summaryThe p53 tumor suppressor protein protects our genome from cancers by repairing DNA damage, regulating cell death and/or pushing cells to a state where they become permanently unable to divide (known as cellular senescence). An accumulation of senescent cells produces various molecular features of aging in both mouse and human cellular models-thus linking p53 to the aging process. However, the molecular mechanism by which p53 regulates aging and its structural implications on this regulation are not clear. In this study, we assessed quantitatively the evolutionary differences in p53 sequences of organisms across several taxonomical orders to determine if there is a relationship between average lifespan and sequence evolution. In addition, we used a protein-protein interaction tool to assess the likelihood of interaction between p53, or p53-associated protein, and various senescence-associated proteins across organisms of various lifespans in two taxonomic orders: Primates and Perciformes. An elucidation of p53 structural difference and mechanistic proteomic network linked to p53 regulation of cellular senescence could advance therapeutics targeting abnormal aging.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

Typical analysis approaches often require significant computational expertise and user time. We introduce OrthoBrowser, a static site generator that will index and serve phylogeny, gene trees, multiple sequence alignments, and novel multiple synteny alignments. This greatly enhances the usability of tools like OrthoFinder by making the detailed results much more visually accessible. This interface can scale reasonably up to hundreds of genomes, allows a user to filter this large dataset to a subset of samples they are interested in at that particular moment in time, or ""zoom in"" to only a subtree of the orthogroup. The multiple synteny alignment method uses a progressive hierarchical alignment approach in the protein space using orthogroup membership to establish orthology. Orthobrowser makes it easy for users to identify, interact with, explore, and share key information about their gene families of interest.

We discovered that the SR62 locus consists of a digenic module encoding Sr62TK and an NLR (Sr62NLR). AvrSr62 binds to the N-terminal kinase of Sr62TK. This triggers displacement of the C-terminal kinase allowing it to recruit Sr62NLR for activation of immune responses.

ME diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME patients low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1725142203830

This study aims to determine cost-saving risk thresholds for statin use in Germany to inform better prescription practices and healthcare policies.

MethodsA decision-analytic approach was employed, using secondary data to compare statin use with no statin use from the perspective of German sickness fund insurees. The analysis focused on cost savings from avoided cardiovascular (CV) events, translating these avoided events into net savings after accounting for treatment costs and potential side effects. The study considered the German adult population insured by sickness funds and used a lifetime horizon for the analysis.

ResultsThe maximum number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve cost savings over 10 years was found to be 40, leading to a minimum risk threshold for savings of 9.8%. It was estimated that approximately 22% of the adult population in Germany has a 10-year CV risk of [&ge;]9.8%, potentially avoiding between 307,049 and 705,537 CV events over 10 years, with net population savings of approximately {euro}18 billion.

ConclusionsThe current official threshold for statin prescription in Germany, set at a 20% 10-year risk, is too stringent. Lowering the threshold to 9.8% could significantly increase the number of patients benefiting from statin therapy, reducing CV events and generating substantial cost savings. These findings suggest that adjustments to prescription guidelines could improve cardiovascular outcomes and economic efficiency within the German healthcare system.","NA","medrxiv",1725142203830

We observed two groups of differentially regulated genes: i) with robust changes in mRNA and protein levels, and ii) with protein/RNA discordances. Many of the latter are classified as interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) but have no reported antiviral activity. This suggests that IFN-dependent changes in mRNA levels do not imply antiviral function.

One particularly compelling demonstration of this fact can be seen by regressing EEG responses to speech against measures of how individual words in that speech linguistically relate to their preceding context. This approach produces a so-called temporal response function that displays a centro-parietal negativity reminiscent of the classic N400 component of the event-related potential. One shortcoming of previous implementations of this approach is that they have typically assumed a linear, time-invariant relationship between the linguistic speech features and the EEG responses. In other words, the analysis typically assumes that the response has the same shape and timing for every word - and only varies (linearly) in terms of its amplitude. In the present work, we relax this assumption under the hypothesis that responses to individual words may be processed more rapidly when they are predictable. Specifically, we introduce a framework wherein the standard linear temporal response function can be modulated in terms of its amplitude, latency, and temporal scale based on the expectedness of the current and prior words. We use the proposed approach to model EEG recorded from a set of participants who listened to an audiobook narrated by a single talker, and a separate set of participants who attended to one of two concurrently presented audiobooks. We show that expected words are processed faster - evoking lower amplitude N400-like responses with earlier peaks - and that this effect is driven both by the words own predictability and the predictability of the immediately preceding word. Additional analysis suggests that this finding is not simply explained based on how quickly words can be disambiguated from their phonetic neighbors. As such, our study demonstrates that the timing and amplitude of brain responses to words in natural speech depend on their predictability. By accounting for these effects, our framework also improves the accuracy with which neural responses to natural speech can be modeled.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

We asked whether BTSP could also be a plasticity mechanism for generation of non-spatial responses in the hippocampus and what roles the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex (MEC and LEC) play in driving non-spatial BTSP. By performing simultaneous calcium imaging of dorsal CA1 neurons and chemogenetic inhibition of LEC or MEC while mice performed an olfactory working memory task, we discovered BTSP-like events which formed stable odor-specific fields. Critically, the success rate of calcium events generating a significant odor-field increased with event amplitude, and large events exhibited asymmetrical formation with the newly formed odor-fields preceding the timepoint of their induction event. We found that MEC and LEC play distinct roles in modulating BTSP: MEC inhibition reduced the frequency of large calcium events, while LEC inhibition reduced the success rate of odor-field generation. Using two-photon calcium imaging of LEC and MEC temporammonic axons projecting to CA1, we found that LEC projections to CA1 were strongly odor selective even early in task learning, while MEC projection odor-selectivity increased with task learning but remained weaker than LEC. Finally, we found that LEC and MEC inhibition both slowed representational drift of odor representations in CA1 across 48 hours. Altogether, odor-specific information from LEC and strong odor-timed activity from MEC are crucial for driving BTSP in CA1, which is a synaptic plasticity mechanism for generation of both spatial and non-spatial responses in the hippocampus that may play a role in explaining representational drift and one-shot learning of non-spatial information.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

We sought to overcome this challenge using the classic catalytic triad and oxyanion hole of serine hydrolases as a model system. We used RFdiffusion (1) to generate proteins housing catalytic sites of increasing complexity and varying geometry, and a newly developed ensemble generation method called ChemNet to assess active site geometry and preorganization at each step of the reaction. Experimental characterization revealed novel serine hydrolases that catalyze ester hydrolysis with catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) up to 3.8 x 10*3 M-1 s-1, closely match the design models (C alpha RMSDs < 1 Angstrom), and have folds distinct from natural serine hydrolases. In silico selection of designs based on active site preorganization across the reaction coordinate considerably increased success rates, enabling identification of new catalysts in screens of as few as 20 designs. Our de novo buildup approach provides insight into the geometric determinants of catalysis that complements what can be obtained from structural and mutational studies of native enzymes (in which catalytic group geometry and active site makeup cannot be so systematically varied), and provides a roadmap for the design of industrially relevant serine hydrolases and, more generally, for designing complex enzymes that catalyze multi-step transformations.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

Acquisition is typically mediated by mobile genetic elements (MGEs), however, beyond plasmids, bacteriophages and certain integrative conjugative elements (ICEs), the nature and diversity of MGEs is poorly understood. The bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 was propagated by serial transfer in the presence of filtrate obtained from garden compost communities. Genome sequencing of derived colonies revealed acquisition of three different mobile elements, each integrated immediately downstream of tmRNA. All are flanked by direct repeats and harbour a tyrosine integrase (intY), followed by a cargo of accessory genes including putative phage defence systems. Although characteristic of genomic islands, MGE-classifiers showed no matches to mobile elements. Interrogation of DNA sequence databases showed that similar elements are widespread in the genus Pseudomonas and beyond, with Vibrio Pathogenicity Island-1 (VPI-1) from V. cholerae being a notable example. Bioinformatic analyses demonstrate frequent transfer among diverse hosts. With focus on a single 55 kb element (I55) we show that intY is necessary for excision and circularisation, that the element is incapable of autonomous horizontal transfer, but is mobilizable - in the absence of direct cell-cell contact - upon addition of community filtrate. Further analyses demonstrate that I55 enhances host fitness in the presence of community filtrate, which stems in part from ability to defend against phages.

Significance StatementThe impact of horizontal gene transfer on the evolution of bacteria outpaces that driven by spontaneous mutation, but knowledge of the range of mediators, the genes mobilised, and the mechanisms of movement have largely depended on inferences stemming from bioinformatics. Here we describe a real-time evolution experiment in which a single focal strain propagated with filtrate from a complex microbial community captures genetic elements carrying a diverse cargo of genes whose mobility was previously unknown. The elements are representative of a class of mobile DNA that depend on nothing other than a tyrosine integrase that targets a highly conserved gene. The elements encode phage resistance, require the integrase to excise from the genome, confer a significant fitness advantage, and depend on a secondary element for transfer.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

Determining the origin time of genes facilitates the elucidation of crucial genetic mechanisms underlying significant biological evolutionary questions such as the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life, the emergence of mammals, the origin of humans, as well as the development of species- or lineage-specific traits. However, accurately determining the origin time of these genes in species separated by long evolutionary distances remains a major challenge in bioinformatics as these genes often undergo significant changes in their genome sequences, making it difficult to trace them back to their origin. Here, we proposed a new approach for dating gene age based on the micro- and macro-synteny algorithms. This approach employs the parallel computation of orthologous genome alignments across multiple species. Our method was integrated into the GageTracker (Gene Age Tracker) software, providing a fast and accurate way to trace gene age with minimal user input, available at https://github.com/RiversDong/GageTracker. Benchmarked against the simMammals dataset (Alignathon), GageTracker achieved the same high-quality genome alignments as the optimized LastZ aligner, but improved operation speed by 1.4-7 times. In a separate analysis of 12 Drosophila genomes, GageTracker efficiently assessed the ages of 23,720 genes (including ~13,965 protein-coding genes) in just ~22 hours with default parameters. When comparing with the GenTree database (recognized as the most comprehensive and accurate tool for evaluating gene age), GageTracker achieved an impressive ~94.4% accuracy and ~99% macro consistency in assessing the age of protein-coding genes. Moreover, for the ~5.6% conflicting genes, GageTracker displayed slightly higher support rates than GenTree, as evidenced by data from OrthoDB, FlyBase, and Ensembl ortholog databases. Notably, younger genes identified by GageTracker exhibited a preferential expression pattern in the testis, further reinforcing the reliability of GageTracker in accurately tracing gene age.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

In cells undergoing (therapeutic) stress, LISRR recruits DAZAP1 (Deleted in AZoospermia Associated Protein 1) to polysomes and drives the assembly of a subset of ribosomes at the endoplasmic reticulum, directing the synthesis of an immunosuppressive translatome. This includes the immune checkpoint PD-L1 and the enzymes necessary for building the glycocalyx, the sugar coat surrounding the cells. Notably, proper glycocalyx assembly is required for spermatozoa immune evasion during fertilization.

Existing theoretical models have suggested the maintenance of a four-chromosome equilibrium (with driving and standard X and suppressing and susceptible Y) in a cyclic dynamic, studies of natural populations have failed to capture this pattern. Although there are several plausible explanations for this lack of cycling, interference from autosomal suppressors has not been studied using a theoretical population genetic framework even though autosomal suppressors and Y-linked suppressors coexist in natural populations of some species. In this study, we use a simulation-based approach to investigate the influence of autosomal suppressors on the cycling of sex chromosomes. Our findings demonstrate that the presence of an autosomal suppressor can hinder the invasion of a Y-linked suppressor under some parameter space, thereby impeding the cyclic dynamics, or even the invasion of Y-linked suppression. Even when a Y-linked suppressor invades, the presence of an autosomal suppressor can prevent cycling. Our study demonstrates the potential role of autosomal suppressors in preventing sex chromosome cycling and provides insights into the conditions and consequences of maintaining both Y-linked and autosomal suppressors.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

The total diversity of geographic radiations of many Indo-Pacific fauna is often incompletely sampled in phylogenetic studies due to the difficulty in obtaining single island endemic forms across the Pacific and the relatively poor performance of degraded DNA when using museum specimens for inference of evolutionary relationships. New methods for production and analysis of genome-wide datasets sourced from degraded DNA are facilitating insights into the complex evolutionary histories of these influential island faunas. Here, we leverage whole genome resequencing (20X average coverage) and extensive sampling of all taxonomic diversity within Todiramphus kingfishers, a rapid radiation of largely island endemic  Great Speciators. We find that whole genome datasets do not outright resolve the evolutionary relationships of this clade: four types of molecular markers (UCEs, BUSCOs, SNPs, and mtDNA) and tree building methods did not find a single well-supported and concordant species-level topology. We then uncover evidence of widespread incomplete lineage sorting and both ancient and contemporary gene flow and demonstrate how these factors contribute to conflicting evolutionary histories. Our complete taxonomic sampling allowed us to further identify a novel case of mitochondrial capture between two allopatric species, suggesting a potential historical (but since lost) hybrid zone as islands were successively colonized. Taken together, these results highlight how increased genomic and taxon sampling can reveal complex evolutionary patterns in rapid island radiations.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

These cell engineering tools depend on antigen sensors which are most often derived from antibodies. Advances in the de novo design of proteins have enabled the design of protein binders with the potential to target epitopes with unique properties and faster production timelines compared to antibodies. Building upon our previous work combining a de novo-designed minibinder of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with the synthetic receptor synNotch (SARSNotch), we investigated whether minibinders can be readily adapted to a diversity of cell engineering tools. We show that the Spike minibinder LCB1 easily generalizes to a next-generation proteolytic receptor SNIPR that performs similarly to our previously reported SARSNotch. LCB1-SNIPR successfully enables the detection of live SARS-CoV-2, an improvement over SARSNotch which can only detect cell-expressed Spike. To test the generalizability of minibinders to diverse applications, we tested LCB1 as an antigen sensor for a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). LCB1-CAR enabled CD8+ T cells to cytotoxically target Spike-expressing cells. We further demonstrate that two other minibinders directed against the clinically relevant epidermal growth factor receptor are able to drive CAR-dependent cytotoxicity with efficacy similar to or better than an existing antibody-based CAR.

However, this level of detail is typically difficult to attain in macromolecular crystallography because the diffracted intensities rapidly fade with increasing resolution. The problem cannot be circumvented by increasing the fluence as this leads to detrimental radiation damage. Previously, we demonstrated that high quality MicroED data can be obtained at low flux conditions using electron counting with direct electron detectors. The improved sensitivity and accuracy of these detectors essentially eliminate the read-out noise, such that the measurement of faint high-resolution reflections is limited by other sources of noise. Inelastic scattering is a major contributor of such noise, increasing background counts and broadening diffraction spots. Here, we demonstrate that a substantial improvement in signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved using an energy filter to largely remove the inelastically scattered electrons. This strategy resulted in sub-atomic resolution MicroED data from proteinase K crystals, enabling accurate structure modelling and the visualization of detailed features.

Current therapeutics remain limited to direct acting antivirals that lack distinct mechanisms of action and are already showing signs of viral resistance. The virus encodes an ADP-ribosylhydrolase macrodomain (Mac1) that plays an important role in the coronaviral lifecycle by suppressing host innate immune responses. Genetic inactivation of Mac1 abrogates viral replication in vivo by potentiating host innate immune responses. However, it is unknown whether this can be achieved by pharmacologic inhibition and can therefore be exploited therapeutically. Here we report a potent and selective lead small molecule, AVI-4206, that is effective in an in vivo model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cellular models indicate that AVI-4206 has high target engagement and can weakly inhibit viral replication in a gamma interferon- and Mac1 catalytic activity-dependent manner; a stronger antiviral effect for AVI-4206 is observed in human airway organoids. In an animal model of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, AVI-4206 reduces viral replication, potentiates innate immune responses, and leads to a survival benefit. Our results pharmacologically validate Mac1 as a therapeutic target via a novel immune-restoring mechanism that could potentially synergize with existing therapies targeting distinct, essential aspects of the coronaviral life cycle. This approach could be more widely used to target other viral macrodomains to develop antiviral therapeutics beyond COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

Differences in copy number and other sources of extrinsic noise generate variance in transgene expression and limit the performance of synthetic gene circuits. In a therapeutic context, supraphysiological expression of transgenes can compromise engineered phenotypes and lead to toxicity. To ensure a narrow range of transgene expression, we design and characterize Compact microRNA-Mediated Attenuator of Noise and Dosage (ComMAND), a single-transcript, microRNA-based incoherent feedforward loop. We experimentally tune the ComMAND output profile, and we model the system to explore additional tuning strategies. By comparing ComMAND to two-gene implementations, we highlight the precise control afforded by the single-transcript architecture, particularly at relatively low copy numbers. We show that ComMAND tightly regulates transgene expression from lentiviruses and precisely controls expression in primary human T cells, primary rat neurons, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and human induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, ComMAND effectively sets levels of the clinically relevant transgenes FMRP1 and FXN within a narrow window. Together, ComMAND is a compact tool well-suited to precisely specify expression of therapeutic cargoes.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

Salt stress exacerbates high light stress in cyanobacteria and leads to severe yield losses in crop plants. Genetic traits that confer salt tolerance without compromising photosynthetic performance are essential for improving photosynthesis under these conditions. Here we applied accelerated evolution in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 by conditionally suppressing its methyl-directed mismatch repair system to obtain beneficial genetic traits for enhanced photosynthesis under salt stress. Screening over 10,000 mutants, we isolated eight strains with increased biomass or sucrose productivity under salt stress. Genome sequencing revealed an average of 8-20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or indels per genome. Notably, mutations in the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center D1 gene, resulting in the amino acid changes L353F, I358N, and H359N at the carboxyl terminus of the pre-D1 (pD1) protein, improve photosynthesis under salt and combined salt and light stress by potentially accelerating D1 maturation during PSII repair.

We examined the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to echocardiography (TTE) and electrocardiography (ECG) as a scalable strategy to quantify pre-clinical trends in ATTR-CM.

MethodsAcross age/sex-matched case-control datasets in the Yale-New Haven Health System (YNHHS) we trained deep learning models to identify ATTR-CM-specific signatures on TTE videos and ECG images (area under the curve of 0.93 and 0.91, respectively). We deployed these across all studies of individuals referred for cardiac nuclear amyloid imaging in an independent population at YNHHS and an external population from the Houston Methodist Hospitals (HMH) to define longitudinal trends in AI-defined probabilities for ATTR-CM using age/sex-adjusted linear mixed models, and describe discrimination metrics during the early pre-clinical stage.

ResultsAmong 984 participants referred for cardiac nuclear amyloid imaging at YNHHS (median age 74 years, 44.3% female) and 806 at HMH (69 years, 34.5% female), 112 (11.4%) and 174 (21.6%) tested positive for ATTR-CM, respectively. Across both cohorts and modalities, AI-defined ATTR-CM probabilities derived from 7,423 TTEs and 32,205 ECGs showed significantly faster progression rates in the years before clinical diagnosis in cases versus controls (ptime x group interaction[&le;] 0.004). In the one-to-three-year window before cardiac nuclear amyloid imaging sensitivity/specificity metrics were estimated at 86.2%/44.2% [YNHHS] vs 65.7%/65.5% [HMH] for AI-Echo, and 89.8%/40.6% [YNHHS] vs 88.5%/35.1% [HMH] for AI-ECG.

ConclusionsWe demonstrate that AI tools for echocardiographic videos and ECG images can enable scalable identification of pre-clinical ATTR-CM, flagging individuals who may benefit from risk-modifying therapies.

To systematically decipher the gene regulatory logic guiding this process, we generated a single-cell multi-omics atlas of RNA expression and chromatin accessibility during early zebrafish embryogenesis. We developed a deep learning model to predict chromatin accessibility based on DNA sequence and found that a small number of transcription factors underlie cell-type-specific chromatin landscapes. While Nanog is well-established in promoting pluripotency, we discovered a new function in priming the enhancer accessibility of mesendodermal genes. In addition to the classical stepwise mode of differentiation, we describe instant differentiation, where pluripotent cells skip intermediate fate transitions and terminally differentiate. Reconstruction of gene regulatory interactions reveals that this process is driven by a shallow network in which maternally deposited regulators activate a small set of transcription factors that co-regulate hundreds of differentiation genes. Notably, misexpression of these transcription factors in pluripotent cells is sufficient to ectopically activate their targets. This study provides a rich resource for analyzing embryonic gene regulation and reveals the regulatory logic of instant differentiation.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

Slow waves and sleep spindles during slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movements and sawtooth waves during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep induce frequent low-amplitude CSF fluctuations, contributing to faster CSF dynamics during deep sleep. In contrast, arousal-related brain activities during light sleep produced infrequent large CSF changes. Furthermore, these brain oscillations during light and deep sleep recruited essentially different brain networks, with deep sleep emphasizing memory and homeostatic circuits. Thus, human deep sleep has a unique way of enabling faster CSF dynamics that are distinctive from arousal mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

In healthy cardiomyocytes, Cx43 is mainly located at the intercalated disk; however, Cx43 remodeling is observed in cardiac pathologies and is linked with arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death. Using a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), we previously demonstrated that Cx43 localizes to the lateral side of dystrophic cardiomyocytes, forming undocked hemichannels. {beta}-adrenergic signaling-induced cardiac stress promotes S-nitrosylation and the opening of undocked Cx43 hemichannels leading to disrupted cardiac membrane excitability and deadly arrhythmogenic behaviors. To establish the direct role of S-nitrosylated Cx43 in DMD cardiomyopathy, we generated knockin DMDmdx mice with reduced levels of S-nitrosylated Cx43, by replacing cysteine 271 with a serine in one Cx43 of the unique site for S-nitrosylation of Cx43 (DMDmdx:C271S+/-). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that cardiac Cx43 lateralization in DMDmdx:C271S+/- mice was similar to DMDmdx mice, indicating that the genetic modification did not prevent Cx43 remodeling. Upon isoproterenol treatment, DMDmdx mice displayed a higher incidence of arrhythmogenic events when compared to DMDmdx:C271S+/- mice, which more closely resemble wild-type mice. Optical mapping imaging in isolated hearts showed that DMDmdx mice displayed aberrant Ca2+ signaling and prolonged action potentials, which is restored in DMDmdx:C271S+/- mice. Isoproterenol treatment evoked severe myocardial injury in DMDmdx mice, which was significantly attenuated in DMDmdx:C271S+/- mice. Notably, DMDmdx mice treated with Gap19, a Cx43 hemichannel blocker, exhibited cardioprotection against myocardial injury. We concluded that S-nitrosylation of Cx43 proteins is a fundamental NO-mediated mechanism involved in arrhythmias and myocardial injury in DMDmdx, occurring through the opening of hemichannels following {beta}-adrenergic stress.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

Due to the brains limited regenerative ability, these long-lived cells must engage unique mechanisms to cope with accumulated damage over time. We have shown that a subset of differentiated neuronal and glial cells in the fruit fly brain become polyploid during adulthood. Cell cycle re-entry in the brain has previously been associated with neurodegeneration, but there may be a more complex relationship between polyploidy and cell fitness in the brain. Here, we examine how known lifespan modifiers influence the accumulation of polyploidy in the aging fly brain. Flies aged at a low temperature, or with a low protein diet, accumulate polyploid cells in the brain more slowly than expected if this phenotype were solely regulated by lifespan mechanisms. Despite the slower accumulation of polyploid cells, animals under conditions that extend lifespan eventually reach similar levels of polyploidy in the brain as controls. Our work suggests known lifespan modifiers can influence the timing of cell cycle re-entry in the adult brain, indicating there is a flexible window of cell cycle plasticity in the aging brain.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

A tradeoff between these objectives is well-documented in microbes, where it is caused by the need to partition the total cellular protein content between growth- and survival-enhancing proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms of growth-survival tradeoffs in multicellular animals remain largely unknown. Here, we addressed this mechanism for C. elegans by measuring the dynamic changes of its proteome during starvation using live imaging and proteomics. We found that starved animals catabolize ribosomal proteins through autophagy, which provides essential energy for survival while preserving organismal integrity. However, the resulting decline in ribosomes delayed growth resumption upon refeeding until pre-starvation ribosome levels were restored. Genetic inhibition of ribosomal autophagy had a dual effect: although it accelerated growth after short starvation, it compromised survival during prolonged starvation. These findings reveal the rate of ribosomal catabolism as a key determinant of a tradeoff between starvation survival and rapid growth resumption whose tuning may adapt animals to different starvation durations. Our research shows how the need to balance protein allocation between growth and survival constrains animal physiology, highlighting the mechanistic role of proteome resource limitation in whole-organism tradeoffs.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

We analysed the Y-chromosome Short Tandem Repeats haplotypes from 8153 males from India and Eurasia to explore the impact of Holocene migration on the Indian gene pool.

However, the origin of this heterogeneity and how it regulates HSC phenotype is unclear. We show that during the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) in the mouse embryo, dynamic changes in mitochondrial activity drive the production of mature HSCs with differing potencies. Lowering mitochondrial activity in the AGM by pharmacological or genetic means activates Wnt signaling to promote HSC expansion. Further, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) gives rise to functional heterogeneity in the definitive HSC pool. In-vitro and in-vivo functional assays, and single-cell transcriptomics on AGM HSCs showed that MMPlow HSCs are myeloid-biased, with enhanced differentiation potential, while MMPhigh HSCs are lymphoid-biased with diminished differentiation potential. Mechanistically, low mitochondrial activity upregulates Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling to promote HSC differentiation. These insights into the initiation of metabolic heterogeneity could be leveraged to isolate HSCs to efficiently generate desired lineages.

Despite the well-known importance of maternal factors on infant immune development, whether maternal immune dysregulation and dysbiosis can perpetuate the same in offspring remains largely unknown. To explore how these maternal factors impact offspring disease development, we used IgA-deficiency induced maternal dysbiosis in Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) dams to study T1D development in their progeny. We found that maternal dysbiosis led to changes in IgA-sufficient offspring immune development resulting in heightened GI immune activity. Maternal dysbiosis also contributed to altered microbiome establishment in progeny, such that pups exhibited reduced colonic abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Clostridoides difficile. In adulthood, these mice exhibited a lowered incidence of T1D. This protection was replicated by fostering high incidence offspring to dysbiotic dams, prompting us to propose that altered breast milk composition in dysbiotic dams can influence immune development and microbiome establishment in offspring, contributing to T1D resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

However, the latter has still been poorly explored. Here, we compared and analyzed the time course of the various cell types constituting the MuSC niche during muscle generation in young and old mice. Aging altered the amplification of all niche cells with particularly prominent phenotypes in macrophages that impaired the resolution of inflammation in the old regenerating muscle. RNAsequencing of FACs-isolated MuSCs and non-myogenic niche cells during regeneration uncovered specific profiles and kinetics of genes and molecular pathways differentially regulated in old versus young regenerating muscle, indicating that each cell type responded to aging in a specific manner. Through this, we discovered that macrophages have a strong signature of aging with altered the activation of Selenoprotein P (Sepp1) expression in macrophages during the resolution of inflammation in regenerating muscle. Macrophage-specific deletion of Sepp1 gene was sufficient to impair the acquisition of the repair inflammatory profile, perturbed the support of macrophages to MuSCs in vitro and in vivo, and to cause inefficient skeletal muscle regeneration. When transplanted in aged mice, bone marrow from young WT mice, but not Sepp1 KOs, restored muscle regeneration to youthful levels. Altogether this work provides a unique resource to study the aging of the MuSC niche, reveals that aging of niche cells is asynchronous and establishes impaired macrophage dynamics/polarization and the anti-oxidant Selenoprotein P expression as drivers of age-related decline of muscle regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

PNOs exhibited similar structure and cell types than the nasal mucosa, as evaluated by immunostaining. PNOs were inoculated with porcine commensal strains of Moraxella pluranimalium, Rothia nasimurium and the pathobiont Glaesserella parasuis for examining host-commensal-pathogen interactions.

M. pluranimalium and G. parasuis strains stimulated the production of proinflammatory cytokines, whereas R. nasimurium induced the production of IFN{gamma} and diminished the proinflammatory effect of the other strains. Overall, PNOs mimic the in vivo nasal mucosa and can be useful to perform host-microbe interaction studies.

This study used a forward-in-time simulation based on the Wright-Fisher model to analyze genealogical and genetic relatedness, haplotype block lengths, and runs of homozygosity (ROH) across generations. In small, insular populations, the number of genetic ancestors rapidly encompassed the total number of potential ancestors, and ROHs occurred frequently due to genetic drift. Our results showed that while genealogical ancestors followed an initial exponential growth phase before stabilizing, genetic ancestors grew more slowly.

To determine how the biotic and abiotic conditions in an insectary affect the composition of the bacterial microbiome of mosquitoes we reared mosquitoes from a single cohort of eggs from one genetically homogeneous inbred Aedes aegypti colony, which were split into three batches, and transferred to each of three different insectaries located within the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. Using three replicate trays per insectary, we assessed and compared the bacterial microbiome composition as mosquitoes developed from these eggs. We also characterised the microbiome of the mosquitoes food sources, measured environmental conditions over time in each climate-controlled insectary, and recorded development and survival of mosquitoes. While mosquito development was overall similar between all three insectaries, we saw differences in microbiome composition between mosquitoes from each insectary. Furthermore, bacterial input via food sources, potentially followed by selective pressure of temperature stability and range, did affect the microbiome composition. At both adult and larval stages, specific members of the mosquito microbiome were associated with particular insectaries; and the insectary with less stable and cooler conditions resulted in slower pupation rate and higher diversity of the larval microbiome. Tray and cage effects were also seen in all insectaries, with different bacterial taxa implicated between insectaries. These results highlight the necessity of considering the variability and effects of different microbiome composition even in experiments carried out in a laboratory environment starting with eggs from one batch; and highlights the impact of even minor inconsistencies in rearing conditions due to variation of temperature and humidity.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

Dopamine signals are widely observed in response to aversive stimuli, indicating they could play a role in learning about how to avoid these stimuli. However, it is unclear what computations dopamine signals perform to support avoidance learning. Furthermore, substantial heterogeneity in dopamine responses to aversive stimuli has been observed across nucleus accumbens (NAc) subregions. To understand how heterogeneous dopamine responses to aversive stimuli contribute to avoidance learning, we recorded NAc core (Core) and NAc ventromedial shell (vmShell) dopamine during a task in which mice could avoid a footshock punishment by moving to the opposite side of a 2-chamber apparatus during a five-second warning cue. We found that NAc Core and vmShell dopamine signals responded oppositely during shocks and warning cues. Both signals evolved substantially - but differently - with learning. NAc vmShell dopamine responses to cues and shocks were present during early learning but not sustained during expert performance. NAc Core dopamine responses strengthen with learning and are especially evident during expert performance. Our data support a model in which NAc vmShell dopamine guides initial cue-shock associations by signaling salience, while NAc Core dopamine encodes prediction errors that guide the consolidation of avoidance learning.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

While there are genomic and transcriptomic methods, developed for other cancer types, to identify HR deficient (HRD) samples, there are no gene expression-based tools to predict HR repair status in HGSC specifically. We have built the first HGSC-specific model to predict HR repair status using gene expression.

MethodsWe separated The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort of HGSCs (n = 361) into training (n = 288) and testing (n = 73) sets and labelled each case as HRD or HR proficient (HRP) based on the clinical standard for classification, being a score of HRD genomic damage. Using the training set, we performed differential gene expression analysis between HRD and HRP cases. The 2604 significantly differentially expressed genes were then used to tune and train a penalised logistic regression model.

ResultsIdentifiHR is an elastic net penalised logistic regression model that uses the expression of 209 genes to predict HR status in HGSC. These genes capture known regions of HR-specific copy number alteration, which impact gene expression levels, and preserve the genomic damage signal. IdentifiHR has an accuracy of 85% in the TCGA test set and of 91% in an independent cohort of 99 samples, collected from primary tumours before (n = 74/99) and after autopsy (n = 6/99), in addition to ascites (n = 12/99) and normal fallopian tube samples (n = 7/99). Further, IdentifiHR is 84% accurate in pseudobulked single-cell HGSC sequencing from 37 patients and outperforms existing gene expression-based methods to predict HR status, being BRCAness, MutliscaleHRD and expHRD.

However, our current mechanistic understanding of these dysfunctions and relationships is imprecise.

Study DesignThe present study used mathematical modeling to uncover cognitive processes driving gaze perception abnormalities in SZ and BD, and how they relate to cognition, symptoms, and social functioning. We modeled the behavior of 28 SZ, 38 BD, and 34 controls (HC) in a self-referential gaze perception task using drift-diffusion models (DDM) parameterized to index key cognitive components: drift rate (evidence accumulation efficiency), drift bias (perceptual bias), start point (expectation bias), threshold separation (response caution), and non- decision time (encoding/motor processes).

Study ResultsResults revealed that aberrant gaze perception in SZ and BD was driven by less efficient evidence accumulation, perceptual biases predisposing self-referential responses, and greater caution (SZ only). Across SZ and HC, poorer social functioning was related to greater expectation biases. Within SZ, perceptual and expectancy biases were associated with hallucination and delusion severity, respectively.

ConclusionsThese findings indicate that diminished evidence accumulation and perceptual biases may underlie altered gaze perception in patients and that SZ may engage in compensatory cautiousness, sacrificing response speed to preserve accuracy. Moreover, biases at the belief and perceptual levels may relate to symptoms and functioning. Computational modeling can, therefore, be used to achieve a more nuanced, cognitive process-level understanding of the mechanisms of social cognitive difficulties, including gaze perception, in individuals with SZ and BD.","NA","medrxiv",1725142203830

Previous methods focused on higher heteroplasmy mutations that are limited in number and can be influenced by functional selection, introducing biases for lineage tracing. Although more challenging to detect, intermediate to low heteroplasmy mtDNA mutations are valuable due to their high diversity, abundance, and lower propensity to selection. To enhance mtDNA mutation detection and facilitate fine-scale lineage tracing, we developed the single-cell Regulatory multi-omics with Deep Mitochondrial mutation profiling (ReDeeM) approach, an integrated experimental and computational framework. Recently, some concerns have been raised about the analytical workflow in the ReDeeM framework. Specifically, it was noted that the mutations detected in a single molecule per cell are enriched on edges of mtDNA molecules, suggesting they resemble artifacts reported in other sequencing approaches. It was then proposed that all mutations found in one molecule per cell should be removed. We detail our error correction method, demonstrating that the observed edge mutations are distinct from previously reported sequencing artifacts. We further show that the proposed removal leads to massive elimination of bona fide and informative mutations. Indeed, mutations accumulating on edges impact a minority of all mutation calls (for example, in hematopoietic stem cells, the excess mutations on the edge account for only 4.3%-7.6% of the total). Recognizing the value of addressing edge mutations even after applying consensus correction, we provide an additional filtering option in the ReDeeM-R package. This approach effectively eliminates the position biases, leads to a mutational signature indistinguishable from bona fide mitochondrial mutations, and removes excess low molecule high connectedness mutations. Importantly, this option preserves the large majority of unique mutations identified by ReDeeM, maintaining the ability of ReDeeM to provide a more than 10-fold increase in variant detection compared to previous methods. Additionally, the cells remain well-connected. While there is room for further refinement in mutation calling strategies, the significant advances and biological insights provided by the ReDeeM framework are unique and remain intact. We hope that this detailed discussion and analysis enables the community to employ this approach and contribute to its further development.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

This study investigates how molecular crowding, specifically the size and shape of crowders like Dextran and Ficoll, modulates the conformational states and phase separation behavior of Sup35NM. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and molecular dynamics simulations, we observed that Dextran, depending on its molecular weight, induces both compaction and expansion of Sup35NM, driving phase separation at certain thresholds. Notably, rod-like Dextran crowders promote phase separation, while spherical Ficoll does not, highlighting the impact of crowder geometry on IDP behavior.

In zebrafish, these two ribosome types are expressed from different genomic loci and also differ in their ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequence. To characterize this dual ribosome system further, we examined the expression patterns of maternal and somatic rRNAs during embryogenesis and in adult tissues. We found that maternal rRNAs are not only expressed during oogenesis but are continuously produced in the zebrafish germline. Proteomic analyses of maternal and somatic ribosomes unveiled differences in core ribosomal protein composition. Most nucleotide differences between maternal and somatic rRNAs are located in the flexible, structurally not resolved expansion segments. Our in vivo data demonstrated that both maternal and somatic ribosomes can be translationally active in the embryo. Using transgenically tagged maternal or somatic ribosome subunits, we experimentally confirm the presence of hybrid 80S ribosomes composed of 40S and 60S subunits from both origins and demonstrate the preferential in vivo association of maternal ribosomes with germline-specific transcripts. Our study identifies a distinct type of ribosomes in the zebrafish germline and thus presents a foundation for future explorations into possible regulatory mechanisms and functional roles of heterogeneous ribosomes.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

To explore it, we analyzed deep proteomic and transcriptomic data from over 1,000 human samples, including 6 cancer types and 26 healthy human tissues. This global analysis identified 60,024 high confidence substitutions corresponding to 8,801 unique sites in 1,990 proteins. Some substitutions are shared across samples, while others exhibit strong tissue-type and cancer specificity. Surprisingly, products of alternate translation are more abundant than their canonical counterparts for hundreds of proteins, suggesting sense codon recoding. Recoded proteins include transcription factors, proteases, signaling proteins, and proteins associated with neurodegeneration. Mechanisms contributing to substitution abun-dance include protein stability, codon frequency, codon-anticodon mismatches, and RNA modifications. We characterize sequence motifs around alternatively translated amino acids and how substitution ratios vary across protein domains, tissue types and cancers. Both the sequence and the tissue-specificity of alternatively translated proteins are conserved between human and mouse. These results demonstrate the contribution of alternate translation to diversifying mammalian proteomes, and its association with protein stability, tissue-specific proteomes, and diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1725142203830

Although most biofilms are stationary, Flavobacterium johnsoniae forms a motile spherical biofilm called a zorb, which is propelled by its base cells and contains a polysaccharide core. Here, we report formation of spatially organized, motile, multispecies biofilms, designated ""co-zorbs,"" that are distinguished by a core-shell structure. F. johnsoniae forms zorbs whose cells collect other bacterial species and transport them to the zorb core, forming a co-zorb. Live imaging revealed that co-zorbs also form in zebrafish, thereby demonstrating a new type of bacterial movement in vivo. This discovery opens new avenues for understanding community behaviors, the role of biofilms in bulk bacterial transport, and collective strategies for microbial success in various environments.

Significance StatementThis paper reports the discovery of co-zorbs, which are spherical aggregates of bacteria that move and transport other bacteria. Zorbs move toward other bacteria and collect them in a manner reminiscent of phagocytes. Once inside the zorb, the new species form a striking, organized core. The discovery of co-zorbs introduces an entirely new type of bacterial movement and transport involving cooperation among bacterial species. Co-zorbs have potential for engineering microbial systems for biotechnology applications and for managing spread of bacterial pathogens in their hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

Interference with transcription factors can lead to counter-silencing of XS target promoters but typically requires promoter engineering. In this study, we developed a novel CRISPR/dCas-mediated counter-silencing (CRISPRcosi) approach by using nuclease-deficient dCas enzymes to counteract the Lsr2-like XS protein CgpS in Corynebacterium glutamicum or Lsr2 in Streptomyces venezuelae. Systematic in vivo reporter studies with dCas9 and dCas12a and various guide RNAs revealed effective counter-silencing of different CgpS target promoters in response to guide RNA/dCas DNA binding, independent of promoter sequence modifications. The most prominent CRISPRcosi effect was observed when targeting the CgpS nucleation site, an effect that was also seen in S. venezuelae when targeting a known Lsr2 nucleation site. Analyzing the system in strains lacking the XS protein CgpS revealed varying strengths of counteracting CRISPR interference effects based on the target position and strand. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling in sgRNA/dCas9 co-expressing wild-type strains revealed high counter-silencing specificity with minimal off-target effects. Thus, CRISPRcosi provides a promising system for the precise upregulation of XS target genes with significant potential for studying gene networks as well as for developing applications in biotechnology and synthetic biology.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

This organelle traverses the apical polar ring (APR) in response to calcium waves and plays a critical role in controlling parasite motility. While the actomyosin-dependent extrusion of the conoid is beginning to be understood, the mechanism by which it is anchored apically to the APR remains unclear. RNG2, a protein localized at both the conoid and the APR, has emerged as a key candidate for this function. By combining iterative ultrastructure expansion microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy we discovered that RNG2 forms 22 tethers between the APR and the conoid. The unique biochemical properties of RNG2, including several proteolytic processing events and its ability to form concatenations, enable it to function as a dynamic bridge between these structures. Conditional depletion of RNG2 resulted in the conoid organelle detaching from the APR without compromising the integrity of its structure, thereby confirming RNG2 essential tethering role. Although microneme secretion remains normal, parasites lacking RNG2 were unable to move and impaired in rhoptry discharge, highlighting the conoid's crucial role in parasite motility and invasion. RNG2 is a pivotal protein that ensures conoid functionality in Coccidia.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

Here, we utilized comparative genome-resolved metagenomics of a high-quality Illumina-sequenced sample from the Cauquenes copper tailing in central Chile. We investigate the metabolic roles and evolutionary behaviors of the resident microorganisms, focusing on capacities related to copper, iron, and sulfur metabolism. We recovered 44 medium and high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), primarily classified belonging to phylum Actinobacteriota (21), Proteobacteria (10), and Acidobacteriota (6). These MAGs were compared to the Global Soil MAGs project (SMAG catalog), which includes bacteria from conventional or natural ecosystems, to uncover specialized properties of mining bacteria. Notably, we discovered a new phylum, Nitrospirota_A, and provided insights into the unexplored taxonomic classifications at the lowest ranks such as genus and species. Functional potential analysis revealed that the mining community has enhanced molecular capabilities associated with sulfur and copper metabolism. Evolutionary analysis revealed that mining genes involved in targeted metabolism are under strong negative selection, indicating conservative evolutionary pressure within the mining environment. In particular, it was possible to identify a MAG from the genus Acidithrix with a global dN/dS ratio greater than 1, suggesting positive selection. Additionally, core proteins essential for bacterial survival, such as flagellar motors, cell cycle regulators, and biogenesis proteins, were also under positive selection. The latter points to the need for enhanced mobility in these microorganisms to locate resources efficiently. We demonstrate that copper mining communities are diverse and possess a significant metabolic repertoire under extreme conditions in sulfur and copper proteins. Those specialized genes appear to be in a conservative state rather than undergoing adaptive evolution. This study enhances our understanding of extremophile mining microbiomes, highlighting their high variability in classification, metabolic functions, evolution, and adaptation, which can be leveraged for further biotechnological applications.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

Despite having the most complex, segmented bacterial genome, little is known about Borrelia burgdorferi DnaA and its role in maintaining the spirochetes physiology. In this work we utilized inducible CRISPR-interference and overexpression to modulate cellular levels of DnaA to better understand this essential protein. Dysregulation of DnaA, either up or down, increased or decreased cell lengths, respectively, while also significantly slowing replication rates. Using fluorescent microscopy, we found the DnaA CRISPRi mutants had increased numbers of chromosomes with irregular spacing patterns. DnaA-depleted spirochetes also exhibited a significant defect in helical morphology. RNA-seq of the conditional mutants showed significant changes in the levels of transcripts involved with flagellar synthesis, elongation, cell division, virulence, and other functions. These findings demonstrate that the DnaA plays a commanding role in maintaining borrelial growth dynamics and protein expression, which are essential for the survival of the Lyme disease spirochete.

IMPORTANCELyme disease is the most prevalent tick-borne infection in the Northern Hemisphere. Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative spirochete bacteria, has been maintained in nature for millennia in a consistent enzootic cycle between Ixodes ticks and various small vertebrate hosts. During the ticks blood meal, B. burgdorferi substantially increases its replication rate, alters its repertoire of outer surface proteins, and disseminates into the new vertebrate host. Across eubacteria, DnaA is the master regulatory protein that initiates chromosomal replication and acts as a transcription factor to regulate specific pathways. Here, we describe the roles that B. burgdorferi DnaA has on the physiology and gene expression of this medically important pathogen.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

ObjectiveTo describe incidence and prevalence of medicines with suggested shortages in at least one European country

DesignWe performed a descriptive cohort study between 2010 in a network of databases which have mapped their data to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM).

SettingSetting included primary care, secondary care, and various disease registries whose previously collected data was leveraged.

ParticipantsWe included all patients with at least 365 days of history on the database.

ExposuresWe investigated all medicines with a suggested shortage in at least one European country for more than 365 days (n=18). Furthermore, we assessed their alternatives as well (n=39).

Main outcomes and measuresWe estimated annual incidence rates and period prevalence of all medicines with suggested shortages and their alternatives. A drop in incidence or prevalence of more than 33% after the shortage announce by the European Medicines Agency was considered confirmation of a shortage.

ResultsAmong 41 databases from Europe and the United States, we observed shortages according to incidence for 12 drugs and shortages according to prevalence for 4 drugs. The drugs varenicline, cetrorelix, and amoxicillin plus clavulanate were in shortage in the most countries.

Conclusion and relevanceWe compiled and analysed data of annual incidence and prevalence of 57 medicines among 41 databases in Europe and the United States. We detected shortages of several drugs and suggest monitoring and stewardship for drug availability.","NA","medrxiv",1725142203830

However, this carboxylic acid-containing lead had poor membrane permeability and other liabilities that made optimization difficult. Here, we developed a shape- based virtual screening pipeline - FrankenROCS - to identify new macrodomain inhibitors using fragment X-ray crystal structures. We used FrankenROCS to exhaustively screen the Enamine high-throughput screening (HTS) collection of 2.1 million compounds and selected 39 compounds for testing, with the most potent compound having an IC50 value equal to 130 M. We then paired FrankenROCS with an active learning algorithm (Thompson sampling) to efficiently search the Enamine REAL database of 22 billion molecules, testing 32 compounds with the most potent having an IC50 equal to 220 M. Further optimization led to analogs with IC50 values better than 10 M, with X-ray crystal structures revealing diverse binding modes despite conserved chemical features.

Among the available tools for human data, mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) has a high potential due to its ability to be used in conjunction with single-cell chromatin accessibility data, giving access to the cell phenotype. Nonetheless, the existing mutation calling tools are ill-equipped to deal with the polyploid nature of the mtDNA and lack a robust statistical framework. Here we introduce scMitoMut, an innovative R package that leverages statistical methodologies to accurately identify mitochondrial lineage related mutations at the single-cell level. scMitoMut assigns a mutation quality q-value based on beta-binomial distribution to each mutation at each locus within individual cells, ensuring higher sensitivity and precision of lineage related mutation calling in comparison to current methodologies. We tested scMitoMut using single-cell DNA sequencing, scATAC sequencing and 10x Genomics single cell multiome datasets. Using a single-cell DNA sequencing dataset from a mixed population of cell lines, scMitoMut demonstrated superior sensitivity in identifying small proportion of cancer cell lines compared to existing methods. In a human colorectal cancer scATAC dataset, scMitoMut identified more mutations than state-of-the-art methods. Applied to 10x Genomics multiome datasets, scMitoMut effectively measured the lineage distance in cells from blood or brain tissues. Thus, the scMitoMut is a free available (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/scMitoMut.html.), well-engineered toolkit for mtDNA mutation calling with high memory and CPU efficiency.

Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), extracellular glutamate levels increase, contributing to excitotoxicity, circuit dysfunction, and morbidity. Increased neuronal glutamate release and compromised astrocyte-mediated uptake contribute to elevated glutamate, but the mechanistic and spatiotemporal underpinnings of these changes are not well established. Using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI and iGluSnFR glutamate imaging, we quantified extracellular glutamate dynamics after injury. Three days post-injury, glutamate release was increased, and glutamate uptake and GLT-1 expression were reduced. 7- and 14-days post-injury, glutamate dynamics were comparable between sham and CCI animals. Changes in peak glutamate response were unique to specific cortical layers and proximity to injury. This was likely driven by increases in glutamate release, which was spatially heterogenous, rather than reduced uptake, which was spatially uniform. The astrocyte K+ channel, Kir4.1, regulates activity-dependent slowing of glutamate uptake. Surprisingly, Kir4.1 was unchanged after CCI and accordingly, activity-dependent slowing of glutamate uptake was unaltered. This dynamic glutamate dysregulation after TBI underscores a brief period in which disrupted glutamate uptake may contribute to dysfunction and highlights a potential therapeutic window to restore glutamate homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

It responds to perturbations at the cell surface and the peptidoglycan layer from a variety of sources, including antimicrobial peptides, beta-lactams, and changes in osmolarity. RcsF, an outer membrane lipoprotein, is the sensor for this pathway and activates the phosphorelay by interacting with an inner membrane protein IgaA. IgaA is essential; it negatively regulates the signaling by interacting with the phosphotransferase RcsD. We previously showed that RcsF-dependent signaling does not require the periplasmic domain of the histidine kinase RcsC and identified a dominant negative mutant of RcsD that can block signaling via increased interactions with IgaA. However, how the inducting signals are sensed and how signal is transduced to activate the transcription of the Rcs regulon remains unclear. In this study, we investigated how the Rcs cascade functions without its only known sensor, RcsF and characterized the underlying regulatory mechanisms for three distinct RcsF-independent inducers. Previous reports showed that Rcs signaling can be induced in the absence of RcsF by a loss of function mutation in the periplasmic oxidoreductase DsbA or by overexpression of the DnaK cochaperone DjlA. We identified an inner membrane protein, DrpB, as a multicopy RcsF-independent Rcs activator in E. coli. The loss of the periplasmic oxidoreductase DsbA and the overexpression of the DnaK cochaperone DjlA each trigger the Rcs cascade in the absence of RcsF by weakening IgaA-RcsD interactions in different ways. In contrast, the cell-division associated protein DrpB uniquely requires the RcsC periplasmic domain for signaling; this domain is not needed for RcsF-dependent signaling. This suggests the possibility that RcsC acts as a sensor for some Rcs signals. Overall, the results add new understanding to how this complex phosphorelay can be activated by diverse mechanisms.

Author summaryThe Rcs phosphorelay signaling cascade regulates the expression of genes related to capsule synthesis, biofilm formation, virulence, and cell division in Enterobacteria and is critical for cell membrane integrity and response to beta-lactam antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides. RcsF is the sole known sensor, but other proteins have been reported to activate this pathway in the absence of RcsF. We have discovered a novel RcsF-independent Rcs activator and found that each of three RcsF-independent proteins activate the system differently. Most significantly, we find that the histidine kinase RcsC can be involved in signal sensing independently of RcsF. Our study sheds light into the complex mechanisms of Rcs activation and adds to our knowledge of non-orthodox signaling systems across organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

Synapse dysfunction and loss are strongly related to cognitive decline in AD. This study integrates genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and immunohistological (multi-omics) data and longitudinal cognitive data across several AD cohorts to elucidate the molecular drivers associated with astrocytes and microglia involved in these processes. Our findings demonstrate that activation of microglia and astrocytes occurs in specific cell subsets that are enriched in AD risk genes. Transcriptomic evidence for early microglial activation precedes immunohistological expression of severe neuropathology. Proteomic markers of astrocytic response appear to be most strongly associated with accelerated cognitive decline. However, we also found that brains from donors with a history of more rapid cognitive decline showed evidence for reduced SNAP25-VAMP interactions indicative of synaptic dysfunction, exhibited higher neurotoxic astrocyte reactivity, and were associated with the expression of neuronal markers of injury. Related molecular signatures in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma may provide biomarkers to identify patients at higher risk for rapid cognitive decline. Together, our results connect glial activation to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD and highlight roles for microglial activation in the genesis of AD and later astrocyte activation as a potential determinant of clinical symptom progression.","NA","medrxiv",1725142203830

These data facilitated the construction of a time-calibrated fern phylogeny covering all major clades, revealing numerous whole-genome duplications and highlighting the uniqueness of fern genetics, with half of the uncovered gene families being fern-specific. Our investigation into fern cell walls through biochemical and immunological analyses identified occurrences of the lignin syringyl unit and its independent evolution in ferns. Moreover, the discovery of an unusual sugar in fern cell walls hints at a divergent evolutionary path in cell wall biochemistry, potentially driven by gene duplication and sub-functionalization. We provide an online database preloaded with genomic and transcriptomic data for ferns and other land plants, which we used to identify an independent evolution of lignocellulosic gene modules in ferns. Our data provide a framework for the unique evolutionary path that ferns have navigated since they split from the last common ancestor of euphyllophytes more than 360 million years ago.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

They are involved in the biosynthesis of primary and specialized metabolites, including salicylic acid (SA), a key defense phytohormone synthesized via the conserved chorismate biosynthetic pathway. However, the identity of the signal(s) that ultimately triggers SA induction in chloroplasts upon perception of a biotic threat has remained elusive. Here, we provide evidence of a functional link between chloroplast-derived reactive oxygen species (cROS) and SA production. We observe that inhibiting ROS bursts generated from photosystem II during plant immune activation completely abrogates the induction of SA synthesis in response to immunity-inducing signals, without affecting SA-independent immune responses. Indeed, time course analyses show that the induction of SA marker genes parallels that of cROS production during an immune response. Consistent with this, preventing cROS induction is sufficient to nullify the immune protection normally conferred by activating immunity prior to an infection. Analyses of transcriptomes and photosynthetic efficiency show that two conserved effectors from the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae, HopM1 and AvrE1, redundantly disrupt photosynthesis and cROS bursts. These effects reduce SA accumulation and are mediated via the impact of HopM1 and AvrE1 in inducting host abscisic acid signaling. Our results suggest that a change in chloroplastic redox homeostasis induced by biotic stressors acts as an initiator of plant immunity through the production of SA, and that this response is targeted by conserved pathogen effector proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

T cells, in particular, leverage their unique T cell receptors (TCRs) to detect specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-presented peptides. TCR activation is then relayed via linker for activation of T cells (LAT), a TCR-proximal disordered adapter protein, which organizes protein partners and mediates the propagation of signals down diverse pathways including NFAT and AP-1. Here, we studied how balanced downstream pathway activation is encoded in the amino acid sequence of LAT. To comprehensively profile the sequence-function relationship of LAT, we developed a pooled, single-cell, high-content screening approach in which a large series of mutants in the LAT protein were analyzed to characterize their effects on T cell activation. Measuring epigenetic, transcriptomic, and cell surface protein dynamics of single cells harboring distinct LAT mutants, we found functional regions spanning over 40% of the LAT amino acid sequence. Conserved sequence motifs for protein interactions along with charge distribution are critical sequence features, and contribute to interpretation of human genetic variation in LAT. While mutant defect severity spans from moderate to complete loss of function, nearly all defective mutants, irrespective of their position in LAT, confer balanced defects across all downstream pathways. To understand the molecular basis for this observation, we performed proximal protein labeling which demonstrated that disruption of LAT interaction with a single partner protein indirectly disrupts other partner interactions, likely through the dual roles of these proteins as effectors of downstream pathways and bridging factors between LAT molecules. Overall, we report widely distributed functional regions throughout a disordered adapter and a precise physical organization of LAT and interacting molecules which constrains signaling outputs. More broadly, we describe an approach for interrogating sequence-function relationships for proteins with complex activities across regulatory layers of the cell.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

Mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction is associated with lack of physical activity and considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs) aflicting our societies such as T2D, CVD, metabolic syndrome, and even AD.

To our knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies on the metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular characteristics of ""healthy sedentary"" individuals living without clinical symptoms. Hence, the main aim of our study herein was to characterize multiple metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular bioenergetic signatures in ""healthy sedentary"" individuals which could already be downregulated compared to moderately active individuals.

Nineteen subjects, 9 sedentary (SED) and 10 moderately active (AC) volunteered for multiple assessments including muscle biopsies, in order to assess muscle metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics both at rest and during exercise.

For our exercise studies, we performed graded exercise testing (GXT) to assess carbohydrate and fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity according to our previously developed methodology.

Resting studies showed decreased mitochondrial respiration including decreases in complex I (-36%) and II (-28%) as well as total electron system capacity (-34%) and electron system capacity coupled to ATP production via ATP synthase (-30%). Regarding muscle carbohydrate metabolism, SED individuals showed a decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation (-37%) as well as reduced expression (-49%) of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Regarding fatty acid metabolism, SED showed decreased activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1)(-51%) and CPT2 (-44%) as well as decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (-35%). Metabolomics analysis also confirmed downregulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) identified distinct metabolic phenotypes through intermediates of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Further, we found significant differences in cardiolipin (CL) species expression between SED and AC groups, which, due to the important role of CL in mitochondrial structure, function, biogenesis and bioenergetics, deserves further attention.

Exercise studies also showed significant differences in substrate utilization between groups where SED possessed a significantly lower fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity. The correlation of different bioenergetic parameters between resting and exercise conditions were robust, suggesting the possibility of performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) as a non-invasive methodology to indirectly assess metabolic function in multiple populations. In summary, in our study herein, we show that ""healthy sedentary"" individuals already possess a significant decrease in cellular metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics compared to moderately active individuals both during resting and exercising conditions.

Since large numbers of sedentary individuals evolve to develop cardiometabolic disease, a better understanding of decreased cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial function is needed in order to improve both diagnosis and treatment of multiple metabolic diseases.

- Despite similar GLUT-4 concentrations, sedentary individuals show significant decreased pyruvate oxidation as well as expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC).
- During exercise studies, sedentary individuals show significantly decreased levels of fat oxidation and lactate clearance capacity which correlate with mitochondrial and bioenergetics parameters from resting muscle biopsies. Hence, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) accompanied by measuring blood lactate levels could be a practical manner to assess muscle mitochondrial function and bioenergetics in a non-invasive and ambulatory manner.

A knock-in reporter4 reveals distinct, cell-specific period lengths in Hes1 oscillations that form a gradient along the crypt-villus axis. Whereas secretory precursors oscillate at low periods, absorptive precursors oscillate at higher periods before transitioning to a differentiated state. To test the function of different oscillation periods, we innovated a microfluidic system that modulates Hes1 oscillations in organoids. We find that varying the oscillation period modulates secretory cell differentiation: While 90-min oscillations promote Paneth cells, 130-min oscillations increase formation of other secretory subtypes. Moreover, low-period oscillations support stemness and a proliferative state. Our study provides the first clear evidence that information for tissue homeostasis in the intestine is encoded in the temporal dynamics of signalling components.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

Genes encoding many of these weapons can be transmitted horizontally, but the impact on bacterial warfare is not understood. Here, we develop an ecological model of bacterial warfare where there is potential for horizontal gene transfer. Our model predicts that weapon gene transfer from an attacker to a target strain is possible, but at a low rate such that transfer has a negligible impact on competition outcomes. We tested the model empirically using a transmissible plasmid encoding colicin E2, a potent antibacterial toxin produced by Escherichia coli. As predicted by the model, we find that toxin plasmid transfer is feasible during warfare, but the resulting transconjugants remain rare. However, exploring the model further reveals realistic conditions where transfer has major impacts. Specifically, the model predicts that whenever competing strains have access to some unique nutrients, transconjugants can proliferate and reach high abundances. In support of these predictions, short- and long-term experiments show that transconjugants can thrive when nutrient competition is relaxed. Our work shows how horizontal gene transfer can reshape bacterial warfare in a way that can benefit a weapon gene but not the bacteria that carries it.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

These results establish a novel approach for whole-organism spatial transcriptomics, provide a comprehensive spatially resolved atlas of gene expression and chromatin accessibility, and reveal the diversity, precision and emergence of embryonic patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

Arabidopsis lyrata appears to be the most polyploidy-rich species-complex in the Arabidopsis genus, with multiple origins of autotetraploidy. This is revealed by genomic data from over 400 samples across Eurasia. We found over 30 previously undescribed autotetraploid populations in Siberia with a minimum of two separate origins, independent of those previously reported in Central Europe. The establishment of Siberian tetraploids is mediated by meiotic adaptation at the same genes as in European tetraploid A. lyrata and Arabidopsis arenosa, despite high divergence and geographical separation. Haplotype analysis based on synthetic long-read assemblies supports the long-range introgression of adaptive alleles from the tetraploid interspecific pool of European A. lyrata and A. arenosa to tetraploid Siberian A. lyrata. Once evolved, adaptation to polyploidy promotes the establishment of new polyploid lineages through adaptive inter- and intraspecific introgression.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

One of the nine human NaV isoforms, NaV1.8, is a promising target for analgesics, and selective inhibitors are of interest as therapeutics. One such inhibitor, the gating-modifier peptide Protoxin-I derived from tarantula venom, blocks channel opening by shifting the activation voltage threshold to more depolarised potentials, but the structural basis for this inhibition has not previously been determined. Using monolayer graphene grids, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy structures of full-length human apo-NaV1.8 and the Protoxin-I-bound complex at 3.1 [A] and 2.8 [A] resolution, respectively. The apo structure shows an unexpected movement of the Domain I S4-S5 helix, and VSDI was unresolvable.

Here, we show that the YqjD/ElaB/YgaM paralogs, initially discovered as membrane-bound ribosome binding proteins in E. coli, constitute an abundant class of ribosome-hibernating proteins, which are conserved across all proteobacteria and some other bacterial phyla. Our data demonstrate that they inhibit in vitro protein synthesis by interacting with the 50S ribosomal subunit. In vivo cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry reveals their specific interactions with proteins surrounding the ribosomal tunnel exit and even their penetration into the ribosomal tunnel.

Extreme publishing behavior was defined as having >60 full articles (original articles, reviews, conference papers) in a single calendar year and indexed in Scopus. We identified 3,191 authors with extreme publishing behavior across science excluding Physics and 12,624 such authors in Physics. While Physics had much higher numbers of extreme publishing authors in the past, in 2022 extreme publishing authors was almost as numerous in non-Physics and Physics disciplines (1,226 vs. 1,480). Excluding Physics, China had the largest number of extreme publishing authors, followed by the USA. The largest fold-wise increases between 2016 and 2022 (5-19-fold) occurred in Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Spain, India, Italy, Russia, Pakistan, and South Korea. Excluding Physics, most extreme publishing authors were in Clinical Medicine, but from 2016 to 2022 the largest relative increases (>6-fold) were seen in Agriculture, Fisheries & Forestry, Biology, and Mathematics and Statistics. Extreme publishing authors accounted for 4,360 of the 10,000 most-cited authors (based on raw citation count) across science.

We examined whether this extended to alterations in circadian rhythms and sleep, such as those induced by chronic social defeat stress, using actigraphy and wireless EEG. CFA-induced inflammatory pain profoundly altered sleep architecture in male and female mice. Injection of the hind paw, whether with CFA or saline, reduced some measures of circadian rhythmicity such as variance, period, and amplitude. CFA increased sleep duration primarily in the dark phase, while sleep bout length was decreased in the light and increased in the dark phase. Additionally, CFA reduced wake bout length, especially during the dark phase. Increases in REM and SWS duration and bouts were most significant in the dark phase, regardless of whether CFA had been injected at its onset or 12 hours prior. Taken together, these results indicate that inflammatory pain acutely promotes but also fragments sleep.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

However, the identities of RNAs whose localization is regulated by a specific RBP as well as the impacts of that RNA localization on cell function have generally remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the RBP HNRNPA2B1 acts to keep specific RNAs out of neuronal projections. Using subcellular fractionation, high-throughput sequencing, and single molecule RNA FISH, we find that hundreds of RNAs demonstrate markedly increased abundance in neurites in HNRNPA2B1 knockout cells. These RNAs often encode motor proteins and are enriched for known HNRNPA2B1 binding sites and motifs in their 3' UTRs. The speed and processivity of microtubule-based transport is impaired in these cells, specifically in their neurites. HNRNPA2B1 point mutations that increase its cytoplasmic abundance relative to wildtype lead to stronger suppression of RNA mislocalization defects than seen with wildtype HNRNPA2B1. We further find that the subcellular localizations of HNRNPA2B1 target RNAs are sensitive to perturbations of RNA decay machinery, suggesting that it is HNRNPA2B1s known role in regulating RNA stability that may explain these observations. These findings establish HNRNPA2B1 as a negative regulator of neurite RNA abundance and link the subcellular activities of motor proteins with the subcellular abundance of the RNAs that encode them.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

A central question is how individual subunits within these complexes can evolve novel functions while maintaining the integrity of the original assembly. Here, we explore this question by tracing the evolutionary trajectory of the plant exocyst, an octameric complex essential for exocytosis in eukaryotes. Remarkably, the Exo70 subunit underwent dramatic expansion and functional divergence in plants. We demonstrate that electrostatic alterations in the N-terminal region of the Exo70 subunit precipitated its dissociation from the exocyst complex. This release mitigated paralog interference, thereby facilitating the subunits extensive functional co-option. Our findings reveal a nuanced mechanism by which a protein subunit, ancestrally constrained within a multimeric complex, can escape those constraints and evolve novel functions, shedding light on the molecular underpinnings of cellular innovation.

The permeability characteristics of the membrane determined several key functions of this network by determining which compounds could enter the compartment and which compounds could not. One key feature of known life is the utilisation of right-handed D- ribose and deoxyribose sugars and left-handed L- amino acid stereochemical isomers (enantiomers), however, it is not clear why life adopted this specific chirality. We previously demonstrated that an archaeal and an intermediate membrane mimic, bearing a mixture of bacterial and archaeal lipid characteristics (a  hybrid membrane), display increased permeability compared to bacterial-like membranes. Here, we investigate if these membranes can drive stereochemical selection on pentose sugars, hexose sugars and amino acids. Using permeability assays of homogenous unilamellar vesicles, we demonstrate that both membranes select for D- ribose and deoxyribose sugars while the hybrid membrane uniquely selects for a reduced alphabet of L- facing amino acids. This repertoire includes alanine, the plausible first L- amino acid utilised. We conclude such compartments could provide stereochemical compound selection thereby demonstrating a solution to the chirality problem during the evolution of life.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

These compounds have applications in medicine, biotechnology, and agriculture. Their production is encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), groups of genes collectively directing their biosynthesis. The advent of metagenomics has allowed researchers to study BGCs directly from environmental samples, identifying numerous previously unknown BGCs encoding unprecedented chemistry. Here, we present the BGC Atlas (https://bgc-atlas.cs.uni-tuebingen.de), a web resource that facilitates the exploration and analysis of BGC diversity in metagenomes. The BGC Atlas identifies and clusters BGCs from publicly available datasets, offering a centralized database and a web interface for metadata-aware exploration of BGCs and gene cluster families (GCFs). We analyzed over 35,000 datasets from MGnify, identifying nearly 1.8 million BGCs, which were clustered into GCFs. The analysis showed that ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are the most abundant compound class, with most GCFs exhibiting high environmental specificity. We believe that our tool will enable researchers to easily explore and analyze the BGC diversity in environmental samples, significantly enhancing our understanding of bacterial secondary metabolites, and promote the identification of ecological and evolutionary factors shaping the biosynthetic potential of microbial communities.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

However, a common confusion lies in equating the protein structure prediction problem with the protein folding problem. The former provides a static structure, while the latter explains the dynamic folding pathway to that structure. We challenge the current status quo and advocate that AF2 has indeed learned some protein folding prin- ciples, despite being designed for structure prediction. AF2s high-dimensional parameters encode an imperfect biophysical scoring function. Typically, AF2 uses multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to guide the search within a narrow re- gion of its learned surface. In our study, we operate AF2 without MSAs or initial templates, forcing it to sample its entire energy landscape -- more akin to an ab initio approach. Among over 7,000 proteins, a fraction fold using sequence alone, highlighting the smoothness of AF2s learned energy surface. Additionally, by combining recycling and iterative predictions, we discover multiple AF2 interme- diate structures in good agreement with known experimental data. AF2 appears to follow a ""local first, global later"" folding mechanism. For designed proteins with more optimized local interactions, AF2s energy landscape is too smooth to detect intermediates even when it should. Our current work sheds new light on what AF2 has learned and opens exciting possibilities to advance our understanding of protein folding and for experimental discovery of folding intermediates.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

Each of the two genomes were broken up into 100-kB segments, each of which was searched for matches to a large set of porcine queries. All scans sought matches to the same set of 813,194 40-mer nucleotide queries randomly selected from the genome of Sus scrofa (domestic pig). For each of the two study organisms, mean segmental match rates (MSMRs) were then calculated for all segments in each of three categories: those segments occurring on autosomes, those on the X chromosome, and those on the Y chromosome.

ResultsIn scans of single-copy regions (euchromatin) in both their Y chromosomes and their autosomes, it was found that the number of matches to randomly selected porcine queries was higher in humans than in bonobos. When autosomes were compared, matches were 1.3% higher in humans than in bonobos. This figure is equal to the percentage of human autosomal nucleotide positions bearing nucleotides that match in pig but not in bonobo. Remarkably, it agrees with the percentage of autosomal nucleotides previously reported to differ in bonobos and humans. So, the results of this study indicate that essentially all the nucleotide positions that differ in humans and bonobos, are the same in humans and pigs. In addition, the number of matches to pig queries found on the human Y chromosome was 34.5% higher than on the bonobo Y, and 12.4% higher than on the chimpanzee Y (the chimpanzee figure may be the more reliable of the two, since the bonobo Y nucleotide sequence file scanned contained only unlocalized scaffolds). MSMRs for the human and bonobo X chromosomes did not significantly differ.","NA","biorxiv",1725142203830

However, whether 2.3.4.4b H5N1 circulating in non-human mammals can establish human infections and spread among humans is unclear. Gain-of-function research restrictions preclude assessing human adapting mutations of 2.3.4.4b H5N1. Here, we tracked the evolution of 2.3.4.4b H5N1 that infected non-human mammals and evaluated their ability to gain human adaptations. The non-human mammal 2.3.4.4b H5N1 partly acquired classical human adapting mutations, which are identical to the residues of H1N1pdm09 and seasonal human H3N2 infections while showing a few species-specific adaptations that might be potential barriers for successful human adaptations. Despite minimal changes in Hemagglutinin (HA), A160T and T199I mutations near the receptor binding site of HA in dairy cattle viruses indicate the rapid HA glycan surface evolution affecting virus entry and immune evasion. The quantitative assessment indicated that 2.3.4.4b H5N1 circulating in bears, cattle, dolphins, and foxes show higher human adaptive potential than other hosts. Also, H5N1 infections in mammals across time showed a unique set of adaptations in the 2.3.4.4b clade compared to previously circulating strains, especially the acquisition of Q591 adaptation in PB2 that enables human adaptation. Thus, 2.3.4.4b H5N1 acquires human adaptations due to natural selection pressure in non-human mammals. Overall, our study delineates human adaptation and infection risk of specific non-human mammalian circulating HPAI 2.3.4.4b H5N1 strains.

Existing databases contain extensive, experimentally derived annotations of intrinsic disorder for millions of proteins at the sequence level. However, only a tiny fraction of these IDRs are associated with an experimentally determined protein structure. Moreover, even if a structure exists, parts of the disordered regions may still be unresolved.

ResultsHere we organize Structures of Intrinsically Disordered Regions (StrIDR), a database of IDRs confirmed via experimental or homology-based evidence, resolved in experimentally determined structures. The database can provide useful insights into the dynamics, folding, and interactions of IDRs. It can also facilitate computational studies on IDRs, such as those using molecular dynamics simulations and/or machine learning.

Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation.

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1725142203830
