Yet, rest is not idle; it involves streams of thoughts. Are these ongoing thoughts reflected in rsFC? To test this question, we developed a novel annotated rest paradigm where participants rated and verbally described their thoughts after each rest period during functional MRI (N = 60). Our findings revealed rich and idiosyncratic thoughts across individuals. Similarity in thoughts was associated with more similar rsFC patterns within and across individuals. In addition, both thought ratings and topics could be decoded from rsFC. Furthermore, neuromarkers of these thoughts generalized to unseen individuals in the Human Connectome Project dataset (N = 908), where decoded thought patterns during rest predicted positive vs. negative trait-level individual differences. Together, our findings reveal that ongoing thoughts at rest are reflected in brain dynamics and these network patterns predict everyday cognition and experiences. Understanding subjective in-scanner experiences is thus crucial in characterizing the relationship between individual differences in functional brain organization and behavior.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BCS-2043740 (M.D.R.);""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199

Sometimes input is surprising, under which circumstances the brain must calibrate erroneous predictions so that perception is veridical. Despite the extensive literature investigating the nature of prediction error signalling, it is still unclear how this process interacts with the functionally segregated nature of the visual cortex, particularly within the temporal domain. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from humans whilst they viewed static image trajectories containing a bound object that sequentially changed along different visual attribute dimensions (shape and colour). Crucially, the context of this change was designed to appear random (and unsurprising) or violate the established trajectory (and cause a surprise). Event-related potential analysis found no effects of surprise after controlling for cortical adaptation. However, multivariate pattern analyses found whole-brain neural representations of visual surprise that overlapped between attributes, albeit at distinct, attribute-specific latencies. These findings suggest that visual surprise results in whole-brain, generalised (i.e., attribute-agnostic) prediction error responses that conform to an attribute-dependent temporal hierarchy.","[{""name"":""Australian Government"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0314h5y94"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199

We identify obesity-associated transcriptional changes across multiple Endometrial Stromal Cell (ESC) states and innate immune populations, including uterine natural killer cells and macrophages.

Yet, the diversity of major plant-associated bacteria groups like Hyphomicrobiales (Alphaproteobacteria) remain largely uncharacterized in the phyllosphere, due to limitations of 16S rRNA metabarcoding and biases in reference databases toward model taxa and environments. Using a meta-analysis combining metabarcoding, metagenomics and phylogenomics, we explored the worldwide diversity of leaf-associated Hyphomicrobiales. We confirmed Methylobacterium was ubiquitous in the phyllosphere and revealed the dominance of two under-characterized Hyphomicrobiales taxa: Lichenibacterium, a recently described genus of lichen-associated bacteria previously identified as 1174-901-12 in taxonomic databases, and RH-AL1, an undescribed genus of bacteria related to Beijerinckiaceae, previously isolated from coal slag. Despite their abundance in the phyllosphere, Lichenibacterium and RH_AL1 could not be properly detected by classical 16S rRNA gene barcoding, underlining biases in reference databases and a lack of taxonomic resolution for this marker gene. As for Methylobacterium, a significant proportion of Lichenibacterium and RH-AL1 were also detected in association with lichens and in environments with harsh conditions like exposed surfaces, air and snow, suggesting airborne or waterborne dispersal and high resilience in harsh environments. Overall our study stresses the need to move toward metagenomics and culturomics to increase the representativeness of leaf-associated bacterial taxa in reference databases, and to improve our understanding of the evolutionary and functional mechanisms underpinning bacteria adaptations to living on plants.","[{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGPIN-2024-05825;RGPIN-2025-05608;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199

This shift increases throughput, improves reproducibility, and expands the functional capabilities of microscopes. However, the current landscape is highly fragmented. Academic researchers often develop custom solutions for specific scientific needs, while industry offerings are typically proprietary and tied to specific hardware. This diversity, while fostering innovation, also creates major challenges in interoperability, reproducibility, and standardization, which slows progress and adaption. This article presents a collaborative effort between academic and industry leaders to survey the current state of smart microscopy, highlight representative implementations, and identify common technical and organizational barriers. We propose a framework for greater interoperability based on shared standards, modular software design, and community-driven development. Our goal is to support collaboration across the field and lay the groundwork for a more connected, reusable, and accessible smart microscopy ecosystem. We conclude with a call to action for researchers, hardware developers, and institutions to join in building an open, interoperable foundation that will unlock the full potential of smart microscopy in life science research.","[{""name"":""Uniscientia"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""187-2021;""},{""name"":""SNF Sinergia"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRSII5_183550;""},{""name"":""Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RIF-2;""},{""name"":""Swedish National Microscopy Infrastructure, NMI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VR-RFI 2023-00163;""},{""name"":""Marie Sklodowska-Curie"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Swedish Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03zttf063"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2023-05450;2019-02355;2023-02387;""},{""name"":""IngaBritt and Arne Lundberg foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Crafoord Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02hwwbr17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Seydlitz foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Magnus Bergvall foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Berta Kamprad Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Swedish Cancer Foundation (Cancerfonden)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/004hzzk67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199

We identified dynamic changes in physiological aging highlighting differences in synaptic maintenance and energy-allocation. These were linked to changes associated with fundamental protein biochemical properties such as size and net charge. Network analysis highlighted a decrease in mitochondrial complex I proteins not compensated at the mRNA level. Aggregation of 60S ribosome subunits indicated deteriorating translation efficiency and was accompanied by mitochondrial and proteasomal imbalance. The analysis of the nine models revealed key similarities and differences between physiological aging and pathology.

In humans, the cytosolic (hMDH1) and mitochondrial (hMDH2) isoforms operate in distinct compartments, suggesting potential differences in regulation. Here, we present a comparative analysis of hMDH1 and hMDH2 under physiologically relevant conditions, integrating enzymatic assays, ligand binding studies, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and molecular modeling. Our findings reveal that hMDH2 activity is inhibited by -ketoglutarate, glutamate, NAD+, ATP, and citrate at concentrations consistent with mitochondrial metabolic states characterized by elevated amino acid catabolism or redox stress. Conversely, hMDH1 exhibits minimal impact by these metabolites, with only modest inhibition observed in the presence of ATP and ADP. SAXS analyses confirm that both isoforms maintain stable dimeric structures upon ligand binding, indicating that regulation is not mediated by global conformational changes. Structural modeling and normal mode analyses identify increased flexibility in hMDH1, particularly within the active site loop, thumb loop, and a partially disordered C-terminal helix. In contrast, hMDH2 displays a more rigid architecture and a more electropositive active site environment, correlating with its heightened sensitivity to anionic metabolites. Fluorescence quenching experiments further support these distinctions, demonstrating stronger binding affinities for nucleotide-based ligands in hMDH2 compared to hMDH1. Collectively, these results suggest that isoform-specific regulation of human MDH arises from differences in local structural dynamics and electrostatics, rather than large-scale structural rearrangements. hMDH2 appears adapted to integrate mitochondrial metabolic signals, modulating malate oxidation in response to cellular conditions, while hMDH1 maintains consistent cytosolic function across diverse metabolic states.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MCB RUI-2322867;CHE REU-2150091;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199

Yet, most neurophysiological research on face processing relies on two-dimensional displays, potentially overlooking the role of stereoscopic depth information. Here, we combine immersive virtual reality (VR), electroencephalography (EEG), and eye tracking to examine the neural representation of faces under controlled manipulations of stereoscopic depth. Thirty-four participants viewed computer-generated faces with neutral, happy, angry, and surprised expressions in frontal view under monoscopic and stereoscopic viewing conditions. Using time-resolved multivariate decoding, we show that EEG signals in immersive VR conditions can reliably differentiate facial expressions. Stereoscopic depth cues elicited a distinct and decodable neural signature, confirming the sensitivity of our approach to depth-related processing. Yet, expression decoding remained robust across depth conditions, indicating that under controlled frontal viewing, the neural encoding of facial expressions is invariant to binocular depth cues. Eye tracking showed that expression-related gaze patterns contained comparable information but did not account for neural representations, while depth information was absent in gaze patterns---consistent with dissociable representational processes. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of EEG-based neural decoding in fully immersive VR as a tool for investigating face perception in naturalistic settings and provide new evidence for the stability of expression representations across depth variations in three-dimensional viewing conditions.","[{""name"":""Cooperation between the Max Planck Society and the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NEUROHUM;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199

Multipass transmembrane proteins have increased propensity to be targeted by the RQC, raising the question of whether problems in transmembrane domain insertion and assembly can also cause RQC-eliciting translational arrests. Here, we investigate RQC-mediated quality control of CFTR, a large transmembrane protein mutated in cystic fibrosis. Reporter assays show that although a sizeable fraction of nascent CFTR expressed in HEK293 cells arrests during translation and activates the RQC, multiple interventions compromising CFTR folding and membrane insertion do not exacerbate this response. CFTR translation abortion was also largely unaffected by regulators of translation kinetics such as codon usage, the ribosome collision sensor GCN1, and the SRP ER targeting complex. We propose that the RQC can be triggered by the inherent difficulties in synthesizing transmembrane segments, resulting from their inappropriate interaction with the protein synthesis machinery.

To maintain genome integrity, cells activate DNA repair pathways that prevent harmful outcomes such as cancer or immune dysfunction. In this study, we uncover a novel role for DNA damage during the terminal differentiation of multiciliated cells (MCCs). MCCs, which line the airways, reproductive tracts, and brain ventricles, produce hundreds of motile cilia, each anchored by a centriole. Therefore, MCCs must generate hundreds of centrioles during differentiation. Normally, centriole duplication is tightly linked to the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, raising questions about how MCCs override numerical and temporal restrictions on centriole duplication. We find that differentiating MCCs accumulate extensive double-stranded DNA breaks during centriole amplification, with damage levels correlating with centriole number. DNA damage response (DDR) kinases are essential for supporting centriole biogenesis and ciliogenesis. We also observe that transcriptional activity, required for the expression of centriole and cilia genes, produces RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) that co-localize with DNA damage. This suggests that transcription-coupled DNA damage helps initiate a pseudo-cell cycle program, permitting centriole amplification without triggering full S/G2 phase processes. Our findings indicate that MCCs harness DDR signaling as part of their developmental program, revealing a broader principle in which the canonical cell cycle is adaptively rewired during differentiation.","[{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-2478-22;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM133897;R01GM114119;R01CA266199;R35GM140813;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199

Of increasing interest is the repeated observation that beyond focal lesions, there are also diffuse, surface-in gradients of pathology in MS, wherein damage is most severe directly adjacent to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting surfaces, such as the subpial and periventricular areas. This observation suggests that toxic factors within MS CSF may be contributing to the emergence and/or evolution of surface-in gradients. Directly separating the CSF from the periventricular parenchyma are ependymal cells - a glial epithelium that are equipped with tufts of motile cilia which are critical for circulating CSF solutes and regulating local fluid flow. While damage to ependymal cilia has the potential to drastically modify CSF homeostasis and thus contribute to the damage of CSF exposed regions, these motile cellular structures have yet to be investigated in the context of MS.

MethodsWe first conducted single cell RNA sequencing of fresh human periventricular brain tissue containing ependymal cells from MS patients and non-MS disease controls. We subsequently collected CSF from MS patients and exposed cultured rodent ependymal cells to this CSF in order to evaluate impact on ependymal ciliary function. To complement our direct evaluation of cilia in the context of MS, we also confirmed whether cilia were altered in a classic animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and also designed a novel transgenic animal model to evaluate the cellular and behavioural effect(s) of adult ependymal ciliary disruption.

ResultsSingle cell RNA sequencing analysis of human ependymal cells in MS demonstrated largescale dysregulation of ciliary genes and in situ stains of MS brain tissue confirmed a loss of ependymal cilia. Exposure of ependymal cells to MS CSF led to transcriptional modification of ciliary gene and protein expression and reduced ciliary beating frequency. Likewise, analysis of ependymal cells in EAE also demonstrated altered cilia gene and protein expression. Conditional knockout in adult mice, of the critical cilia-associated gene Ccdc39 in ependymal cells led to transient ventricular enlargement, increased periventricular microglial density, and alterations in nesting behaviour.

ConclusionThese data suggest that motile cilia in ependymal cells are dysregulated in CNS autoimmunity. More importantly, however, they provide evidence to suggest that ependymal cilia disruption could play an active role in the development of periventricular pathology in MS and can lead to behavioural deficits that may underlie aspects non-motor MS symptomatology.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199

Caloric restriction (CR), a well-established intervention, extends longevity in diverse species primarily through inhibition of the TOR signaling pathway. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), a classic serotonergic psychedelic with emerging therapeutic applications, remains largely unexplored in the context of aging. Here, we show that LSD treatment significantly extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans and reduces age-associated lipofuscin accumulation, indicative of delayed cellular aging. LSD reproduces several CR-like phenotypes, including decreased reproductive output and increased nuclear localization of the transcription factor PHA-4/FOXA, without affecting food intake. Moreover, LSD treatment reduces lipid stores and downregulates global protein synthesis, both hallmark signatures of TOR inhibition. These findings establish LSD as a modulator of evolutionarily conserved longevity pathways and suggest that psychedelic signaling can mimic a caloric restriction-like metabolic state, paving the way for the development of novel geroprotective strategies.","[{""name"":""D’Or Institute for Research and Education"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""IDOR/Pioneer Science Initiative"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Coordenação de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B “Meiosis”;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199

Prioritizing causal variants within these loci is critical for characterizing trait biology. Statistical fine mapping identifies causal variants at trait-associated loci, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited GWAS sample sizes prevent the resolution of many associations. Functionally informed approaches augment fine mapping by estimating variant prior causal probabilities based on overlap with trait-relevant functional annotations. However, functional enrichment provides only an indirect proxy for variant functional impact. Sequence-to-function models directly estimate variant effects on molecular phenotypes from underlying sequence context. Borzoi is a long-context model that predicts sequence determinants of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation across diverse tissues and cell types. Here we present Sniff, a Borzoi-informed fine-mapping approach that integrates broad genomic functional annotations with Borzoi-predicted variant effects via PolyFun to estimate variant prior causal probabilities. Applied to 15 UK Biobank traits, Sniff identifies 9.45% additional fine-mapped variants compared to PolyFun-Baseline at posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 0.8. Sniff-prioritized variants exhibit allele-specific activity in reporter assays and are predicted to have tissue-specific activity in trait-relevant tissues. For most traits, genes nominated by Sniff receive higher scores from the orthogonal gene prioritization method PoPS compared to genes nominated using functional annotations alone. Because differentially prioritized variants are driven by Borzoi predictions, we leverage attribution techniques to characterize sequence features underlying fine mapping and generate mechanistic hypotheses for GWAS associations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199

However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function.

MethodsPlacental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD091218-04S1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199

The components differ in their representational attributes and plasticity, with evidence for sparser, more decorrelated activity and faster plasticity in regions higher up in the hierarchy. How and why did the brain arrive at this organization? We explore the principles that allow such an organization to emerge by simulating a hierarchy of learning subsystems in artificial neural networks (ANNs) using a meta-learning approach. As ANNs optimized weights for a series of tasks, they concurrently meta-learned layer-wise plasticity and sparsity parameters. This approach enhanced the computational efficiency of ANNs, promoting hidden activation sparsity while benefitting task performance. Meta-learning also gave rise to a brain-like hierarchical organization, with higher layers displaying faster plasticity and a sparser, more pattern-separated neural code than lower layers. Early layers peaked early in their plasticity and stabilized, whereas higher layers continued to develop and maintained elevated plasticity over time, mirroring empirical developmental trajectories. Moreover, when trained on dual tasks imposing competing demands for item discrimination and categorization, ANNs with parallel pathways developed distinct representational and plasticity profiles, convergent with the distinct properties observed empirically across intra-hippocampal pathways. These results suggest that the macroscale organization and development of heterogeneous learning subsystems in the brain may emerge in part from optimizing biological variables that govern plasticity and sparsity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199

Despite these limitations, phytoplasmas, which are parasitic, insect-transmitted plant pathogens maintain a diverse arsenal of secreted effectors that manipulate both plant and insect hosts to promote infection and transmission. These effectors can suppress immunity and reprogram plant development, including witchs broom and leaf-like flowers, through ubiquitin-independent degradation of key transcription factors. However, how phytoplasmas diversify and maintain these effectors in the absence of frequent genetic exchange remains unclear. To address this, we analysed the effectoromes of 239 phytoplasma genomes and identified a diverse set of secreted proteins, which we designated as Phytoplasma-Associated Molecular Effectors (PhAMEs). We found that PhAMEs targeting evolutionarily conserved and structurally constrained surfaces of host proteins are widespread across phytoplasmas. These effectors adopt compact, efficient folds. They often function as molecular scaffolds with dual interaction surfaces capable of linking host proteins or integrating signalling pathways. Such scaffolding PhAMEs have evolved multiple times independently, providing clear evidence of convergent evolution. Despite severe genomic constrains imposed by genome reduction and limited HGT, gene duplications, interface variations, domain fusions, and repeat expansions have helped the shaping effector fold and diversity. While the overall effector repertoire of phytoplasmas appeared largely unique, some PhAME domains share similarities with proteins from other mollicutes and pathogens. Collectively, our findings shed light on how genome-reduced bacteria innovate molecular functions and offer insights into phytoplasma biology, effector evolution, and host-pathogen dynamics. They also lay the groundwork for protein engineering approaches aimed at discovering or designing novel biomolecules with biotechnological potential.","[{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) EPSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X024415/1;""},{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) BBSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BBS/E/J/000PR9797;""},{""name"":""John Innes Centre"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""John Innes Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04kg99k11"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Gatsby Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199

Upon activation, they oligomerize into inflammasome-like resistosomes to initiate immune signaling, yet the dynamics of resistosome assembly remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the virulence effector AVRcap1b from the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans suppresses immune activation by directly engaging oligomerization intermediates of the tomato helper NLR SlNRC3. Cryo-EM structures of SlNRC3 in AVRcap1b-bound and unbound states reveal that AVRcap1b bridges multiple protomers, stabilizing a stalled intermediate and preventing formation of a functional resistosome. Leveraging AVRcap1b as a molecular tool, we also capture an additional SlNRC3 resistosome intermediate showing that assembly proceeds in a stepwise manner from dissociated monomers. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized vulnerability in NLR activation and reveal a pathogen strategy that disrupts immune complex assembly. This work advances mechanistic understanding of resistosome formation and uncovers a previously unrecognized facet of pathogen-plant coevolution.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/V002937/1;BB/Y002997/1;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/Y032187/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199

Flowering shoot (inflorescence) architecture varies significantly across plant families and is a key target of genetic engineering efforts in many crops1-4. Asteraceae (sunflower family), comprising 10% of flowering plants, all have capitula, a novel inflorescence that mimics a single flower5,6. Asteraceae capitula are highly diverse but are thought to have evolved once via unknown mechanisms7,8. During capitulum development, shoot stem cells undergo prolonged proliferation to accommodate the formation of intersecting spirals of flowers (florets) along the disk-shaped head9,10. Here we show that capitulum evolution paralleled decreases in CLAVATA3 (CLV3) peptide signaling, a conserved repressor of stem cell proliferation. We trace this to novel amino acid changes in the mature CLV3 peptide which decrease receptor binding and downstream transcriptional outputs. Using genetically tractable Asteraceae models, we show that reversion of CLV3 to a more active form impairs Asteraceae stem cell regulation and capitulum development. Additionally, we trace the evolution of CLV3 and its receptors across the Asterales allowing inferences on capitulum evolution within this lineage. Our findings reveal novel mechanisms driving evolutionary innovation in plant reproduction and suggest new approaches for genetic engineering in crop species.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM119614;""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IOS-1546837;IOS-1906389;IOS-2214473;IOS-2214472;DBI-2319905;""},{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_204526;""},{""name"":""Research Council of Finland"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""341774;""},{""name"":""Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03vxy9y38"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199

This primary genetic cue is often located on a single locus--referred to as sex chromosomes--and can be limited to females (in a ZZ/ZW system) or males (in an XX/XY system). One trademark of sex chromosomes is a restriction or cessation of recombination surrounding the sex-limited region (to prevent its inheritance in the homogametic sex). This may lead to--through a variety of mechanisms--higher amounts of genetic divergence within this region, i.e. between the X/Z and Y/W chromosomes, especially when compared to their autosomal counterparts. Recent advances in genome sequencing and computation have brought with them the ability to resolve haplotypes within a diploid individual, permitting assembly of previously challenging genomic regions like sex chromosomes. Leveraging these advances, we identified replicable diagnostic characteristics between typical autosomes and sex chromosomes (within a single genome assembly). Under this framework, we can use this information to identify putative sex chromosome linkage groups across divergent vertebrate taxa and simultaneously curate misassembled regions on autosomes. Here, we present this conceptual framework and associated tool for identifying candidate sex chromosome linkage groups from a single, diploid individual dubbed Sex Chromosome Identification by Negating Kmer Densities, or SCINKD.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DEB1657662;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IOS2151318;R35GM142836;R35GM124827;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755727629199
