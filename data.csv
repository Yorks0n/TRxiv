This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

Upon activation, they oligomerize into inflammasome-like resistosomes to initiate immune signaling, yet the dynamics of resistosome assembly remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the virulence effector AVRcap1b from the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans suppresses immune activation by directly engaging oligomerization intermediates of the tomato helper NLR SlNRC3. Cryo-EM structures of SlNRC3 in AVRcap1b-bound and unbound states reveal that AVRcap1b bridges multiple protomers, stabilizing a stalled intermediate and preventing formation of a functional resistosome. Leveraging AVRcap1b as a molecular tool, we also capture an additional SlNRC3 resistosome intermediate showing that assembly proceeds in a stepwise manner from dissociated monomers. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized vulnerability in NLR activation and reveal a pathogen strategy that disrupts immune complex assembly. This work advances mechanistic understanding of resistosome formation and uncovers a previously unrecognized facet of pathogen-plant coevolution.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

Despite these limitations, phytoplasmas, which are parasitic, insect-transmitted plant pathogens maintain a diverse arsenal of secreted effectors that manipulate both plant and insect hosts to promote infection and transmission. These effectors can suppress immunity and reprogram plant development, including witchs broom and leaf-like flowers, through ubiquitin-independent degradation of key transcription factors. However, how phytoplasmas diversify and maintain these effectors in the absence of frequent genetic exchange remains unclear. To address this, we analysed the effectoromes of 239 phytoplasma genomes and identified a diverse set of secreted proteins, which we designated as Phytoplasma-Associated Molecular Effectors (PhAMEs). We found that PhAMEs targeting evolutionarily conserved and structurally constrained surfaces of host proteins are widespread across phytoplasmas. These effectors adopt compact, efficient folds. They often function as molecular scaffolds with dual interaction surfaces capable of linking host proteins or integrating signalling pathways. Such scaffolding PhAMEs have evolved multiple times independently, providing clear evidence of convergent evolution. Despite severe genomic constrains imposed by genome reduction and limited HGT, gene duplications, interface variations, domain fusions, and repeat expansions have helped the shaping effector fold and diversity. While the overall effector repertoire of phytoplasmas appeared largely unique, some PhAME domains share similarities with proteins from other mollicutes and pathogens. Collectively, our findings shed light on how genome-reduced bacteria innovate molecular functions and offer insights into phytoplasma biology, effector evolution, and host-pathogen dynamics. They also lay the groundwork for protein engineering approaches aimed at discovering or designing novel biomolecules with biotechnological potential.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

We consider four specific measures in greater detail, describe how they differ and show that three of them can be estimated from GWAS summary statistics using an existing method, Fourier Mixture Regression. We estimate these measures for 36 traits in humans. We find a dearth of traits with polygenicity values that fall within the large gap between Mendelian and highly polygenic traits.

The components differ in their representational attributes and plasticity, with evidence for sparser, more decorrelated activity and faster plasticity in regions higher up in the hierarchy. How and why did the brain arrive at this organization? We explore the principles that allow such an organization to emerge by simulating a hierarchy of learning subsystems in artificial neural networks (ANNs) using a meta-learning approach. As ANNs optimized weights for a series of tasks, they concurrently meta-learned layer-wise plasticity and sparsity parameters. This approach enhanced the computational efficiency of ANNs, promoting hidden activation sparsity while benefitting task performance. Meta-learning also gave rise to a brain-like hierarchical organization, with higher layers displaying faster plasticity and a sparser, more pattern-separated neural code than lower layers. Early layers peaked early in their plasticity and stabilized, whereas higher layers continued to develop and maintained elevated plasticity over time, mirroring empirical developmental trajectories. Moreover, when trained on dual tasks imposing competing demands for item discrimination and categorization, ANNs with parallel pathways developed distinct representational and plasticity profiles, convergent with the distinct properties observed empirically across intra-hippocampal pathways. These results suggest that the macroscale organization and development of heterogeneous learning subsystems in the brain may emerge in part from optimizing biological variables that govern plasticity and sparsity.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

Despite their critical role, the structural organization of kinetochores assembled on centromeres with vastly distinct architectures across diverse species remains poorly understood (2,3). To address this, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the inner kinetochore (CCAN) from the silkmoth Bombyx mori, an insect that lacks the canonical centromere-specifying histone variant CENP-A and exhibits chromosome-wide centromeric activity (holocentric). Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1752703875454

An important aspect of this endeavor is understanding how an organism adapts to stress-inducing environmental conditions on Mars, such as radiation, shock waves, extreme temperatures, and chaotropic stress due to higher levels of perchlorates. A conserved approach used by organisms across evolutionary scales to adapt and overcome stress conditions is the assembly of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensates. In this study, we employ a multidisciplinary approach to understand yeast survivability and adaptation under Mars-like stress conditions, specifically shock waves and perchlorate, by focusing on RNP condensates. Our study reveals that yeast survives 5.6 M intensity shock waves. Exposure to either shock waves or sodium perchlorate induces the formation of P-bodies, a conserved stress-induced condensate. Yeast mutants defective in P-body assembly show defective growth in response to perchlorate stress. Transcriptome analysis, followed by validation, identified several relevant transcripts whose levels are perturbed in response to Mars-like conditions. Finally, identification of several transcripts whose abundance is altered in the P-body assembly mutant upon stress highlights a new connection between response to Martian stress conditions and RNP condensates. This study, a first of its kind, highlights the importance of RNP condensates in understanding the impact of Martian conditions on life in general. This study paves the way for using RNP condensates as a biomarker for assessing the health of life forms during space explorations.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

Here we analyzed evolutionarily unrelated signal-sequestering viral proteins, finding that they share structural and biophysical traits in their genetic organization, ternary structures and binding pocket properties. Based on these traits we developed a structure-guided computational pipeline that can sift through large phage genome databases to unbiasedly predict phage proteins that manipulate bacterial immune signaling. Numerous previously uncharacterized proteins, grouped into three families, were verified to inhibit the bacterial Thoeris and CBASS signaling systems. Proteins of the Sequestin and Lockin families bind and sequester the TIR-produced signaling molecules 3'cADPR and His-ADPR, while proteins of the Acb5 family cleave and inactivate 3'3'-cGAMP and related molecules. X-ray crystallography and structural modeling, combined with mutational analyses, explain the structural basis for sequestration or cleavage of the immune signals.

BONCAT-based capture of newly translated proteins provided direct molecular evidence for the expression of a previously hypothesized oxidative glycine pathway for syntrophic acetate oxidation by this microorganism, showcasing the potential of targeted metaproteomics to characterize rare and active cells central to community metabolism in natural and engineered ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

Their historical significance, linked to the rise of the Anglo-Norman era (1093-1286 CE) in Scotland, and the historical complexities of surname adoption post-Norman conquest of England, justifies the need for a comprehensive understanding of the genetic history of the Hay noble lineage. This study focuses on examining the patterns of paternal inheritance in lineages with the Hay surname. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of Y-chromosome data that is publicly available on the Family Tree DNA (FTDNA) platform, and specific FTDNA surname projects, as well as looking in more detail at three well-documented male-line descendants of William II HAY, 1st Earl of Erroll, (d. 1201) that have been verified to a high degree of confidence. Our results reveal that all descendants of William II HAY, 1st Earl of Erroll, (d. 1201) derive from the multigenerational Y-SNPs R1a - YP6500 (plus equivalent SNPs BY33394 / FT2017) and R1a - FTT161. Furthermore, subclades of R1a - FTT161 have been identified that confirm direct male-line descent from two of William II HAYs sons. Subclade R1a - BY199342 (plus equivalents) confirms direct male-line descent from David HAY, 2nd Earl of Erroll, (d. 1241), and subclade R1a - FTA7312 confirms direct male line decent from Robert HAY of Erroll. The result also confirms that the Hay noble lineage shares the Y-SNP R1a - YP4138 (estimated to have occurred 832 CE) with several non-Hay testers that have surnames of Norman origin, therefore, providing further evidence to support the Norman origin hypothesis for these surnames. In addition to the identification of multigenerational Y-SNPs associated to documented Hay noblemen, this study has observed significant Y-DNA haplogroup diversity among males with the surname Hay (plus associated spelling variants: Hays, Haye, Hayes, Hey and Haya). Our results show that only 22% of the men sampled (n=109) with the surname Hay (plus associated spelling variation) are descended from the 12th century progenitor of the noble Hay lineage of Scotland. Therefore, confirming that a significant proportion of males with the surname Hay do not descend from the noble progenitor of the surname.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

Biophysical and biochemical properties of the ECM are known to affect three-dimensional (3D) cellular behavior, and phenotype that regulate a wide range of pathological conditions. Tunable biomimetic hydrogels are extensively employed to regulate cellular dynamics in defined 3D microenvironments, enabling detailed investigation of cell-matrix interactions. This study aims to establish the relationship between varying hydrogel properties (adhesivity, degradability, porosity, and stiffness, hereby collectively referred to as  matrix compliance) and fibroblast morphology at the cellular and nuclear levels. Poly(ethylene glycol diacrylate)-fibrinogen (PF)-based hydrogels were fabricated and their matrix properties were tuned using two different non-degradable co-monomers of varying molecular weights and concentrations. NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were cultured in 3D hydrogels for 10 days and their cellular and nuclear morphology was analyzed via confocal imaging. Cells in degradable, soft, porous, and adhesive hydrogels displayed higher degree of spreading, higher cell density, longer protrusions, and elongated and larger nuclei compared to those in less degradable, stiffer, less porous, and less adhesive hydrogels. Matrix compliance conjointly regulated cell density, protrusion length, and protrusion frequency (collectively referred to as  cellular confinement) and nuclear volume (referred to as  nuclear confinement). These results highlight the complex interplay and interdependence of these cellular and nuclear morphological features as regulated by engineered tunable matrices, providing guidance for future studies of 3D cell behavior in novel biomaterials.

Statement of significanceBiomimetic tunable hydrogels are commonly used to support, and control, three-dimensional (3D) cellular behavior to recapitulate various developmental processes and disease states. Specific biophysical and biochemical characteristics of the extracellular matrix (ECM) can be modeled using these hydrogels by controlling the compositions and crosslinking mechanisms. Using this approach, the behavior of cells in 3D hydrogel matrices can be correlated with the matrix properties, thereby providing mechanistic insights into cell-matrix interactions. This study assesses the variations in the morphological features of fibroblasts encapsulated in 3D protein-based hydrogel matrices with varying crosslinking mechanisms. Our results reveal the combinatorial role of matrix adhesivity, degradability, porosity, and stiffness in regulating cellular and nuclear confinement of fibroblasts in 3D microenvironments. Overall, this study elucidates how matrix characteristics influence cellular behavior, serving as a practical guide for researchers developing innovative biomaterial matrices for 3D cell culture applications.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

In this study, we identify a host-adapted enzymatic module in the root endophyte Serendipita indica that targets acetylated xylan, a major structural component of monocot cell walls. The glycoside hydrolase SiGH11 cleaves the xylan backbone and releases O-acetylated oligosaccharides, which are subsequently deacetylated by the XynE-like esterase SiAXE. These enzymes are co-expressed within a monocot-specific transcriptional program that is enriched in carbohydrate-active enzymes and sugar transporters. Their combined activity enhances enzymatic degradation and facilitates downstream hydrolysis by exo-xylanases, which reduces the production of apoplastic reactive oxygen species triggered by damage-associated molecular patterns. Functional analysis shows that overexpression of SiAXE promotes early root colonization, while deletion of the gene compromises fungal proliferation during later stages. These findings define a coordinated and immune-compatible strategy for host cell wall deconstruction that enables fungal adaptation and endophytic colonization of monocot roots.

In BriefSerendipita indica utilizes a transcriptionally coordinated xylanase and esterase module to degrade acetylated xylan in monocot roots. This enzyme cooperation enhances substrate breakdown, suppresses immune responses, and enables endophytic colonization, illustrating how mutualistic fungi adapt saprotrophic enzymes for host-specific intracellular accommodation.

Membrane fission is thus required to balance lysosome size, number, and composition. PIKfyve is a lipid kinase that converts phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] to phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,5)P2] and promotes lysosome fission since lysosomes coalesce into larger, but fewer organelles in PIKfyve defective cells. Here, we reveal a role for PIKfyve in regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dynamics. We show the ER is less reticulated and motile in cells acutely inhibited for PIKfyve. Partly, this arises because lysosomes cluster perinuclearly and are less motile, which appears to arrest ER hitchhiking, a process in which lysosomes pull and form ER tubules via microtubule-based movement. Secondly, the ER morphology is distorted because of hyper-tethering of protrudin, an ER transmembrane protein, to lysosomes via excess PtdIns(3)P and FYVE domain of protrudin. Thus, our findings reveal that PIKfyve activity balances phosphoinositides at ER-lysosome contact sites to govern ER properties and has significant implications to our understanding of disease linked to PIKfyve dysfunction such as neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

Glial-glial crosstalk is essential for maintaining the regional milieu and appears to be particularly important in modulating neuroinflammation and many aspects of neurodegeneration. In particular, astrocytes are critical for maintaining dopamine neuronal integrity and survival, and astroglial dysfunction is prominent in Parkinson disease. As such, astrocytes represent a potentially critical therapeutic target in neurodegeneration. In this study, in vivo optogenetics were used to selectively stimulate astrocytes in the substantia nigra following a striatal 6-OHDA lesion. Remarkably, a single bout of optogenetic stimulation was sufficient to attenuate motor deficits and dopamine neuron loss induced by the neurotoxin. Furthermore, bulk RNAseq and snRNAseq analysis of the substantia nigra revealed extensive changes in both microglia and oligodendrocytes, suggesting that the neuroprotective effects of stimulating astrocytes may be mediated through alterations in glia-glia crosstalk. Altogether, this work demonstrates the importance of understanding glia-glia interactions in neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

These parasites must acquire heme from their hosts, making this process critical for their survival. In the midgut of the insect vector, T. cruzi epimastigotes are exposed to both hemoglobin (Hb) and free heme resulting from its degradation. Despite the importance of this nutrient, how different heme sources influence parasite gene expression remains poorly understood.

Here, we showed that heme restitution either as hemin or Hb to heme-starved parasites induces an early and distinct transcriptional response in T. cruzi epimastigotes. Using RNA sequencing at 4- and 24-hours post-supplementation, we identified gene subsets commonly or uniquely regulated by each heme source, including genes putatively linked to heme acquisition and metabolism. We also presented here the first studies focused on CRAL/TRIO domain-containing protein (TcCRAL/TRIO), a novel heme responsive hemoprotein identified from this study.

Our results provide a more detailed picture of T. cruzi biology and highlights heme acquisition as a promising point of vulnerability. These findings may ultimately contribute to the identification of potential molecular targets for the development of new therapeutic strategies against Chagas disease.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

We used untargeted serum metabolomics to profile the immunometabolic landscape of ferrets after SARS-CoV-2 infection and DNA-/protein-based vaccination. Ferrets were vaccinated with either a multigenic DNA vaccine encoding SARS-CoV-2 RBD, M, and N (OC2), an N-only DNA vaccine (OC12), a recombinant spike protein with QS-21 adjuvant (S+QS21), or a hepatitis B/D control construct (Hep-B/D), and subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Serum was analyzed longitudinally at baseline, post-vaccination, and post-challenge. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced broad metabolic reprogramming, involving TCA cycle, glutathione metabolism, and nucleotide turnover, reflecting inflammation and cellular activation. OC2 vaccination induced strong metabolic shifts in amino acid and mitochondrial pathways despite low pre-challenge anti-S antibodies. Post-challenge, these shifts extended to redox and nucleotide pathways, correlating with robust anti-S and very strong anti-N antibody responses and complete viral clearance in BAL, but with marked airway pathology, consistent with T cell-mediated clearance of infected cells. S+QS21 and OC12 induced distinct, immunogen-specific signatures with partial protection, while Hep-B/D showed minimal systemic engagement. Metabolite-antibody correlations revealed vaccine-specific associations, highlighting lipid and amino acid pathways as potential immunogenicity biomarkers. Overlap and heatmap analyses showed that metabolic trajectories reflect both the magnitude and quality of immune training. These findings underscore the value of systems vaccinology in resolving mechanistic differences in vaccine responses and support metabolic profiling as a tool for evaluating immune efficacy in preclinical vaccine studies.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

Globally, these viruses have caused mass mortalities in captive and wild avian and mammalian populations, including terrestrial and marine mammals. H5N1 has been the dominant subtype, and whilst incursions have overlapped temporally, occurrences have often been spatially distinct. Here, we report the detection of a mortality event in wild birds on the Norfolk coastline in the east of England, where H5N1 HPAIV was detected in five Great Black-backed Gulls (Larus marinus) and a Northern Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis). Interestingly, at the same site, and as part of the same mortality event, a total of 17 Great Black-backed Gulls, one Herring Gull (Larus argentatus), one Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula arctica) and one Northern Fulmar tested positive for H5N5 HPAIV. Additionally, H5N5 was also detected in 17 co-located Grey Seal carcases (Halichoerus grypus). The H5N1 HPAIV from an infected bird belonged to genotype DI.2, closely related to contemporaneous detections in GB wild birds and poultry.

In parallel, we made diphtheria toxin-mediated cell type ablation compatible with human cells, thereby enabling in-depth interrogation of the sequence of events during depletion and reappearance of stem cells. Following LGR5+ stem cell depletion, most of the remaining epithelial cells entered a regenerative state characterized by fetal-like expression programs. Strikingly, this regenerative response was already initiated before stem cell loss, indicative of active communication between functional stem cells and progeny during homeostasis. We identified inactivation of retinoid X receptor (RXR) as a crucial trigger to initiate the regenerative response in colonocytes, with human colon stem cells being the producer of the RXR stimulus retinoic acid. Thus, stem cell-derived retinoic acid actively suppresses the regenerative state in colonocytes, explaining how surviving cells sense stem cell loss.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

In the first iteration of the cycle, we constructed a biosensor that responded to intracellular pyruvate levels within 0.05 - 10mM range. In the second cycle, we implemented design of experiment (DoE) to systematically explore combinatorial effects of promoters and ribosome binding sites (RBSs). A first set of experiments were designed to identify factors with a significant effect on biosensor performance. The results showed RBS of report gene significantly influenced dynamic range by modulating basal and maximum expression, while RBS of transcription factor affected signal span. The Akaike Information Criterion was used to select a model incorporating two main effects and one interaction effects. The best-performing strain exhibited an 18.5-fold increase in dynamic range and a 37.2-fold reduction in leaky expression.

We evaluated the extent and magnitude of nonlinearity and its environmental and life history correlates in 243 recruitment and 267 spawner time series of 143 marine fish species, worldwide. Here we show that temperature variation amplifies nonlinearity in recruitment and spawner biomass, while life history mediates the degree of nonlinearity for the latter, dampening it in slow-lived species. Nonlinearity was displayed by 81% of populations and correlated with the magnitude of fluctuations. These nonlinear dynamics were low-dimensional and causally forced by temperature in 60% of populations with the probability of forcing increasing for recruits in variable temperature environments and fast-lived spawners. Our results challenge assumptions of stable dynamics and sustainable yield common to fisheries management, and suggests nonlinear fluctuations of fish populations are magnified by size-selective fisheries and environmental variability from global climate change.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

This study investigated whether such modality-specific effects emerge during movement preparation and whether this phase influences subsequent online control. Participants performed reaching movements toward auditory, proprioceptive, or audio-proprioceptive targets. Electromyography and movement kinematics were recorded to examine the effects of sensory modality on sensory encoding and motor coordination during movement preparation, as well as online control at 5%, 50%, and 100% of movement time. Results revealed a modality-dependent sensory encoding phase, whereas a modality-independent motor coordination phase. Movement variability was greater for auditory targets than for proprioceptive and audio-proprioceptive targets at 50% and 100% of movement. Only motor coordination influenced early online control (5%), but this effect was modality-independent. These findings demonstrate that the influence of sensory modality extends beyond execution to the preparatory phase of movement. The results support a four-stage model of action control: a modality-dependent sensory encoding phase of preparation and late online control, alongside a modality-independent motor coordination phase and early online control. These findings offer new insight into the temporal dynamics of sensorimotor control without vision, indicating that non-visual sensory information is differentially used during distinct phases of movement preparation and execution.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate most fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain, and plasticity of AMPARs signaling underlies the long-lasting changes in synaptic efficacy and strength important for learning and memory.1,2 Recent work has indicated that the enigmatic N-terminal domain (NTD) of AMPARs may be a critical regulator of synaptic targeting and plasticity of AMPARs. However, few synaptic proteins have been identified that regulate AMPAR plasticity through interactions with AMPAR NTDs. Moreover, the scope of AMPAR NTD interactors that are important for synaptic plasticity remains unknown. Here, we present the dynamic, extracellular interactome for AMPARs during synaptic plasticity. Using surface-restricted proximity labeling and BioSITe-based proteomics, we identified 70 proteins that were differentially labeled by APEX2-tagged AMPARs after induction of chemical Long-term potentiation of synapses (cLTP) in cultured neurons. Included in this list, were four members of the IgLON family of GPI-anchored proteins (Ntm, OBCAM/Opcml, Negr1, Lsamp). We show OBCAM and NTM directly interact with the extracellular domains of AMPARs. Moreover, overexpression of NTM significantly attenuates the mobility of surface AMPARs in dendritic spines. These data represent a significant first step at uncovering the unexplored extracellular regulation of AMPARs, with broad implications for synapse function and synaptic plasticity.

Significance StatementOver the past 30 years, significant effort has been focused on understanding the mechanisms that induce long-lasting changes in synapse strength (synaptic plasticity) that drive learning and memory. While many studies have investigated intracellular mechanisms that enable plasticity, especially those acting on AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs), significantly less is known regarding extracellular mechanisms that shape changes in synapse function. Here, we identified 70 proteins that differentially associate with the extracellular region of AMPARs during chemically-induced synaptic plasticity. We show that OBCAM and NTM directly interact with the NTD of AMPARs and regulate their mobility on the surface of neurons. These data advance our understanding of extracellular AMPAR regulation, with broad implications for synapse function and synaptic plasticity.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

This is particularly problematic for the lower two-thirds of the formation, which generally lacks reliable biostratigraphic or magnetostratigraphic zonation and has no dated ash beds. To address these enduring issues for one of the most significant Upper Cretaceous terrestrial fossil-bearing units in North America, detailed stratigraphic sections were established on the Murray Ranch and on McGinnis Butte in central Montana and correlated with other published Hell Creek Formation localities via magnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and radioisotopic dating of ash beds. Results indicate that the K-Pg boundary is not exposed in the study area, however high-precision U-Pb CA-TIMS zircon ages for two newly discovered ash beds (66.929 {+/-} 0.020 Ma and 66.850 {+/-} 0.026 Ma, respectively) bracketing the  Dueling Dinosaurs locality provide the first absolute ages for the lower portion of the Hell Creek Formation, anywhere. Bayesian age-stratigraphic modelling places the  Dueling Dinosaurs locality at 66.897 +0.023/-0.028 Ma and suggest that the age of the base of the formation is ~67.102 +0.710/-0.173 Ma (or older) in the study area.

We review evidence for the evolution of arboreality within lineages of early mammals and their stem relatives (Synapsida) while also emphasizing the uncertainty of locomotor inferences of fossil lineages. An improved understanding of the evolutionary origins and prevalence of arboreality in early mammals requires robust links between morphological traits and locomotor behaviors that can be applied to fossils. To this end, we use a large comparative dataset of linear measurements taken on extant mammalian postcranial specimens to evaluate the skeletal proxies that best differentiate arboreality from other locomotor modes. Consistent with previous research, we find that measures of digit length and elbow proportions are especially powerful predictors of climbing. Locomotor predictions based on single measurements or ratios are improved when phylogeny is incorporated into models. Nonetheless, combining multiple functionally relevant traits into our models yields robust predictions of locomotor mode even without incorporating phylogenetic information--this is especially encouraging for fossil groups with unstable phylogenies. We test these locomotor proxies in three early-mammalian case studies--Multituberculata, Plesiadapiformes, and early Theria. We find that multituberculates had a wide locomotor breadth whereas plesiadapiforms all had a high probability of climbing, consistent with previous studies. However, some Mesozoic therians in our sample are predicted to be ground-dwellers, conflicting with the hypothesis that the ancestral therian was scansorial or arboreal. The predictive tools presented here will improve locomotor inferences for small mammals, further illuminating the prevalence and importance of arboreality in early mammalian evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

While this prediction is mathematically robust under simplifying assumptions, accumulating evidence suggests that the structure of gene interaction networks can alter both the rate and organization of incompatibility evolution. Here, we extend classic DMI models with a network approach, equating the assumptions of the Orr model with a complete graph of gene interactions. We simulate the evolution of hybrid incompatibilities under different gene interaction networks and evaluate the effects of network density, topology, and substitution model. We find that network density strongly governs the rate of DMI accumulation, particularly under models permitting multiple substitutions per locus, while network topology shapes the agglomeration of incompatibilities into large, connected clusters. Substitution rate heterogeneity, especially when anti-correlated with node degree, further suppresses both accumulation and clustering. These results highlight that while the snowball effect remains qualitatively valid, the structure and evolution of the incompatibility network exhibit nontrivial departures from previous expectations, with implications for observable quantities in empirical systems. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating genomic architecture and network constraints into models of speciation.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

Monthly water samples were collected over a year (2023-2024) throughout the estuary, covering saline, brackish and freshwater zones. Overall, 69 species of fish were detected, increasing the number of known species within the estuary in comparison to both historical and contemporary records (46 and 39, respectively), with a generally higher observed richness within the upper estuary sampled zones where the water chemistry is predominantly freshwater. Notably, we identified several species returning to the system for the first time since pre-industrial times. Peak species richness was recorded during the winter season (December-February). Species compositions varied significantly by month and spatially by zone within months, but not when grouped seasonally. Furthermore, around [~]15% of the species detected were diadromous, with the endangered Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, for example, being frequently detected during its key migratory period. This study highlights the resurgence in fish diversity in a once biologically depleted estuarine ecosystem and demonstrates how eDNA metabarcoding can be implemented for detecting historically absent species, thereby enhancing restoration monitoring efforts globally.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

However, it is not well understood whether personal light exposure patterns predicts and individuals risk of cardiovascular diseases.

ObjectiveTo assess whether day and night light exposure predicts incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and whether relationships of light with cardiovascular diseases differ according to genetic susceptibility, sex, and age.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

ParticipantsN=88,905, age (M{+/-}SD) = 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 56.9% female.

ExposureApproximately 13 million hours of personal light exposure data, tracked by wrist-worn light sensors (one week each).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, derived from UK National Health Service records, across a 9.5-year follow-up after light tracking.

ResultsPeople with the brightest nights (90-100th percentiles) had significantly higher risks of developing coronary artery disease (adjusted-HR range: 1.23-1.32), myocardial infarction (aHRs: 1.42-1.47), heart failure (aHRs: 1.45-1.56), atrial fibrillation (aHRs: 1.28-1.32), and stroke (aHRs: 1.28-1.30), compared to people with dark nights (0-50th percentiles). These relationships were robust after adjusting for established risk factors for cardiovascular health, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol, diet, sleep duration, socioeconomic status, and polygenic risk. Relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and coronary artery disease were stronger for women, and relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation were stronger for younger individuals in this cohort.

Conclusions and RelevanceNight light exposure was a significant risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases in this cohort. In addition to current preventative measures, avoiding light at night may be a useful strategy for reducing risks of cardiovascular diseases.

Key Points

QuestionDoes personal light exposure predict incidence of cardiovascular diseases?

FindingsIn this study of [~]89,000 adults aged >40 years, exposure to brighter light at night predicted higher incidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors.

MeaningAvoiding exposure to night light may lower risk for cardiovascular diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1752703875454

Residential CD4 T cells, regulatory T cells, B cells, and NK cells have been demonstrated to share phenotypic properties with residential CD8 T cells, but the migratory kinetics are even more poorly defined.

The viral S protein evolved towards highly efficient antibody evasion and replicative capacity in the upper respiratory tract resulting in high transmissibility. At the same time, the mutations acquired in the S protein diminish infection of the lung epithelium and pathogenic potential. The changing entry requirements for Omicron sub-lineages that lead to this shift in tropism remain poorly understood. We resolve the changing replication requirements of SARS-CoV-2 to be related to two distinct pools of ACE2. The first pool relates to ACE2s role in the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and this pool can complex with TMPRSS2 (RAS-ACE2). The second pool relates to ACE2s role as a protein solute carrier chaperone than cannot complex with TMPRSS2 (Chaperone ACE2). Here, we demonstrate that pre-Omicron lineages replicate in a TMPRSS2 dependent manner across both ACE2 pools, whilst Omicron lineages can only spread and replicate using chaperone ACE2. This provides a mechanistic basis for the evolving infectivity requirements of SARS-CoV-2 and furthermore provides approaches to track and monitor ACE2 utilizing coronaviruses.

Graphical AbstractMechanistic basis for shift in SARS-CoV-2 tropism with the arrival of Omicron. A. Chaperone ACE2 is defined structurally as a heterodimer of dimers with a solute carrier protein-SLC6A19 or SLC6A20. Here this ACE2 structure can exist uncomplexed from TMPRSS2 and enables TMPRSS2 use by both pre-Omicron and Omicron lineages. B. Renin Angiotensin ACE2 is defined by ACE2 with an exposed collectrin-like domain (CLD), which enables binding of TMPRSS2 or ADAM-17. Here ACE2 can form a complex with TMPRSS2 in a manner that allows pre-Omicron but not Omicron lineages to utilize TMPRSS2 to facilitate infection. Here Omicron lineages are heavily attenuated as they cannot use TMPRSS2 to spread. C. to E. Based on single cell profiles, ACE2 can exist as a chaperone with SLC6A20 in C. the Nasal Cavity or D. primarily as RAS-ACE2 in the lung to respond to acute lung injury. E. The largest pool of ACE2 in our body resides within the small intestine on enterocytes and this further facilitates replication in this tissue by pre-Omicron and Omicron lineages.

Primary outcomes included: (1) COVID-19 severity (hospitalization and life-threatening disease), (2) long COVID, and (3) SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. We applied multivariable logistic regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting and reported adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and associated p-values.

FindingsOf 21,704,702 individuals, we identify 4,825,605 COVID-19 positive individuals, 6.36% had RDs, with markedly higher rates of rare disease (RD) patients that have life-threatening illness (16% vs. 6.1% without life-threatening illness) and that are hospitalized (13% vs. 6.0% without hospitalization). Otorhinolaryngologic diseases showed the highest risk of life-threatening outcomes (OR 4.51; 95% CI 3.81-5.33), followed by developmental defect during embryogenesis (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.72-1.98) and cardiac conditions (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.51-2.11). Hospitalization risk was highest for otorhinolaryngologic (OR 2.90; 95% CI 2.61-3.23), developmental defect during embryogenesis (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.97-2.16), and hematologic and endocrine diseases (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.75-1.87 and OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.64-1.99, respectively).

In patients with RDs, vaccination alone or antiviral treatment alone was associated with reduced odds of life-threatening COVID-19 disease compared to non-vaccinated individuals (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.66-0.77 and OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.26-0.42, respectively). The combination of both vaccination and antiviral treatment showed the greatest reduction in odds ratio (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.20-0.27). Similar results were observed in patients without RDs. In contrast, vaccination or antiviral therapy alone, compared to no intervention, did not significantly reduce long COVID risk in RD patients, although these interventions alone did result in a lower odds ratio in patients without RD. However, their combination was protective in both groups. Vaccination alone, compared to no vaccination, also reduced the risk of reinfection across RD and non-RD populations.

InterpretationRD patients face elevated risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes. While vaccination and antivirals significantly reduce the acute severity of illness, their impact on long COVID appears limited in this population. Notably, vaccination was protective against COVID-19 reinfection in both RD and non-RD populations. These findings highlight the need for targeted strategies to protect RD patients beyond current interventions, particularly in preventing long-term complications.

As a solution, we introduce Metalorian, a conditional diffusion model that generates de novo heavy metal-binding peptides, guided by MetaLATTE, a multi-label classifier fine-tuned to include underrepresented metal classes. Leveraging both continuous protein embeddings and discrete metal-binding constraints, Metalorian produces peptides with controllable lengths and user-defined binding specificity while preserving essential physicochemical properties. Crucially, our data augmentation strategy enables robust classification and generation even with sparse training data for certain metals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through peptides designed for copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), and zinc (Zn), which retain key features such as net charge and hydrophobicity, while significantly reducing sequence length and molecular weight compared to known metal-binding proteins. Metalorian-generated peptides exhibit stable conformations and favorable binding energetics, as confirmed through molecular dynamics simulations. To validate binding in vitro, we developed a streamlined SUMO-fusion expression and cleavage system coupled with ELISA-based quantification, confirming robust Cu and Zn binding by multiple Metalorian-generated peptides. Overall, our work establishes a foundational platform for engineering heavy metal-binding peptides tailored to diverse and underrepresented targets, and highlights the potential of well-trained continuous latent spaces for diffusion-based de novo peptide design.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

This primary genetic cue is often located on a single locus--referred to as sex chromosomes--and can be limited to females (in a ZZ/ZW system) or males (in an XX/XY system). One trademark of sex chromosomes is a restriction or cessation of recombination surrounding the sex-limited region (to prevent its inheritance in the homogametic sex). This may lead to--through a variety of mechanisms--higher amounts of genetic divergence within this region, i.e. between the X/Z and Y/W chromosomes, especially when compared to their autosomal counterparts. Recent advances in genome sequencing and computation have brought with them the ability to resolve haplotypes within a diploid individual, permitting assembly of previously challenging genomic regions like sex chromosomes. Leveraging these advances, we identified replicable diagnostic characteristics between typical autosomes and sex chromosomes (within a single genome assembly). Under this framework, we can use this information to identify putative sex chromosome linkage groups across divergent vertebrate taxa and simultaneously curate misassembled regions on autosomes. Here, we present this conceptual framework and associated tool for identifying candidate sex chromosome linkage groups from a single, diploid individual dubbed Sex Chromosome Identification by Negating Kmer Densities, or SCINKD.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

However, the impact of disrupting anti-ferroptotic pathways in the broader tumor microenvironment (TME), such as in immune cells, is still undefined and may complicate treatments. Here, we show that Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1 (FSP1/Aifm2) is critically required for regulatory T cell (Treg) resistance to ferroptosis and their immunosuppressive function within the TME. Compared to other canonical ferroptosis regulators such as GPX4, GCH1, and NRF2, only FSP1 was induced upon T cell activation. Deletion of Aifm2 in all T cells, or Tregs specifically, enhanced tumor control by selectively disrupting Treg immunosuppression within tumors without inciting autoimmune pathology in mice. As opposed to deletion of Gpx4 in all T cells, T cell deletion of Aifm2 did not impair antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. These results reveal a unique opportunity for targeting a regulator of ferroptosis that can not only directly target cancer cells, but also simultaneously enhance anti-cancer immune responses without inciting autoimmunity.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

Human genetic data and functional experimentation have demonstrated that H2AK119ub is required for cortical development, however the molecular mechanism for this remains unknown. Here, we show that mouse embryos expressing catalytically deficient RING1B exhibit intact early neurogenesis but display impaired neuroectodermal fate restriction. Using in vivo, primary, and in vitro models, we demonstrate that reduced H2AK119ub leads to ectopic activation of lineage-inappropriate transcriptional programmes, including mesodermal and endodermal gene expression during neural differentiation. This transcriptional deregulation is not solely attributable to H2AK119ub or H3K27me3 loss but instead reflects sensitisation of PRC1 target genes to inappropriate transcription factor (TF)-mediated activation. Synthetic induction of candidate TFs, including GATA6, SOX7, and SNAI1, phenocopies the fate-skewing effects of PRC1 catalytic dysfunction, confirming their causal role. Our results uncover a buffering role for PRC1-catalysed H2AK119ub in safeguarding neural progenitor identity by preventing inappropriate TF-driven transcription and provides a mechanistic framework for understanding the cellular heterogeneity and phenotypic variability observed in Polycomb-associated neurodevelopmental disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

ResultsWe developed TATAT, a modular, Dockerized software that contains all the tools necessary to generate an annotated coding transcriptome from raw RNA-seq data. The tools remain in a static state and can be coordinated with bash and python scripts provided therein, making TATAT a standardized, reproducible workflow that can easily be shared and installed.

The reason often invoked is the dysregulation of the immune system, which is both cause and consequence of ageing. However, we do not all age in the same way, and increased susceptibility may not be solely due to immune dysregulation affecting resistance to infection. There are many possible ways to make a host less tolerant to infection by dysregulating key physiological or metabolic processes. We hypothesised that the increase in susceptibility to infection over age can be linked to both immune ageing and decreased tolerance, and importantly, that it will depend on genotype and sex of the host. We assessed susceptibility to Gram-negative bacterial challenge in both sexes in 22 Drosophila isolines at young and old ages, and leveraged variation between genotypes to investigate how frequently an increase in susceptibility to infection was more associated with a decline in resistance or disease tolerance mechanisms. To achieve this, we assessed pathogen load to report on host immune decline. Strikingly, in most cases, greater infection susceptibility at old age was driven by reduced tolerance, although we also frequently identify cases that suffered bona fide immunosenescence, e.g. impaired resistance. We screened across bacterial pathogens during systemic and oral infections and found sex-specific signatures in survival in young and old individuals, but increased susceptibility with age occurred in both sexes. Pairing infection survival with lifespan data, we find that transcending genotype variation, susceptibility at old age predicts lifespan in males only, regardless of the existence or direction of sex bias in longevity. This work highlights that increased infection susceptibility is an early-arising ageing phenotype that occurs in both sexes, but only predicts lifespan in males, paralleling burgeoning evidence in mammals for male-biased effects of age on infection and its connection with mortality. Our data support a model where infection susceptibility increases with age following the same multiplicative pattern as organismal mortality, with existing failures making new failures more consequential. We propose that the term ""immunosenescence"" be used specifically to describe proven dysregulation of immune tissue resistance mechanisms. We argue that to fully understand the drivers of age-related susceptibility to infection, it is essential to consider genotype, sex, and their interaction, as well as the dysregulation of non-immune functions that influence the ability to control pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

However, recent studies have uncovered their role in antigen surveillance and immune signalling initiation. To investigate how membrane protrusions initiate and contribute to signalling, from the first cell-cell contact to immunological synapse formation, we performed dynamic imaging experiments of endogenously tagged signalling proteins in T cells. To quantitatively capture the early dynamics of cell-cell interactions, we employed HER2-CAR-expressing T cells targeting HER2+breast cancer cells. By harnessing live-cell imaging and super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy we were able to capture topological membrane changes and their correlation with mesoscale protein rearrangements over time. Our findings indicate that, prior to activation, key molecular players in T cell activation, including the kinase Lck, the phosphatase CD45 and the adaptor LAT, as well as the exogenously expressed CAR, lack any enrichment in actin-rich protrusions. However, upon initial contact of the T cell with the target cell, a dynamic and fast rearrangement of the surface receptors, phosphatases, and kinases occurs within the protrusions, ensuring a rapid and effective initiation of the immune signalling cascade. The rapid clustering of the HER2-CAR occurs preferentially within protrusions rather than flat membrane regions and is accompanied by enhanced recruitment of the kinase ZAP-70 and LAT. While the localisation of the kinase Lck remained unchanged, protrusion-cell contacts trigger a pronounced exclusion of the phosphatase CD45, an effect observed both with and without the cytosolic signalling domain of the CAR.

A key component of social behavior is approach, where animals actively move to-ward social partners to maintain group cohesion, establish affiliations, and coordinate actions. While a continuous stream of social information is encoded across sensory modalities, it remains unclear whether a distinct neural process underlies social approach. Here, we developed a novel assay in which a head-fixed, tail-free zebrafish interacts with a freely swimming conspecific, enabling precise quantification of social behavior alongside whole-brain functional imaging at cellular resolution. We demonstrate that zebrafish approach behavior is jointly shaped by spatial and temporal information from conspecifics rather than by these features acting independently. Social approach behavior is preceded by distinct brain-wide neural activity patterns emerging seconds before movement onset, characterized by increased activity in a small subset of forebrain neurons and decreased activity in midbrain and hindbrain neuronal populations. These activity patterns reliably predict upcoming approach movements from each of these regions separately. Moreover, the extent to which neural activity distinguishes approach from non-approach movements predicts individual differences in social behavior, directly linking neural dynamics to behavioral variability. Together, our findings reveal a neural mechanism underlying social approach behavior, highlighting how a distributed yet functionally coordinated network facilitates social interaction.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

How these cancer-specific methylation changes are established in the decades before cancer, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we use a unique collection of longitudinal blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia to sensitively track the dynamics of DNA methylation changes at high temporal resolution. We identify thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that exhibit altered patterns of methylation up to 10 years before acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) diagnosis. Most of these DMRs are strongly associated with expanding clones carrying somatic driver mutations. We identify a subset of  epigenetic driver DMRs characterised by recurrent CpG alterations that are highly shared across pre-AML cases. These are likely to reflect early epigenetic reprogramming associated with AML development. We also reveal large numbers of stochastic  passenger CpGs whose differential methylation results from hitch-hiking with clonal expansions driven by somatically acquired genetic events. These passenger CpGs can be exploited for lineage tracing to discover clonal expansions driven by missing driver mutations. Our findings show widespread changes in methylation patterns during the early stages of cancer development which could be utilised for risk prediction and therapeutic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

DesignMatched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

In this regard, harnessing the inherent ability of cellular tissues to self-organize and generate robust force fields offers a promising strategy for creating self-shaping living surfaces. However, achieving precise control over tissue mechanics to direct specific morphogenetic outcomes remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a strategy to program tissue shape transformations through the nematic organization of cellular forces. By precisely controlling nematic order and topological defects, we generate millimeter-scale tissues programmed with specific multicellular tension fields. Using a theoretical framework that integrates contractile nematics with thin sheet mechanics, we explore the role of nematically guided tensions in shape morphogenesis. Experimentally, upon tissue detachment, nematically guided tension fields drive out-of-plane deformations, generating reproducible 3D shapes. By integrating tissue contractility and nematic patterning, our approach offers a robust framework for the rational design of shape-programmable living surfaces.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

We first reveal striking similarities in interphase microtubule organization across diverse diatom species by characterizing cytoskeletal arrangements throughout cell cycles and populations, uniting both pennate and centric morphologies under shared principles. We further unveil diatom photosynthetic diversity through qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis of chloroplast and pyrenoid morphologies, demonstrating that each diatom species architects unique photosynthetic machinery. Using cryo-ExM on environmental samples further exposes intricate diatom symbioses, revealing tight spatial organisation of ecological interactions.

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

The viral non-structural protein NS3 is a membrane-bound AAA+ ATPase of superfamily 3 (SF3) with multiple proposed roles in the norovirus replication cycle. However, the structure of NS3, and the mechanisms by which it contributes to genome replication and membrane remodeling, have remained unknown. We engineered a soluble, hexameric, and catalytically active form of NS3 and determined its cryo-EM structure in the presence of a nucleotide analogue at 2.9 [A] resolution. The structure adopts a split lock-washer architecture characteristic of AAA+ motors that operate via a hand-over-hand translocation mechanism2. Modeling of the nucleotide-binding site reveals conserved features governing ATP binding and hydrolysis. Using integrative modeling with AlphaFold3, we generated a full-length, membrane-associated model of NS3, in which an N-terminal transmembrane domain, central helical bundle, and AAA+ motor form a continuous conduit. This model supports a role for NS3 as a candidate membrane-spanning RNA translocase that couples ATP hydrolysis to genome movement. This structural framework helps address long-standing gaps in our understanding of norovirus replication and establishes a basis for mechanistic studies and structure-guided antiviral design.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

In a comprehensive analysis of N. benthamiana agroinfiltration experiments, we model sources of variability that affect transient expression. Our findings emphasize the need to validate normalization methods under the specific conditions of each study, as distinct normalization schemes do not always reduce variation either within or between experiments.

As part of a broader long-term study on African leopard (Panthera pardus) population ecology in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda, we deployed camera traps on animal trails and at Python Cave, a known roost site of Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and a confirmed Marburg and virus reservoir. This serendipitous deployment yielded the first visual documentation of a multi-trophic predator and scavenger guild interacting at a filovirus reservoir site. Over a five month period (February 16th - June 5th 2025) across 304 trap nights, we recorded at least 14 different vertebrate species, including leopards, primates, raptors, and small carnivores, engaging in bat predation, scavenging on bat remains, guano foraging, or cave exploration across 261 temporally and spatially independent events (>1 hour apart). These instances were structured, repeated and the species continuously made contact with the bats or entered their roosting space. Camera traps also recorded an estimated 400 human individuals visiting the cave -- including school groups, tourists, and local trainees -- the majority with no personal protective equipment. The shallow, accessible structure of Python Cave appears to collapse the typical spatial buffers between reservoir species and both predators and humans. These observations constitute the first ecological confirmation of a dynamic, multispecies exposure network at a known Marburg virus site, and may represent a Rosetta Stone for interpreting the real-time mechanics of zoonotic spillover.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

While these have the potential to significantly accelerate scientific discoveries by creating AI-driven virtual cell models, their progress has been greatly limited by the lack of large-scale high-quality perturbation data, which remains constrained due to scalability bottlenecks and assay variability. Here, we introduce ""Fix-Cryopreserve-ScRNAseq"" (FiCS) Perturb-seq, an industrialized platform for scalable Perturb-seq data generation. We demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq exhibits high sensitivity and low batch effects, effectively capturing perturbation-induced transcriptomic changes and recapitulating known biological pathways and protein complexes. In addition, we release X-Atlas: Orion edition (X-Atlas/Orion), the largest publicly available Perturb-seq atlas. This atlas, generated from two genome-wide FiCS Perturb-seq experiments targeting all human protein-coding genes, comprises eight million cells deeply sequenced to over 16,000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell. Furthermore, we show that single guide RNA (sgRNA) abundance can serve as a proxy for gene knockdown (KD) efficacy. Leveraging the deep sequencing and substantial cell numbers per perturbation, we also show that stratification by sgRNA expression can reveal dose-dependent genetic effects. Taken together, we demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq is an efficient and scalable platform for high-throughput Perturb-seq screens. Through the release of X-Atlas/Orion, we highlight the potential of FiCS Perturb-seq to address current scalability and variability challenges in data generation, advance foundation model development that incorporates gene-dosage effects, and accelerate biological discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

A categorical view emphasizes discrete category-selective areas, while a dimensional view highlights continuous feature maps spanning across these areas. Can these divergent perspectives on cortical organization be reconciled within a unifying framework? Using data-driven decomposition of fMRI responses in face-, body-, and scene-selective areas, we identified overlapping activity patterns shared across individuals. Each area encoded multiple interpretable dimensions tuned to both finer subcategory features and coarser cross-category distinctions beyond its preferred category, even in the most category-selective voxels. These dimensions formed distinct clusters within category-selective areas but were also sparsely distributed across the broader visual cortex, supporting both locally selective, category-specific, and globally distributed, feature-based coding. Together, these findings suggest multidimensional tuning as a fundamental organizing principle that integrates feature-selective clusters, category-selective areas, and large-scale tuning maps, providing a more comprehensive understanding of category representations in human visual cortex.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

The protein C2CD3 is critical for distal appendage assembly, with mutations linked to orofaciodigital syndrome and other ciliopathies. However, its precise molecular role in appendage recruitment remains unclear. Using Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-ExM), iterative U-ExM, and in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), we reveal that C2CD3 adopts a radially symmetric 9-fold organization within the centrioles distal lumen. We show that the C-terminal region of C2CD3 localizes close to a [~]100 nm luminal ring structure consisting of [~]27 nodes, while its N-terminal region localizes close to a hook-like structure that attaches to the A-microtubule as it extends from the centriole interior to exterior. This hook structure is adjacent to the DISCO complex (MNR/CEP90/OFD1), which marks future appendage sites. C2CD3 depletion disrupts not only the recruitment of the DISCO complex via direct interaction with MNR but also destabilizes the luminal ring network composed of C2CD3/SFI1/centrin-2/CEP135/NA14, as well as the distal microtubule tip protein CEP162. This reveals an intricate ""in-to-out"" molecular hub connecting the centriolar lumen, distal microtubule cap, and appendages. Although C2CD3 loss results in shorter centrioles and appendage defects, key structural elements remain intact, permitting continued centriole duplication. We propose that C2CD3 forms the luminal ring structure and extends radially to the space between triplet microtubules, functioning as an architectural hub that scaffolds the distal end of the centriole, orchestrating its assembly and directing appendage formation.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

For this reason, the genetic profiles of Genghis Khan and his descendants are of keen academic and public interest. His Y-chromosome has been hypothesized to belong to haplogroup C3* (C2a1a3-F1918) but this has yet to be substantiated. To explore the genetic ancestry of Genghis Khan, we analyzed four archaeological individuals from the Golden Horde, including three males and one female, who were buried in separate medieval elite mausoleums in the Ulitau region of Kazakstan. One of the males is believed to be Joshi (Juchi), the eldest son of Genghis Khan. We generated genomic data from these archaeological individuals and found that the three males were paternally related, sharing the Y-chromosome haplogroup C3*, consistent with the hypothesized signature haplotype of Genghis Khan. In addition, we confirm that the Golden Horde elites derived most of their genomes from Ancient Northeast Asians (ANA) while having an additional ancestral component from either Ancient North Eurasians (ANE) or a Berel Scythian related population.

Protein- and RNA-rich liquid-like condensates form through phase separation on and around chromatin, driving diverse condensate morphologies with varying sphericity and intra-condensate chromatin density3,4. However, a unifying set of physical principles underlying these varied interactions and their implications for chromatin organization remains elusive. Here, we develop and experimentally validate a mesoscopic model that bridges the physics of phase separation and chromatin mechanics. Specifically, by integrating computational modeling with experiments using two canonical condensate proteins, the heterochromatin protein HP1, and the euchromatin protein BRD4, we demonstrate that wetting properties and chromatin stiffness shape condensate morphology, while condensates remodel chromatin mechanics and organization. This two-way interplay is governed by elastocapillarity--the deformation of chromatin by condensate interfacial tension -- and resolves discrepancies in nuclear condensate behavior, with emergent behaviors that deviate from the simplest liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) models5-8. Our findings underscore that nuclear condensates and chromatin cannot be studied in isolation, as they are fundamentally interdependent, impacted by biomolecularly-defined wetting properties, with implications for genome organization, transcriptional regulation, and epigenetic control in diverse phenotypes, including cancer2,9,10.

The mechanism by which ectopic gene activation occurs through these gain-of-function enhancer mutations remains poorly understood. Using the ZRS, a benchmark disease-associated enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), as a model, we demonstrate that poised (i.e., accessible but inactive) chromatin sensitizes Shh to aberrant activation in anterior limb bud, leading to polydactyly. In the anterior limb cells of wild-type mice, Shh is inactive, but the ZRS is accessible and marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. We demonstrate that this poising signature explains how over 20 independent rare variants within the ZRS cause Shh misexpression in the same anterior limb bud cell population, resulting in similar limb malformations, despite affecting binding sites for different activators and repressors. Disabling pioneer transcription factor binding to the ZRS suppresses its poised state in anterior cells, prevents aberrant activation of the ZRS by rare variants, and fully rescues limb malformations in variant knock-in mice. A thorough examination of other disease-associated enhancers with pathogenic gain-of-function variants revealed that they are all poised in tissues with ectopic activity. We use this poising signature to predict and validate in vivo ectopic forebrain activity of previously uncharacterized autism-associated non-coding variants. Our findings suggest that spatial enhancer poising, likely a byproduct of development, creates a susceptibility to non-coding mutations and offers a potential mechanistic explanation for the burden of disease-associated non-coding variants.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

While the virus itself contributes to pathogenesis, disease severity is primarily influenced by the hosts response to infection. One factor observed to impact the host response is sex, as epidemiological data indicates that male persons have a higher case fatality rate than females infected with MERS-CoV. However, the mechanism underlying this sex bias is unknown and disease course remains difficult to predict. This study investigates how male and female transgenic mice expressing humanized dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (hDPP4) respond to MERS-CoV infection following exposure to either a tolerance-inducing low dose or lethal high dose. We observed that female hDPP4 mice display dose-dependent tolerance to infection and males experienced uniformly lethal disease in both dosing groups. Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis revealed that males suppress innate and inflammatory responses early after infection, causing delayed induction of the host antiviral response. In contrast, high dose females mount an immediate and sustained interferon and inflammatory response, activating antiviral effectors and interferon-stimulated genes. Tolerant females displayed the greatest transcriptional control, showing no pathway enrichment and minimal changes in weight throughout infection. Our results suggest that the magnitude of the response is driven by dose while the nature of the response in shaped by sex. Females mount a more robust response to MERS-CoV infection, allowing females to tolerate low-dose infection but causing uncontrolled inflammation after high dose infection. In contrast, males experienced lethal outcomes regardless of dose. By examining the dynamics of sex-biased host transcriptional responses in determining disease severity, this study highlights the importance of sex as a biological variable in coronavirus pathogenesis research.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

However, these methods are inherently specialized, relying on predefined assumptions and/or limited scalability. Recent advances in simulation and deep learning provide an alternative approach: learning directly to generalize from synthetic genetic data to infer specific hidden evolutionary processes. Here we reframe the inference of coalescence times as a problem of translation between two biological languages: the sparse, observable patterns of mutation along the genome and the unobservable ancestral recombination graph (ARG) that gave rise to them. Inspired by large language models, we develop cxt, a decoder-only transformer that autoregressively predicts coalescent events conditioned on local mutational context. We show that cxt performs on par with state-of-the-art MCMC-based likelihood models across a broad range of demographic scenarios, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Trained on simulations spanning the stdpopsim catalog, the model generalizes robustly and enables efficient inference at scale, producing over a million coalescence predictions in minutes. In addition cxt produces a well calibrated approximate posterior distribution of its predictions, enabling principled uncertainty quantification. Our work moves towards a foundation model for population genetics, bridging deep learning and coalescent theory to enable flexible, scalable inference of genealogical history from genomic data.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

Here we report evolutionary analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data of male and female human, marmoset (New World monkey), and mouse gonadal cells spanning key prenatal stages. We find that the two primates and mouse share similar X chromosome expression dynamics, including X chromosome reactivation (XCR), and that in Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) testes, germ cells undergo female-like XCR and escape of X inactivation. New male-specific regulatory regions have emerged progressively during mammalian evolution, especially on the X following sex chromosome origination. Further analyses revealed that male-specific regulatory regions evolved faster than female-specific ones in both supporting and pre-meiotic germ cells. However, female meiotic germ cells show even higher rates of molecular evolution and exhibit a permissive chromatin state that facilitates the birth of new genes, thus resembling their adult spermatogenic counterparts. Finally, we traced both conserved and species-specific gene expression trajectories across the three mammals, uncovering candidate genes for disorders of sex development that are typically central to cell-type-specific regulatory networks. Together, our study unveils both ancestral mammalian and recently evolved gene regulatory programs that control human- and primate-specific aspects of gonadal development in both sexes.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875454

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2. These structural predictions were based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database, together with corresponding protein sequences obtained from UniProt. We then assessed the predicted interaction structures through various confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we performed a limited evaluation against experimentally determined human protein complex structures not included in the Boltz-2 training regimen, which indicated prediction accuracy consistent with AlphaFold3. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, while highlighting both strengths and limitations. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875455

Correspondingly, current theories describe muscle activity as a function of cortical dynamics. Tasks like speech and locomotion, however, require the integration of voluntary commands with ongoing movements orchestrated by largely independent subcortical centers. In such cases, motor cortex must receive inputs representing the state of the environment and the state of subcortical networks, then transform these inputs into commands that modulate the rhythmic motor pattern. Here, we study this transformation in mice performing an obstacle traversal task, which combines a spinal locomotor pattern with voluntary cortical adjustments. Cortical dynamics contain a prominent representation of motor preparation that is linked to obstacle proximity and robust to removal of somatosensory or visual input, and also maintain a representation of the state of the spinal pattern generator. Readout signals resembling commands for obstacle traversal are consistent across trials, but small in amplitude. Using computational modeling, we identify a simple algorithm that generates the appropriate commands through phase-dependent gating. Together, these results reveal a regime in which motor cortex does not fully specify muscle activity, but must sculpt an ongoing, spinally-generated program to flexibly control behavior in a complex and changing environment.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875455

Here we present the first direct evidence that H3K4me3 is not a cause but a consequence of transcriptional activation, functioning as a downstream epigenetic response. Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription. Together, these findings redefine H3K4me3 as a post-transcriptional histone mark, revealing an unexpected layer of epigenetic regulation with broad implications for gene expression control.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875455

As an example, two bat genomes of size 2.2Gbp and 2.5Gbp can be compared in a little over 2 minutes using 8 threads on an Apple M4 Max laptop using 5.7GB of memory and producing 1.05 million alignments totaling 1.63Gbp of aligned sequence that cover about 60% of each genome.

ObjectiveTo estimate the impacts of federal policy changes on PrEP coverage, new HIV infections and costs associated with new HIV infections

DesignEstimation of excess HIV infections under different policy impacts were conducted using parameters from a previously published ecological model of the relationship between PrEP coverage and new HIV infections. Costs were estimated for the treatment of infections not averted under different scenarios.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsThere was no individual participation in research activities; population-based data sources were used to describe the population-level PrEP use and new diagnoses under different hypothetical changes in PrEP coverage.

ExposuresPercent of people with indications for PrEP who are taking PrEP

Main Outcome and MeasuresEstimated change in new HIV infections under different assumptions of change in PrEP coverage; costs of treatment for avoidable HIV infections and net costs of avoidable infections after accounting for costs of PrEP medications.

ResultsEven modest reductions in PrEP coverage would result in thousands of avoidable HIV infections. An absolute 3.3% annual reduction in PrEP coverage over the next decade would result in 8,618 avoidable HIV infections, with lifetime medical costs of over $3.6 billion (discounted) for treatment of the unaverted HIV infections.

Conclusions and RelevanceChanges in policy that reduce PrEP uptake would result in avoidable HIV infections and increased costs for HIV treatment. Maintaining policies and programs that support PrEP uptake offers benefits for health and is estimated to result in net cost savings.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the likely impacts on HIV transmissions and healthcare costs if policy changes result in decreased PrEP utilization in the United States?

FindingsUnder assumptions of even modest reductions in PrEP use, we estimated thousands of HIV infections would fail to be averted over the next decade, and billions of dollars of additional treatment costs would accrue to the healthcare system.

Results of the studyWe used historical descriptive data on the US HIV epidemic to quantify the relationship between PrEP coverage and trends in HIV diagnoses and to estimate future trends in HIV infections if PrEP coverage were to be rolled back. If PrEP use declines modestly - about 3% annually - we estimate that 8,618 new infections would fail to be averted in a decade because of lowered PrEP uptake, and the estimated lifetime medical costs of these unaverted infections would be $3.6 billion (discounted) and $9.3 billion (undiscounted).

MeaningChanges in healthcare priorities and policies, especially those that increase out of pocket costs of PrEP or reduce the convenience of engaging in PrEP care, risk rolling back our progress in ending the HIV epidemic, accruing avertable HIV infections, and incurring increased costs for medical care of people whose HIV infections were avoidable.","NA","medrxiv",1752703875455

Microbiota sequencing revealed involvement of Av2 in suppression of Pseudomonas spp. recruitment upon plant inoculation with V. dahliae, suggesting that Av2 suppresses the cry for help.

This method limits measurements of free-swimming organisms without boundary effects or movement restrictions. We present energy consumption measurements of free-swimming jellyfish based on 3D morphological reconstructions of the animal during the process of catabolysis utilizing a non-invasive technique. We used a 6-meter tall, 13,600 liter water tank for swimming experiments without food present in the water column. To study continuous swimming, we implemented an onboard microelectronic swim controller that externally stimulated jellyfish swimming for 50 hours. Computer vision-based feedback control was used to enable continuous swimming against a flow current without encountering the vertical limits of the tank over a distance of 2.55 km or 15,000 body lengths. Using a 3D laser scanning system, we created morphological reconstructions of the jellyfish before, during, and after swimming experiments. Changes in animal volume were converted to energy consumption using the body chemical composition determined with elemental analysis. Free-swimming, electrically stimulated animals were found to consume 2.5 times more energy than similarly stimulated animals in a constrained environment, likely due in part to additional hydrodynamic drag associated with free-swimming. Simplified drag models could not fully account for the increased energy consumption. This highlights the need for hydrodynamic models that more effectively capture these dynamics. These measurements suggest that this technique could be applied more broadly to measuring free-swimming metabolic rates of other gelatinous invertebrates.

Here we analyzed whole-genome sequences of 150 individuals across China, Korea, Okinawa, and Taiwan, including a newly identified northern Chinese population from Qingdao. We found a deep divergence between continental (Korea-China) and insular (Okinawa-Taiwan) populations and specify northern China and Taiwan as sources for Korea and Okinawa, respectively.

An old split time between Qingdao and Korea ([~]3,500 generations ago) and multiple gene flows into Qingdao reject a simple scenario of a single recent northward migration.

However, the structural basis of interactions between EA and TRPC4/5 proteins has remained elusive, limiting our ability to fully understand and exploit mechanisms of TRPC4/5 channel activation by this intriguing natural product. Here, we present nine high-resolution cryo-EM structures (2.4-3.2 [A]) of human TRPC5 - representing different states and ligand occupancies - which show that EA binds to a conserved lipid binding site between transmembrane domains of adjacent TRPC5 subunits. Our structural models are consistent with the effects of mutagenesis of nearby residues on EAs potency, efficacy and activation kinetics, and allow us to rationalise competitive inhibition by other TRPC4/5 modulators as well as EAs selectivity profile within the TRPC family. Comparison of structures containing various TRPC5:EA stoichiometries revealed key structural and molecular determinants of EA-mediated TRPC5 activation - most notably the aromatic interaction network around Phe520 - underscoring the critical function of Met-aromatic motifs in ion channel structure and function. Binding of EA causes conformational changes of nearby amino acid residues, resulting in rearrangement of the pore helices into a pre-open state.

Linear growth is governed by the somatotropic axis, wherein pituitary growth hormone (GH) stimulates hepatic insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) to promote bone elongation1.

How these networks are altered at the cellular level remains unclear owing to challenges of bridging data across scales. Here, we integrate in vivo cortical similarity networks with whole brain spatial transcriptomics to characterize the aging brain in a lifespan cohort of macaques (N=64, ages 1-26 years). Deep-layer excitatory neurons and oligodendrocytes emerged as dominant correlates of cortical similarity, linking infragranular cell type composition to macroscopic network structure. Age-related declines in network strength were most pronounced in transmodal networks, including default mode and limbic, and aligned with regions enriched in inhibitory and glial cell types. Parvalbumin-enriched chandelier cells showed the strongest association with regional vulnerability, suggesting a role in network disconnection. Cell-type enrichment was conserved across species, with both human and macaque transcriptomic data aligning with the cortical functional hierarchy. These findings uncover a cellular basis for cortical network aging and highlight the value of imaging-transcriptomic integration across scales.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875455

In this study, we develop a conditional knock-in mouse model expressing a mitochondrially targeted variant of the bacterial toxin DarT (mitoAtDarT), which induces mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage without affecting the nuclear genome. Ubiquitous expression of mitoAtDarT leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, evidenced by reduced membrane potential and mitochondrial mass, resulting in early embryonic lethality. Employing high-resolution microCT and molecular markers, we demonstrate that mitoAtDarT-expressing embryos fail to undergo normal gastrulation, exhibiting disrupted mesodermal patterning and a complete absence of allantois formation. Surprisingly, defects in lineage specification were evident even earlier, during preimplantation development. Blastocysts expressing mitoAtDarT exhibited reduced total cell numbers, altered trophectoderm-to-inner cell mass ratios, and a striking increase in cells co-expressing lineage markers, indicating a failure in the first cell fate decision. Our findings demonstrate that mitochondrial integrity is essential not only for energy metabolism but also for the precise coordination of cell fate specification and morphogenesis. This work suggests developmental checkpoints are sensitive to mitochondrial genome damage and establishes mitoAtDarT as a powerful tool for dissecting the contributions of mitochondria to embryonic development.","NA","biorxiv",1752703875455
