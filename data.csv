In this study, we used SARS-CoV-2 as a model system to explore whether the intrahost diversity of viral infections could provide clues on the relative fitness of single amino acid variants (SAVs). To do so, we analysed ~15 million complete genomes and nearly ~8000 sequencing libraries generated from SARS-CoV-2 infections, which were collected at various timepoints during the COVID-19 pandemic. Across timepoints, we found that many successful SAVs were detected in the intrahost diversity of samples collected prior, with a median of 6-40 months between the initial collection dates of samples and the highest frequency seen for these SAVs. Additionally, we found that the co-occurrence of intrahost SAVs significantly captures genetic linkage patterns observed at the interhost level (Pearson's r=0.28-0.45, all p<0.0001). Further, we show that machine learning models can learn highly generalisable intrahost, physiochemical and phenotypic patterns to forecast the future fitness of intrahost SAVs (r2=0.48-0.63). Most of these models performed significantly better when considering genetic linkage (r2=0.53-0.68). Overall, our results document the evolutionary forces shaping the fitness of mutations, which may offer potential to forecast the emergence of future variants and ultimately inform the design of vaccine targets.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542273

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542273

These archaeal tissues are mechanically and molecularly distinct from their unicellular lifestyle, mimicking several eukaryotic features. Notably, archaeal tissues undergo a coenocytic stage followed by a tubulin-independent cellularization, orchestrated by active membrane tension at a critical cell size. Past cellularization, tissues are organized into two cell types - apical and basal scutoids - with junction elasticity akin to animal tissues, with actin and protein glycosylation as fiducial polarity markers.

Chromatin in the cell varies greatly, from euchromatin to heterochromatin, in its genome functions. It is important to understand how heterochromatin is physically different from euchromatin. However, their specific labeling methods in living cells are limited. To address this, we have developed replication-dependent histone labeling (Repli-Histo labeling) to label nucleosomes in euchromatin and heterochromatin based on DNA replication timing. We investigated local nucleosome motion in the four chromatin classes from euchromatin to heterochromatin of living human and mouse cells. We found that more euchromatic regions (earlier replicated regions) show greater nucleosome motion. Notably, the motion profile in each chromatin class persists throughout interphase. Genome chromatin is essentially replicated from regions with greater nucleosome motions, even though the replication timing program is perturbed. Our findings, combined with computational modeling, suggest that earlier replicated regions have more accessibility and local chromatin motion can be a major determinant of genome-wide replication timing.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542273

We lack global and temporally continuous coverage on tree mortality data. Ground-based observations on tree mortality, e.g., derived from national inventories, are very sparse, not standardized and not spatially explicit. Earth observation data, combined with supervised machine learning, offer a promising approach to map tree mortality over time. However, global-scale machine learning requires broad training data covering a wide range of environmental settings and forest types. Drones provide a cost-effective source of training data by capturing high-resolution orthophotos of tree mortality events at sub-centimeter resolution. Here, we introduce deadtrees.earth, an open-access platform hosting more than a thousand centimeter-resolution orthophotos, covering already more than 300,000 ha, of which more than 58,000 ha are fully annotated. This community-sourced and rigorously curated dataset shall serve as a foundation for a global initiative to gather comprehensive reference data. In concert with Earth observation data and machine learning it will serve to uncover tree mortality patterns from local to global scales. This will provide the foundation to attribute tree mortality patterns to environmental changes or project tree mortality dynamics to the future. Thus, the open and interactive nature of deadtrees.earth together with the collective effort of the community is meant to continuously increase our capacity to uncover and understand tree mortality patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542273

Additionally, there is growing interest in animal social traditions, which appear crucial for social interaction and group cohesion. We have previously documented such a tradition, in which chimpanzees copied inserting blades of grass in their ears from one persistent inventor4. Now, over a decade later, we have observed an unrelated group of chimpanzees where 5/8 individuals began wearing grass in their ears and 6/8 from their rectums. As of 2024, one newly introduced chimpanzee has adopted the grass-in-ear behavior. Given that the behaviors were not observed in seven other groups in the same sanctuary (N=148), we conclude that social learning of arbitrary behavior occurred and discuss our findings considering the larger scope of animal culture.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

We studied 40 patients with DoC who underwent DBS targeting the thalamic centromedian-parafascicular complex. Better-preserved gray matter, especially in the striatum, correlated with consciousness improvement. Stimulation was most effective when electric fields extended into parafascicular and subparafascicular nuclei--ventral to the centromedian nucleus, near the midbrain--and when it engaged projection pathways of the ascending arousal network, including the hypothalamus, brainstem, and frontal lobe. Moreover, effective DBS sites were connected to networks similar to those underlying impaired consciousness due to generalized absence seizures and acquired lesions. These findings support the therapeutic potential of DBS for DoC, emphasizing the importance of precise targeting and revealing a broader link between effective DoC treatment and mechanisms underlying other consciousness-impairing conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1729548542274

We found that GTPase factors EngA and ObgE can complement the changes in temperature and magnesium ion concentrations. In the presence of these factors, ribosome assembly can proceed under physiological conditions, with magnesium ion concentrations below 10 mM, potassium concentrations around 100 mM, and temperatures of 37 {degrees}C. Both the ribosome assembly and translation processes were successfully integrated in the reconstituted cell-free protein synthesis system. Furthermore, we found that these GTPase factors can reassemble the ribosomes to an active state, whose structure was disrupted by EDTA chelation of magnesium ions, indicating that these two factors can reversibly induce the ribosome structure to an intact state. The findings are essential for the bottom-up construction of synthetic cells.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Here, we show that the YebC-family protein YebC2 (formerly YeeI) functions as a translation factor in B. subtilis that resolves ribosome stalling at polyprolines. We demonstrate that YebC2, EF-P and YfmR act independently to support cellular fitness. Moreover, we show that YebC2 interacts directly with the 70S ribosome, supporting a direct role for YebC2 in translation. Finally, we assess the evolutionary relationship between YebC2 and other characterized YebC family proteins, and present evidence that transcription and translation factors within the YebC family have evolved separately. Altogether our work identifies YebC2 as a translation factor that resolves ribosome stalling and provides crucial insight into the relationship between YebC2, EF-P, and YfmR, three factors that prevent ribosome stalling at prolines.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

ObjectiveAssess the duration and severity of autonomic dysfunction in adults with Long COVID and evaluate its impact on function and quality of life.

DesignA follow-up survey of a subset of participants from a cross-sectional online survey of adults with Long COVID. Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction.

Participants526 adults (ages 20-65) with a history of Long COVID

Main measuresThe Composite Autonomic Symptom 31 (COMPASS-31) score, the RAND 36-Item Health Survey, the prevalence of new postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and predictors of autonomic dysfunction, including POTS

Key results71.9% of Long COVID patients had a COMPASS-31 score >20, suggestive of moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction. The median symptom duration was 36 [30-40] months, reaching up to 3.5 years after SARS-CoV-2 infection. 37.5% of Long COVID patients could no longer work or had to drop out of school due to their Long COVID illness. 40.5% were newly diagnosed with POTS following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ConclusionsEvidence of persistent moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction was seen in 71.9% of Long COVID patients in our study, with a 36-month median symptom duration, suggesting that enduring autonomic dysfunction is highly prevalent in the Long COVID population. Moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction was significantly correlated with impaired function and capacity, highlighting the need to address POTS and other manifestations of autonomic dysfunction as a key component of Long COVID management.","NA","medrxiv",1729548542274

Release of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland into the bloodstream and their transport into target cells is facilitated by plasma membrane transporters, of which monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)8 and the highly homologous MCT10 are most important. Patients with MCT8 mutations suffer from a severe neurodevelopmental and metabolic disorder, however, the molecular mechanism underlying thyroid hormone transport is unknown. Using cryogenic-sample electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined the ligand-free and thyroxine-bound human MCT8 structures in the outward-open state and the thyroxine-bound human MCT10 in the inward-facing state. Our structural analysis revealed a network of conserved gate residues involved in conformational changes upon thyroxine binding, triggering ligand release on the opposite compartment. We then determined the structure of a folded, but inactive patient-derived MCT8 mutant, indicating a subtle conformational change which explains its reduced transport activity. In addition, we determined the structure of MCT8 bound to its inhibitor silychristin, revealing an interaction with residues essential to drive transition to the inward-facing state, thereby locking the protein in the outward-facing state. This study provides molecular and structural insights into normal and disordered thyroid hormone transport.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Perturbations in the activity or abundance of epigenetic factors can lead to tumorigenesis. Remarkably, several metabolites influence the epigenetic landscape in cells. Here, we investigated the interplay between a highly expressed epigenetic factor, YEATS2, and a metabolic enzyme, GCDH, in regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in head and neck cancer. We report that the histone reader YEATS2 is responsible for increased invasive potential in head and neck cancer in an SP1-dependent manner. YEATS2 functions by maintaining histone crotonylation, and its abrogation leads to a global decrease in the H3K27Cr mark. Mechanistically, we report that YEATS2 maintains high H3K27Cr levels at the promoter of the EMT-promoting gene SPARC. Further, we found that the addition of the H3K27Cr mark is also dependent on the crotonyl-CoA-producing enzyme GCDH. Overall, we describe a novel mechanism of interplay between epigenetics and metabolism in head and neck tumorigenesis, which results in the enhanced expression of EMT-related genes in a histone crotonylation-dependent manner.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

PRMT5 is a type II protein arginine methyltransferase that regulates several tumorigenic events in many cancer types. However, the regulation of PRMT5 and its direct implication on aberrant alternative splicing under hypoxia remains unexplored. In this study, we observed hypoxia induced upregulation of PRMT5 via the CCCTC binding factor, CTCF. Further, PRMT5-mediated symmetric arginine dimethylation H4R3me2s and H3R8me2s directly regulated the alternative splicing of Transcription Factor 3 (TCF3). Under hypoxia, PRMT5-mediated histone dimethylation at the intronic conserved region (ICR) present between TCF3 exon 18a and exon 18b recruits DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), resulting in DNA methylation. DNA methylation at the TCF3-ICR is recognized and bound by Methyl CpG binding protein (MECP2) resulting in RNA-Pol II pausing, promoting the recruitment of the negative splicing factor PTBP1 to the splicing locus of TCF3 mRNA. PTBP1 promotes the exclusion of exon 18a which results in the production of the pro-invasive TCF3-18B (E47) isoform which promotes EMT and invasion of breast cancer cells under hypoxia. Collectively, our results indicate PRMT5-mediated symmetric arginine dimethylation of histones regulates alternative splicing of TCF3 gene thereby enhancing EMT and invasion in breast cancer hypoxia.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

However, the translational potential of spatial transcriptomics is still limited by its high cost, hindering the assembly of large patient cohorts needed for robust biomarker discovery. Here we present Path2Space, a deep learning model trained on spatial transcriptomics data to predict spatial gene expression directly from histopathology slides. Studying breast cancer, the model was first trained on one ST breast cancer patients cohort and further independently tested and validated on two other ST cohorts. Path2Space identifies 4,500 genes whose spatial expression is robustly predicted in all three cohorts, markedly more accurate than existing ST predictors. Second, we show that based on the inferred ST, Path2Space accurately infers cell-type abundances in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Thirdly, Applying Path2Space to the TCGA breast cancer cohort we identify three TME spatially grounded subsets of patients that have markedly different survival rates. Fourth, analyzing two large breast cancer patients cohorts treated with trastuzumab, we show that the heterogeneity of the inferred HER2 levels across the tumor microenvironment is predictive of response, concordant with the bystander hypothesis. Finally, we developed a spatially interpretable model for predicting trastuzumab response directly from the H&E-slides. This model's performance surpasses that of existing response prediction models that use measured bulk multi-omics data. Path2Space is the first approach capable of robustly delineating the tumor microenvironment on an unprecedented scale directly from the tumor slides.

However, the reconstitution of mtDNA deletions responsible for severe mitochondrial myopathies and age-related diseases has not yet been achieved in human cells. Here, we developed a method to engineer specific mtDNA deletions in human cells by co-expressing end-joining (EJ) machinery and targeted endonucleases. As a proof-of-concept, we used mito-EJ and mito-ScaI to generate a panel of clonal cell lines harboring a [~]3.5 kb mtDNA deletion with the full spectrum of heteroplasmy. Investigating these isogenic cells revealed a critical threshold of [~]75% deleted genomes, beyond which cells exhibited depletion of OXPHOS proteins, severe metabolic disruption, and impaired growth in galactose-containing media. Single-cell multiomic analysis revealed two distinct patterns of nuclear gene deregulation in response to mtDNA deletion accumulation; one triggered at the deletion threshold and another progressively responding to increasing heteroplasmy. In summary, the co-expression of mito-EJ and programable nucleases provides a powerful tool to model disease-associated mtDNA deletions in different cell types. Establishing a panel of cell lines with a large-scale deletion at varying levels of heteroplasmy is a valuable resource for understanding the impact of mtDNA deletions on diseases and guiding the development of potential therapeutic strategies.

Variation in the human Glp1r gene leading to altered receptor structure, signal transduction, and function might be directly linked to therapeutic responses in patients. A naturally occurring, low-frequency, gain-of-function missense variant, rs10305492 G>A (A316T), protects against T2D and cardiovascular disease. Here we employ CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate a humanised knock-in mouse model bearing the homozygous Glp1r A316T substitution.

Diffusive generation of latent molecular encodings, rather than direct diffusive generation of molecular structures, offers an appealing way to handle the small and mismatched datasets that are common for molecular properties. We benchmark various diffusion guidance schemes and sampling methods against a pre-trained autoregressive transformer and genetic algorithms to evaluate control over potency, expert preference, and various physicochemical properties. We show that conditional diffusion allows control over the properties of generated molecules, with practical and performance advantages over competing methods. We also apply the recently introduced idea of particle guidance to enhance sample diversity. We prospectively survey a panel of medicinal chemists and determine that we can conditionally generate molecules that align with their preferences via a learned preference score.

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1.

We previously showed that LCFA degradation impedes oxidative protein folding in the Escherichia coli envelope, an issue that arises due to the insufficiency of ubiquinone, a lipid-soluble electron carrier in the electron transport chain (ETC). To maintain redox homeostasis, E. coli activates the CpxAR two-component system; however, the nature of feedback imparted by this envelope stress response (ESR) remained unknown. Here, we show that contrary to the well-recognized remedial mode of Cpx restoring envelope integrity by upregulating protein quality control factors, in LCFA-grown cells, it uses a preventive measure to maintain homeostasis. Cpx increases ubiquinone availability for oxidative protein folding by suppressing LCFA metabolism and directly increasing ubiquinone levels. Further, rather than using its conventional mode of imparting regulation via CpxR working as a transcriptional regulator, during LCFA metabolism, Cpx mainly uses its non-coding arm to counteract envelope redox stress. The Cpx-regulated small RNA CpxQ represses fad genes involved in LCFA transport and {beta}-oxidation, downregulates components of glyoxylate shunt, gluconeogenesis, and ETC, and increases ubiquinone content. Corroborating with its role in repressing LCFA metabolism and maintaining redox homeostasis, CpxQ overexpression impairs growth of E. coli in LCFAs and CpxQ deletion renders LCFA-grown E. coli hypersensitive to a thiol agent. Our foremost work studying the interconnection between LCFA metabolism, redox stress, and ESR in E. coli provides a rationale for investigating similar networks in other LCFA-utilizing bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Through comprehensive analyses of severe DNA methylation loss over TEs in an experimental population and in >700 natural strains of Arabidopsis thaliana, we uncovered hundreds of TE epivariants in nature, most of which can be inherited independently of DNA sequence changes and thus are true epialleles. Furthermore, natural epivariants are enriched near genes and we uncovered a novel role for the Paf1 complex as a major facilitator of their prevalence. Conversely, related TE copies limit epiallelic variation, by producing the small RNAs that guide DNA methylation in trans. Crucially, natural epivariants mainly affect stress-responsive genes, making them unique targets for selection. Our findings therefore demonstrate that TEs are important mediators of transgenerational epigenetic variation in nature, with singular properties for plant adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

CRISPRi screens in iPSC-derived neurons and glia have already been successful in relating gene function to neurological related phenotypes; however, loss of dCas9-KRAB expression after differentiation has been observed by many labs and has limited applicability for post-differentiation gene perturbations. This loss of expression is largely ascribed to transgene silencing after differentiation. Here, we investigated the expression levels of different CRISPR enzymes in iPSC and Ngn2-derived neurons using piggybac delivery. We found that the commonly used dCas9-KRAB (using the KOX1 domain) displayed dramatic reduction in protein expression levels following neuronal differentiation, yet surprisingly, nCas9 constructs retained comparable protein expression between iPSCs and neurons. We further found that CRISPR constructs, primarily relying on the SV40 Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), fail to efficiently localize to the nuclei of neurons, despite having robust nuclear levels in iPSCs, leading to KRAB-specific cytoplasmic degradation. By adding a neuronal-specific NLS, we were able to correct neuronal nuclear localization and protein expression, confirming the contribution of mislocalization to the instability of dCas9-KRAB in neurons. As the lack of nuclear localization can have a profound impact on editing and gene perturbation efficiency, we suggest further investigation across both cultured and in-vivo postmitotic cell models.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

To address this concern, we present a high-throughput proteome-wide MGD screening platform utilizing label-free, data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) for integrated proteomics and ubiquitinomics analysis.

While typically considered an intracellular antioxidant with tumor-promoting capabilities, glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide of cysteine, glutamate, and glycine that can be catabolized, yielding amino acids. The extent to which GSH-derived amino acids are essential to cancers is unclear. Here, we find that GSH catabolism promotes tumor growth. We show that depletion of intracellular GSH does not perturb tumor growth, and extracellular GSH is highly abundant in the tumor microenvironment, highlighting the potential importance of GSH outside of tumors. We find supplementation with GSH can rescue cancer cell survival and growth in cystine-deficient conditions, and this rescue is dependent on the catabolic activity of {gamma}-glutamyltransferases (GGTs). Finally, pharmacologic targeting of GGTs activity prevents the breakdown of circulating GSH, lowers tumor cysteine levels, and slows tumor growth. Our findings indicate a non-canonical role for GSH in supporting tumors by acting as a reservoir of amino acids. Depriving tumors of extracellular GSH or inhibiting its breakdown is potentially a therapeutically tractable approach for patients with cancer. Further, these findings change our view of GSH and how amino acids, including cysteine, are supplied to cells.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

To understand the forces that shape the plant microbiome we need to characterize the microbial traits that contribute to plant colonization. We used barcoded mutant libraries to identify bacterial genes that contribute to the colonization of a monocot and a eudicot host. We show that plant colonization is influenced by dozens of genes. While some of these colonization genes were shared between the two host plant species, most were highly specific, benefiting the colonization of a single host and organ. We characterized an efflux pump that specifically contributes to Arabidopsis shoot colonization. This efflux pump is prevalent across Pseudomonadota genomes, yet benefits the bacterial association with only a small subset of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Leveraging genomic diversity within Arabidopsis thaliana, we confirmed that specific glucosinolate breakdown products are detoxified by this family of efflux pumps.

Most transcriptome analyses to date have focused on leaf-derived galls. To better understand gall formation mechanisms, we investigated stem-derived galls induced by the weevil Smicronyx madaranus on the parasitic plant Cuscuta campestris at gene expression, cellular, and physiological levels. RNA-seq across four developmental stages identified differentially expressed genes and associated gene ontology terms. Consistent with histological observations, genes related to cell division and the cell cycle were upregulated early but decreased as the gall matured. Similar to leaf-derived galls, we found high expression of PLETHORA and meristem-related homeobox genes in early gall development, suggesting that stem cell induction and maintenance are involved in various gall types. Like leaf-derived galls, the expression of genes related to floral organ development increased through the gall development. However, their expression patterns were dramatically different: downstream genes in the flowering pathway were highly expressed at the initial gall stage, whereas upstream genes were highly expressed later. This suggests that the weevil might activate the flowering pathway at unconventional stages, potentially rerouting the typical flowering cascade to influence gall development. Unlike the decrease in photosynthesis-related genes in leaf-derived galls, we observed an increase in these genes in galls formed on the stem of the holoparasitic plant. Shading experiments confirmed that photosynthesis is crucial for both gall growth and the weevil.

However, the developmental mechanism of the extended production of GABAergic neurons in the human brain remains elusive. Here, we use single-cell transcriptomics, bioinformatics, and histological analyses to uncover microglial regulation of the sustained proliferation of GABAergic progenitors and neuroblasts in the human medial ganglionic eminence (hMGE). We show that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and its receptor IGR1R as the top ligand-receptor pair underlying microglia-progenitor communication in the prenatal human brain. Using our newly developed neuroimmune hMGE organoids, which mimics hMGE cytoarchitecture and developmental trajectory, we demonstrate that microglia-derived IGF1 promotes progenitor proliferation and the production of GABAergic neurons. Conversely, IGF1-neutralizing antibodies and IGF1 knockout human embryonic stem cells (hESC)-induced microglia (iMG) completely abolished iMG-mediated progenitor proliferation. Together, these findings reveal a previously unappreciated role of microglia-derived IGF1 in promoting proliferation of neural progenitors and the development of GABAergic neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Its spatially and temporally regulated activity within cells is essential for maintaining proper redox balance, and disruptions in these patterns can lead to oxidative stress and various related pathologies. Redox proteomics, which examines the impact of H2O2 at the proteome level, typically focuses only on thiol oxidation, overlooking broader proteomic alterations and the significance of subcellular localization in these redox processes. In this study, we address these open questions by combining chemogenetics with Thermal Proteome Profiling (TPP) to map global proteome response to compartmentalized H2O2 production. We identified hundreds of proteins with altered thermostability and/or abundance upon localized H2O2 generation in the cytosol, nucleus, and the ER lumen, highlighting their roles in cellular responses to localized H2O2. We identified proteins such as MAP2K1, PARK7, TRAP1, and UBA2 to be highly sensitive to localized H2O2 production. Furthermore, we validated their altered thermostability and found that these changes are controlled via dysregulated protein-protein interactions. This study provides a valuable resource for researchers exploring redox-mediated signal transduction and offers novel insights that could be harnessed in treating oxidative stress-induced pathologies.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Therefore, we aimed to identify genetic and ecological factors that are fundamental for successful horizontal ARG transfer. From the analysis of [~]1 million bacterial genomes and >20,000 metagenomes, we developed random forest models that could reliably predict horizontal ARG transfer between bacteria. Our results suggest that genetic incompatibility, measured as nucleotide composition dissimilarity, negatively influences the likelihood of transfer of ARGs between evolutionarily divergent bacteria. Conversely, environmental co-occurrence increased the likelihood, especially in humans and wastewater, in which several environment-specific dissemination patterns were observed. This study provides new ways to predict the spread of ARGs and provides new insights into the mechanisms governing this evolutionary process.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

The specificity of deadenylation can be mediated through RNA adaptors - RNA-binding proteins that tether substrate mRNAs to Ccr4-Not in a regulated and context-specific manner. Interaction with Ccr4-Not is mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) within the RNA adaptors. Due to the difficulty in studying large IDR-containing complexes, the determinants of specificity and their regulation remain unclear. Here we use structural biology and biochemical reconstitution to show that dispersed segments within IDRs of RNA adaptors bind to several distinct binding sites on Ccr4-Not through multivalent interactions. We further demonstrate that binding can be modulated by phosphorylation, altering the consequent deadenylation rate in a continuously tunable manner. This mechanism is broadly applicable in evolutionarily divergent IDRs from multiple RNA adaptors including fission yeast Puf3, and human Pumilio/PUM1 and Tristetraprolin/TTP. Together, our work suggests that multivalent interactions and phosphorylation represent conserved strategies for regulating gene expression. Thus, in response to cellular cues, mRNA decay can be regulated by a graded mechanism, rather than a bistable on/off switch, rationalizing how post-transcriptional gene expression is fine-tuned.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

A major factor responsible for such seamless assembly are the preferential interactions between the constituent macromolecules, either associative or segregative, that can drive de-mixing to produce co-existing phases, and thus provide a dynamic intracellular compartmentalization. But how these two types of interactions, occurring simultaneously within the cytoplasmic space, influence each other is still largely unknown. This makes understanding and applying the molecular interactions that interfere with each other in such crowded environments crucial when engineering increasingly complex synthetic cells. Here, we show that the interplay between segregative and associative phase separation within cell-mimicking vesicles can lead to rich dynamics between them. Using on-chip microfluidic systems, we encapsulate the associative and segregative components in cell-sized containers and trigger their phase separations to create hierarchical structures that act as molecular recruiters, membrane targeting agents, and initiators of condensation. The obtained multiphase architecture provides an isolated microenvironment for condensates, restricting their molecular communication as well as diffusive motion, and leading to budding-like behaviour at the lipid membrane. In conclusion, we propose segregative phase separation as a universal condensate regulation strategy in managing molecular distribution, condensate location, as well as membrane interaction. We believe our approach will facilitate controlling the behaviour of membraneless organelles within synthetic cells.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Commonly used antiseizure medications (ASMs) for SCN8A-related disorders, caused by gain-of-function variants, are sodium channel blockers. The use of such ASMs is often not enough to gain satisfactory seizure control. In this retrospective study, the effect of cenobamate was assessed in patients with SCN8A-DEE. Methods: Across multiple centers and through a collaboration with the patient advocacy organization International SCN8A Alliance, patients with SCN8A-DEE treated with cenobamate for at least 3 months were identified. Data were obtained once from patients' caregivers or treating physicians through a RedCap survey. The functional effects of the included patients' SCN8A variants were determined by functional tests published in the literature or functionally classified by prediction tools. Results: Twelve patients (2-25 years, 8 females) with presumed gain-of-function SCN8A variants were treated with cenobamate for a mean period of 8.6 months (range 3-27 months). Countable motor seizures were reduced in 12/12 (100%) patients. Seven experienced a seizure reduction above 75% of which two patients achieved seizure freedom. A 25-50% and 50-75% decrease was observed in three and two patients, respectively. An increase in seizure-free days/patient was also reported. Rescue medication was decreased in 83% of patients, and non-seizure-related improvements (increased alertness, better sleep, improved muscle tone) were observed in 58%. Adverse effects were reported by 33%; half resolved spontaneously or by the reduction of concomitant ASMs. Significance: Our data suggest, that cenobamate is a promising and safe treatment for SCN8A-DEE, even during early infancy. As a possible precision approach to treatment, cenobamate effectively reduced seizure burden and ameliorated non-seizure-related symptoms. Similar results may be achieved in cohorts of patients with gain-of-function variants encoding other sodium channels","NA","medrxiv",1729548542274

Here, we performed intravital imaging of microglia mitochondria, revealing that microglial processes diverge, with some containing multiple mitochondria while others are completely void. Microglial processes that engage in minute-to-minute surveillance typically do not have mitochondria. Moreover, unlike process surveillance, mitochondrial motility does not change with animal anesthesia. Likewise, the processes that acutely chemoattract to a lesion site or initially engage with a neuron undergoing programmed cell death do not contain mitochondria. Rather, microglia mitochondria have a delayed arrival into the responding cell processes. Thus, there is subcellular heterogeneity of mitochondrial partitioning and asymmetry between mitochondrial localization and cell process motility or acute damage responses.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Accordingly, studies of perceptual decision-making have historically relied on tasks with fixed choice-response mappings, in which choice and motor response are inextricably linked. Although several studies have since dissociated choice and response, they have typically involved dynamic switching of the choice-response mapping on a trial-by-trial basis. Thus, it remains unclear if abstract choice representations arise specifically when choice-response relationships change dynamically, or if they reflect a more general property of the decision-making process. Here, we show that in the human brain, choices are represented abstractly, even when the association between choice and motor response remains stable over time. We measured neural activity in humans using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while participants performed a motion discrimination task. Importantly, the associations between perceptual choice and motor response were balanced across experimental conditions and remained stable over many trials. We found neural information about the participants perceptual choice, independent of both the motor response and the visual stimulus. This abstract choice information increased during the stimulus period and peaked after the response had been made. Furthermore, choice and response information showed distinct cortical distributions, with strongest choice information in frontoparietal regions. Our results suggest that abstract choice representations are not restricted to action-independent contexts or those with dynamic choice-response associations and may therefore reflect a general role in perceptual decision-making.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Connecting genomic alterations to health outcomes requires extensive computational analysis using accurate algorithms. Over the years, these algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated, but the lack of gold-standard datasets presents a fundamental challenge. Since genomic data is considered personal health information, only a limited number of deeply sequenced cancer genomes are available for distribution. As a result, tool benchmarking is often conducted on a small set of genomes with uncertain ground truths, which makes it difficult to measure the accuracy of analytic workflows. To address this issue, we developed a novel generative AI tool called OncoGAN to generate synthetic cancer genomes based on training sets derived from large-scale genomic projects by employing generative adversarial networks and tabular variational autoencoders. Our results demonstrate that this approach accurately reproduces the number and frequency of mutations and their characteristics. Furthermore, it captures the genomic position of the mutations following the patterns specifically found for each tumor, and it enables us to replicate tumor-specific mutational signatures. To evaluate the fidelity of the simulations, we tested the synthetic genomes using DeepTumour, a software capable of identifying tumor types based on mutational patterns, and demonstrated a high level of concordance between the synthetic genome tumor type and DeepTumour's prediction of the type. This tool will allow the generation of a large realistic training and testing set of cancer genomes containing known genome alterations. This represents an advance for computational biologists, who will now have access to a publicly available set of realistic synthetic genomes with no privacy concerns, which can be used to develop new algorithms, improve the accuracy of existing tools, and benchmarking.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Building on recent formalizations of this phenomenon, we tackle the computational challenge of exhaustively detecting autocatalytic cycles in reactions networks, and further evaluate the impact of thermodynamic constraints on their realization under mass action kinetics. We first characterize the complexity of the detection problem by proving its NP-completeness. This justifies the use of constraint solvers to list all autocatalytic cycles in a given reaction network, and also to group them into compatible sets, composed of cycles whose stoichiometric requirements are not contradictory. Crucially, we show that the introduction of thermodynamic realism does constrain the composition of these sets. Compatibility relationships among cycles can indeed be disrupted when the reaction kinetics obey thermodynamic consistency throughout the network. On the contrary, these constraints have no impact on the realizability of isolated cycles, unless upper or lower bounds are imposed on the concentrations of the reactants. Overall, by better characterizing the conditions of autocatalysis in complex reaction systems, this work brings us a step closer to assessing the contribution of this collective chemical behavior to the emergence of natural selection in the primordial soup.

Significance StatementDescribing the processes behind the origin of life requires us to better understand self-amplifying dynamics in complex chemical systems. Detecting autocatalytic cycles is a critical but difficult step in this endeavor. After characterizing the computational complexity of this problem, we investigate the impact of thermodynamic realism on autocatalysis. We demonstrate that individual cycles, regardless of thermodynamic parameters, can be activated as long as entities may occur at any required concentration. In contrast, two cycles can become mutually incompatible due to thermodynamic constraints, and will thus never run simultaneously. These results clarify the implications of physical realism on the realization of autocatalysis.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Methods: Our study had two aims: (i) to describe two SD cases and detailed assessments of their unaffected monozygotic (MZ) twins, and (ii) to review cases with FTD-associated mutations or known family history classified as SD/svPPA either in the Genetic Frontotemporal dementia Initiative (GENFI) or in the published literature. Results: The two affected twins displayed characteristic features of SD, both in neuroimaging and cognition, whereas their MZ twins exhibited no abnormalities in either regard, even up to 15 years of follow-up for one affected twin. Only five cases out of more than 1300 people in GENFI were classified as svPPA, with a genetic mutation. The systematic review revealed 29 cases with sufficient clinical and language details regarding 'genetic' SD/svPPA. A comparison of these five GENFI and 29 literature cases to the patterns observed in a large number of sporadic cases revealed critical differences in presentation.

Here, we present STRAIGHT-IN Dual, which enables simultaneous, allele-specific, single-copy integration of two DNA payloads with 100% efficiency within one week. Notably, STRAIGHT-IN Dual leverages the STRAIGHT-IN platform to allow near-scarless cargo integration, facilitating the recycling of components for subsequent cellular modifications. Using STRAIGHT-IN Dual, we investigated how promoter choice and gene syntax influences transgene silencing, and demonstrate the impact of these design features on forward programming of hiPSCs into neurons. Furthermore, we designed a grazoprevir-inducible synZiFTR system to complement the widely-used tetracycline-inducible system, providing independent, tunable, and temporally controlled expression of both transcription factors and functional reporters. The unprecedented efficiency and speed with which STRAIGHT-IN Dual generates homogenous genetically engineered hiPSC populations represents a major advancement for synthetic biology in stem cell applications and opens opportunities for precision cell engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

While multiple mechanisms have been theoretically shown to generate population cycles3-6, there are limited examples of mutualisms driving self-sustained oscillations. Using an engineered microbial community that cross-feeds essential amino acids, we experimentally demonstrate cycles in strain abundance that are robust across environmental conditions. A nonlinear dynamical model that incorporates the experimentally observed cross-inhibition of amino acid production recapitulates the population cycles. The model shows that the cycles represent internally generated relaxation oscillations, which emerge when fast resource dynamics with positive feedback drive slow changes in strain abundance. Our findings highlight the critical role of resource dynamics and feedback in shaping population cycles in microbial communities and have implications for biotechnology.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

The results indicate that Omicron BA.1.1 and its pure reverse mutants were widely distributed throughout the United States from the early days of their emergence, showing a statistically significant difference compared to other major variants, which spread from a small number of sources. The peak emergence of BA.1.1 and BA.1.1.18 pure reverse mutants occurred a few weeks before the peak of all collected samples, whereas the peak of pure reverse mutants in major BA.1 variants and BA.2 coincides with the overall sampling peak. Although the peaks of BA.1.x collections are not all synchronous, the peaks of pure reverse mutants in the BA.1 lineage completely overlap, with the number of such mutants declining abruptly after the peak. These regional and temporal anomalies in the Omicron BA.1 lineage, especially in the BA.1.1 lineage, are virtually impossible to explain by current theories of natural mutation and spread by human-to-human infection.","NA","medrxiv",1729548542274

QT45 can synthesize both its complementary strand from a mix of all 64 trinucleotides and a copy of itself using 13 defined trinucleotides and one hexamer as substrates.

Yet, despite its essential role, the technology remains bound by the inherent limitations of quadrupole filters, which throw away up to 99% of the useful ion signal and caps the speed at which fragmentation data can be generated. These deficiencies often force compromises in data depth and accuracy, hindering breakthroughs that tie genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics together. A new technology is poised to break through these performance barriers, unlocking unprecedented capabilities in precision, sensitivity and throughput. This step-change in how mass spectrometry fragmentation analysis is performed will reshape the future of scientific discovery, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. The solution is high resolution ion mobility (HRIM), which offers a means to quickly and efficiently isolate ions prior to fragmentation and detection by a high resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) while also resolving challenging isomeric and isobaric compounds that lead to chimeric MS/MS spectra. HRIM isolates ions in time as a result of a high speed separation rather than acting as a filter that discards ion signal like the pervasive quadrupole mass analyzer, allowing higher sensitivity analysis to be achieved. Also, since HRIM eliminates the need to hop or sweep electronics control parameters, as is the case with a quadrupole, fragmentation spectral generation can occur at a much faster rate, upwards of 500 Hz. This whitepaper describes an IM/MS methodology first contemplated over twenty years ago and today being positioned as the fastest method for high resolution fragmentation analysis. Revisiting this concept using the latest generation ion mobility technology based on structures for lossless ion manipulation (SLIM), which is the only HRIM technology that delivers similar resolution and range of analysis as a quadrupole, realizes the full potential of this approach to deliver benefits in both speed and sensitivity for high performance MS/MS measurements. This new way of achieving ion fragmentation in complex samples is set to revolutionize the mass spectrometry space, starting in the growing field of proteomics where all researchers are seeking faster methods to achieve more comprehensive proteomic coverage. Due to the advantages of HRIM physics, we predict this will set the bar for high throughput -omics within the coming years and will eventually be as ubiquitous as the quadrupole is today.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

The Target Of Rapamycin (TOR) complex 2 is a protein kinase that acts as a central regulator of PM homeostasis, but the mechanisms by which it monitors and reacts to membrane stresses are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we characterized a family of amphiphilic molecules that physically perturb PM organization and in doing so inhibit TORC2 in yeast and mammalian cells. Using fluorescent lipid associated reporters in budding yeast, we show that these small molecules first cause a transient increase in the amount of biochemically accessible ergosterol at the PM. Contemporaneous TORC2 inhibition stimulates a rapid removal of accessible ergosterol from the PM by the PM-ER sterol transporters Lam2 and Lam4, necessary for TORC2 reactivation. Thus, we show that TORC2 acts in a feedback loop to control active sterol levels at the PM and introduce sterols as possible TORC2 signalling modulators.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

For PV, this mechanism exploits the host secretory autophagy pathway. Virions are selectively incorporated into autophagosomes, double-membrane vesicles that travel to the plasma membrane, fuse, and release single-membrane vesicles containing virions. Loading of cellular cargo into autophagosomes relies on direct or indirect interactions with microtubule-associated protein 1B-light chain 3 (LC3) that are mediated by motifs referred to as LC3-interaction regions (LIRs). We have identified a PV mutant with a severe defect in non-lytic spread. An F-to-Y substitution in a putative LIR of the nonstructural protein 3CD prevented virion incorporation into LC3-positive autophagosomes and virion trafficking to the plasma membrane for release. Using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy to monitor PV-induced autophagosome biogenesis, for the first time, we show that virus-induced autophagic signals yield normal autophagosomes, even in the absence of virions. The F-to-Y derivative of PV 3CD was unable to support normal autophagosome biogenesis. Together, these studies make a compelling case for a direct role of a viral nonstructural protein in the formation and loading of the vesicular carriers used for non-lytic spread that may depend on the proper structure, accessibility, and/or dynamics of its LIR. The studies of PV 3CD protein reported here will hopefully provoke a more deliberate look at the presence and function of LIR motifs in viral proteins of viruses known to use autophagy as the basis for non-lytic spread.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

However, because neurons function as spatiotemporal filters of the presynaptic activity patterns, the input dynamics should contribute to neuronal diversity. We tested this hypothesis in barrel cortical neurons using a classical  step-and-hold input and a rich dynamical input mimicking input from a presynaptic network. We found that the stimulus type strongly determines classification. To understand this input dependence further, we systematically compared which attributes are the most informative about neuronal heterogeneity by performing classifications based on four different attribute sets that capture 1) action potential features, 2) passive biophysical features, 3) adaptation, and 4) linear input filter using the Spike Triggered Average (STA). We compared the variance explained by the shared structure across these four attribute sets. We observed that the linear input filter explains the highest amount of private variance and thus is the most informative about neuronal heterogeneity. These results demonstrate the importance of the interplay between the input dynamics and the postsynaptic neurons linear input filter for understanding functional neuronal diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Firstly, we used genome-wide association studies to connect genetic variants with the phenotypes. Next, we benchmarked an automated machine learning pipeline that includes preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameters optimization in combination with multiple linear and complex machine learning methods. We determined gradient boosting machines as best performing in 65% of predictions and pangenome as best predictor, suggesting a considerable contribution of the accessory genome in controlling phenotypes. The accuracy broadly varied among the phenotypes (r = 0.2-0.9), consistent with varying levels of complexity, with stress resistance being easier to predict compared to growth across carbon and nitrogen nutrients. While no specific genomic features could be linked to the predictions for most phenotypes, machine learning identifies high-impact variants with established relationships to phenotypes despite being rare in the population.

Cells generally orient divisions along their long axis of interphase shape and many studies have shown that mechanosensitive division orientation is an indirect response to force-induced cell shape changes. However, we show that, to achieve an accurate alignment of divisions with cell shape, force sensing via nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) is necessary. Through its mechanosensitive cortical localisation, NuMA promotes increased spindle oscillations upon tissue stretch and subsequently enhances the accuracy of spindle orientation along the shape and stretch axis. This fundamental mechanism opens avenues for further exploration in the context of diseases such as cancer where spindle orientation tends to go awry.

Cell division orientation, which is key to cell fate and shaping tissues, is influenced by mechanical forces. For example, in uniaxially stretched tissue most divisions orient along the stretch axis. This mechanosensitive division orientation can be achieved by distinct mechanisms involving a direct response to force or an indirect response to force via cell shape changes. Cells also generally align divisions along their long axis of interphase shape. Since stretching a tissue elongates cells, uncoupling whether divisions orient in response to force or to cell shape remains challenging. Here, we utilised the Xenopus laevis embryonic animal cap tissue and applied a reproducible external stretch to understand mechanosensitive division orientation. We focused on nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), which is key to spindle orientation. We show that NuMA is dynamically localised to the cell cortex earlier during mitosis in uniaxially stretched tissues. This temporal cortical recruitment of NuMA coincides with the onset and subsequent stretch-induced amplification of spindle oscillations. Additionally, we show that knockdown of NuMA reduces spindle oscillations and disrupts division orientation according to stretch and cell shape. We also show that divisions dynamically align with cell shape under tissue stretch and this involves a direct response to force via NuMA localisation, rather than an indirect response to force via cell shape changes. Overall, using live tissue imaging, mathematical modelling, and tissue mechanics our results indicate that NuMA fine tunes spindle dynamics and ensures the accurate alignment of divisions with cell shape and anisotropic tension.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Here we show through in situ monitoring and ex situ manipulations that methane is rapidly produced by archaea in frequently oxygenated sandy sediments. By combining biogeochemical, metagenomic, and culture-based experiments, we show this activity is driven by aerotolerant methylotrophic methanogens (Methanococcoides spp.) broadly distributed in surface layers of sandy sediments, providing evidence of a hidden process contributing to marine methane emissions. Moreover, we show that methane emissions are driven by methylated seaweed and seagrass metabolites, revealing an unexpected feedback loop between eutrophication-driven algal blooms and greenhouse gas emissions.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

There exists extensive heterogeneity in skeletal muscle functional behaviour and molecular landscape, at the cell composition, myofiber sub-type and intra-myofiber sub-type level. This heterogeneity highlights limitations in currently applied methodological approaches, which has stagnated our understanding of fundamental skeletal muscle biology in both healthy and myopathic contexts. Here, we developed a novel approach that combines a fluorescence based assay for the biophysical examination of the sarcomeric protein, myosin, coupled with same-myofiber high sensitivity proteome profiling, termed Single Myofiber Protein Function-Omics (SMPFO). Successfully applying this approach to healthy human skeletal muscle tissue, we identify the integrate relationship between myofiber functionality and the underlying proteomic landscape that guides divergent, but physiologically important, behaviour in myofiber sub-types. By applying SMPFO to two forms of human nemaline myopathy (ACTA1 and TNNT1 mutations), we reveal significant reduction in the divergence of myofiber sub-types, across both biophysical and proteomic behaviour. Collectively, we develop SMPFO as a novel approach to study skeletal muscle with greater specificity, accuracy and resolution then currently applied methods, facilitating that advancement in understanding of SkM tissue in both healthy and diseased states.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

To elucidate the molecular and cellular pathways activated by tofacitinib in responder and non-responder patients, we generated a longitudinal single-cell RNA sequence dataset profiling both immune and non-immune cell populations from colonic biopsies of UC patients. Our analysis revealed that responders exhibited higher baseline JAK-STAT activity, while non-responders had increased baseline NF-kB pathway activation. Longitudinal comparisons showed that disease progression in non-responders was associated with increased abundance and enhanced activation of macrophages and fibroblasts.

Although the role of IAA and its transport in algae remains unclear, PIN-driven auxin export is probably an ancient and conserved trait within Streptophytes. Among streptophyte algae, Chara represents a genus with a considerable degree of complexity in body arrangement. This study investigates the auxin response and characterizes homologs of land plant PIN auxin efflux carriers in Chara braunii. Through regeneration experiments, we observed that IAA significantly promotes elongation of thallus and side branch development upon thallus tip decapitation, indicating an effect on morphogenesis. We show that IAA is actively uptaken and metabolized by thallus cells and that this process is influenced by N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA). To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we cloned and sequenced the most expressed Chara braunii PINs, CbPINa and CbPINc. Using epitope-specific antibodies, we showed their presence in the plasma membrane (PM) of vegetative internodal cells and generative antheridial cells. Functional tests in tobacco BY-2 cells, supported by in silico docking of IAA and NPA to CbPINa and CbPINc, showed that PM-localized CbPINa interferes with auxin transport in contrast to ER-localized CbPINc. Finally, our phosphoproteome analysis indicated that IAA rapidly induces specific phosphorylation events, including RAF-like kinase phosphorylation, highlighting a potential role for IAA in fast signaling processes in Chara braunii. Altogether, we provide new insights into IAA role in Chara braunii morphogenesis and suggest that while the canonical auxin transport mechanism may not be conserved, auxin still may likely play a role in rapid signaling pathways in this close relative of land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

However, the mechanisms of evolving antimicrobial resistance in such polymicrobial environments are poorly understood. We previously reported that Mg2+ depletion caused by the fungus Candida albicans can enable Pseudomonas aeruginosa to acquire significant resistance to colistin, a last-resort antibiotic targeting bacterial membrane. Here, we dissect the genetic and biochemical basis of this increased colistin resistance. We show that P. aeruginosa cells can acquire colistin resistance using three distinct evolutionary trajectories involving mutations in genes involved in lipid A biosynthesis, lipid A modifications that are dependent on low Mg2+, and a putative Mg2+ transporter, PA4824. These mutations confer colistin resistance by altering acyl chains, hydroxylation, and aminoarabinose modification of lipid A moieties on the bacterial outer membrane. In all cases, enhanced colistin resistance initially depends on the low Mg2+-responsive PhoPQ pathway, which potentiates the evolution of resistance mutations and lipid A modifications that do not occur without Mg2+ depletion. However, the PhoPQ pathway is not required to maintain high colistin resistance in all cases. In most cases, the genetic and biochemical changes associated with these novel forms of colistin resistance also impair bacterial membrane integrity, leading to fitness costs. Our findings provide molecular insights into how nutritional competition drives a novel antibiotic resistance mechanism and its ensuing fitness tradeoffs.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Here we used multiple mathematical modelling techniques to analyse and compare existing AP designs. We show that carbon-fixing APs are the most promising candidates to replace native photorespiration in major crop species. Our results demonstrate the different metabolic routes that APs employ to increase yield and which plant physiology can profit most from them.

To proceed unhindered, pol {delta} holoenzymes must bypass lesions without stalling. This entails dNMP incorporation opposite the lesion (insertion) and the 5 template nucleotide (extension). Historically, it was viewed that high-fidelity pol holoenzymes stall upon encountering lesions, activating DNA damage tolerance pathways that are ultimately responsible for lesion bypass. Our recent study of 4 prominent lesions revealed that human pol {delta} holoenzymes support insertion and/or bypass for multiple lesions and the extents of these activities depends on the lesion and pol {delta} proofreading. In the present study, we expand these analyses to other prominent lesions. Collectively, analyses of 10 lesions from both studies reveal that the insertion and bypass efficiencies of pol {delta} holoenzymes each span a complete range (0 - 100%). Consequently, the fates of pol {delta} holoenzymes upon encountering lesions are quite diverse.

Thus, drug discovery and repurposing are essential to enhance treatment efficacy and safety.

MethodsWe obtained summary statistics for protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) of 2,004 plasma proteins and 1,443 brain proteins, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MS susceptibility with 14,802 cases and 26,703 controls, and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for 8,000 genes in peripheral blood and 16,704 genes in brain tissue. Our integrative analysis included a proteome-wide association study to identify MS-associated proteins, followed by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) to determine causal associations. We used the HEIDI test and Bayesian colocalization analysis to distinguish pleiotropy from linkage. Proteins passing SMR, HEIDI, and colocalization analyses were considered potential drug targets. We further conducted pathway annotations, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, and examined mRNA levels of these targets.

ResultsWe identified hundreds of MS-associated proteins in plasma and brain, confirming the causal roles of 18 proteins (nine in plasma and nine in brain). Among these, we found 78 annotated pathways and 16 existing non-MS drugs targeting six proteins. We also discovered intricate PPIs among seven potential drug targets and 19 existing MS drug targets, as well as PPIs of four targets across plasma and brain. Combining expression data, we identified two targets adhering to the central dogma of molecular biology.

To address this, we developed a single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) assay to directly visualize and analyse in vitro RNA synthesis by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We purified the minimal replication complex, comprising nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8, and combined it with fluorescently labelled RNA substrates, enabling real-time monitoring of RNA primer elongation at the single-molecule level. This platform allowed us to investigate the mechanisms of action of key inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication. In particular, our data provides evidence for remdesivirs mechanism of action, which involves polymerase stalling and subsequent chain termination dependent on the concentration of competing nucleotide triphosphates. Our study demonstrates the power of smFRET to provide dynamic insights into SARS-CoV-2 replication, offering a valuable tool for antiviral screening and mechanistic studies of viral RdRp activity.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Pausing also contributes to the formation of nucleosome-free regions with the help of chromatin remodellers. However, if these nucleosome-free regions engage with transcription factors to stimulate the transcription potential of paused promoters is not known. In this study, we demonstrate that ligand-induced estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) binding is stabilized at Pol II-paused sites. This stabilization results from an increased dwell time of ERalpha on chromatin, as revealed by single molecule tracking (SMT) experiments. Notably, short chromatin-associated RNAs generated by the paused Pol II contribute to enhancing ERalpha binding at paused promoters. We also observe that pausing increases histone H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) levels, which primes paused promoters for robust transcriptional activation upon release. Collectively, these findings suggest that paused Pol II plays a central role in enhancing transcription factor binding through an RNA-dependent mechanism. This, in turn, results in a more vigorous transcriptional response following pausing release, thus contributing to the fine-tuning of ERalpha-mediated gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Animal studies have yielded rich insight into mechanisms for visual perception, but the neural mechanisms for visual imagery remain poorly understood. Here, we first determined that [~]80% of visually responsive single neurons in human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) used a distributed axis code to represent objects. We then used that code to reconstruct objects and generate maximally effective synthetic stimuli. Finally, we recorded responses from the same neural population while subjects imagined specific objects and found that [~]40% of axis-tuned VTC neurons recapitulated the visual code.

Various neurological conditions and neurodegenerative diseases benefit from small molecules capable of BBB penetration (BBBP) to elicit a therapeutic effect. Predicting BBBP often involves in silico assessment of molecular properties such as lipophilicity (logP) and polar surface area (PSA) using the CNS multiparameter optimization (MPO) method. This study curated an open-source dataset to benchmark rigorously machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) models with each other and with MPO for predicting BBBP. Our analysis demonstrated that AI models, especially attentive NNs using stereochemical features, significantly outperform MPO in predicting BBBP. An attentive graph neural network (GNN), we refer to as CANDID-CNS, achieved a 0.23-0.26 higher AUROC score than MPO on full test sets, and a 0.17-0.19 higher score on stereoisomers filtered subsets. Regarding stereoisomers that differ in BBBP, which MPO cannot distinguish, attentive GNNs correctly classify these with AURPC, AUROC, and MCC metrics comparable to or better than those of MPO on less difficult test molecules. These findings suggest that integrating attentive GNN models into pharmaceutical drug discovery processes can substantially improve prediction rates, and thereby reduce the timeline, cost, and increase probability of success of designing brain penetrant therapeutics for the treatment of a wide variety of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Evolution has woven the LC into wide-ranging neural circuits that influence functions as broad as autonomic systems, the stress response, nociception, sleep, and high-level cognition among others. Given this conservation, there is a strong possibility that LC activity is inherently similar across species, and furthermore that age, sex, and brain state influence LC activity similarly across species. The degree to which LC activity is homogenous across these factors, however, has never been assessed due to the small sample size of individual studies. Here, we pool data from 20 laboratories (1,855 neurons) and show diversity across both intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as species, age, sex and brain state. We use a negative binomial regression model to compare activity from male monkeys, and rats and mice of both sexes that were recorded across brain states from brain slices ex vivo or under different anesthetics or during wakefulness in vivo. LC activity differed due to complex interactions of species, sex, and brain state. The LC became more active during aging, independent of sex. Finally, in contrast to the foundational principle that all species express two distinct LC firing modes (""tonic"" or ""phasic""), we discovered great diversity within spontaneous LC firing patterns. Different factors were associated with higher incidence of some firing modes. We conclude that the activity of the evolutionarily-ancient LC is not conserved. Inherent differences due to age and species-sex-brain state interactions have implications for understanding the role of LC in species-specific naturalistic behavior, as well as in psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease, immunology, and metabolic disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Accessory genes encoded in the diversity hotspots are involved in anti-MGE defence and counter-defence, virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), thus playing key roles in interactions amongst phages, MGEs, bacteria and eukaryotic hosts. To date the majority of research has been focused on either individual hotspots or on relatively limited sets of hotspots in a small set of genomes, typically from a single species. A global understanding of hotspot diversity and dynamics still lacking. To address this gap, we developed iLund4u, an algorithm for the systematic annotation of hotspots across millions of sequences. Using a proteome composition approach, iLund4u detects proteome communities, annotates accessory proteins and identifies hotspots. By analysing 873K phage genomes and 696K plasmid sequences we identified 13.7K hotspots and 171K diverse protein families encoded there as cargo. Furthermore, iLund4u allows for protein search and proteome annotation functions versus a precomputed iLund4u database. In the protein search mode iLund4u identifies all hotspots that encode homologues of a query protein. In the proteome annotation mode iLund4u annotates hotspots by searching for communities of similar proteomes.

While environmental interactions occur during this extended maturation period, the impact of extrinsic cues on determining the fate of distinct neuron types remains unknown. To address this question, we exposed developing neocortical cells to various environmental conditions and examined how this affects cell fate and diversity. Our developmental analyses reveal a hierarchical molecular program in which cell class-distinguishing features emerge first, followed by subclass- and type-related characteristics, with distinct developmental paces among cell populations. Environmental contribution was assessed in vivo, using genetically modified mice models in which position or innervation are altered, and in vitro using two-dimensional cultures. Acquisition of cellular identity and diversity remained stable across in vivo models. In contrast, in vitro glutamatergic neurons showed decreased expression of identity-defining genes, reduced diversity and alterations in canonical cortical connectivity. Cellular identity and diversity were restored towards in vivo values in organotypic slice cultures. These findings reveal cell population-specific responses to environmental conditions and highlight the role of extracellular context in shaping cell diversity in the maturing neocortex.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1729548542274

We describe this burden and compare it to the burden of influenza in the first two post-pandemic years in Denmark.

MethodsA cohort study including residents in Denmark from May 16, 2022, to June 7, 2024. Data were obtained from national registries, including information on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-positive COVID-19 and influenza admissions, mortality within 30 days of admission, sex, age, COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, comorbidity, and living in long-term care facility for elderly. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to compare rates of admissions between COVID-19 and influenza. To assess severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 30-day mortality between COVID-19 and influenza.

ResultsAmong 5,899,170 individuals, admissions with COVID-19 (n=24,687) were more frequent than admissions with influenza (n=8,682; aIRR 2.01, 95%CI 1.37-2.95), in particular during the first year (p=0.01), in the summer (p<0.001) and among people above 65 years of age (p<0.001). The number of deaths were also higher (COVID-19, n=2,393; influenza, n=522). Among patients, the risk of mortality of COVID-19 was higher than influenza in the 12-30 days following admission (0-11 days, aHR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.25; 12-30 days, aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.21-1.84), in particular among non-vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza (aHR 1.81, 95%CI 1.25-2.62), while it was similar to influenza among patients without comorbidities (aHR 1.07, 95%CI 0.63-1.80).

ConclusionCOVID-19 represented a greater disease burden than influenza, with more hospitalisations and deaths, and more severe disease primarily among non-vaccinated and comorbid patients.

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1729548542274

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","10.1186/s40168-024-01916-8","biorxiv",1729548542274
