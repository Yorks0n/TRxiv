In healthy controls (HC) regulation of CBF is complex and involves multiple mechanisms including cardiac output (CO), cerebral perfusion pressure, PO2 and PCO2, flow-metabolism coupling, and innervation of cerebral vessels. In ME/CFS multiple other mechanisms have also been identified.

Aim of the studyWe previously found that both CBF and CO were reduced in ME/CFS patients during tilt testing, and we hypothesized that the relation between CBF and CO is abnormal and different from HC. In this retrospective study we analyzed this relation in a large group of patients. To compare the patient data with those of HC, we focused on patients with a normal heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) response to upright tilt. Also, the influence of clinical data was analyzed.

MethodsA total of 534 ME/CFS patients and 49 HC underwent tilt testing with measurements of HR, BP, CBF, and CO. In 46 (9%) patients CO and CBF changes were in the normal range of HC, and in 488 (91%) an abnormal CO and CBF reduction was found.

Resultspatients with a CO and CBF reduction in the range of HC had less severe disease and were more likely to be male. In patients with an abnormal CO and CBF reduction the slope of the regression line of CO versus CBF reduction was almost 1. A multiple regression analysis of the latter group, including patients with PetCO2 measurements (440/488: 90%) showed that the CO reduction for the major part predicted the CBF reduction, with a limited role for the PetCO2 reduction and the tilt duration. Other data did not add to the model.

ConclusionsTwo different patient groups with a normal HR and BP response during the tilt were identified: those with a CO and CBF in the normal range of HC and those with an abnormal CO and CBF reduction during the tilt (91% of patients). The former group had milder disease and included more men. In the largest group of patients there was an almost 1:1 relation between the CO and CBF reduction, suggesting absence of compensatory vasodilation in the cerebral vasculature. This may be an appropriate target for clinical and therapeutic interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1723327473002

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1723327473002

Here, we systematically review over 3,600 abstracts, and identify a dozen end-to-end impact attribution studies on human health outcomes published between 2016 and 2023. Based on these studies, we find that estimates of attributable mortality range from 10 to over 271,000 deaths, depending on timescale, spatial extent, climate hazard, and cause of death. We calculate that this loss of life amounts to up to US$ trillions in monetary value when using standard valuation approaches. So far, end-to-end attribution studies capture only a small fraction of the presumed global burden of climate change, with few studies addressing infectious and non-communicable diseases, and no subnational or event-specific studies focused on a location outside of Europe and the United States. However, the field of health impact attribution is poised to explode in the next decade, putting unprecedented pressure on policymakers to take action for human health.","NA","medrxiv",1723327473002

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1723327473002

Persistently elevated autoantibodies have been found in some individuals with long COVID (LC). Using a >21,000 human protein array, we identified diverse AAB targets in LC patients that correlated with their symptoms. Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness.

ObjectiveThis cross-sectional study examined the relationships between macronutrients, dietary components, and sleep parameters, considering their interdependencies.

MethodsData from 4,825 users of sleep and nutrition apps for at least 7 days were analyzed. Multivariable regression analysis investigated associations between quartiles of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate, and total fat, including saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats), dietary components (sodium, potassium, dietary fiber, and sodium-to-potassium ratio), and sleep variables (total sleep time [TST], sleep latency [SL], and % wakefulness after sleep onset [%WASO]). Nutrients were divided into quartiles, with the lowest intake group as the reference. Compositional data analysis accounted for interdependencies among macronutrients. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI).

ResultsHigher protein intake was associated with longer TST in the 3rd (B = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.26) and 4th quartiles (B = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.27). Higher total fat intake was linked to shorter TST in the 3rd (B = -0.11, 95% CI = -0.20, -0.27) and 4th quartiles (B = -0.16, 95% CI = -0.25, -0.07). Higher carbohydrate intake was associated with shorter %WASO in the 3rd (B = -0.82, 95% CI = -1.37, -0.26) and 4th quartiles (B = -0.57, 95% CI = -1.13, -0.01), while higher total fat intake was linked to longer %WASO in the 4th quartile (B = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.06, 1.18). Higher dietary fiber intake was consistently associated with longer TST in the 3rd (B = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.02, 0.19) and 4th quartiles (B = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.26), shorter SL in the 2nd (B = -1.71, 95% CI = -2.66, -0.76), 3rd (B = -2.23, 95% CI = -3.19, -1.27), and 4th quartiles (B = -2.30, 95% CI = -3.27, -1.33), and shorter %WASO in the 2nd (B = -1.06, 95% CI = -1.61, -0.51), 3rd (B = -1.04, 95% CI = -1.59, -0.48), and 4th quartiles (B = -1.05, 95% CI = -1.61, -0.48). A higher sodium-to-potassium ratio was linked to shorter TST in the 3rd (B = -0.11, 95% CI = -0.20, -0.02) and 4th quartiles (B = -0.19, 95% CI = -0.28, -0.10), longer SL in the 2nd (B = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.08, 1.98) and 4th quartiles (B = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.53, 2.47), and longer %WASO in the 4th quartile (B = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.15, 1.28). Compositional data analysis, involving 6% changes in macronutrient proportions, showed higher protein intake correlated with longer TST (B = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.18, 0.35), while more monounsaturated fats were linked to longer SL (B = 4.64, 95% CI = 1.93, 7.34) and %WASO (B = 2.21, 95% CI = 0.63, 3.78). Higher polyunsaturated fat intake correlated with shorter TST (B = -0.22, 95% CI = -0.39, -0.05), shorter SL (B = -4.72, 95% CI = -6.58, -2.86), and shorter %WASO (B = -2.00, 95% CI = -3.08, -0.92).

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1723327473002

Disease progression and failure to respond to anthracycline based chemotherapy, standard first-line treatment, is associated with poor patient outcomes. To address this, we investigated the contribution of STS cancer stem cells (STS-CSCs) to doxorubicin resistance. We identified a positive correlation between CSC abundance and doxorubicin IC50 in resistant cell lines. We investigated if a common genetic signature across STS-CSCs could be targeted. Utilizing patient derived samples from five sarcoma subtypes we identified Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a member of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) responsible for H3K27 methylation as being enriched in the CSC population. EZH2 activity and a shared epigenetic profile was observed across subtypes. Targeting of EZH2 using Tazemetostat, an FDA approved inhibitor specifically ablated the STS-CSC population. Treatment of doxorubicin resistant cell lines with tazemetostat resulted in a decrease in the STS-CSC population. Further, co-treatment was not only synergistic in the parent cell lines, but restored chemosensitivity in doxorubicin resistant lines. These data confirm the presence of shared genetic programs across distinct subtypes of CSC-STS that can be therapeutically targeted.","NA","biorxiv",1723327473002

MethodsThis study uses the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to investigate the potential relationship between vaccinations and the incidence of NMOSD, AE, and MOGAD. Potential risk factors, such as age, sex, type of vaccine, and previous history of autoimmune diseases, were examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

ResultsOur analysis included 161 cases: 72 NMOSD, 82 AE, and 7 MOGAD. The COVID-19 vaccine was implicated in 19/72 (26.3%) NMOSD, 43/82 (52.4%) of AE and 6/7 (85.7%) of MOGAD. The subacute temporal profile (OR 24.4, p = 0.004) and the presence of any comorbidity (OR 12.49, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with hospitalization for those with NMOSD. The subacute onset of symptoms and encephalopathy was statistically significant for hospitalization (OR 6.15, p = 0.048) and (OR 10.3, p = 0.005) respectively for patients with AE. Anti-NMDAR (N-methyl D-aspartate) antibodies were observed in 16/24 (66.7%) of AE. Treatment often involved high-dose corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

ConclusionsMost cases of vaccine induced NMOSD, AE, and MOGAD occurred secondary to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The subacute onset of symptoms and the presence of encephalopathy was most associated with hospitalization.","NA","medrxiv",1723327473002

In neurons, mitochondrial lactate reported blood lactate levels with high fidelity. The exchange of lactate across the inner mitochondrial membrane was found to be mediated by a high affinity H+-coupled transport system involving the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier MPC. Assessment of electron transport chain activity and determination of lactate flux showed that mitochondria are tonic lactate producers, a phenomenon driven by energization and stimulated by hypoxia.

ObjectivesTo determine immune-cell-specific transcriptomic profiles associated with IPF mortality.

MethodsWe profiled peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in 18 participants [University of South Florida: IPF, COVID-19, post-COVID-19 Interstitial Lung Disease (Post-COVID-19 ILD), controls] by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and identified 16 immune-cell-specific transcriptomic profiles. The Scoring Algorithm of Molecular Subphenotypes (SAMS) was used to calculate Up-scores based on these 16 gene profiles. Their association with outcomes was investigated in peripheral blood, Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) and lung tissue of N=416 IPF patients from six cohorts. Findings were validated in an independent IPF, PBMC scRNA-seq dataset (N=38).

Measurements and main resultsCox-regression models demonstrated that 230 genes from CD14+CD163-HLA-DRlow circulating monocytes predicted IPF mortality [Pittsburgh (p=0.02), Chicago (p=0.003)]. PBMC proportions of CD14+CD163-HLA-DRlow monocytes were higher in progressive versus stable IPF (Yale, 0.13{+/-}0.05 versus 0.09{+/-}0.05, p=0.034). Receiving operating characteristic identified a 230 gene, Up-score >41.84 (Pittsburgh) predictive of mortality in Chicago (HR: 6.58, 95%CI: 2.15-20.13, p=0.001) and in pooled analysis of BAL cohorts (HR: 2.20, 95%CI: 1.44-3.37, p=0.0003). High-risk patients had decreased expression of the T-cell co-stimulatory genes CD28, ICOS, ITK and LCK (Pittsburgh and Chicago, p<0.01). 230 gene-up-scores negatively correlated with Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) in IPF lung tissues (LGRC, rho=-0.2, p=0.02). Results were replicated using a subset of 13 genes from the 230-gene signature (pooled PBMC cohorts - HR: 5.34, 95%CI: 2.83-10.06, p<0.0001).

This is despite the disproportionate potential benefits such models could have to livestock research, from improving breeding values to prioritising functional variants at trait-associated loci. A key open question is what datasets and modelling approaches are most important to close this performance gap between species. In this work we have developed a new framework for predicting regulatory variants, that includes deriving key conservation metrics in cattle for the first time, variant annotation and model training. When trained on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) data for human and cattle we show that this framework has a high performance at predicting regulatory variants, with a maximum area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) score of 0.92 in human and 0.81 in cattle. We explore various approaches to further close this performance gap, including integrating advanced DNA sequence models and generating extra chromatin data, but illustrate that the best approach would be generating improved gold-standard sets of known cattle regulatory variants. Importantly we demonstrate both the human and cattle models substantially enrich for variants linked to important traits, with up to 25-fold enrichments for functional variants observed. Consequently, with our framework developed to be applicable across species these results not only demonstrate its potential utility for fine-mapping functional variants and improving breeding values in cattle, but also its potential for wider use across animal species.","NA","biorxiv",1723327473002

Robust perception is thought to be facilitated by nonlinear response properties, including temporal adaptation (reduced responses to re-peated stimuli) and contrast gain (shift in the contrast response function with pre-exposure to a stimulus). Temporal adaptation and contrast gain have both been shown to aid object recognition, however, their joint effect on perceptual and neural responses remains unclear. Here, we collected behavioural measurements and electrocorticography (EEG) data while human participants (both sexes) classified objects embedded within temporally repeated noise patterns, whereby object contrast was varied. Our findings reveal an in-teraction effect, with increased categorization performance as a result of temporal adaptation for higher but not lower contrast stimuli. This increase in behavioral performance after adaptation is associated with more pronounced contrast-dependent modulation of evoked neural responses, as well as better decoding of object information from EEG activity. To elucidate the neural computations underlying these effects, we endowed deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) with various temporal adaptation mechanisms, including intrinsic suppression and temporal divisive normalisation. We demonstrate that incorporating a biologically-inspired contrast response function to modify temporal adaptation helps DCNNs to accurately capture human behaviour and neural activation profiles. Moreover, we find that networks with multiplicative temporal adaptation mechanisms, such as divisive normalization, show higher robustness against spatial shifts in the inputs compared to DCNNs employing additive mechanisms. Overall, we reveal how interaction effects between nonlinear response properties influence human perception in challenging viewing contexts and investigate potential computations that mediate these effects.

Significance statementHumans are able to perceive the environment even when viewing conditions are suboptimal. This robust perception has been linked to nonlinear neural processing of incoming visual information. Here, we examine the joint impact of two neural response properties, temporal adaptation and contrast gain, during object recognition, demonstrating interaction effects on categorization performance and in evoked neural responses. Using convolutional neural networks, we investigate various temporal adaptation mechanisms mediating the neural responses and perception, demonstrating that introducing contrast-dependent modulation of the unit activations captures human behaviour and neural object representations. Our findings shed light on how neural response properties give rise to robust perception and offer a framework to study the underlying neural dynamics and their impact on perception.","NA","biorxiv",1723327473002

However, the extent to which these viral prospecting efforts have enhanced preparedness for disease outbreaks remains poorly characterized, especially in terms of whether they are necessary, sufficient, or feasible ways to spur medical countermeasure development. We find that several viruses which pose known threats to human health lack approved vaccines and that known viruses discovered in human patients prior to 2000 have caused most major 21st-century outbreaks. With Filoviridae as a case study, we show there is little evidence to suggest that viral prospecting has accelerated countermeasure development or that systematically discovering novel zoonotic viruses in animal hosts before they cause human outbreaks has been feasible. These results suggest that prospecting for novel viral targets does not accelerate a rate-limiting step in countermeasure development and underscore questions about the importance of zoonotic viral discovery for outbreak preparedness. We consider limitations to these conclusions and alternative but related approaches to preparedness and response.","NA","medrxiv",1723327473002

We identified biomarkers of T1D by combining plasma cis and trans protein QTLs (pQTLs) for 2,922 proteins in the UK Biobank with a T1D genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 157k samples. T1D risk variants at over 20% of known loci colocalized with cis or trans pQTLs, and distinct sets of T1D loci colocalized with immune, pancreatic secretion, or gut-related proteins. We identified 23 proteins with evidence for a causal role in using pQTLs as genetic instruments in Mendelian Randomization which included multiple sensitivity analyses. Proteins increasing T1D risk were involved in immune processes (e.g. HLA-DRA) and, more surprisingly, T1D protective proteins were enriched in pancreatic secretions (e.g. CPA1), cholesterol metabolism (e.g. APOA1), and gut homeostasis. Genetic variants associated with plasma levels of T1D-protective pancreatic enzymes such as CPA1 were enriched in cis-regulatory elements in pancreatic exocrine and gut enteroendocrine cells, and the protective effects of CPA1 and other enzymes on T1D were consistent when using instruments specific to acinar cells. Finally, pancreatic enzymes had decreased acinar expression in T1D, including CPA1 which was altered prior to onset. Together, these results reveal causal biomarkers and highlight processes in the exocrine pancreas, immune system, and gut that modulate T1D risk.","NA","medrxiv",1723327473002

Previously, we have categorised healthcare pathways for patients after discharge from hospital with COVID-19 across 45 UK sites. The aim of this work was to estimate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of these pathways.

MethodsWe examined prospectively collected data from 1,013 patients at 12-months post-discharge on whether they felt fully recovered (self-report), number of newly diagnosed conditions (NDC), quality of life (EQ-5D-5L utility score compared to pre-covid estimate) and healthcare resource costs (healthcare records). An analysis of the cost-effectiveness was performed by combining the healthcare resource cost and one-year EQ5D (giving a quality adjusted life-year: QALY) using statistical models that accounted for observed confounding.

ResultsAt 1 year, 29% of participants felt fully recovered and 41% of patients had an NDC. The most comprehensive services, where all patients could potentially access assessment, rehabilitation, and mental health services, were more clinically effective when compared with either no service or light touch services (mean (SE) QALY 0.789 (0.012) vs 0.725 (0.026)), with an estimated cost per QALY of {pound}1,700 (95% uncertainty interval: dominated to {pound}24,800).

CODANIN-1 negatively regulates the function of ASF1. However, the molecular mechanism by which CODANIN-1 inhibits ASF1-mediated histone supply remains elusive. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a human CODANIN-1_ASF1A_CDIN1 complex at 3.56 [A] resolution. The structure reveals that CODANIN-1 forms a dimer and utilizes a histone H3 mimic helix (HMH) to interact with the histone binding surface of ASF1. This feature confers on CODANIN-1 an ability to sequester ASF1 and inhibit the formation of the ASF1-H3-H4 complex, essential for histone nuclear import and nucleosome assembly. Furthermore, we show that interaction of both the CODANIN-1 HMH and B-domain with ASF1 is critical for the inhibitory activity of CODANIN-1 in cells. Our study provides a structural and molecular basis for the function of CODANIN-1 as a unique negative regulator of nucleosome assembly.","NA","biorxiv",1723327473002

In cases of sinusitis, among the most common reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in children, healthcare providers must distinguish between bacterial and viral causes based on clinical signs and symptoms. However, due to the overlap between symptoms of acute sinusitis and viral upper respiratory infections, antibiotics are often over-prescribed. Objectives: Currently, there are no electronic health record (EHR)-based methods, such as lab tests or ICD-10 codes, to retroactively assess the appropriateness of these prescriptions, making manual chart reviews the only available method for evaluation, which is time-intensive and not feasible at a large scale. In this study, we propose using natural language processing to automate this assessment. Methods: We developed, trained, and evaluated generative models to classify the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions in 300 clinical notes from pediatric patients with sinusitis seen at a primary care practice in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia network. We utilized standard prompt engineering techniques, including few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting, to refine an initial prompt. Additionally, we employed Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning to train a medium-sized generative model Llama 3 70B-instruct. Results: While parameter-efficient fine-tuning did not enhance performance, the combination of few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting proved beneficial. Our best results were achieved using the largest generative model publicly available to date, the Llama 3.1 405B-instruct. On our test set, the model correctly identified 91.4% of the 35 notes where antibiotic prescription was appropriate and 71.4% of the 14 notes where it was not appropriate. However, notes that were insufficiently, vaguely, or ambiguously documented by physicians posed a challenge to our model, as none evaluation sets were accurately classified. Conclusion: Our generative model demonstrated strong performance in the challenging task of chart review. This level of performance may be sufficient for deploying the model within the EHR, where it can assist physicians in real-time to prescribe antibiotics in concordance with the guidelines, or for monitoring antibiotic stewardship on a large scale.","NA","medrxiv",1723327473002

METHODSMean country-level lipid intakes were compared to Age-Standardized Alzheimer-Disease-Incidence-Rates(ASAIR) in 183 countries across all inhabited continents. Penalized spline regression and multivariable-adjusted linear regression, including a lag between intake and incidence, were used to assess the relationships between five lipid intakes and ASAIR. Validation was conducted using longitudinal within-country changes between 1990 and 2019.

This has been considered metaplasia; the inappropriate conversion from one adult cell-type to another. In fact, BO could be a reversal of mammalian embryogenesis when the early foregut is first lined by simple columnar epithelium. Exploring this hypothesis has been hampered by inadequate molecular details of human oesophageal development. Here, we adopted single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic approaches to discover and decode the cell types that constitute the initial primitive columnar, transitory and subsequently stratified lower oesophageal epithelium. Each stage is comprised of several previously undefined epithelial sub-populations. HNF4A, a major driver of the Barretts phenotype, is a prominent transcriptional regulator in the early foregut columnar cells, but not in the later ciliated or stratified cells, and is central to gene regulatory programmes known to be reactivated in BO. Moreover, GWAS susceptibility SNPs for BO mapped to putative regulatory regions in fetal epithelial cells, which are inaccessible in the corresponding adult epithelial cells. Collectively, these data argue that the path to BO involves de-differentiation to a primitive fetal-like state.","NA","biorxiv",1723327473002

To prove this, we have topically treated healthy full-thickness human scalp skin with T3 (1, 10nM) and T4 (1, 10M) for six days in serum-free organ culture, using an HF-targeting vehicle that contains only FDA-approved ingredients. This showed that, at distinct doses, topical T3 and T4 significantly increased the percentage of HFs in anagen, decreased the percentage of proliferative (Ki-67+) cells in the hair matrix, did not promote melanogenesis (as measured by quantitative Warthin-Starry histochemistry), and significantly increased keratin 15 expression in the bulge. Finally, T3 and T4, at low concentrations, increase the expression of the hair growth promoters IGF-1 and FGF-7. The lower concentration of T3 and both of T4 also significantly increases the number of CD31+ endothelial cells, suggesting a pro-angiogenic effect, which is also important for hair growth promotion. These preliminary results strongly suggest that topically applied thyroid hormones promote hair growth in intact human scalp on multiple levels ex vivo.

Specific lots of agar, from different suppliers, were toxic. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect was attenuated on rich media. Consequently, quality control checks that use only rich media can provide false assurances on the quality of the agar. Lastly, we describe likely sources of the toxicity and we provide specific guidance for quality control measures that should be applied by all vendors as preconditions for their sale of agar.

This study aimed to investigate the causal relationship of PAR1 (encoded by the gene F2R) with renal phenotypes using drug-target Mendelian Randomization (MR). First, we performed colocalization analyses to confirm whether PAR1/F2R expression instruments were shared between plasma/blood and kidney tissue. We selected PAR1/F2R expression instruments from the UK Biobank-Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP), eQTLGen, and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx). Kidney F2R expression data were obtained from NephQTL2. Second, given the known experimental evidence of the vorapaxar effect on PAR1 inhibition, we conducted drug-target MR to investigate the causal effects of genetically lower PAR1 protein levels or F2R expression levels on thrombotic diseases as positive controls from FinnGen, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and arterial thromboembolism (AET). Finally, we performed drug-target MR to investigate the causal relationship of genetically lower PAR1 protein or F2R expression levels from plasma/blood and kidney tissues on renal diseases and function. We included five renal phenotypes as our main outcomes: CKD, microalbuminuria (MA), NS, estimated GFR (eGFR), and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR). Renal genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data were obtained from the CKDGen consortium, except for NS, which was obtained by meta-analysing FinnGen and a novel GWAS in the UKB. In addition, we also used serum albumin from UKB as a further outcome in a sensitivity analysis. Colocalization analyses identified shared genetic variants between blood and tubulointerstitial F2R expression (posterior probabilities are 89.1% for eQTLGen and 95.4% for GTEx) but not between plasma PAR1 and tubulointerstitial F2R expression. We present MR findings as {beta} or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) per unit decrease in plasma protein or gene expression, or per effect allele, consistent with the direction of effect when taking vorapaxar. Genetically- proxied lower PAR1 and F2R expression reduced risk of VTE with ORs of 0.84 [95% CI 0.71 to 1.00] (UKB-PPP), 0.94 [0.88 to 1.01] (eQTLGen) and 0.89 [0.75 to 1.06] (GTEx), indicating that genetically-instrumented lower PAR1 is directionally consistent with the effect of vorapaxar. Genetically-proxied lower PAR1 and F2R expression increased the risk of developing CKD (UKB- PPP: OR=1.17 [0.99 to 1.38]; eQTLGen: OR=1.12 [1.02 to 1.23]; GTEx: OR=1.24 [1.05 to 1.46]), but may decrease eGFR (eQTLGen: {beta}=-0.02 [-0.06 to 0.01], GTEx: {beta}=-0.04 [-0.08 to 0.01], UKB-PPP: {beta} =-0.01, [-0.05, 0.04]). The effect of genetically-proxied PAR1 on NS was inconclusive due to lack of power. Our study suggests that genetically-proxied lower PAR1 and F2R expression reduces VTE risk, and increases CKD risk, but provides less evidence on reducing eGFR or increasing uACR. Evidence regarding NS was inconclusive. For NS patients, the decision to use anti-PAR1 treatment should be made with caution, given the potential renal implications and the current lack of conclusive evidence of its impact on NS.","NA","medrxiv",1723327473002

Insertions or deletions of nucleotides not divisible by three shift the reading frames, resulting in significantly different protein sequences. These events are disruptive but can also create variability important for evolution. Previous studies suggest that genetic code and gene sequences evolve to minimize frameshift effects, maintaining similar physicochemical properties to their reference proteins. Here, we focused on tandem repeat sequences, known as frameshift hotspots. Using cutting-edge bioinformatics tools, we compared reference and frameshifted protein sequences within tandem repeats across 50 prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteomes. Our analysis revealed several intriguing sequence-structure-function correlations. We showed that in contrast to the general tendency, frameshifts within these regions, especially with short repeats, lead to significant changes: increased hydrophobicity and arginine content, new aggregation-prone and transmembrane regions. Overall, frameshifts have stronger effects on tandem repeat regions compared to non-repetitive sequences, and therefore can be a primary cause of altered functions, cellular localization, and the development of various pathologies.","NA","biorxiv",1723327473002

Identifying and controlling dose-dependent transgenes require tools for precisely titrating expression. To this end, we developed a highly modular, extensible framework called DIAL for building editable promoters that allow for fine-scale, heritable changes in transgene expression. Using DIAL, we increase expression by recombinase-mediated excision of spacers between the binding sites of a synthetic zinc finger transcription factor and the core promoter. By nesting varying numbers and lengths of spacers, DIAL generates a tunable range of unimodal setpoints from a single promoter. Through small-molecule control of transcription factors and recombinases, DIAL supports temporally defined, user-guided control of transgene expression that is extensible to additional transcription factors. Lentiviral delivery of DIAL generates multiple setpoints in primary cells and iPSCs. As promoter editing generates stable states, DIAL setpoints are heritable, facilitating mapping of transgene levels to phenotypes. The DIAL framework opens new opportunities for tailoring transgene expression and improving the predictability and performance of gene circuits across diverse applications.

Specifically, we enter n variations of k pattern classes (n*k patterns) onto a cortex-like balanced inhibitory-excitatory network with heterogeneous neurons, and let the pattern spread within the recurrent network. We show that we can identify high mutual-information (MI) neurons as major information-bearing elements within each pattern representation. We employ a simple one-shot adaptive (learning) process focusing on high MI neurons and inhibition. Such  localist plasticity has high efficiency, because it requires only few adaptations for each pattern. Specifically, we store k=10 patterns of size s=400 in a 1000/1200 neuron network. We stimulate high MI neurons and in this way recall patterns, such that the whole network represents this pattern. We assess the quality of the representation (a) before learning, when entering the pattern into a naive network and (b) after learning, on the adapted network, during recall. The recalled patterns could be easily recognized by a trained classifier. The pattern  unfolds over the recurrent network with high similarity, albeit compressed, with respect to the original input pattern. We discuss the distribution of neuron properties in the network, and find that an initial Gaussian or uniform distribution changes into a more heavy-tailed, lognormal distribution during the adaptation process. The remarkable result is that we are able to achieve reliable pattern recall by stimulating only high information neurons. This work has interesting technical applications, and provides a biologically-inspired model of cortical memory.","NA","biorxiv",1723327473002

The aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity of earwax on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli isolated from skin and stool respectively. Bacteriological investigations were carried out using culture and morphological characteristics, conventional biochemical tests and antibiotic susceptibility testing of both earwax and conventional antibiotics against the presumptive isolates. Occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus (58.3%) and Escherichia coli (45.8%) in skin and stool samples were respectively determined based on cultural and morphological characteristics. Conventional biochemical tests were carried out on the 14 and 10 presumptive Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli isolates and then 10 and 8 presumptive isolates were detected respectively. The antibacterial activity of the test agent was determined using the agar well diffusion technique; five different concentrations (20% v/v, 40% v/v, 60% v/v, 80% v/v, and 100% v/v) of the test agents were evaluated against the bacterial isolates. The earwax showed antibacterial activity against both isolates (except the 20% v/v for Staphylococcus aureus) at all concentrations used with antibacterial activity directly proportional to earwax concentration and a better antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (zone of inhibition 20mm) aureus than Escherichia coli. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out on the 10(41.7%) and 8(33.3%) presumptive isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli respectively based on Kirby Bauer method. Highest rate of susceptibilities of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates to antibiotics were observed in Erythromycin (100%), while for Escherichia coli were observed in Erythromycin and Levofloxacin (100%). Meanwhile, highest rate of resistant to Staphylococcus aureus isolates were observed in Gentamicin (100%) while for Escherichia coli was observed in Amoxicillin (100%).

A DFE is typically estimated by fitting an observed site frequency spectrum (SFS) to an expected SFS given a hypothesized distribution of selection coefficients and demographic history. The development of tools to infer gene trees from haplotype alignments, along with ancient DNA resources, provides us with additional information about the frequency trajectories of segregating mutations. Here, we ask how useful this additional information is for learning about the DFE, using the joint distribution on allele frequency and age to summarize information about the trajectory. To this end, we introduce an accurate and efficient numerical method for computing the density on the age of a segregating variant found at a given sample frequency, given the strength of selection and an arbitrarily complex population size history. We then use this framework to show that the unconditional age distribution of negatively selected alleles is very closely approximated by re-weighting the neutral age distribution in terms of the negatively selected SFS, suggesting that allele ages provide very little information about the DFE beyond that already contained in the present day frequency. To confirm this prediction, we extended the standard Poisson Random Field (PRF) method to incorporate the joint distribution of frequency and age in estimating selection coefficients, and test its performance using simulations. We find that when the full SFS is observed and the true allele ages are known, including ages in the estimation provides only small increases in the accuracy of estimated selection coefficients. However, if only sites with frequencies above a certain threshold are observed, then the true ages can provide substantial information about the selection coefficients, especially when the selection coefficient is large. When ages are estimated from haplotype data using state-of-the-art tools, uncertainty about the age abrogates most of the additional information in the fully observed SFS case, while the neutral prior assumed in these tools when estimating ages induces a downward bias in the case of the thresholded SFS.","NA","biorxiv",1723327473002

Sequence divergence between repeats causes RMD suppression and indeed this divergence must be resolved in the RMD products. The mismatch repair factor, MLH1, was shown to be critical for both RMD suppression and a polarity of sequence divergence resolution in RMDs. Here, we sought to study the interrelationship between these two aspects of RMD regulation (i.e., RMD suppression and polar divergence resolution), by examining several mutants of MLH1 and its binding partner PMS2. To begin with, we show that PMS2 is also critical for both RMD suppression and polar resolution of sequence divergence in RMD products. Then, with six mutants of the MLH1-PMS2 heterodimer, we found several different patterns: three mutants showed defects in both functions, one mutant showed loss of RMD suppression but not polar divergence resolution, whereas another mutant showed the opposite, and finally one mutant showed loss of RMD suppression but had a complex effect on polar divergence resolution. These findings indicate that RMD suppression vs. polar resolution of sequence divergence are distinct functions of MLH1-PMS2.

This study investigates virological factors contributing to the reemergence of Oropouche fever in Brazil between 2023 and 2024.

MethodsIn this study, we combined OROV genomic, molecular, and serological data from Brazil from 1 January 2015 to 29 June 2024, along with in vitro and in vivo characterization. Molecular screening data included 93 patients with febrile illness between January 2023 and February 2024 from the Amazonas State. Genomic data comprised two genomic OROV sequences from patients. Serological data were obtained from neutralizing antibody tests comparing the prototype OROV strain BeAn 19991 and the 2024 epidemic strain. Epidemiological data included aggregated cases reported to the Brazilian Ministry of Health from 1 January 2014 to 29 June 2024.

FindingsIn 2024, autochthonous OROV infections were detected in previously non-endemic areas across all five Brazilian regions. Cases were reported in 19 of 27 federal units, with 83.2% (6,895 of 8,284) of infections in Northern Brazil and a nearly 200-fold increase in incidence compared to reported cases over the last decade. We detected OROV RNA in 10.8% (10 of 93) of patients with febrile illness between December 2023 and May 2024 in Amazonas. We demonstrate that the 2023-2024 epidemic was caused by a novel OROV reassortant that replicated approximately 100-fold higher titers in mammalian cells compared to the prototype strain. The 2023-2024 OROV reassortant displayed plaques earlier than the prototype, produced 1.7 times more plaques, and plaque sizes were 2.5 larger compared to the prototype. Furthermore, serum collected in 2016 from previously OROV-infected individuals showed at least a 32-fold reduction in neutralizing capacity against the reassortment strain compared to the prototype.

InterpretationThese findings provide a comprehensive assessment of Oropouche fever in Brazil and contribute to a better understanding of the 2023-2024 OROV reemergence. The recent increased incidence may be related to a higher replication efficiency of a new reassortant virus that also evades previous immunity.","NA","medrxiv",1723327473002

After extrusion of modified lipoproteins from the IM via the LolCDE complex, the periplasmic chaperone LolA carries lipoproteins through the periplasm and transfers them to the OM lipoprotein insertase LolB, itself a lipoprotein with a LolA-like fold. Yet, LolB homologs appear restricted to {psi}-proteobacteria and are missing from spirochetes like the tick-borne Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi, suggesting a different hand-off mechanism at the OM. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the B. burgdorferi LolA homolog BB0346 (LolABb) at 1.9 [A] resolution. We identified multiple structural deviations in comparative analyses to other solved LolA structures, particularly a unique LolB-like protruding loop domain. LolABb failed to complement an Escherichia coli lolA knockout, even after codon optimization, signal I peptide adaptation, and a C-terminal chimerization which had allowed for complementation with an -proteobacterial LolA. Analysis of a conditional B. burgdorferi lolA knockout strain indicated that LolABb was essential for growth. Intriguingly, protein localization assays indicated that initial depletion of LolABb led to an emerging mislocalization of both IM and periplasmic OM lipoproteins, but not surface lipoproteins. Together, these findings further support the presence of two separate primary secretion pathways for periplasmic and surface OM lipoproteins in B. burgdorferi and suggest that the distinct structural features of LolABb allow it to function in a unique LolB-deficient lipoprotein sorting system.

SIGNIFICANCEBorrelia spirochetes causing Lyme disease and relapsing fever have unusual double-membrane envelopes that instead of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) display abundant surface lipoproteins. We recently showed that secretion of these surface lipoproteins in Borrelia burgdorferi depends on a distant homolog of the canonical LPS outer membrane translocase LptD. Here, we probed the role of the B. burgdorferi Lol pathway in lipoprotein sorting and secretion. We show that the periplasmic chaperone LolA is essential, functionally different from E. coli LolA, with structural features of a bifunctional lipoprotein carrier protein operating without a downstream LolB outer membrane lipoprotein insertase. Depletion of LolA did not impact surface lipoprotein localization but led to a marked mislocalization of inner membrane lipoproteins to the outer membrane. This further supports two parallel, yet potentially interacting Borrelia lipoprotein transport pathways that are responsible for either secreting surface lipoprotein virulence factors or maintaining proper distribution of lipoproteins within the periplasmic space.","NA","biorxiv",1723327473002

Here, we developed a multiplexed DMS by phage display protocol to define the binding determinants of short linear motifs (SLiMs) binding to peptide binding domains. We first designed a benchmarking DMS library to evaluate the performance of the approach on well-known ligands for eleven different peptide binding domains, including the talin-1 PTB domain. Systematic benchmarking against a gold-standard set of motifs from the eukaryotic linear motif (ELM) database confirmed that the DMS by phage analysis correctly identifies known motif binding determinants. The DMS analysis further defined a non-canonical PTB binding motif, with a putative extended conformation. A second DMS library was designed aiming to provide information on the binding determinants for 19 SLiM-based interactions between human and SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The analysis confirmed the affinity determining residues of viral peptides binding to host proteins, and refined the consensus motifs in human peptides binding to five domains from SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the non-structural protein (NSP) 9. The DMS analysis further pinpointed mutations that increased the affinity of ligands for NSP3 and NSP9. An affinity improved cell-permeable NSP9-binding peptide was found to exert stronger antiviral effects as compared to the initial wild-type peptide. Our study demonstrates that DMS by phage display can efficiently be multiplexed and applied to refine binding determinants, and shows how DMS by phage display can guide peptide-engineering efforts.","NA","biorxiv",1723327473002

Here, we sequenced and analyzed 382 full-length OROV genomes from human samples collected between 2022 and 2024 from all four states, aiming to trace the origin and genetic evolution of OROV leading to the current outbreak. Genomic analyses revealed that the recent upsurge of OROV cases in the Brazilian Amazon region coincides with the emergence of a novel reassortant viral lineage containing the M segment of viruses detected in the eastern Amazon region from 2009 to 2018 and the L and S segments of viruses detected in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador from 2008 to 2021. The novel reassortant OROV lineage likely emerged in the Central region of the AM state between 2010 and 2014 and displayed a long-range silent dispersion during the second half of the 2010s. The 2022-2024 OROV epidemic was spatially segregated into three major subpopulations located in RR, AMACRO (a bordering region between AC, RO, and AM-Southern region), and AM-Central (which includes the Amazonas capital, Manaus) regions. The peak of OROV transmissions in all regions occurred during the rainy season in the Amazon basin. Furthermore, our phylodynamics reconstructions showed that OROV spread was driven mainly by short-range (< 2 km) movements, with an average dispersal rate [&le;] 1.2 km/day, consistent with the pattern of an active flight of infected vectors. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion (22%) of long-range (> 10 km) OROV migrations were also detected, consistent with viral dispersion via human activities. Our data provides an unprecedented view of the real-time spread and evolution of a neglected emergent human pathogen. Moreover, our results emphasize the need for widespread, long-term genomic surveillance to better understand the real burden of OROV within and beyond the Amazon region.","NA","medrxiv",1723327473002

To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Warm White Light-Emitting Diode (LED), Cool White LED, Blue LED, and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic Puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation, and husbandry programs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic Puffin strandings remains to be the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine if aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1723327473002

MethodsPlasma samples from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were assayed with AD blood tests from C2N Diagnostics, Fujirebio Diagnostics, ALZPath, Janssen, Roche Diagnostics, and Quanterix. Outcomes measures were amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, cortical thickness, and dementia severity. Logistic regression models assessed the classification accuracies of individual or combined plasma biomarkers for binarized outcomes, and Spearman correlations evaluated continuous relationships between individual plasma biomarkers and continuous outcomes.

ResultsMeasures of plasma p-tau217, either individually or in combination with other plasma biomarkers, had the strongest relationships with all AD outcomes.

DiscussionThis study identified the plasma biomarker analytes and assays that most accurately classified amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1723327473002

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1723327473002

We present ESM3, a frontier multimodal generative language model that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to biological alignment. We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins with a chain of thought. Among the generations that we synthesized, we found a bright fluorescent protein at far distance (58% identity) from known fluorescent proteins. Similarly distant natural fluorescent proteins are separated by over five hundred million years of evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1723327473002

However, this notion has recently been challenged. Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1723327473002

However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role. Our data show that the clonal dynamics of blood are consistent with a set of remarkably simple evolutionary rules which strike a balance between chance and determinism.","NA","biorxiv",1723327473002

Here, we estimate biological age of 11 organs from 44,526 individuals in the UK Biobank using an antibody-based proteomics platform to model disease and mortality risk. Organ age estimates are associated with future onset of heart failure (heart age HR=1.83), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (lung age HR=1.39), type II diabetes (kidney age HR=1.58), and Alzheimers disease (brain age HR=1.81) and sensitive to lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise, hormone replacement therapy, or supplements. Remarkably, the accrual of aged organs progressively increases mortality risk while a youthful brain and immune system are uniquely associated with disease-free longevity. These findings support the use of plasma proteins for monitoring organ health and the efficacy of drugs targeting organ aging disease.","NA","biorxiv",1723327473002
