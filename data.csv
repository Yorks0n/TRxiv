This qualitative study explores the lived experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) following the implementation of Covid-19 vaccine mandates in Alberta s health sector. It draws on 80 responses to a single open-ended question from a survey of 190 HCWs in the province across vaccination statuses. We performed a manual sentiment analysis, classifying entries as positive, neutral, or negative - depending on their normative orientation towards vaccination mandates - using Weberian ideal types as a conceptual framework. Most respondents (82.5%) expressed negative sentiments, with close to one fifth (17.5%) offering positive views; no entries were coded as neutral. Themes within negative responses included coercion, ethical conflict, professional exclusion, institutional betrayal, and suppression of dissent. Many vaccinated HCWs described complying under duress, challenging the assumption that signals endorsement. The most salient theme was that of moral injury - defined as the distress caused by acting against one s conscience, witnessing perceived harm, or remaining silent under institutional pressure. In contrast, positive responses emphasized professional duty and public safety, often rejecting the legitimacy of dissenting perspectives. Our findings underscore the deeply polarizing nature of vaccination mandates and complicate dominant narratives that equate compliance with consent. Further, in contrast to clinical conceptions rooted in combat or bedside trauma, our analysis situates moral injury in the structural conditions created by public health policies, offering a lens for assessing their implications for the wellbeing of HCWs, quality care, and ethical healthcare practice and policy. We conclude that future public health policies, especially those justified under claims of emergency, must include built-in safeguards for ethical integrity and democratic participation","NA","medrxiv",1748815748979

Much effort has been devoted to understanding TF activity in different tissues and how tissue-specificity is achieved. However, ultimately gene regulation occurs at the single cell level and the recent explosion in the availability of single cell gene expression data now makes it possible to understand TF activity at this granular level of resolution. Here, we leverage a large collection of Human Cell Atlas (HCA) single cell data to explore TF activity by examining cell-type and tissue-specific sets of target genes, or regulons. We compile a regulon atlas, CellRegulon, and map the activity of TFs in an extensive set of healthy adult and foetal tissues spanning hundreds of cell types. Using CellRegulon, we describe dynamic patterns of co-regulation, associate TF-modules with different cellular functions and characterise the distribution of active TFs and TF families across cell types. We show that CellRegulon can link disease gene expression signatures to cell types and TFs relevant to the disease. Finally, using a newly generated multiome dataset of the adult lung, we show how CellRegulon can be extended into an enhancer-gene regulatory network (eGRN) to improve cell-type associations with genetic risk loci for diseases, such as childhood onset asthma, COPD and IPF, and to identify high risk gene modules. Our database for easy download and interactive exploration allows researchers to understand key gene modules activated at cell type transitions and will therefore be valuable for tasks such as cell type engineering (https://www.cellregulondb.org).","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

Here, we evaluate a modified Orbitrap Astral Zoom mass spectrometer (MS) prototype and compare its performance to the standard Orbitrap Astral MS. Across a range of acquisition methods and sample inputs, the prototype instrument outperformed the standard Orbitrap Astral MS in precursor and protein identifications, ion accumulation efficiency, and reproducibility of measurements. To enable meaningful cross-platform comparisons, we implemented an ion calibration framework that converts signal intensity from arbitrary units to absolute ion counts (ions/sec). This benchmarking strategy showed that the prototype sampled 30% more ions per peptide than the original Orbitrap Astral MS. This increase in the ion beam utilization resulted in improved sensitivity and quantitative precision. To make these metrics broadly accessible, we added new metrics to the Skyline document grid to report ion counts directly from data-independent acquisition (DIA) data. Taken together, our results demonstrate the Orbitrap Astral Zoom prototype as a high-performance platform for DIA proteomics and establish a generalizable framework for evaluation of mass spectrometer performance based on the number of ions detected for each analyte.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

However, although chromatin plays an integral role in regulating the function of regulatory elements along the nuclear genome, our understanding of how, or whether, similar chromatin structures form on plasmids transfected into mammalian cells remains limited. We demonstrate that plasmid single-molecule chromatin fiber sequencing (plasmid Fiber-seq) can accurately map chromatin architectures along individual, full-length transfected plasmid molecules at near single-nucleotide resolution. Application of plasmid Fiber-seq to diverse plasmids and cell lines demonstrates that plasmids are chromatinized in a sequence-dependent organized manner and adopt a heterogeneous and incomplete chromatin architecture relative to nuclear-encoded chromatin fibers. We show that the focal occupancy of nucleosomes and transcription factors along transfected plasmids is central to their transcriptional activity within mammalian cells, and demonstrate that plasmids indeed are capable of recapitulating nuclear genome-encoded chromatin architectures, although not always. Finally, we demonstrate that combining plasmid Fiber-seq with high-throughput reporter assays can establish the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenic non-coding variants, including disentangling the effects of transcriptional activators and repressors with near-single-nucleotide resolution. Overall, our findings reveal the principles by which plasmid-based assays can be used for accurate fine-scale mapping of chromatin-dependent regulatory grammar.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

However, even a single gene perturbation can cause global changes in gene expression profiles. Consequently, predicting which genes will be affected by a particular genetic perturbation remains a challenge. Here, we analyze changes in genome-wide gene expression profiles caused by single-gene perturbations in bacterial, worm, and human cells and show a simple rule that genes that intrinsically maintain the ratio of expression levels (stoichiometry) with a perturbed gene are more likely to be affected when it is deleted or inactivated. Furthermore, deleting a gene that maintains their stoichiometry with more genes tend to affect the expression levels of other genes genome-wide. Stoichiometry-conserving gene clusters can be found beyond local transcriptional regulatory units and metabolic pathways. Thus, the effects of genetic perturbations are propagated to other genes through a multi-level stoichiometry-conserving architecture in cells.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

However, visualizing these interactions in vivo remains technically challenging. Here, we established fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy combined with Forster resonance energy transfer (FLIM-FRET) as a robust, spatially resolved technique to visualize protein interactions in living Staphylococcus aureus using fluorescent proteins. After systematically optimizing growth conditions and the analysis pipeline, we validated the method with cytosolic and membrane-anchored control proteins, achieving FRET efficiencies of up to 40%. Using FLIM-FRET, we mapped the protein interactions of the critical glycosyltransferase FtsW within the septal PG synthesizing complex. We confirmed its interaction with the cognate transpeptidase PBP1 and the regulatory protein DivIB. Notably, we found that FtsW also self-interacts, an observation corroborated by an alternative FLIM-FRET method employing Halo-Tag labelled with Janelia Fluor dyes. These findings support the hypothesis that septal PG synthesis may be carried out by a complex of multimers, capable of simultaneously synthesizing more than one glycan strand. Inhibition of PG synthesis by directly targeting PBP1 with the beta-lactam antibiotic imipenem weakened the interaction between PBP1 and FtsW, whereas the FtsW self-interaction was enhanced in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, inhibition of PG synthesis by targeting the lipid II flippase, therefore depleting the FtsW-PBP1 substrate from the outer surface of the cell membrane, had little effect on these interactions. This suggests that alterations in FtsW interactions result primarily from antibiotic-induced conformational changes or from uncoupling the activities of FtsW and PBP1, resulting in the presence of uncrosslinked glycans, rather than merely from a loss of PG synthesis activity.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1748815748979

However, direct observations of rapid genetic adaptation and population dynamics across climates are rare across species. To fill this gap, we conducted a replicated, globally synchronized evolution experiment with the plant Arabidopsis thaliana for 5 years in over 30 outdoor experimental gardens with distinct climates across Europe, the Levant, and North America. We performed whole-genome sequencing on [~]70,000 surviving reproductive individuals and directly observed rapid and repeatable adaptation across climates. Allele frequency changes over time were parallel in experimental evolution replicates within the same climates, while they diverged across contrasting climates--with some allele frequency shifts best explained by strong selection between -46% to +60%. Screening the genome for signals of rapid climate adaptation identified a polygenic architecture with both known and novel adaptive genetic variants connected to important ecological phenotypes including environmental stress responses, CAM5 and HEAT SHOCK FACTORs, and germination and spring flowering timing, CYTOCHROME P450s and TSF. We found evolutionary adaptation trends were often predictable, but variable across environments. In warm climates, high evolutionary predictability was associated with population survival up to 5 years, while erratic trends were an early warning for population extinction. Together, these results show rapid climate adaptation may be possible, but understanding its limits across species will be key for biodiversity forecasting.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

We aimed to compare Germany-wide characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized adults with diabetes in diabetes certified vs. non-diabetes certified hospitals.

MethodsWe analyzed in the German Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) statistics for 2021-2023 all inpatient cases aged [&ge;] 20 years with and without diabetes (all types) as a main or secondary diagnosis based on ICD-10 codes. Using Wilcoxon and Chi2-tests, characteristics of inpatient cases with diabetes were compared between diabetes certified hospitals (n=300) and non-diabetes certified hospitals (n=1,103).

ResultsOf 43.4 million total inpatient cases in the period from 2021 to 2023, 8.1 million (18.5%) had a documented diabetes diagnosis (94% of the cases as secondary diagnosis). In certified hospitals, 19.0% of inpatient cases had diabetes compared to 18.3% in non-certified hospitals. Although inpatient cases with diabetes had more hospital-acquired and procedure-related complications (17.2% vs. 16.7%, p<0.001), as well as higher rates of hypoglycemia (3.2% vs. 2.1%, p<0.001) and metabolic disorder (diabetic ketoacidosis: 0,5% vs. 0,4%; acute metabolic disorder with multiple complications: 2.3% vs. 1.0%, p<0.001) in certified hospitals vs. non-certified hospitals, in-hospital mortality for all diabetes cases was similar (4.5% in both). However, among those with diabetes as the main diagnosis, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in diabetes certified hospitals (type 1 diabetes: 0.6% vs. 1.1% and type 2 diabetes: 2.3% vs. 2.9%, both p<0.001), despite a higher complication burden.

ConclusionsHospitalized people with diabetes as the main diagnosis had lower in-hospital mortality in diabetes-certified hospitals, even though they had a higher disease burden. These findings suggest that expanded use of DDG-certified departments, including consultation services for patients whose diabetes is a secondary diagnosis, may further improve clinical outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1748815748979

They continue to be important therapeutic targets for multiple disorders including autoimmune diseases, acute and chronic inflammation, and allergy-related conditions. Recent structural coverage has provided important insights into their activation and signaling, however, confounding observations in the literature related to ligand efficacy and functional responses, especially in different model systems, present a major challenge for drug discovery efforts. Here, we systematically and comprehensively profile a broad set of natural and synthetic ligands at C3aR and C5aR1 and discover a previously unanticipated level of functional specialization in terms of species-specific pharmacology and receptor activation. Taking a lead from this, we determine seventeen cryo-EM structures of different ligand-receptor-G-protein complexes and uncover distinct orientation of agonists between the human and mouse receptors despite an overlapping positioning in the orthosteric binding pocket. Combined with extensive mutagenesis and functional assays, these structural snapshots allow us to decode and validate a convergent molecular mechanism involving a ""Five-Point-Switch"" in these receptors that orchestrates the recognition and efficacy of diverse agonists. We also identify species-specific differences at the level of phosphorylation patterns encoded in the carboxyl-terminus of these receptors and directly visualize their impact on {beta}arr binding and activation using cryo-EM structures. Interestingly, we observe that {beta}arrs engage with the mouse C5aR1 using a variation of previously discovered P-X-P-P phosphorylation motif via a ""Sliding-Mechanism"" and also exhibit distinct oligomeric state for the human vs. mouse receptors. Taken together, this study elucidates functional specialization at the complement anaphylatoxin receptors and underlying molecular mechanisms, offering a previously lacking framework with direct and immediate implications for the development of novel therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

Although amyloidosis and aggregation of the 42-amino acid amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}42) have long been considered pathogenic triggers for AD, clinical evidence linking high levels of A{beta}42 with normal cognition challenges this hypothesis. To resolve this conundrum on the role of A{beta}42 in regulating synaptic activity, we used an adeno-associated viral vector approach that triggers extracellular accumulation of A{beta}42 and spatial memory impairment. We show that A{beta}42 leads to an early increase in excitatory and proximal inhibitory synaptic transmission onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, and an increased expression of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 in these cells. A{beta}42 accumulation does not cause early cognitive deficits unless accompanied by an increased neuronal GLT-1 expression, suggesting this transporter is a critical mediator of A{beta}42 s effects.

Emerging evidence suggests that impaired microglial amyloid-beta phagocytosis is a key feature in AD, highlighting the therapeutic potential of enhancing this innate immune function. Here, we demonstrate that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) ameliorated memory deficits and reduced amyloid-beta burden in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, we show that PTP1B was highly expressed in microglia, and its deficiency promoted a transcriptional shift toward immune activation and phagocytosis. Consistently, PTP1B deletion in microglia enhanced phagocytosis and metabolic fitness, supported by increased AKT-mTOR signaling, a pathway essential for meeting the energy demands of activation. Mechanistically, we identified spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), a key regulator of microglial phagocytosis, as a direct substrate of PTP1B. Inhibition of SYK showed that PTP1B modulates microglial activation in a SYK-dependent manner. These findings established PTP1B as a critical modulator of microglial activation and a potential therapeutic target for AD.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

Our cryo-EM structure of the BRD4 short (BRD4-S) isoform bound to a nucleosome diacetylated on histone H4 shows how BRD4 BD1 engages both the H4 tail and nucleosomal DNA. Unexpectedly, our biochemical studies indicate that BRD4 uses basic regions outside of the bromodomains to bind nucleosomes tightly even in the absence of histone acetylation. Our results further show that histone H4 acetylation influences the conformation of the BRD4/nucleosome complex.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

While the disease is currently under control, the emergence of new coronavirus variants with pandemic potential underscores the need for more universal coronavirus vaccines. This study evaluates the immunogenicity in non-human primates of two broad-spectrum nasal vaccine candidates called PanCoV. The vaccine preparations are based on highly conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2, specifically the nucleocapsid (N) and the S2 subunit from Spike protein, which include several relevant T-cell epitopes and have the potential to form virus-like particles. PanCoV1 candidate contains the N protein, while the PanCoV2 comprises a chimeric protein containing the C-terminal domain of N protein fused to a fragment of S2 subunit. Both vaccine candidates also include the receptor-binding domain (RBD) from Spike protein and the ODN-39M as CpG adjuvant. The results demonstrate that both nasal vaccine candidates can boost the anti-RBD immune response and induce anti-N immunity, this systemic response shows cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and H-CoV antigens. In addition, a neutralizing response against SARS-CoV-2 that persisted for almost three months after the last dose was induced. A mucosal-specific and cross-reactive IgA response was also observed, mainly in monkeys vaccinated with PanCoV2. Furthermore, the specific IFN gamma-secreting response observed in the vaccinated groups peripheral blood mononuclear cells highlights the ability of these candidates to stimulate cellular immunity with a Th1 bias. PanCoV vaccines emerge as promising candidates for use as a booster alternative, with the potential to amplify and broaden the scope of the immune response against coronaviruses.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

These networks quantitatively predict functionally relevant experimental datasets spanning multiple scales, including allosteric sensitivity across a saturation mutagenesis library, calorimetric binding entropies, and phylogenetic trees.

Surface immunophenotyping alone is often insufficient, as interrogating functional capacity is required to determine cellular mechanisms and effectively inform diagnostic biomarker discovery, therapeutics and vaccine development. However, large panels with intracellular markers are subject to numerous challenges, including spectral overlap and background cellular autofluorescence, reducing resolving power for rare subsets or populations defined by low-abundance expression. We posited that mass cytometry may overcome such limitations; to address this, 3 small (11 or 12-plex) clone-matched antibody panels were evaluated by spectral flow and mass cytometry. Panels were comprised of surface and intracellular targets (phospho-epitopes, transcription factors or cytokines) and designed to minimize fluorescence spectral overlap. CyTOF technology offered superior signal resolution across the range of intracellular targets. Improved signal-to-noise provided better resolution of phospho-events and transcription factor expression, in particular TOX and T-bet. Most strikingly, stimulation-specific IL-10+ and IL-13+ cells were only detected by CyTOF. Superior resolution of these cytokines enabled accurate population clustering, permitting more unique immune cell signatures to be found, including Tr1 and Tc2 populations, thus providing a more comprehensive picture of the immuno-diversity present.

To overcome this limitation, we engineered Escherichia coli to utilize hydrogen gas (H2) and formate (HCOO-) as alternative sources of energy and reducing equivalents, thereby decoupling energy generation from carbon metabolism. This approach enabled precise suppression of decarboxylative oxidation during acetate growth, with 86.6 +/- 1.6% of electrons from hydrogen gas (via soluble hydrogenase from Cupriavidus necator H16) and 98.4 +/- 3.6% of electrons from formate (via formate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas sp. 101) offsetting acetate oxidation. Hydrogen gas supplementation led to a titratable and stoichiometric reduction in CO2; evolution in acetate-fed cultures. Metabolomic analysis suggests that this metabolic decoupling redirects carbon flux through the glyoxylate shunt, partially bypassing two decarboxylative steps in the TCA cycle. We demonstrated the utility of this strategy by applying it to mevalonate biosynthesis, where formate supplementation during glucose fermentation increased titers by 57.6% in our best-performing strain. Flux balance analysis further estimated that 99.0 +/- 2.8% of electrons from formate were used to enhance mevalonate production.

Grapevine (Vitis vinifera) provides a unique model, with cultivars vegetatively propagated for centuries. Here, we assembled the phased genomes of Cabernet Sauvignon and its parental lineages, Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon Blanc, using HiFi long-reads and a gene map tenfold denser than existing maps. Using three clones per cultivar, we quantifyied methylation with very consistent short- and long-read sequencing and ensured both varietal representativeness and assessment of clonal variability. We leveraged the parent-progeny sequence graph to highlight allele-specific methylation and conserved transcriptomic patterns for genes and small RNA. Such a format was essential to integrate multi-omics data and revealed that despite less clonal conservation than genetic polymorphisms, methylation marks were remarkably inherited. By further demonstrating the linear-reference limitations, we determined the correct representation of genetic variants by the sequence graph is crucial for the accurate allelic quantification of the methylome. These findings reveal the remarkable stability of epigenetic marks in a model propagated by asexual reproduction. Using a phased sequence graph, we introduce a scalable framework that accounts for genomic variation, accurately quantifies allele-specific methylation, and supports multi-omics integration such as our evaluation of the transcriptional impact of epigenetic inheritance.

The full extent of protein dysfunctions in AD and their impact on cellular physiology remains unknown. Here, we used plexDIA, an approach that parallelizes the acquisition of samples and peptides, to characterize proteomic changes in AD. Using human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue, we identified 281 differentially abundant proteins in AD. By systematically analyzing cellular compartment-specific shifts in protein abundance, we identified an AD-specific decrease in levels of the 20S proteasome, the catalytic core of the cells primary protein degradation pathway. This alteration was accompanied by widespread decreases in proteasome subunit stoichiometries. Many proteasome substrate proteins were negatively correlated with 20S levels and increased in AD, suggesting that reduced 20S levels leads to abnormal protein accumulation. By analyzing proteins increased in AD, we identify key properties of such proteins. Namely, they have highly specific subcellular localizations and fast degradation rates, they contain signal sequences that allow them to be targeted for proteasomal degradation, and they are targeted by quality control pathways that recognize mislocalized proteins. Furthermore, we identify coherent sets of ubiquitin system enzymes, proteins that target substrates for proteasomal degradation, whose levels robustly discriminate AD from non-AD samples. One subset exhibited consistent increases in AD, while another exhibited consistent decreases, revealing complex alterations to the ubiquitin system in AD. Taken together, our results suggest that decreased ubiquitin-proteasome system capacity and impaired clearance of short-lived and mislocalized proteins contribute substantially to proteopathic burden in AD.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

High viral titres were detected in milk from infected cows, raising concerns about onwards human infections. Although pasteurisation was shown to effectively inactivate influenza viruses in milk, unpasteurised milk still poses a risk of infection, both from occupational exposure in dairies and from the consumption of raw milk. We therefore assessed how long influenza viruses could remain infectious for in milk without heat inactivation. We examined the stability of a panel of influenza viruses in milk, including a contemporary H5N1 HPAIV and a variety of other influenza A and D viruses. We incubated viruses in cows milk under laboratory conditions: at room temperature to simulate exposure in dairies and at 4{degrees}C to simulate exposure to refrigerated raw milk. Following an isolated report of H5N1 viral RNA being detected in milk from a sheep in the UK, we also carried out similar experiments with a laboratory strain of IAV in sheeps milk. Although the survival of influenza viruses in milk was variable, we consistently found that under laboratory conditions substantial viral infectivity remained over periods when people might reasonably be exposed to infected milk - for over a day at room temperature and for more than 7 days when refrigerated. Our results highlight the zoonotic risk of H5N1 HPAIV in raw milk from infected animals and reinforce the importance of taking measures to mitigate this risk.","NA","medrxiv",1748815748979

In this study, we demonstrate that SCs from a mammalian hibernator, Syrian hamster exhibit remarkable resistance to cold-induced cell death, which is associated with intrinsically higher expression of the antioxidant enzyme GPX4, which likely contributes to the suppression of ferroptosis. RNA-seq analysis revealed widespread downregulation of myogenesis-related genes following cold exposure, which suggests suppression of the myogenic program. Consistently, SCs exposed to cold stress exhibited reduced activation and differentiation capacities upon subsequent rewarming, with an increased number of quiescent Pax7-positive/MyoD-negative cells. Muscle regeneration was markedly delayed during hibernation, accompanied by decreased SC activation and macrophage infiltration, suggesting that cold-induced suppression of SC function underlies limited regenerative capacity in hibernating hamsters. Our results provide insight into the unique physiology of mammalian hibernators: SC viability is preserved, whereas regenerative activity is selectively suppressed during hibernation.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

While this phenotype seemingly mirrors vining activity, this hypothesis remains understudied within naturally twining plants. Qualitative observations identified skewed microtubules in the twining stem of Ipomoea nil vine, suggesting parallels with Arabidopsis studies. To further investigate organ chirality in twining plants, we used common bean vine (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) to examine the relationship between microtubule orientation, cell morphogenesis, and the right-handed twining phenotype via immunolabeling techniques. Here, we report a transition from mixed microtubules orientations in emergent and elongating internodes to a predominance of longitudinal microtubules in straight and twined stem segments post-elongation. Additionally, we report a distinction in epidermal cell shapes, where the straight portions of the stem consist of lobes with rectangular cells and furrows comprised of round cells, while the twined portions are comprised of cells that are relatively more rectangular and stretched. We propose that these orientations reflect dynamic microtubule responses to external stimuli and growth cues, such as tensile stresses from climbing or tissue expansion. Taken together, these findings highlight dissimilarities between twisting Arabidopsis mutants and naturally twining plants.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

The vast majority of GPCR drugs bind the conserved orthosteric pocket, which can lead to non-specificity and toxicity. Precision modalities such as biased signaling and allosteric modulation could lead to GPCR therapeutics with improved efficacy and safety profiles. The rational design of precision therapies is, however, limited by the lack of high-resolution functional understanding of GPCRs. Here we present a general approach to chart high-resolution functional maps of GPCRs and apply the approach to the {beta}2 adrenergic receptor. Across ~150,000 measurements of five different phenotypes, we construct an unprecedented picture of signaling properties of this model receptor. A contiguous core activation network of residues required for signaling links the ligand binding site to the transducer binding site. Residues controlling signaling parameters connect to this core network, with determinants of signaling bias located more peripherally. Dose-response curves for nearly all possible amino acid substitutions, a total of >7,500 different proteins, reveal the relationship between expression level and potency; and the spatial distribution of potency changing residues. The multi-modal maps rationalize previous serendipitously discovered allosteric sites and prospectively annotate novel sites to target. Application of this approach across the superfamily of GPCRs will unlock deep understanding of these critical molecules and enable rational design of precision GPCR therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

While existing approaches have successfully linked BGCs to broad classes of chemical products, they typically operate in a single modality (genomic or chemical) limiting the scope of bidirectional prediction. In this work, we propose a multimodal framework that integrates genomic and chemical information by projecting embeddings derived from pretrained language models into a common representation space. We embed genomic sequences using a BGC foundation model and represent molecules through a chemical language model, then use a metric learning model to co-embed BGCs and their associated chemical structures. This co-embedding space allows us to quantify the similarity between BGCs and compounds using similarity measures, enabling both forward and inverse retrieval tasks. Beyond retrieval, we show that the shared space can guide strain selection for targeted compounds. By identifying BGCs closest to a query compound in the embedding space, we prioritize microbial strains that encode similar clusters, thereby streamlining genome mining and retrobiosynthetic design efforts. This approach represents a generalizable, scalable strategy to bridge biological and chemical modalities in natural product discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

Here, we revisit this question using one of the deepest metagenomic sequencing efforts to date, applying 148 Gbp of Nanopore long-read and 122 Gbp of Illumina short-read data to a single forest soil sample.

ResultsOur hybrid assembly reconstructed 837 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including 466 high- and medium-quality genomes, nearly all lacking close relatives among cultivated taxa. Rarefaction and k-mer analyses reveal that, even at this depth, we capture only a fraction of the extant diversity: nonparametric models project that over 10 Tbp would be required to approach saturation. These findings offer a quantitative, technology-enabled update to long-standing diversity estimates and demonstrate that conventional metagenomic sequencing efforts likely miss the majority of microbial and biosynthetic potential in soil. We further identify over 11,000 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), >99% of which have no match in current databases, underscoring the breadth of unexplored metabolic capacity.

Genome sequencing revealed a large number of uncharacterized NRPS biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and their products are underexplored. The majority of NRPSs remain silent potentially attributed to factors such as the low activity of the initiation unit or insufficient precursor supply. Exchanging the starter condensation (Cs) domains within initiation unit can change the length of acyl chains of NRPs, hinting at a promising strategy through swapping of a well-studied Cs domain to activate the initiation unit and harness primary metabolites as precursors, which may offer a new option to access silent BGCs. Here, we first pinpointed two highly efficient fusion sites for initiation unit exchanges. Subsequently, they were validated by replacing the initiation region of endopyrrole pathway with a Cs-containing initiation unit for generation of a lipo-endopyrrole derivate. We promptly leveraged this strategy of changing initiation unit to target six previously silent NRPS BGCs, three BGCs were successfully activated and five novel lipopeptides were identified, demonstrating its application to recover silent BGCs. Furthermore, we extended this strategy in more BGCs from different bacteria. Utilizing a heterologous Cs-containing unit to replace the initiation region of chitinimide biosynthetic pathway led to successful incorporation of N-terminal fatty acid chains into chitinimide to create artificial lipo-chitinimides.

While some non-indigenous species (NIS) have already changed the composition and function of native Mediterranean communities, many others continue to arrive but often go unnoticed without regular surveys or until they are strongly established.

Previous studies suggest that it is associated with reproductive benefits, either by making breeders newly available for reproduction or by increasing offspring care and reducing competition for resources. In addition, infanticide may result from a reproductive trade-off, where parents kill their offspring if environmental conditions compromise their reproductive value. Here, we combine video, genetic and individual-level reproductive data collected over 12 years to describe infanticide in a highly social, cooperative bird, the sociable weaver Philetairus socius and to establish whether direct reproductive benefits or life-history trade-offs are possible motivators for this behaviour. We documented 50 cases of infanticide and identified 27 aggressors with known histories. These were mostly born outside the colonies where they committed infanticide (63%) and there was some bias towards females and younger individuals. Aggressors were usually not part of the victim's breeding group (74%), but in two cases infanticide was committed by the breeding female, and in five by helpers. In most cases, aggressors were not reproducing at the time of the infanticide, never mated with any of the breeders from the attacked nest, nor occupied the nest from where the chicks were evicted. Only eight of the known aggressors were confirmed as breeders after the attacks, and these mostly reproduced at the colony where the attacks were committed. Overall, we found no evidence for direct reproductive benefits of infanticide in sociable weavers. However, the younger age of aggressors, lack of genetic relatedness to the victims and future breeding at the colony suggest that competition between breeding groups, and hence indirect reproductive benefits, could provide motivation for infanticide in this population. Additional work over longer periods is needed to identify these possible indirect fitness benefits of infanticide.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

DesignMatched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]). Negative control outcomes did not show any indication of meaningful unobserved residual confounding.

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Single-cell transcriptomics provides a detailed picture of the cellular states observed during these decisions, but building quantitative and predictive models from these data remains a challenge. Here, we present dynamic landscape analysis (DLA), a framework that applies dynamical systems theory to identify stable cell states, map transition pathways, and generate a predictive cell fate decision landscape from single-cell data. Applying this framework to vertebrate neural tube development, we reveal that progenitor specification by Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) can be captured in a landscape with an unexpected circular topology, where initially divergent lineages converge through multiple routes. This landscape accurately predicted cellular responses and cell fate allocation for unseen dynamic signalling regimes. By modelling the dynamic responses that drive cell fate decisions, the DLA framework provides a quantitative and generative framework for extracting mechanistic insights from high-dimensional single-cell data.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

While generally described as positively charged amphipathic helices, presequences lack a consensus motif and thus likely promote the import of proteins into mitochondria with variable efficiencies. Indeed, the concept of presequence ""strength"" critically underlies biological models such as stress sensing, yet a quantitative analysis of what dictates ""strong"" versus ""weak"" presequences is lacking. Furthermore, the extent to which presequence strength affects mitochondrial function and cellular fitness remains unclear. Here, we capitalize on the high-throughput and kinetic nature of the MitoLuc mitochondrial protein import assay to quantify multiple aspects of presequence strength. We find that select presequences, including those that regulate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), are sufficient to impart differential import efficiencies during mitochondrial uncoupling. Surprisingly, we find that presequences beyond those classically associated with stress signaling promote highly variable import efficiency in stressed and basal (i.e., non-stressed) conditions in vitro, suggesting that presequence strength may influence a broader array of processes than currently appreciated. We exploit this variability to demonstrate that only presequences that promote robust import in vitro can fully rescue defects in respiratory growth in Complex IV-deficient yeast, suggesting that presequence strength dictates metabolic potential. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that presequence strength can describe numerous metrics, such as total imported protein, maximal import velocity, or sensitivity to uncoupling, suggesting that the annotation of presequences as ""weak"" versus ""strong"" requires more nuanced characterization than is typically performed. Importantly, we find that such variability in presequence strength meaningfully affects cellular fitness in processes beyond stress signaling, suggesting that organisms may broadly exploit presequence strength to fine-tune mitochondrial import and thus organellar homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

However, why do certain images remain unidentifiable while others can be recognized immediately, and what visual features drive subjective clarification? To address these critical questions, we developed a unique dataset of 1,854 ambiguous images and collected more than 100,000 participant ratings evaluating their identifiability before and after seeing undistorted versions of the images. Relating the representations of a brain-inspired neural network model in response to our images with human ratings, we show that subjective identification depends largely on the extent to which higher-level visual features from the original images are preserved in their ambiguous counterparts. Notably, the predominance of higher-level features over lower-level ones softens after participants disambiguate the images. In line with these results, an image-level regression analysis showed that the subjective identification of ambiguous images was best explained by high-level visual dimensions. Moreover, we found that the process of ambiguity resolution was accompanied by a notable decrease in semantic distance and a greater consistency in object naming among participants. However, the relationship between information gained after disambiguation and subjective identification was non-linear, indicating that acquiring more information does not necessarily enhance subjective clarity. Instead, we observed a U-shaped relationship, suggesting that subjective identification improves when the acquired information either strongly matches or mismatches prior predictions. Collectively, these findings highlight fundamental principles underlying the mapping between human visual perception and memory, advancing our understanding on how we resolve ambiguity and extract meaning from incomplete visual information.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

CHASERR is a broadly expressed lncRNA located immediately upstream of the promoter of the CHD2 gene. We show that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting conserved motifs in CHASERRs last exon induce the formation of a fusion transcript joining CHASERR to CHD2. This fusion transcript is exported to the cytoplasm and translated into full-length CHD2 protein. Deleting the same motifs in mice mimics the ASO effect, increasing CHD2 protein without causing the deleterious effects associated with full CHASERR ablation. The fusion transcripts are also expressed endogenously, induced in activated neurons, and their constitutive induction affects neuronal gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Perinatal introduction of the ASO into Chd2+/- mice up-regulates CHD2 expression and alleviates behavioral phenotypes caused by CHD2 haploinsufficiency, providing a therapeutic route to CHD2 haploinsufficiency. This concept of targeting upstream genes with ASOs to induce transcript fusion can be extended to other gene pairs, and is thus a broadly relevant approach for increasing haploinsufficient gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

Using live cell imaging we first describe the series of sequential changes in DNA organisation that accompany cell division in Sulfolobus, which computational modelling shows likely aid genome segregation. Through a perturbation analysis we identify a regulatory checkpoint which ensures that the compaction of the genome into two spatially segregated nucleoids only occurs once cells have assembly a division ring - which also defines the axis of DNA segregation. Finally, we show that DNA compaction and segregation depends, in part, on a ParA homologue, SegA, and its partner SegB, whose absence leads to bridging DNA. Taken together, these data show how regulatory checkpoints like those operating in eukaryotes aid high-fidelity division in an archaeon.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1748815748979

Here, we introduce the SAFE Labs Handbook: a collection of thirty ""commitments"" which can be verifiably actioned without requiring institutional support. These commitments were collaboratively developed by thirteen group leaders in life sciences, from institutions across eight countries, instigated through the 2024 SAFE Labs workshop. The importance of each commitment has been scored by more than 200 researchers, at various career stages, from more than twenty countries. Even though all commitments were rated as significantly important by scientists from all career stages, implementation rates were notably low (< 25%). Lab members reported higher importance scores than group leaders, with large divergences indicating where group leaders may underestimate the potential impact on lab culture. Indeed, the overall implementation rate was correlated with importance score for group leaders, but not lab members. Strikingly, more than 95% of group leaders said they would consider implementing the handbook commitments.

However, it remains unclear why these taxa are so dominant across a wide range of soil types and environmental conditions. Here we use genome-resolved metagenomics to test the hypothesis that strain-level differences exist in these taxa that are not adequately captured with standard marker gene sequencing, and that distinct strains harbor unique traits that reflect adaptations to different soil environments. We analyzed data from 331 natural soils spanning Australia to assess strain differentiation in Bradyrhizobium, a dominant soil bacterial genus of ecological importance. We developed a workflow for strain-level bacterial analyses of complex soil metagenomes, combining genomes from pre-existing databases with new genomes generated via targeted assembly from metagenomes to detect 181 Bradyrhizobium strains across the soil collection. In addition to a high degree of phylogenetic variation, we observed substantial variation in pangenome content and inferred traits, highlighting the breadth of diversity within this widespread genus. While members of the genus Bradyrhizobium were detected in > 80% of samples, most individual strains were restricted in their distributions. The overall strain-level community composition of Bradyrhizobium varied significantly across geographic space and environmental gradients, and was particularly associated with differences in temperature, soil pH, and soil nitrate and metal concentrations. Our work provides a general framework and methodology for studying the strain-level ecology of soil bacteria and highlights the ecological and pangenomic diversity within this dominant soil bacterial genus.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

In yeast, the nucleus-vacuole junction (NVJ) expands during glucose starvation through the recruitment of stress-specific proteins, but the underlying mechanisms and physiological significance remained unclear. Here, we identify the yeast INSIG homologs Nsg1, Nsg2, along with the aspartyl protease Ypf1 as glucose starvation-specific NVJ-localized factors. Ypf1 promotes the recruitment of INSIG proteins and the HMG-CoA reductases Hmg1 and Hmg2 to the NVJ, likely in response to nuclear membrane remodeling induced by changes in very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) metabolism. We further demonstrate that this membrane remodeling destabilizes Nsg1, promoting the NVJ localization and activation of Hmg1, while stabilizing Nsg2, which counteracts Hmg1 activation. These findings reveal that Nsg1 and Nsg2, previously known as regulators of Hmg2 stability, also act as negative regulators of Hmg1. Based on these results, we propose a model in which VLCFAs modulate the physical properties of the nuclear membrane, enabling cells to sense glucose starvation and regulate sterol metabolism during glucose starvation.

Recent studies have suggested that these changes can be partially explained by altered sensory feedback processing when producing speech. Individuals with PD (IwPD) may fail to monitor sensory feedback from their own voice, impairing their ability to adjust voice and speech when sensory input differs from expectations. In this study, we investigated sensory feedback processing in PD by looking at the sensory attenuation typically observed in event-related responses (ERP) to the self-generated voice. When sensory feedback processing is intact, the P50, N100, and P200 ERP responses to the self-generated voice are more attenuated than to an externally-generated voice. Twenty-three IwPD and 23 healthy controls (HCs) participated in a voice playback study that comprised three conditions: self-generated voice (auditory-motor condition; AMC), externally-generated voice (auditory-only condition; AOC), and motor-only. The AMC and AOC conditions also included an amplitude modulation of the voice (0/+15dB). Linear mixed models assessed group differences in ERP morphology. While groups did not differ in their P50 and P200 responses, there was a significant group-condition-loudness interaction for the N100. Follow-up analyses showed that IwPD displayed much larger N100 error responses for unexpected loudness modulations as compared to HC. This observation suggests that IwPD may process voice modulations differently than HC. The hypersensitivity to loudness changes may underlie IwPD's difficulties in processing and adapting their voice acoustics.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

H3K4me2 in plants is correlated with transcriptionally repressed states, which can be accounted for by transcription-coupled active H3K4me2 demethylation, but the converse molecular pathway by which H3K4me2 represses transcription remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that H3K4me2 colocalizes with the facultatively repressive marks H2A.Z, H2A ubiquitination (H2Aub), and H3K27me3 in the gene body. Our genetic analyses reveal that H3K4me2 functions upstream but not downstream of these repressive marks. Interestingly, in genes with diurnal H3K4me2 oscillation, H3K4me2 oscillates in antiphase with transcription but in phase with H2A.Z. In addition, the genetic manipulation of H3K4me2 affects the oscillating profiles of H2A.Z, suggesting the efficient relay from H3K4me2 to H2A.Z. Notably, the diurnal oscillation of H2Aub is much weaker than that of H2A.Z despite the overall similarity in their distributions. These results suggest that H3K4me2 orchestrates H2A.Z and H2Aub with distinct dynamics. Our findings reveal that plants employ H3K4me2 to transmit transcriptional cessation into repressive chromatin states.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

Adaptation of NVJ functions to metabolic cues is mediated by a striking remodeling of the size and the proteome of the contact site, but the extent and the molecular determinants of this plasticity are not fully understood. Using microscopy-based screens, we monitored NVJ remodeling in response to glucose availability. We identified Pex31, Nsg1, Nsg2, Shr5, and Tcb1 as NVJ residents. Glucose starvation typically results in an expansion of the NVJ size and proteome. Pex31 shows an atypical behavior, being specifically enriched at the NVJ at high glucose conditions. Loss of Pex31 uncouples NVJ remodeling from glucose availability, resulting in recruitment of glucose starvation-specific residents and NVJ expansion at glucose replete conditions. Moreover, PEX31 deletion results in alterations of sterol ester storage and a remodeling of vacuolar membranes that phenocopy glucose starvation responses. We conclude that Pex31 has a role in metabolic adaptation of the NVJ.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

ObjectiveOur goal is to evaluate changes in metabolite concentration levels associated with AD to identify biomarkers that could support early and accurate diagnosis and therapeutic interventions by using targeted mass spectrometry and machine learning approaches.

MethodsSerum samples collected from a total of 107 individuals, including 55 individuals diagnosed with AD and 52 healthy controls (HC) enrolled previously to ADDIA cohort were analyzed using the Biocrates(R) 400 metabolite panel. Several machine learning models including Lasso, Random Forest, and XGBoost were trained to classify AD and HC. Repeated cross-validation was used to ensure performance evaluation.

ResultsWe identified 18 metabolites with nominal differences (p<0.05; AUC>0.60) between AD and HC. These included alterations in acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, triglycerides, and amino acids, suggesting disruptions in lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress. The best model achieved an average AUC of 0.88 on the train set and 0.73 on the test set. Classification performance was further improved by combining multiple metabolites in a single panel and adding APOE genotyping (AUC=0.902).

ConclusionsThese results highlight important metabolic signatures that could help to reduce misdiagnosis and support the development of metabolomic panels to detect AD. The combination of multiple serum metabolic biomarkers and APOE genotyping can significantly improve classification accuracy and potentially assist in making non-invasive, cost-effective diagnostic approach.","NA","medrxiv",1748815748979

MCSs play many roles in cellular homeostasis by facilitating inter-organelle lipid and ion exchange as well as organelle positioning. The late endosome/lysosome (LE/Lys) cholesterol transfer protein STARD3 (StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain containing protein 3) forms reversible contacts between the LE/Lys and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This tether protein contains a Phospho-FFAT motif (two phenylalanines (FF) in an acidic tract (AT)) whose interaction with ER-resident VAP proteins is phosphorylation-dependent. In this study, we identify Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3 and GSK3{beta}) as the kinases responsible for phosphorylating serine 209 within the Phospho-FFAT motif of STARD3. This phosphorylation event is both necessary and sufficient to activate STARD3's tethering activity, thereby promoting ER-LE/Lys contacts. Furthermore, we show that the ER-LE/Lys tethering activity made by STARD3 regulates endosome positioning, revealing an additional function for STARD3 on endosome biology. Our findings establish a direct and critical role for GSK3 in regulating MCS dynamics via STARD3 phosphorylation. This novel insight into GSK3-mediated phosphorylation expands our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing inter-organelle communication.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

We demonstrate the real world implications of the use of testing and evaluate adverse events and outcomes in individuals who did not receive pharmacogenomic testing for clopidogrel.

MethodsWe analyzed ~100K individuals with paired EHR and exome sequencing data from population health studies administered at multiple medical centers using the Helix Exome+(R) assay. We inferred clopidogrel dosage by processing the prescription with an LLM. We identified all instances of individuals with at least one prescription that is not in concordance with their CYP2C19 genotype. Lastly, we identify instances of thrombosis using a comprehensive codeset based on ICD9, ICD10, and SNOMED terms.

ResultsWe identified 16,140 prescriptions of clopidogrel given to 3,853 participants. We found that 29% of these individuals have a mismatch between the recommended clopidogrel dosage guideline based on their CYP2C19 genotype and their actual prescribed daily dosage. 25% of poor metabolizers experienced thrombosis, with 40% occurring within 2 months of treatment. Poor and intermediate metabolizers receiving clopidogrel are much more likely to experience thrombosis and myocardial infarction (binomial p-value = 0.001).

ConclusionsWe estimate a 38% excess of adverse events occur in poor and intermediate metabolizers relative to normal and rapid metabolizers. The lack of testing may be responsible for 1 thrombosis event per every ~30 people prescribed clopidogrel.","NA","medrxiv",1748815748979

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

Deceased donor kidneys usually undergo cold storage until kidney transplantation, leading to cold ischemia injury that may contribute to poor graft outcomes. However, the molecular characterization of potential mechanisms of cold ischemia injury remains incomplete. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged spatial transcriptomics technology to perform full transcriptome characterization of cold ischemia injury (0-48 hours) using a murine model. We developed a computational workflow to identify spatiotemporal transcriptomic changes that accompany the injury pathophysiology in a compartment-specific manner. We identified potential metabolic reprogramming preferentially within the kidney inner medulla displaying strong oxidative phosphorylation signature in an ischemic environment. We found commonalities between the spatiotemporal transcriptomic presentation of cold ischemia and warm ischemia- reperfusion injury, including an induction of an anti-viral like immune response throughout the renal tissue. Altogether, these systems-level biological insights enabled by our full transcriptome temporal characterization unveil a molecular basis for how cold ischemia injury may negatively affect kidney outcomes. Moreover, our spatial analyses highlight pathological developments deep within the renal tissue, suggesting potential opportunities for new insights beyond biopsy-focused superficial tissue examinations. We also developed an interactive online browser at https://jef.works/vitessce-cold-ischemia/ to facilitate exploration of our results by the broader scientific and clinical community.","NA","biorxiv",1748815748979

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.
