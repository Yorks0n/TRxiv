Current de-extinction efforts focus on genetically modifying the closely related Asian elephant to express woolly mammoth traits. In this study, we establish a multiplex-edited mouse model with modifications in genes associated with hair morphology and lipid metabolism, enabling insights into traits involved in developing woolly hair and cold tolerance. Our optimized workflows achieved high editing efficiencies and produced genetically modified mice with simultaneous editing of up to seven different genes. Selected modifications include loss-of-function mutations in Fgf5, Tgm3, and Fam83g, among others. The resulting mice display exaggerated hair phenotypes including curly, textured coats, and golden-brown hair. This study establishes a rapid platform for testing mammoth-centric genetic variants while advancing methods for complex genetic model generation. These approaches inform de-extinction efforts and research into the genetic basis of mammalian hair development and cold adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1741212510909

There are > 10,000 new hospitalizations per week in the U.S., many of whom develop post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), or ""long COVID"", with long-term health issues and compromised quality of life. Early identification of individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 is key for monitoring and supporting respiratory status and improving outcomes. Therefore, precision tools for early detection of patients at high risk of severe disease can reduce morbidity and mortality. Here we report an untargeted and longitudinal metabolomic study of plasma derived from adult patients with COVID-19. One-carbon metabolism, a pathway previously shown as critical for viral propagation and disease progression, and a potential target for COVID-19 treatment, scored strongly as differentially abundant in patients with severe COVID-19. A follow-up targeted metabolite profiling revealed that one arm of the one-carbon metabolism pathway, the methionine cycle, is a major driver of the metabolic profile associated with disease severity. The methionine cycle produces S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl group donor important for methylation of DNA, RNA, and proteins, and its high abundance was reported to correlate with disease severity. Further, genomic data from the profiled patients revealed a genetic contributor to methionine metabolism and identified the C677T allele of the MTHFR gene as a pre-existing predictor of disease trajectory - patients homozygous for the MTHFR C677T have higher incidence of experiencing severe disease. Our results raise the possibility that screening for the common genetic MTHFR variant may be an actionable approach to stratify risk of COVID severity and may inform novel precision COVID-19 treatment strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1741212510909

The site is considered to be between 1.95 Ma and 1.77 Ma (Gabunia et al. 2000b) and presents us with the first skeletal evidence of hominins to emerge from Africa, a key event in human evolution. Their morphology, and the degree of morphological variation observed among the assemblage, has generated considerable controversy about their affinities and heterogeneity. Here we use parsimony analyses to test the competing hypotheses for Dmanisi hominins employing characters from the cranium, mandible, dentition, and postcranium; and we address anomalies in endocranial volume, dentition and mandibular structure among the assemblage. We propose that the Dmanisi hominins are not Homo erectus, and that two species are represented among the assemblage: one comprises Homo georgicus and the other an as yet unnamed species. Our review of the dating of the Dmanisi site leads us to propose that Homo georgicus was probably present by 1.8 Ma and that the other hominins recovered from the Dmanisi excavations accumulated at some time or times during the reverse polarity of 1.07 Ma and 1.77 Ma. The specific, individual, ages of these hominins remain unknown.","NA","biorxiv",1741212510909

In many species, this is accomplished by primordial germ cells (PGCs), which give rise to sperm or eggs. PGCs are often specified far from the future gonads and must migrate through developing tissues to reach them. Failure to do so can result in infertility or germ cell tumours. While PGC migration is well characterized in some species, very little is known about their migration in mammalian embryos. Here, we performed dynamic and quantitative analyses of PGC migration from E7.5 to E9.5 in the mouse embryo, providing the first comprehensive study of the migratory characteristics of PGCs from their point of origin to the gonads. We demonstrate that migrating PGCs are influenced by the surrounding environment and, in contrast to other organisms, extend highly dynamic, actin-rich protrusions to navigate through ECM barriers and tight intercellular spaces. As PGCs migrate through increasingly confined spaces, they undergo significant nuclear deformation and become prone to nuclear rupture and DNA damage. Their migration under confinement may be aided in part by a depleted nuclear lamina that leads to wrinkled nuclear morphology. Our high-resolution and dynamic imaging approaches have uncovered a surprising risk to genome integrity in migrating PGCs, with implications for DNA repair and adaptations in nuclear mechanics in PGCs.","NA","biorxiv",1741212510909

It is typically stored as a genetic relatedness matrix (GRM), whose elements are pairwise relatedness values between individuals. This relatedness has been defined in various contexts based on pedigree, genotype, phylogeny, coalescent times, and, recently, ancestral recombination graph (ARG). ARG-based GRMs have been found to better capture the structure of a population and improve association studies relative to the genotype GRM. However, calculating GRMs and further operations with them is fundamentally challenging due to inherent quadratic time and space complexity. Here, we first discuss the different definitions of relatedness in a unifying context, making use of the additive model of a quantitative trait to provide a definition of branch relatedness and the corresponding branch GRM. We explore the relationship between branch relatedness and pedigree relatedness through a case study of French-Canadian individuals that have a known pedigree. Through the tree sequence encoding of an ARG, we then derive an efficient algorithm for computing products between the branch GRM and a general vector, without explicitly forming the branch GRM. This algorithm leverages the sparse encoding of genomes with the tree sequence and hence enables large-scale computations with the branch GRM. We demonstrate the power of this algorithm by developing a randomized principal components algorithm for tree sequences that easily scales to millions of genomes. All algorithms are implemented in the open source tskit Python package. Taken together, this work consolidates the different notions of relatedness as branch relatedness and by leveraging the tree sequence encoding of an ARG it provides efficient algorithms that enable computations with the branch GRM that scale to mega-scale genomic datasets.","NA","biorxiv",1741212510909

The intricate nature of biosynthetic enzymes poses a major challenge in accurately predicting the chemical structures of secondary metabolites solely based on genome sequences using current rule-based methods. Here, we present DeepSeMS, a large language model designed to predict the chemical structures of secondary metabolites from various microbial biosynthetic gene clusters. Built on the Transformer architecture, DeepSeMS innovatively identifies sequence features using functional domains of biosynthetic enzymes, and incorporates feature-aligned chemical structure enumeration for training data augmentation. External evaluation results show that DeepSeMS predicts more accurate chemical structures of secondary metabolites with a Tanimoto coefficient up to 0.6 compared with the ground truth, significantly outperforming antiSMASH and PRISM with coefficients of only 0.14 and 0.45 respectively. Moreover, DeepSeMS successfully predicted secondary metabolites for 96.60% of cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters, surpassing existing methods with success rates less than 50%. Leveraging DeepSeMS, we characterized over 65,000 novel secondary metabolites from the global ocean microbiome with previously undocumented structural types, ecological distribution, and biomedical applications especially antibiotics. A login-free and user-friendly web server for DeepSeMS (https://biochemai.cstspace.cn/deepsems/) has been launched, featuring an integrated global ocean microbial secondary metabolites repository to expedite the discovery of novel natural products. Collectively, this study underscores the great capacity of a large language model-driven method in revealing hidden biosynthetic potential of the global ocean microbiome.","NA","biorxiv",1741212510909

Repeated vaccination is essential for preparing against currently circulating and newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants while enabling people to continue with daily life. Optimizing vaccination strategies is crucial to efficiently manage medical resources and establish an effective vaccination framework. Therefore, it is important to quantitatively understand vaccine-induced immunity dynamics and to be able to identify poor responders with lower sustained antibody titers as potential priorities for revaccination. We investigated longitudinal antibody titer data in a cohort of 2,526 people in Fukushima, Japan, from April 2021 to November 2022 for whom basic demographic and health information was available. Using mathematical modeling and machine learning, we stratified the time-course patterns of antibody titers after 2 primary doses and 1 booster dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We identified 3 notable populations, which we refer to as the durable, the vulnerable, and the rapid-decliner populations, approximately half of which remained in the same population after the booster dose. Notably, the rapid-decliner population experienced earlier infections than the others. Furthermore, when comparing IgG(S) titers, IgA(S) titers, and T-spot counts between participants who experienced breakthrough infections after booster vaccination and those who did not, we found that IgA(S) titers were significantly lower in breakthrough infected participants during the early stage after booster vaccination. Our computational approach is adaptable to various types of vaccinations. This flexibility can inform policy decisions on vaccine distribution to enhance immunity both in future pandemics and in the post-COVID-19 era.","NA","biorxiv",1741212510909

The assumption that pathogens and mammalian-associated bacteria remodel their lipid A PAMP because of host-microbe co-evolution is a long held-belief of microbial pathogenesis. We set out to test this fundamental principle by interrogating a Gram-negative genus presenting evidence of evolutionary events linked to the acquisition of essential virulence traits, resulting in pathogenic and non-pathogenic species. The genus Yersinia fulfil these requirements; the acquisition of the pYV virulence plasmid is one of the evolutionary events associated with virulence. At 37{degrees}C, only pathogenic Yersinia switch to deacylated lipid A, a modification that diminishes TLR4/MD-2 recognition and reduces inflammation. An engineered chimeric pathogenic Yersinia strain expressing the non-pathogenic lipid A profile efficiently engages with TLR4, demonstrating it is sufficient to switch the acylation pattern to modify the recognition by TLR4 and subsequent activation of inflammation. The lipid As of pathogenic and non-pathogenic species are modified with aminoarabinose and palmitate; therefore, only the reduced acylation of the lipid A PAMP is a trait associated with virulence. The decorations of lipid A do not alter TLR4 engagement but confer resistance to antimicrobial peptides. The chimeric pathogenic Yersinia strain expressing the non-pathogenic lipid A profile allows to ascertain whether the switch in the lipid A PAMP affects virulence. This strain showed enhanced motility due to an upregulation of the flhDC master regulator, and impaired cellular invasion through downregulation of rovA, a key invasion regulator. The expression and function of pYV-encoded virulence factors Yops and YadA were not affected. Nonetheless, the chimeric strain was attenuated in vivo, demonstrating that virulence factors cannot overcome a switch in the lipid A PAMP associated with pathogenicity.","NA","biorxiv",1741212510909

First, we analyze ~18 million antibody pairs targeting ~250 protein families and establish that a threshold of >70% CDRH3 sequence identity among antibodies sharing both heavy and light chain V-genes reliably predicts overlapping-epitope antibody pairs. Next, we develop a supervised contrastive fine-tuning framework for antibody large language models which results in embeddings that better correlate with epitope information than those from pre-trained models. Applying this contrastive learning approach to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain antibodies, we achieve 82.7% balanced accuracy in distinguishing same-epitope versus different-epitope antibody pairs and demonstrate the ability to predict relative levels of structural overlap from learning on functional epitope bins (Spearman {rho} = 0.25). Finally, we create AbLang-PDB, a generalized model for predicting overlapping-epitope antibodies for a broad range of protein families. AbLang-PDB achieves five-fold improvement in average precision for predicting overlapping-epitope antibody pairs compared to sequence-based methods, and effectively predicts the amount of epitope overlap among overlapping-epitope pairs ({rho} = 0.81). In an antibody discovery campaign searching for overlapping-epitope antibodies to the HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody 8ANC195, 70% of computationally selected candidates demonstrated HIV-1 specificity, with 50% showing competitive binding with 8ANC195.

Our understanding of how human lung macrophages respond to inflammatory signals have predominantly relied on cell lines or peripheral blood derived cells, which have a limited capacity to reflect the complexity of tissue macrophage responses. Therefore, we isolated macrophages from resected human lung tissue and stimulated them ex vivo under type 2 (IL-4, IL-13, or IL-4 + IL-13) or type 1 (IFN{gamma} + LPS) conditions. Human lung macrophages stimulated with IL-4/13, alone or in combination, significantly upregulated expression of the chemokines CCL17, CCL18 and CCL22, along with the transglutaminase TGM2 and the lipoxygenase ALOX15.

We introduce here GrAnnoT, a tool designed for efficient and reliable annotation transfer using such graphs, by projecting existing annotations from a source genome to the graph and subsequently to other embedded genomes.

Our agent-based simulations of the transfer dynamics of the conjugative plasmid pLS20 from Bacillus subtilis reveal that spatial organization, colony growth dynamics, and quorum-sensing regulation significantly influence plasmid dissemination. Increased donor-recipient mixing enhances plasmid transmission by reducing quorum-induced repression, while colony growth-driven displacement of donor cells alters the local distribution of quorum-sensing signals, enabling sustained conjugation activity at the colony periphery. Complementary ODE modeling captures macroscopic trends in plasmid transmission, providing insights into the interplay between spatial factors and regulatory mechanisms. By bridging single-cell regulatory dynamics with population-level behaviors, this study advances our understanding of bacterial conjugation on solid surfaces, offering potential strategies for mitigating the spread of antibiotic resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1741212510909

While group-level gradient patterns are well-characterized, the biological mechanisms underlying individual variability remain poorly understood. Here, we integrate genetic, transcriptomic, and metabolic data across large-scale cohorts to investigate the biological basis of functional gradients and their relevance to neuropsychiatric conditions. Using twin-based heritability analyses and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in over 30,000 individuals based on three datasets, we identified consistent heritability patterns and five genetic loci associated with gradient organization. These loci are linked to sixteen genes involved in metabolic pathways, with gene expression patterns spatially correlating with functional gradients. Furthermore, we observed significant associations between cardiovascular metabolic biomarkers and gradient architecture. Polygenic risk scores for neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, were significantly associated with gradient loadings, suggesting shared genetic influences on functional organization and mental health risk. Our findings highlight a complex interplay between genetic variation, metabolic processes, and brain function, offering new insights into the biological foundations of functional brain organization and its implications for neuropsychiatric vulnerability.","NA","medrxiv",1741212510909

By aggregating gene expression profiles from millions of cells across hundreds of studies, single cell atlases have provided a foundation for training AI-driven models of the cell. However, reliance on datasets with pre-processed counts limits the size and diversity of these repositories and constrains downstream model training to data curated for divergent purposes. This introduces analytical variability due to differences in the choice of alignment tools, genome references, and counting strategies.

We evaluated five pseudo-absence sampling techniques, considering pseudo-absence ratios, buffer radii, and density smoothing factors to determine the most effective modeling approach. Key environmental predictors included humidity, agricultural land-use, and forest cover, while temperature had minimal influence for both the virus and the vector. The resulting suitability model identifies high transmission risk areas in Central and South America, and reveals that environmental suitability patterns align with seasonal fluctuations in case numbers, with peaks in Amazonian states at the beginning of the year and an expansion into non-Amazonian regions later in the year.

Here, we introduce Brightness Demixing, a novel method for fluorophore discrimination that exploits brightness, which directly depends on the fluorophore's extinction coefficient and quantum yield. By oversampling blinking events, we precisely quantify photon flux as a proxy for brightness, enabling robust differentiation of fluorophores independent of their spectral properties, without requiring additional spectral separation. Brightness Demixing operates within a single detection channel, eliminating the need for additional spectral filters or cameras. We demonstrate this approach with simultaneous two- and three-target imaging in both 2D and 3D configurations. By maintaining single-wavelength excitation and minimizing chromatic aberrations, this method significantly enhances multiplexing in SMLM while remaining fully compatible with existing setups.

To address these challenges, we developed BaGPipe, an automated and flexible bacterial GWAS pipeline built using Nextflow and incorporating Pyseer for association analysis. BaGPipe integrates all essential components of a bacterial GWAS--spanning pre-processing, statistical analysis, and downstream visualisation--into a unified workflow that is reproducible and easy to deploy across diverse computational environments. BaGPipe was validated on a publicly available dataset of Streptococcus pneumoniae whole-genome sequences, and reproduced published findings with improved computational efficiency. BaGPipe was then applied to a dataset of Staphylococcus aureus whole-genome sequences, successfully identifying known and novel antibiotic resistance associations. By offering an accessible, efficient, and reproducible platform, BaGPipe accelerates bacterial GWAS and facilitates deeper exploration into the genetic underpinnings of phenotypic traits.

Impact StatementThe increasing availability of bacterial genome sequences has created an opportunity for robust, reproducible tools to facilitate the discovery of novel genotype-phenotype associations. Despite the demonstrated utility of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in identifying genetic determinants of disease, toxicity and antibiotic resistance, existing tools for bacterial GWAS often involve fragmented workflows requiring extensive manual intervention, limiting their adoption and reproducibility. Here, we introduce BaGPipe, a fully integrated bacterial GWAS pipeline that automates pre-processing, statistical analysis, and visualisation, thereby streamlining the entire workflow. With its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use, BaGPipe makes bacterial GWAS more accessible to researchers, enabling faster and more reliable insights into microbial genetics. This is an important step towards overcoming the computational and logistical barriers that have constrained bacterial GWAS, ultimately accelerating research into microbial evolution, resistance mechanisms, and the genetic basis of other key phenotypic traits.

Defects in tropomyosin function can lead to diseases, including some myopathies and allergies. In cells, tropomyosin molecules form coiled-coil dimers, which then polymerise end-to-end with other dimers for actin association. Tropomyosin is challenging to tag for in vivo fluorescence microscopy without perturbing its polymerisation interfaces. We recently developed a fluorescent tag comprising a forty amino acid flexible linker capable of detecting tropomyosin in S. pombe actin cables and the actomyosin ring, and in patch-like structures that were previously unappreciated. We also used this strategy successfully to tag human TPM2.2, a prominent human muscle isoform. Here, we expand this tool to visualise eight other human tropomyosin isoforms, using mNeonGreen, mCherry and mStayGold tags. All show typical tropomyosin fluorescence, no signs of cytotoxicity and are compatible with super-resolution microscopy. These tools singly or in combination should aid detailed mechanistic investigations of tropomyosin isoforms.","NA","biorxiv",1741212510909

In this study, we present a simple and efficient method for co-extracting nucleic acids (NA) from these two distinct respiratory pathogens for downstream diagnostic testing. We evaluated three different nucleic acid amplification (NAA)-based platforms, LightCycler480 (LC480) qPCR, Qiacuity digital PCR (dPCR), and Cytation3 for CRISPR-Cas13a-based SHINE-TB/SC2 detection assays. Chelex-100 chelating resin-based boiling preparation method was optimized for Mtb NA extraction from saliva and sputum. Saliva showed compatibility with all three platforms, with sensitivity as low as 100 CFU/ml (or 2 genomic copies/{micro}l). This method worked well for sputum using dPCR at 100% (21/21) positivity, though the CRISPR-based SHINE-TB assay showed more variability and sensitivity to sputum inhibitor carry-over, resulting in an 81% positive rate (17/21). Diluting sputum with TE buffer (1:1) improved the detection (2/4). Extraction efficiency of our method was 48%, 62.2%, 86.4% and 99.3% for concentrations 105, 104, 103 and 10 CFU/ml, respectively.

Here, we used synaptic partner matching in the Drosophila olfactory circuit3,4 to address this question. By systematically altering the combination of differentially expressed CSPs in a single olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) type, which senses a male pheromone that inhibits male-male courtship, we switched its connection from its endogenous postsynaptic projection neuron (PN) type nearly completely to a new PN type that promotes courtship. To achieve this switch, we deduced a combinatorial code including CSPs that mediate both attractive and repulsive interactions between synaptic partners5,6. The anatomical switch changed the odor response of the new PN partner and markedly increased male-male courtship. We generalized three manipulation strategies from this rewiring to successfully rewire a second ORN type to multiple distinct PN types. This work demonstrates that manipulating a small set of CSPs is sufficient to respecify synaptic connections, paving ways to explore how neural systems evolve through changes of circuit connectivity.","NA","biorxiv",1741212510909

Furthermore, cerebellar microglia in aged mice, compared to young mice, were found in closer proximity to granule cells. This relationship was characterized using the newly defined neuron-associated microglia score, which captures proximity-dependent transcriptional changes and suggests a novel microglial responsiveness.

In March 2024, a first-time outbreak of HPAIV H5N1 in dairy cattle herds was reported in the United States (US). Since then, the virus has continued to spread in cattle herds and spilt over into humans. We recently showed that the first human isolate reported in the US in Texas (HPhTX) from a dairy worker in an affected cattle farm has enhanced replication kinetics and pathogenicity in mice compared to a closely related bovine isolate (HPbTX). However, the molecular determinants of differential pathogenicity have not yet been identified. Herein, we show that HPhTX has enhanced polymerase activity, compared with HPbTX, in human cells and that the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) protein is the main factor responsible for this difference. Through single and combined site-directed mutagenesis and swapping the three amino acids different between HPhTX and HPbTX, we found that PB2 mutation E627K is the major contributor to the enhanced polymerase activity of HPhTX. E362G substitution in HPhTX PB2 affected the polymerase, although to a lesser extent than E627K. Moreover, M631L mutation in HPhTX PB2 enhanced polymerase activity. Rescue of a loss-of-function recombinant HPhTX (rHPhTX) containing mutations at residues 627 and 362, alone or in combination, revealed a contribution of PB2 E362G and K627E in morbidity, mortality, and viral replication as compared to rHPhTX wild-type (WT), and significantly reduced viral pathogenicity to levels comparable to rHPbTX WT.

Detailed annotation of KZFP genes in a cluster on Mus musculus Chromosome 4 revealed parallel expansion and diversification of this locus in different mouse strains (C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ and CAST/EiJ) and species (Mus spretus and Mus pahari). Our data supports a model by which new ERV integrations within young KZFP gene clusters likely promoted recombination events leading to the emergence of new KZFPs that repress them. At the same time, ERVs also increased their numbers by duplication instead of retrotransposition alone, unraveling a new mechanism for ERV enrichment at these loci.","NA","biorxiv",1741212510909

The sample categories consisted of faecal, urine, guano, blood, tissues, oral, and rectal swabs.  The molecular detection approaches included polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques using species-specific, genus-specific, or broad-range primers.

Globally, the most predominant bat species which tested positive for CoVs were Rhinolophus, Myotis, Miniopterus, Scotophilus, Eidolon, Chaerephon, Hipposideros, and Desmodus. Continuous bat coronavirus surveillance using molecular methods and full genome sequencing is of utmost importance in detecting and characterizing viruses at molecular level and establishing the genetic diversity of new and circulating viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1741212510909

We present LOCATE (Long-read to Characterize All Transposable Elements), an algorithm using long-read sequencing to detect and assemble transposon insertions. LOCATE outperforms existing tools on simulated datasets and achieves the best performance in two previous benchmarks, as well as in a new benchmark we constructed using real biological datasets. Applying LOCATE to public datasets revealed that pre-existing Alu copies create two hotspots for Alu and LINE1 insertions: the A-rich linker and the poly(A) tail. We further observed a preference for self-insertions over non-self-insertions in Alu and LINE1, suggesting a ""feedforward"" transposition mechanism in which Alu and LINE1 RNA transcripts target the hotspots of their source copies to generate new insertions. LOCATE enhances our ability to study transposons and their role in genome dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1741212510909

While the immune microenvironment in multiple myeloma (MM) becomes increasingly dysfunctional during disease evolution, little is known about changes in the NK cell compartment. Using primary samples from clinical trial patients, we performed detailed phenotypic analyses of bone marrow mononuclear cells from MGUS, SMM, and newly diagnosed MM patients. We found that disease progression is associated with an increase in CD56bright NK cells with a dynamic positive association between this NK cell subset and local tumour burden. We generated a large single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of >100,000 NK cells from healthy donor individuals and plasma cell disorder patients and identify a bone marrow specific CD56bright-like NK cell population (BM-NK) that is enriched in the marrow of MM patients. These findings highlight the evolution of the NK-cell compartment in MM and suggest a role for BM-resident CD56bright NK cells with impaired cytotoxicity in promoting immune evasion.","NA","biorxiv",1741212510909

Yet, sparsity and noise in spatial transcriptomics data pose significant analytical challenges. Here, we introduce Smoothie, a method that denoises spatial transcriptomics data with Gaussian smoothing and constructs and integrates genome-wide co-expression networks. Utilizing implicit and explicit parallelization, Smoothie scales to datasets exceeding 100 million spatially resolved spots with fast run times and low memory usage. We demonstrate how co-expression networks measured by Smoothie enable precise gene module detection, functional annotation of uncharacterized genes, linkage of gene expression to genome architecture, and multi-sample comparisons to assess stable or dynamic gene expression patterns across tissues, conditions, and time points. Overall, Smoothie provides a scalable and versatile framework for extracting deep biological insights from high-resolution spatial transcriptomics data.","NA","biorxiv",1741212510909

RepTiles reduced the burden associated with the manual design of long DNA from standard biological parts. We are applying RepTiles to the construction of random DNA segments that will form part of a neochromosome in Physcomitrium patens. RepTiles has a base DNA collection of 52 1.7 kb chemically synthesised Phytobricks mini-chunks. We provide a user-friendly web application that facilitates the design of DNA assemblies based on the base collection. The system generates assembly plans for generating chunks using Golden Braid. The resulting chunks can then be assembled into megachunks using Transformation Associated Recombination cloning. It thus supports the generation of ultra-long synthetic DNA from phytobricks, contributing to the vision of synthetic plant genomics from modular parts to complete genomes.","NA","biorxiv",1741212510909

The neural network is based on the U-Net commonly used in image segmentation which we employ to transform unaligned sequences to aligned sequences. For alignment scenarios our Ali-U-Net neural network has been trained on, it is in most cases more accurate than programs such as MAFFT, T-Coffee, MUSCLE, and Clustal Omega, while being considerably faster than similarly accurate programs on a single CPU core. Limitations are that the neural network is still trained specifically for certain alignment problems and can perform poorly for gap distributions it has not seen before. Furthermore, the algorithm currently works with fixed-size alignment windows of 48x48 or 96x96 nucleotides. At this stage, we view our study as a proof of concept, confident that the present findings can be extended to larger alignments and more complex alignment scenarios in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1741212510909

However, it is not known how the composition of individual axons is established or locally modulated to enable neuronal function and plasticity. Here, we use spatial translatomics to identify local axonal translatomes in anatomically and functionally specialized neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). DRG neurons extend long central and peripheral axons in opposite directions and distinct microenvironments to enable somatosensation. Using Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification and RNA sequencing, we generated a comprehensive resource of mRNAs preferentially translated within each axon. Locally translated proteins include pain receptors, ion channels, and translational machinery, which establish distinct electrophysiologic properties and regenerative capacities for each axon. We identify RNA-binding proteins associated with sorting and transporting functionally related mRNAs. These findings provide resources for addressing how axonal translation shapes the spatial organization of neurons and enables subcellular neuroplasticity.
