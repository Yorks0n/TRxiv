METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1725746796821

However, it remains uncertain whether such diverse tuning corresponds to distinct functions within the hippocampal network or if a more generic computation can account for these observations. To disentangle the contribution of externally driven cues versus internal computation, we developed a task in mice where space, auditory tones, rewards, and context were juxtaposed with changing relevance. High-density electrophysiological recordings revealed that neurons were tuned to each of these modalities. By comparing movement paths and action sequences, we observed that external variables had limited direct influence on hippocampal firing. Instead, spiking was influenced by online action plans modulated by goal uncertainty. Our results suggest that internally generated cell assembly sequences are selected and updated by action plans toward deliberate goals. The apparent tuning of hippocampal neuronal spiking to different sensory modalities might emerge due to alignment to the afforded action progression within a task rather than representation of external cues.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Here, we use in situ cryo-electron tomography to visualize the native structures and organization of several major mitochondrial complexes inside Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells. ATP synthases and respiratory complexes are segregated into curved and flat crista membrane domains, respectively. Respiratory complexes I, III, and IV assemble into a single type of respirasome, from which we determined a native 5 [A]-resolution structure showing the binding of electron carrier cytochrome c.

KP.3, featuring F456L and Q493E, exhibits a markedly enhanced ACE2 binding affinity compared to KP.2 and the JN.1 variant due to synergistic effects between these mutations. This study elucidated the structures of KP.2 and KP.3 RBD in complex with ACE2 using cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) and decipher the structural and thermodynamic implications of these mutations on receptor binding by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, revealing that F456L mutation facilitates a more favorable binding environment for Q493E, leading to stronger receptor interactions which consequently enhance the potential for incorporating additional evasive mutations. These results underscore the importance of understanding mutational epistatic interactions in predicting SARS-CoV-2 evolution and optimizing vaccine updates. Continued monitoring of such epistatic effects is crucial for anticipating new dominant strains and preparing appropriate public health responses.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

The rapid evolution of H5 HPAIVs continues to raise concern with heightened zoonotic and pandemic risks. The immunodominant haemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA) is crucial for influenza virus receptor binding and pH-induced fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Mutations in HA are frequent due to polymerase error, immune pressure and host adaptation, resulting in antigenic modulation and/or an expansion of host tropism, respectively, ultimately hindering control strategies. We evaluated a comprehensive panel of H5 viruses representing prevalent genotypes from UK outbreaks spanning 2020 to 2022 for HA functionality. HA genes from each genotype were assessed through receptor binding, pH of fusion, thermostability and HA inhibition assays to evaluate factors contributing to zoonotic potential, stability, and antigenicity. The viruses only bound to avian receptors and exhibited fusion at a pH of 5.8, above the pH range (pH 5.0 to 5.5) associated with efficient human-to-human transmission. Therefore, these H5 viruses have low immediate zoonotic threat. Contemporary H5 viruses were more thermostable and showed antigenic drift compared to the earlier 2017-2018 clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 viruses, and N236D in HA was identified as a significant antigenic epitope. The findings of this study underscore the evolving nature of the HA of these viruses and highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance and characterisation efforts to identify factors that might contribute to zoonotic risk.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Here, we demonstrate that RTN4IP1 deficiency causes a CI assembly defect in both patient fibroblasts and knockout cells, and report that RTN4IP1 is a bona fide CI assembly factor. Complexome profiling revealed accumulation of unincorporated ND5-module and impaired N-module production. RTN4IP1 patient fibroblasts also exhibited defective coenzyme Q biosynthesis, substantiating this emerging function of RTN4IP1.

In this study, we report on the neutralizing antibody (nAb) escape, infectivity, fusion, and stability of these subvariants-LB.1, KP.2.3, KP.3, and KP.3.1.1. Our findings demonstrate that all of these subvariants are highly evasive of nAbs elicited by the bivalent mRNA vaccine, the XBB.1.5 monovalent mumps virus-based vaccine, or from infections during the BA.2.86/JN.1 wave. This reduction in nAb titers is primarily driven by a single serine deletion (DelS31) in the NTD of the spike, leading to a distinct antigenic profile compared to the parental JN.1 and other variants. We also found that the DelS31 mutation decreases pseudovirus infectivity in CaLu-3 cells, which correlates with impaired cell-cell fusion. Additionally, the spike protein of DelS31 variants appears more conformationally stable, as indicated by reduced S1 shedding both with and without stimulation by soluble ACE2, and increased resistance to elevated temperatures. Molecular modeling suggests that the DelS31 mutation induces a conformational change that stabilizes the NTD and strengthens the NTD-Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) interaction, thus favoring the down conformation of RBD and reducing accessibility to both the ACE2 receptor and certain nAbs. Additionally, the DelS31 mutation introduces an N-linked glycan modification at N30, which shields the underlying NTD region from antibody recognition. Our data highlight the critical role of NTD mutations in the spike protein for nAb evasion, stability, and viral infectivity, and suggest consideration of updating COVID-19 vaccines with antigens containing DelS31.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

It also provides a unique habitat for ecological microbiota. Previous research on the microbiome of pollen has largely focussed on angiosperm systems, with limited research into coniferous gymnosperms. This study characterises the pollen microbiome associated with one of the worlds most widely grown tree species, Pinus radiata. Trees were sampled from locations across Canterbury, New Zealand, with repeated collections in 2020 and 2021. Metabolomic analysis revealed the main compounds present on P. radiata pollen to be amino acids (principally proline), and carbohydrates (fructose, glucose, and sucrose). Although phenolic compounds such as {rho}-coumaric acid and catechin, and terpenoids such as dehydroabietic acid, were present at low concentrations, their strong bioactive natures mean they may be important in filtering of microbiome communities on pollen. Pinus radiata pollen was found to host a microbiome dominated by fungi; this directly contrasts with those for many angiosperm species. Geographic range and sampling years were evaluated as secondary drivers of microbiome assembly. Neither sampling location nor annual variation had a significant impact on the fungal component of the pine pollen microbiome, which was remarkably stable/conserved among samples. However, some bacterial taxa exhibited sensitivity to geographic distances and yearly variations, suggesting a secondary role for some. A core microbiome was identified in P. radiata pollen, characterized by a consistent presence of specific fungal and bacterial taxa across samples. While the dominant phyla, Proteobacteria and Ascomycota, align with findings from other pollen microbiome studies, unique core members were unidentified at genus level. This tree species-specific microbiome assembly emphasizes the crucial role of the host plant in shaping the pollen microbiome. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of pollen microbiomes in gymnosperms, shedding light on the need to look further at their ecological and functional roles.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1725746796821

Fragmented Y chromosome scaffolds (n=11 [&ge;]1 Mbp) were identified using Y-specific contigs generated by genome subtraction. We identified two novel alpha-satellite repeats of 187 bp and 199 bp in the putative centromeres that did not form higher order repeats. The genome assembly exceeds the standard recommended by the Earth Biogenome Project; 0.02% false expansions, 99.63% kmer completeness, 94.66% complete single copy BUSCO genes and an average 98.42% of transcriptome data mappable to the genome assembly.

To maintain the infection cycle, soil phages must travel from one suitable host to the next. However, traversing the soil matrix presents a dangerous journey for phages, which need to encounter the right hosts in this spatially complex habitat, but are not capable of active motion and can adsorb to soil particles. Here, we tested the hypothesis that bacterial-feeding nematodes (roundworms) present a reliable vehicle of soil transport for phages. First, we demonstrated that the bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans vectored the laboratory model phage T7 as well as the soil phage {Phi} Ppu-W11 on agar. Sorption assays carried out with paralyzed and non-paralyzed nematodes showed that phage transport can occur via both external cuticular attachment and ingestion, and that the presence of host bacteria is not required for phage vectoring. Finally, we designed a microcosm to test phage transfer in compost and sandy soil using C. elegans and its sister species, C. remanei, respectively. This experiment confirmed that nematodes also enable phage movement through complex spatial habitats. This novel mechanism of phage vectoring extends our understanding of virus transmission in soil, revealing new multitrophic interactions that may influence soil functioning.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

We assessed immune responses in n=42 health-care workers (median age 47 years, interquartile range, IQR 19,5 years, 48% male), who in August 2024 were vaccinated with 30 microg of the updated mRNA omicron JN.1 vaccine (bretovameran, BioNTech/Pfizer, Mainz, Germany). Humoral immune responses were analyzed directly prior to and 13 days after vaccination. The omicron JN.1 vaccination resulted in a significant 1,2-fold increase of anti-S IgG and 1,2-fold increase of omicron anti-S IgG (p<0,0001). To assess plasma neutralisation capacity, we employed a pseudovirus particle (pp) neutralisation assay including S proteins of seven SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Baseline response rates were 100% for XBB.1.5pp, 90% for JN.1pp and KP.2pp, 82% for KP.2.3pp, 92% for KP.3pp, and 72% for LB.1pp. Before JN.1 vaccination, particles bearing KP sublineage S proteins were slightly less efficiently neutralised compared with JN.1pp (median change, 1,2-fold to 2,6-fold), while LB.1pp neutralisation was 3-fold reduced, indicating antibody evasion. After vaccination, the response rates increased significantly for all pseudoviruses except XBB.1.5pp and KP.3pp. Thus, we observed a significant increase in neutralisation of JN.1pp, KP.2pp, KP.2.3pp, and LB.1pp, showing a median change of 2.2-fold, 3.8-fold, 3.3-fold, and 4.9-fold, respectively. In summary, bretovameran increased anti-S IgG and strengthened neutralising responses against circulating SARS-CoV-2-variants, except for KP.3.

The toroidal molecular architecture of the Hfq hexamer contains three well characterised surfaces which allow it to bind sRNAs to stabilise them and engage target transcripts. Hfq-interacting sRNAs are categorised into two classes based on the surfaces they use to bind Hfq. By characterising a systematic alanine mutant library of Hfq to identify amino acid residues that impact survival of Escherichia coli experiencing nitrogen starvation, we corroborated the important role of the three RNA binding surfaces for Hfq function. Surprisingly, we uncovered two conserved residues, V22 and G34, in the hydrophobic core of Hfq, to have a profound impact on Hfqs RNA binding activity in vivo. Transcriptome-scale analysis revealed that V22A and G34A Hfq mutants cause widespread destabilisation of both sRNA classes. However, the alanine substitutions at these residues had no measurable impact on protein stability, structure or equilibrium binding to target sRNAs in vitro. We propose that V22 and G34 are key to the cooperative function among the RNA-binding surfaces of Hfq, a mechanism especially critical under cellular conditions when there is an increased demand for Hfq.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Thus, TRAIP promotes DNA inter-strand crosslink repair by triggering the disassembly of CDC45-MCM2-7-GINS (CMG) helicases that have converged on these lesions. However, disassembly of single CMGs that have stalled temporarily would be deleterious, suggesting that TRAIP must be carefully regulated. Here, we demonstrate that human cells lacking the de-ubiquitylating enzyme USP37 are hypersensitive to topoisomerase poisons and other replication stress-inducing agents. We further show that TRAIP loss rescues the hypersensitivity of USP37 knockout cells to topoisomerase inhibitors. In Xenopus egg extracts depleted of USP37, TRAIP promotes premature CMG ubiquitylation and disassembly when converging replisomes stall. Finally, guided by AlphaFold-Multimer, we discovered that binding to CDC45 mediates USP37s response to topological stress. In conclusion, we propose that USP37 protects genome stability by preventing TRAIP-dependent CMG unloading when replication stress impedes timely termination.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Auxin-dependent transcriptional changes are mediated by DNA-binding Auxin Response Factors (ARF), whose AuxRE DNA binding sites are well-known. The identification of the first AuxRE showed this to be part of a composite element with a second motif. Indeed, systematic analysis showed other DNA motifs to be enriched in auxin-regulated promoters. Neither the basis for this enrichment nor the mechanisms for the activity of composite AuxREs is known. Here, we systematically mined Arabidopsis promoters for composite AuxRE elements enriched in auxin-responsive genes. We identified many and show that their presence is a reliable predictor of auxin response. Through mutating these elements and their higher-order modules, we demonstrate function in promoter activity. Lastly, we identified transcription factors (TFs) that bind AuxRE-associated motifs, showed their involvement in auxin response, and discovered that several of these TFs directly bind ARF proteins. We propose that ARF-TF complexes specifically bind compound motifs in promoters, and act as a source of diversification in auxin-dependent gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Locating this root is crucial for reconstructing the features of LECA, both as the endpoint of eukaryogenesis and the start-point for the evolution of the myriad complex traits underpinning the diversification of living eukaryotes. However, the position of the root remains contentious due to pervasive phylogenetic artefacts stemming from inadequate evolutionary models, poor taxon sampling, and limited phylogenetic signal. Here, we estimate the root of the eToL with unprecedented resolution based on a new, much larger, dataset of mitochondrial proteins which includes all known eukaryotic supergroups. Our comprehensive analyses with state-of-the-art phylogenetic models reveal that the eukaryotic root lies between two multi-supergroup assemblages:  Opimoda+ and  Diphoda+. Compellingly, this position is consistently supported across different models and robustness analyses. Notably, groups containing  typical excavates are placed on both sides of the root, suggesting the complex features of the  excavate cell architecture trace back to LECA.

Available data support that the burst of cytokines and bradykinin, observed in some COVID-19 patients, sustains systemic inflammation and the hypercoagulant state, thus increasing thrombotic risk. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) can play a direct role in the activation of the coagulation cascade. Adding Mpro to human plasma from healthy donors increased clotting probability by 2.5-fold. The results of enzymatic assays and degradomics analysis indicate that Mpro triggers plasma clotting by proteolytically activating coagulation factors zymogens VII and XII at their physiological activation sites, i.e. Arg152-Ile153 bond for FVII and Arg353-Val354 bond for FXII, where FVII and FXII are strategically positioned at the very beginning of the extrinsic or intrinsic pathways of blood coagulation. These findings are not compatible with the substrate specificity of the protease known so far, displaying a prevalence for a Gln-residue in P1 and a hydrophobic amino acid in P2 position. This apparent discrepancy was resolved by High Throughput Protease Screen assay, unveiling an extended, time-dependent, secondary specificity of Mpro for Arg-X bonds, which was further confirmed by Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass spectrometry analysis of Arg-containing inhibitors binding to Mpro and by enzymatic assays showing that the protease can cleave peptide substrates containing Arg in P1.

We hypothesized that this discrepancy arises from individuals belief that others prefer riskier choices than they do. To examine this hypothesis, we used a gambling task where on some trials, individuals were informed that their choices would be observed by a risk- averse or seeking partner. Most important, individuals were given chances to learn each partners preference beforehand. As expected, individuals initially believed that partners would make relatively riskier choices than they would. Against two alternative explanations, we found that individuals simulated partners choices and weighed these simulated choices in making their own choices. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we showed that decision probabilities adjusted with the simulated partners choices were represented in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Moreover, individual differences in the functional connectivity between the TPJ and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were explained by the interaction between model-estimated social reliance and sensitivity to social cues in the mPFC. These findings provide a neuromechanistic account of how being observed by others affects individuals decision-making, highlighting the roles of the mPFC and TPJ in simulating social contexts based on individuals beliefs.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

The developing conceptus (embryo and extra-embryonic membranes) secretes factors which modify the endometrium and can be critical for early pregnancy processes such maternal recognition of pregnancy (MRP) and enhancing uterine receptivity to implantation. For example, a competent bovine conceptus secretes IFNT to initiate MRP. The bovine conceptus also secretes other proteins at the time of MRP, including CAPG and PDI, which are highly conserved among placental mammals. We have previously shown that these proteins act upon the endometrium to modulate receptivity, embryo development, and implantation in species with different implantation strategies (humans and cattle). We hypothesise that developing a novel 3D bovine endometrium on a chip system will enhance our understanding of the role of conceptus-derived factors in altering the endometrium and/or ULF secretion. Here we have developed a 3D bovine endometrium on a chip system, comprising both stromal and epithelial cell culture combined with culture medium flow better mimics the in vivo endometrium and exposure to conceptus-derived factors than conventional 2D endometrial cell culture. We have demonstrated that the conceptus-derived proteins CAPG and PDI modulate the endometrial transcriptome and secretory response to promote pathways associated with early pregnancy and alter ULF composition. This work highlights the critical need for more robust and in vivo -like culture systems to study endometrial-conceptus interactions in vitro to further investigate the role of conceptus derived factors for pregnancy success.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe have developed an in vitro 3D bovine endometrium-on-a-chip system comprising both primary stromal cells under static conditions and epithelial cells under flow conditions to mimic the in vivo endometrial environment from the conceptuses perspective. The secretome of the 3D endometrium-on-a-chip was characterised, was found to contain proteins associated with cell adhesion and tissue development, and contained proteins previously identified in in vivo uterine luminal fluid. PDI and CAPG (previously identified conceptus-derived factors) altered the transcriptome and secretome of cells within the system. Exposure to CAPG or PDI altered the secretome of proteins previously identified in pregnant uterine luminal fluid or associated with early pregnancy, and exposure to CAPG or PDI also altered the transcriptome to support processes such as immune response, secretion, proliferation, and adhesion related pathways. This data supports previously published works and highlights the need for the use of more in vivo-like in vitro models to study conceptus-endometrial interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

We have investigated oxygen availability effects on the human lung epithelium using organoids. We find first-trimester lung epithelial progenitors remain undifferentiated under normoxia, but spontaneously differentiate towards multiple airway cell types and inhibit alveolar differentiation under hypoxia. Using chemical and genetic tools, we demonstrate that hypoxia-induced airway differentiation is dependent on HIF (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor) pathways, with HIF1 and HIF2 differentially regulating fate decisions. Transcription factors KLF4 and KLF5 are direct targets of the HIF pathway and promote progenitor differentiation to basal and secretory cells. Chronic hypoxia also induces transdifferentiation of human alveolar type 2 cells to airway cells via the HIF pathway, mimicking alveolar bronchiolization processes in lung disease. Our results reveal roles for hypoxia and HIF signalling during human lung development and have implications for aberrant cell fate decisions in chronic lung diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Our ML surrogate achieves a 95% reduction in computational time when compared to the original WCM.

As a COG-UK partner, Quadram Institute Bioscience (QIB) in Norfolk sequenced over 87,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, contributing to the region becoming densely sequenced. Retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 lineage dynamics in this region may contribute to preparedness for future pandemics. Methods: 29,406 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences and corresponding metadata from Norfolk were extracted from the COG-UK dataset, sampled between March 2020 and December 2022, representing 9.9% of regional COVID-19 cases. Sequences were lineage typed using Pangolin, and subsequent lineage analysis carried out in R using RStudio and related packages, including graphical analysis using ggplot2. Results: 401 global lineages were identified, with 69.8% appearing more than once and 31.2% over ten times. Temporal clustering identified six lineage communities based on first lineage emergence. Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants of concern (VOC) accounted for 8.6%, 34.9% and 48.5% of sequences respectively. These formed four regional epidemic waves alongside the remaining lineages which appeared in the early pandemic prior to VOC designation and were termed pre-VOC lineages. Regional comparison highlighted variability in VOC epidemic wave dates dependent on location. Conclusion: This study is the first to assess SARS-CoV-2 diversity in Norfolk across a large timescale within the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 was both highly diverse and dynamic throughout the Norfolk region between March 2020 - December 2022, with a strong VOC presence within the latter two thirds of the study period. The study also displays the utility of incorporating genomic epidemiological methods into pandemic response.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Recent advances in structural genomics have identified fungal effector families whose members adopt similar folds despite sequence divergence, highlighting their importance in virulence and immune evasion. To extend the scope of comparative structure-guided analysis to more evolutionarily distant phytopathogens with similar lifestyle, we used AlphaFold2 to predict the 3D structures of the secretome from selected plasmodiophorid, oomycete, and fungal gall-forming pathogens. Clustering of protein folds based on structural homology revealed species-specific expansions and a low abundance of known orphan effector families. We identified a nucleoside hydrolase-like fold, structurally homologous to the bacterial effector HopQ1, to be conserved among various gall-forming microbes. We also identified novel sequence-unrelated but structurally similar (SUSS) effector clusters, rich in conserved motifs. Notably, ankyrin proteins were significantly expanded in gall-forming plasmodiophorids, with AlphaFold-Multimer screening revealing the MAP kinase pathway as a major target of these proteins. Altogether, this study advances our understanding of secretome landscapes in gall-forming microbes and provides a valuable resource for broadening structural phylogenomic studies across diverse phytopathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Pallatom directly learns and models the joint distribution P(structure, seq) by focusing on P(all-atom), effectively addressing the interdependence between sequence and structure in protein generation. To achieve this, we propose a novel network architecture specifically designed for all-atom protein generation. Our model employs a dual-track framework that tokenizes proteins into tokenlevel and atomic-level representations, integrating them through a multi-layer decoding process with ""traversing"" representations and recycling mechanism. We also introduce the atom14 representation method, which unifies the description of unknown side-chain coordinates, ensuring high fidelity between the generated all-atom conformation and its physical structure. Experimental results demonstrate that Pallatom excels in key metrics of protein design, including designability, diversity, and novelty, showing significant improvements across the board. Our model not only enhances the accuracy of protein generation but also exhibits excellent training efficiency, paving the way for future applications in larger and more complex systems.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Here, we performed RNA-sequencing on cells expressing the iFFL and utilized DECCODE, an unbiased computational method, to match our data with thousands of drug-induced transcriptional profiles. DECCODE identified compounds that consistently enhance expression of both transiently and stably expressed genetic payloads across various experimental scenarios and cell lines, while also reducing external perturbations on integrated genes.

Number sense, the ability to discriminate the quantity of objects, is crucial for survival. To understand how neurons work together and develop to mediate number sense, we used two-photon fluorescence light sheet microscopy to capture the activity of individual neurons throughout the brain of larval Danio rerio, while displaying a visual number stimulus to the animal. We identified number-selective neurons as early as 3 days post-fertilization and found a proportional increase of neurons tuned to larger quantities after 3 days. We used machine learning to predict the stimulus from the neuronal activity and observed that the prediction accuracy improves with age. We further tested ethanols effect on number sense and found a decrease in number-selective neurons in the forebrain, suggesting cognitive impairment. These findings are a significant step towards understanding neural circuits devoted to discrete magnitudes and our methodology to track single-neuron activity across the whole brain is broadly applicable to other fields in neuroscience.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

How xCas9 expands the DNA targeting capability of Cas9 by recognizing a series of alternative Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequences while ignoring others is unknown. Here, we establish the molecular determinants of xCas9s expanded PAM recognition. We show that while Cas9 enforces strict guanine selection through the rigidity of its interacting arginine dyad, xCas9 modulates the flexibility of R1335 to recognize specific PAM sequences selectively. This modulation confers a pronounced entropic preference for the canonical TGG PAM over SpCas9. Moreover, xCas9 expands PAM recognition by enhancing DNA binding in the early evolution cycles and improving binding to the canonical PAM in the final evolution cycle. This dual capability explains how xCas9 expands PAM recognition while also enhancing recognition of the canonical TGG PAM. These findings will facilitate the engineering of Cas9 variants more effective and specific across a broader spectrum of genetic sequences.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Assessing the diagnostic accuracy of an LLM-based tool on real pediatric cases can help reduce this time, providing quicker diagnoses for patients and their families.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the clinical utility of DxGPT as a support tool for differential diagnosis of both common and rare diseases.

DesignUnicentric descriptive cross-sectional exploratory study. Anonymized data from 50 pediatric patients medical histories, covering common and rare pathologies, were used to generate clinical case notes. Each clinical case included essential data, with some expanded by complementary tests.

SettingThis study was conducted at a reference pediatric hospital, Sant Joan de Deu Barcelona Childrens Hospital.

ParticipantsA total of 50 clinical cases were diagnosed by 78 volunteer doctors (medical diagnostic team) with varying experience, each reviewing 3 clinical cases.

InterventionsEach clinician listed up to five diagnoses per clinical case note. The same was done on the DxGPT web platform, obtaining the Top-5 diagnostic proposals. To evaluate DxGPTs variability, each note was queried three times.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)The study mainly focused on comparing diagnostic accuracy, defined as the percentage of cases with the correct diagnosis, between the medical diagnostic team and DxGPT. Other evaluation criteria included qualitative assessments. The medical diagnostic team also completed a survey on their user experience with DxGPT.

ResultsTop-5 diagnostic accuracy was 65% for clinicians and 60% for DxGPT, with no significant differences. Accuracies for common diseases were higher (Clinicians: 79%, DxGPT: 71%) than for rare diseases (Clinicians: 50%, DxGPT: 49%). Accuracy increased similarly in both groups with expanded information, but this increase was only stastitically significant in clinicians (simple 52% vs. expanded 69%; p=0.03). DxGPTs response variability affected less than 5% of clinical case notes. A survey of 48 clinicians rated the DxGPT platform 3.9/5 overall, 4.1/5 for usefulness, and 4.5/5 for usability.

Conclusions and RelevanceDxGPT showed diagnostic accuracies similar to medical staff from a pediatric hospital, indicating its potential for supporting differential diagnosis in other settings. Clinicians praised its usability and simplicity. These tools could provide new insights for challenging diagnostic cases.

Key Points QuestionIs DxGPT, a large language model-based (LLM-based) tool, effective for differential diagnosis support, specifically in the context of a clinical pediatric setting?

FindingsIn this unicentric cross-sectional study, diagnostic accuracy, measured as the proportion of clinical cases where any of the five diagnostic options included the correct diagnosis, showed comparable results between clinicians and DxGPT. Top-5 accuracy was 65% for clinicians and 60% for DxGPT.

MeaningThese findings highlight the potential of LLM-based tools like DxGPT to support clinicians in making accurate and timely diagnoses, ultimately improving patient care.","NA","medrxiv",1725746796821

Differential health impacts of dietary proteins from various sources are likely driven by differences in their digestibility by the host and subsequent availability to the intestinal microbiota. However, our current understanding regarding the fate of dietary proteins from different sources in the gut, specifically how component proteins within these sources interact with the host and the gut microbiota, is limited. To determine which dietary proteins are efficiently digested by the host and which proteins escape host digestion and are used by the gut microbiota, we used high-resolution mass spectrometry to quantify the proteins that make up different dietary protein sources before and after digestion in germ-free and conventionally raised mice. Contrary to expectation, we detected proteins from all sources in fecal samples of both germ-free and conventional mice suggesting that even protein sources with a high digestive efficiency make it in part to the colon where they can serve as a substrate for the microbiota. Additionally, we found clear patterns where specific component proteins of the dietary protein sources were used as a preferred substrate by the microbiota or were not as accessible to the microbiota. We found that specific proteins with functions that could impact host health and physiology were differentially enriched in germ-free or conventionally raised mice. These findings reveal large differences in the fate of dietary protein from various sources in the gut that could explain some of their differential health impacts.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

By sequencing mRNA during exponential growth and fermentation in synthetic grape must, we identified unique expression patterns linked to the strains originated from wine-related environments. Global expression analysis revealed that anthropized subpopulations, particularly Europe/Domestic-2 and Europe-Mix, exhibited distinct gene expression profiles related to fermentation processes such as glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism. These processes were differentially expressed, along with other important biological processes during fermentation, such as nitrogen and fatty acid metabolism. This study highlights that anthropization has driven metabolic specialization in L. thermotolerans, enhancing traits like lactic acid production, which is a trait of interest in modern winemaking. Correlation analysis further linked lactic acid dehydrogenase genes with key metabolic pathways, indicating adaptive gene expression regulation.

The valproic acid (VPA) rodent model is the most widely used model for the study of idiopathic ASD, but almost all of the studies have used male rodents.

MethodTo fill this knowledge gap, we evaluated sex differences for neuronal activity, morphology, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) signaling in primary cortical (CTX) and hippocampal (HIP) neurons prepared from rats exposed to VPA in utero. In vivo, sex-specific VPA-induced alterations in the frontal CTX transcriptome at birth were also determined.

ResultsOverall, VPA induced more robust changes in neuronal function and structure in the CTX than in the HIP. Male- and female-derived primary CTX neurons from rats exposed to prenatal VPA had elevated activity and showed more disorganized firing. In the HIP, only the female VPA neurons showed elevated firing, while the male VPA neurons exhibited disorganized activity. Dendritic arborization of CTX neurons from VPA rats was less complex in both sexes, though this was more pronounced in the females. Conversely, both female and male HIP neurons from VPA rats showed elevated complexity distal to the soma. Female VPA CTX neurons also had an elevated number of dendritic spines. The relative activity of the  and {beta} isoforms of GSK-3 were suppressed in both female and male VPA CTX neurons, with no changes in the HIP neurons. On postnatal day 0, alterations in CTX genes associated with neuropeptides (e.g., penk, pdyn) and receptors (e.g., drd1, adora2a) were seen in both sexes, though they were downregulated in females and upregulated in males.

LimitationsPrimary neuron studies may not recapitulate findings performed in vivo or at later stages of development.

ConclusionTogether these findings suggest that substantial sex differences in neuronal structure and function in the VPA model may have relevance to the reported sex differences in idiopathic ASD.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Here we demonstrate that USP37 binds the CDC45-MCM-GINS (CMG) helicase, which forms the stable core of the replisome and is regulated by ubiquitylation. The Pleckstrin-Homology Domain of USP37 binds CDC45 and structure-guided mutations that displace USP37 from CMG are sufficient to phenocopy loss of USP37 catalytic activity. Importantly, USP37 counteracts CMG helicase ubiquitylation by the CUL2LRR1 ligase, which induces helicase disassembly during termination. We show that depletion of CUL2LRR1 suppresses the sensitivity of Usp37 mutants to DNA synthesis defects and to ATR checkpoint kinase inhibitors. In contrast, mutation of the TRAIP ubiquitin ligase specifically suppresses the sensitivity of Usp37 mutants to topological stress during chromosome replication. We propose that USP37 evolved to reverse the untimely action of the two ubiquitin ligases that regulate the CMG helicase during chromosome replication in metazoa.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

This was benchmarked against plasma from unvaccinated, SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals (n=24). In addition to this cross-sectional analysis, we performed longitudinal analysis in a subset of individuals (n=34), where paired samples collected 2-4 weeks after a third COVID-19 vaccine dose and after SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection were available. Boruta feature selection and lasso regression models identified a distinct plasma profile in long COVID individuals, characterised by elevated IL-20, HAGH, NAAA, CLEC10A, LXN, and MCP-1 and reduced TRAIL, G-CSF, NBL1, and CCL23 protein concentrations. Notably, longitudinal analysis demonstrated that neither COVID-19 booster vaccination nor breakthrough infection replicated inflammatory and neurology-related plasma protein profiles observed after primary infection suggesting an altered immune response outcome in individuals with long COVID upon re-exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1725746796821

Previous studies assessed the pulsatility index based on blood flow velocity pulsatility in relatively large cerebral arteries of human. Here, we introduce a novel method to quantify the volumetric pulsatility of cerebral microvasculature across cortical layers and in white matter (WM), using high-resolution 4D vascular space occupancy (VASO) MRI with simultaneous recording of pulse signals at 7T. Microvascular volumetric pulsatility index (mvPI) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) changes across cardiac cycles are assessed through retrospective sorting of VASO signals into cardiac phases and estimating mean CBV in resting state (CBV0) by arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI at 7T. Using data from 11 young (28.4{+/-}5.8 years) and 7 older (61.3{+/-}6.2 years) healthy participants, we investigated the aging effect on mvPI and compared microvascular pulsatility with large arterial pulsatility assessed by 4D-flow MRI. We observed the highest mvPI in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on the cortical surface (0.19{+/-}0.06), which decreased towards the cortical layers as well as in larger arteries. In the deep WM, a significantly increased mvPI (p = 0.029) was observed in the older participants compared to younger ones. Additionally, mvPI in deep WM is significantly associated with the velocity pulsatility index (vePI) of large arteries (r = 0.5997, p = 0.0181). We further performed test-retest scans, non-parametric reliability test and simulations to demonstrate the reproducibility and accuracy of our method. To the best of our knowledge, our method offers the first in vivo measurement of microvascular volumetric pulsatility in human brain which has implications for cerebral microvascular health and its relationship research with glymphatic system, aging and neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1725746796821

Surprisingly, this manipulation had no effect on the rate of adaptation. We next used a dual-task methodology to examine the influence of attentional resources on adaptation. Here, again, we found no effect of attention, with the rate of adaptation similar under focused or divided attention conditions. Interestingly, we found that attention modulates adaptation in an indirect manner: Attended stimuli serve as cues that define the context for learning. The rate of adaptation was significantly attenuated when the attended stimulus changed from the end of one trial to the start of the next trial. In contrast, similar changes to unattended stimuli had no impact on adaptation. Together, these results suggest that visual attention defines the cues that establish the context for sensorimotor learning.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

SCRIVENER combines bacterial conjugation, in vivo DNA cutting, and in vivo homologous recombination to seamlessly stitch blocks of DNA together by mating E. coli in large arrays or pools. This workflow is simpler, cheaper, and higher throughput than current DNA assembly approaches that require DNA to be moved in and out of cells at different procedural steps. We perform over 5,000 assemblies with two to 13 DNA blocks that range from 240 bp to 8 kb and show that SCRIVENER is capable of assembling constructs as long as 23 kb at relatively high throughput and fidelity. Most SCRIVENER errors are deletions between long interspersed repeats. However, SCRIVENER can overcome these errors by enabling assembly and sequence verification at high replication at a nominal additional cost per replicate. We show that SCRIVENER can be used to build combinatorial libraries in arrays or pools, and that DNA blocks onboarded into the platform can be repurposed and reused with any other DNA block in high throughput without a PCR step. Because of these features, DNA engineering with SCRIVENER has the potential to accelerate design-build-test-learn cycles of DNA products.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

However, their influence on cognitive performance across early life remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the contribution of common genome-wide and rare exonic variation to cognitive performance across childhood and adolescence primarily using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n=6,495 unrelated children). We show that the effect of common variants associated with educational attainment and cognitive performance increases as children age. Conversely, the negative effect of deleterious rare variants attenuates with age. Using trio analyses, we show that these age-related trends are driven by direct genetic effects on the individual who carries these variants. We further find that the increasing effects of common variants are stronger in individuals at the upper end of the phenotype distribution, whereas the attenuating effects of rare variants are stronger in those at the lower end. Concordant results were observed in the Millenium Cohort Study (5,920 children) and UK Biobank (101,232 adults). The effects of common and rare genetic variation on childhood cognitive performance are broadly comparable in magnitude to those of other factors such as parental educational attainment, maternal illness and preterm birth. The effects of maternal illness and preterm birth on childhood cognitive performance also attenuate with age, whereas the effect of parental educational attainment does not. Furthermore, we show that the relative contribution of these various factors differ depending on whether one considers their contribution to phenotypic variance across the entire population or to the risk of poor outcomes. Our findings may help explain the apparent incomplete penetrance of rare damaging variants associated with neurodevelopmental conditions. More generally, they also show the importance of studying dynamic genetic influences across the life course and their differential effects across the phenotype distribution.","NA","medrxiv",1725746796821

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Evolutionary transitions between sex-chromosome systems-- which change the chromosome pair that determines sex, the system of heterogamety, or both--are frequent in some clades. In others, however, sex chromosome systems show long-term stability. Previous explanations of this stasis rely on evolutionary dynamics peculiar to sex linkage, such as the accumulation of deleterious mutations on the sex-specific chromosome or sexually antagonistic mutations on either sex chromosome. Here, I show that the ordinary operation of stabilizing selection on quantitative traits can, as a by-product, promote stability of sex chromosome systems. The reason is that stabilizing selection on a trait permits individual chromosomes genetic contributions to the trait to drift upwards or downwards, subject only to the constraint that they all sum to the trait optimum. This chromosome-specific drift causes reduced fitness in individuals with unusual chromosomal constitutions, such as the novel sexual genotypes that sex chromosome turnovers always produce. The theory can explain a suite of patterns in the phylogenetic distribution of sex determining systems. Applied to interspecific hybrids, it can also explain two key observations concerning their reduced fitness: Haldanes rule and the large-X effect.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

To enable precision health, it is essential to understand how genetic variants contribute to earlier death or prolonged survival. In this study, we tested the association of common genetic variants and the burden of rare non-synonymous variants in a survival analysis, using age-at-death (N = 35,551, median [min, max] = 72.4 [40.9, 85.2]), and last-known-age (N = 358,282, median [min, max] = 71.9 [52.6, 88.7]), in European ancestry participants of the UK Biobank.

Common variant analysis highlighted three longevity-associated loci: APOE, ZSCAN23, and MUC5B. We identified six genes whose burden of loss-of-function variants is significantly associated with reduced lifespan: TET2, ATM, BRCA2, CKMT1B, BRCA1 and ASXL1. Additionally, in eight genes, the burden of pathogenic missense variants was associated with reduced lifespan: DNMT3A, SF3B1, CHL1, TET2, PTEN, SOX21, TP53 and SRSF2. Most of these genes have previously been linked to oncogenic-related pathways and some are linked to and are known to harbor somatic variants that predispose to clonal hematopoiesis.

However, evidence for predictive coding9-12 and reward sensitivity13-19 in the hippocampal neuronal representation suggests that its role extends beyond purely spatial representation. In fact, it raises the question of what kind of spatial representation is most useful for learning and maximizing future rewards? Here, we track the evolution of reward representation over weeks as mice learn to solve a cognitively demanding reward-based task. Our findings reveal a highly organized restructuring of hippocampal reward representations during the learning process. Specifically, we found multiple lines of evidence, both at the population and single-cell levels, that hippocampal representation becomes predictive of reward over weeks. Namely, both population-level information about reward and the percentage of reward-tuned neurons decrease over time. At the same time, the representation of the animals choice and reward approach period (the period between choice and reward) increased over time. By tracking individual reward cells across sessions, we found that neurons initially tuned for reward shifted their tuning towards choice and reward approach periods, indicating that reward cells backpropagate their tuning to anticipate reward with experience. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of hippocampal representations, highlighting their critical role in learning through the prediction of future outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

While altered ER-associated processes are linked to age-onset pathogenesis, whether shifts in ER morphology underlie these functional changes is unclear. We report that ER remodeling is a conserved feature of the aging process in models ranging from yeast to C. elegans and mammals. Focusing on C. elegans as an exemplar of metazoan aging, we find that as animals age, ER mass declines in virtually all tissues and ER morphology shifts from rough sheets to tubular ER. The accompanying large-scale shifts in proteomic composition correspond to the ER turning from protein synthesis to lipid metabolism. To drive this substantial remodeling, ER-phagy is activated early in adulthood, promoting turnover of rough ER in response to rises in luminal protein-folding burden and reduced global protein synthesis. Surprisingly, ER remodeling is a pro-active and protective response during aging, as ER-phagy impairment limits lifespan in yeast and diverse lifespan-extending paradigms promote profound remodeling of ER morphology even in young animals. Altogether our results reveal ER-phagy and ER morphological dynamics as pronounced, underappreciated mechanisms of both normal aging and enhanced longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Previous studies have identified phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming as early predictors. However, the graphic complexity of Arabic letters imposes particular constraints on the visual system, which should mobilize visual attention. To test this hypothesis, 101 Arabic-speaking children who just began their formal reading instruction in Arabic were administered tests of syllable and word reading. Their nonverbal reasoning, vocabulary, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming and letter knowledge were measured. Their visual attention was estimated through tasks of visual attention span. We found that phonological awareness, visual attention span and letter knowledge were associated with reading outcomes. However, regression analyses showed that the relationship between visual attention span and reading disappeared when letter knowledge was taken-into-account. We used structural equation modeling to examine the direct and indirect effects of visual attention span to reading. Results showed that phonological awareness and letter knowledge were significant and independent predictors of reading while visual attention span contributed only indirectly through its influence on letter knowledge. Our findings suggest that beginning readers rely on visual attention to identify and discriminate visually-complex Arabic letters. In turn, more efficient letter identification in children with higher visual attention facilitates reading acquisition. These findings support the cognitive models of word recognition that include visual attention as a component of the reading system. They open new perspectives for cross-language studies, suggesting that visual attention might contribute differently to reading depending on the orthographic system. They also provide a foundation for innovative teaching methodologies in Arabic language education.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Here, we show that RA breakdown via CYP26B1 is essential for determining RA signaling levels within blastemas. CYP26B1 inhibition molecularly reprograms distal blastemas into a more proximal identity, phenocopying the effects of administering excess RA. We identify Shox as an RA-responsive gene that is differentially expressed between proximally and distally amputated limbs. Ablation of Shox results in shortened limbs with proximal skeletal elements that fail to initiate endochondral ossification. These results suggest that PD positional identity is determined by RA degradation and RA-responsive genes that regulate PD skeletal element formation during limb regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Predictive processing has been repeatedly demonstrated and seemingly explains expectation suppression (ES), or the attenuation of neural activity in response to expected stimuli. However, the mechanisms behind ES are unclear and various models of the mechanisms supporting ES have been suggested with conflicting evidence. Sharpening models propose that expectations suppress neurons that are not tuned to the expected stimulus, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio for expected stimuli. In contrast, dampening models posit that expectations suppress neurons that are tuned to the expected stimuli, increasing the relative response amplitude for unexpected stimuli. Previous studies have used decoding analyses to examine these effects, with increases in decoding accuracy interpreted in terms of sharpening and decreases related to dampening. The opposing process theory (OPT) has suggested that both processes may occur at different time points, namely that initial sharpening is followed by later dampening of the neural representations of the expected stimulus as learning progresses. In this study we aim to test this theory and shed light on the dynamics of expectation effects, both at single trial level and over time. Thirty-one participants completed a statistical learning task consisting of paired scene categories whereby a 'leading' image from one category is quickly followed by a 'trailing' image from a different category. Multivariate EEG analyses focussed on decoding stimulus information related to the trailing image category. Within-trial, decoding analyses showed that stimulus expectation increased decoding accuracy at early latencies and decreased decoding accuracy at later latencies, in line with OPT. However, across trials, stimulus expectation decreased decoding accuracy in initial trials and increased decoding accuracy in later trials. We theorise that these dissociable dynamics of expectation effects within and across trials can be explained in the context of hierarchical learning mechanisms. Our single trial results provide evidence for the OPT, while our results over time suggest that sharpening and dampening effects emerge at different stages of learning.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Addressing this gap, we generated extensive RNA-sequencing data for multiple organs across 22 representative species over the fern phylogeny, assembling high-quality transcriptomes. These data facilitated the construction of a time-calibrated fern phylogeny covering all major clades, revealing numerous whole-genome duplications and highlighting the uniqueness of fern genetics, with half of the uncovered gene families being fern-specific. Our investigation into fern cell walls through biochemical and immunological analyses identified occurrences of the lignin syringyl unit and its independent evolution in ferns. Moreover, the discovery of an unusual sugar in fern cell walls hints at a divergent evolutionary path in cell wall biochemistry, potentially driven by gene duplication and sub-functionalization. We provide an online database preloaded with genomic and transcriptomic data for ferns and other land plants, which we used to identify an independent evolution of lignocellulosic gene modules in ferns. Our data provide a framework for the unique evolutionary path that ferns have navigated since they split from the last common ancestor of euphyllophytes more than 360 million years ago.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

We demonstrate that species-specific transcriptome dynamics are mirrored at the chromatin level, but that the speed of neural differentiation is insensitive to manipulations of cell growth and cycling. Exploiting the single-cell resolution of our data, we identify glycogen storage levels regulated by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2 (UGP2) as a species-dependent trait of pluripotent cells, and show that lowered glycogen storage in UGP2 mutant cells is associated with accelerated neural differentiation.

These factors harbour antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in Pseudomonas species (PIncs). Despite their importance, some PIncs plasmid remain underexplored at the sequence level. This study attempts to address this gap by determining the complete nucleotide sequences of several key plasmids. Using BLAST search and AlphaFold3-based protein structure prediction, we identified replication initiation proteins (RIPs) and origins of vegetative replication (oriV) for these plasmids. Notably, mini-plasmids containing these RIP and oriV sequences successfully replicated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Through pangenome analyses using the PLSDB database with the experimentally identified RIP gene reference, 2,351/59,895 plasmids were classified, and their core and accessory genes, including ARGs, were detected. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of the RIPs with publicly available protein sequences enabled the grouping of existing PIncs into distinct evolutionary lineages, providing a robust framework for identifying RIPs across a broader range of previously uncharacterised plasmids. The RIPs of 8,860 plasmids in the PLSDB were newly assigned. These findings offer crucial insights into the complex landscape of plasmid-mediated ARG dissemination, marking a significant advancement in the understanding of Pseudomonas plasmids across clinical and environmental contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Thousands of ATAC-seq samples have been collected that hold information about chromatin accessibility across diverse cell types and contexts, but most of these are not paired with genetic information and come from diverse distinct projects and laboratories.

ResultsWe report here joint genotyping, chromatin accessibility peak calling, and discovery of quantitative trait loci which influence chromatin accessibility (caQTLs), demonstrating the capability of performing caQTL analysis on a large scale in a diverse sample set without pre-existing genotype information. Using 10,293 profiling samples representing 1,454 unique donor individuals across 653 studies from public databases, we catalog 23,381 caQTLs in total. After joint discovery analysis, we cluster samples based on accessible chromatin profiles to identify context-specific caQTLs. We find that caQTLs are strongly enriched for annotations of gene regulatory elements across diverse cell types and tissues and are often strongly linked with genetic variation associated with changes in expression (eQTLs), indicating that caQTLs can mediate genetic effects on gene expression. We demonstrate sharing of causal variants for chromatin accessibility and diverse complex human traits, enabling a more complete picture of the genetic mechanisms underlying complex human phenotypes.

ConclusionsOur work provides a proof of principle for caQTL calling from previously ungenotyped samples, and represents one of the largest, most diverse caQTL resources currently available, informing mechanisms of genetic regulation of gene expression and contribution to disease.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Here we explore the potential of transcription factor (TF) recognition element arrays as DNA tools for modifying free TF levels in cells and thereby controlling gene expression. We first demonstrate proof-of-concept, showing that Tet TF-binding recognition element (RE) arrays of different lengths can tune gene expression and alter gene circuit performance in a predictable manner. We then open-up the approach to interface with any TF with a known binding site by developing a new method called Cloning Troublesome Repeats in Loops (CTRL) that can assemble plasmids with up to 256 repeats of any RE sequence. Transfection of RE array plasmids assembled by CTRL into mammalian cells show potential to modify host cell gene regulation at longer array sizes by sequestration of the TF of interest. RE array plasmids built using CTRL were demonstrated to target both synthetic and native mammalian TFs, illustrating the ability to use these tools to modulate genetic circuits and instruct cell fate. Together this work advances our ability to assemble repetitive DNA arrays and showcases the use of TF-binding RE arrays as a method for manipulating mammalian gene expression, thus expanding the possibilities for mammalian cell engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Prior to moulting, epidermal tissue peels off from the old cuticle and grows non-uniformly to shape protruding appendages, which are often branching, curving, or twisting, from the planar epidermis. This non-uniform growth is possibly regulated by the distribution of morphogens on the epidermal cell sheet. Previous studies have identified molecules and signalling pathways related to such morphogenesis; however, how local regulation of cell sheet growth can transform planar epidermis globally into complex three-dimensional structures, such as beetle horns, remains unclear. To reveal the relationship between epidermal growth regulation and generated structures, this study theoretically examined how various shapes can be generated from planar epidermis under a deductive growth model that corresponds morphogen distributions to non-uniform growth on tissue. The results show that the heterochronic expression of multiple morphogens can flexibly fuse multiple simple shapes to generate various structures emulating complex appendages of beetles. These findings indicate that morphogenesis through such a mechanism may have developmental stability and modularity, providing insights into the evolution of the diverse morphology of arthropods.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

We have uncovered a sex chromosome in California two-spot octopus (Octopus bimaculoides) in which males/females have ZZ/ZO karyotypes respectively. We show that the octopus Z chromosome is an evolutionary outlier with respect to divergence and repetitive element content as compared to autosomes and that it is present in all cephalopods that we have examined including Nautilus, the outgroup to squids and octopuses. Our results suggest that the cephalopod Z chromosome system originated before the split of all extant cephalopod lineages, over 480 million years ago and has been conserved to the present, making it the among the oldest conserved animal sex chromosome systems known.","NA","biorxiv",1725746796821

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1725746796822
