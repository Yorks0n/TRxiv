In previous work, we predicted a fourth RBD epitope based on allosteric conformational perturbations measured by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) upon complexation with the canonical spike protein target, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). We subsequently identified a pan-neutralizing antibody (ICO-hu104) with the predicted epitope, however, as the epitope was somewhat distant from the hACE2 binding interface, and our previous work limited to the spike RBD, the neutralization mechanism was unclear. Using HDX-MS, we investigated the binding of ICO-hu104 to the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from Wuhan, Delta and Omicron variants. We demonstrate that binding of ICO-hu104 at its epitope results in an increase in deuterium uptake in the distant HR1 domain for variants of concern, which in a biological context could be indicative of destabilisation of the helices within this region, promoting S1 shedding or failure of helical extension during S2-mediated fusion. This is supported by our computational modelling, highlighting propagation of allosteric effects to the S2 coiled-coil region. Collectively, this work demonstrates an alternative neutralization mechanism for ICO-hu104 which is distinct from its first-generation predecessors and thus opens alternative avenues targeting non-RBD epitopes through assessment of allosteric perturbations.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of long COVID on working memory using a single rapid online anonymous survey and working memory quiz. We analyzed working memory scores in relation to long COVID status (clinically diagnosed, self-reported, and non-long COVID), age, number of COVID-19 infections and long COVID duration, and subjective ratings of brain fog severity and overall life impact of symptoms. The study recruited 1064 participants aged 16 to over 85 years (83% from the United Kingdom) with 39% reporting long COVID. The results demonstrate that long COVID significantly impairs working memory, with the greatest deficits observed in clinically diagnosed cases. In addition, we found that working memory declined with age and multiple COVID-19 infections particularly in the diagnosed long COVID group. Moreover, individuals in the diagnosed long COVID group reported experiencing the most severe brain fog and the greatest impact of long COVID symptoms on their lives, and both of these factors were strongly correlated with lower memory scores. Participants who had been living with long COVID for a longer duration had lower memory scores. However, this relationship was likely influenced by the SARS-CoV-2 variant, as individuals with prolonged long COVID symptoms were more likely to have been infected with earlier variants (alpha and wild-type) which are linked to more severe disease outcomes. Our results suggest that long COVID is associated with significant working memory impairments, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions and support strategies for those with long COVID to address memory problems.","NA","medrxiv",1738447547796

However, excessive NET formation may damage organs during sepsis. We investigated the association between NETs and sepsis outcomes, including mortality and acute kidney injury (AKI).

MethodsWe analysed levels of H3.1 nucleosomes in 971 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock from the SISPCT trial (Effect of Sodium Selenite Administration and Procalcitonin-Guided Therapy on Mortality in Patients With Severe Sepsis or Septic Shock). We evaluated associations between H3.1 levels and mortality and the need for renal replacement therapy using multivariable Cox regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses.

ResultsWe analysed 971 critically ill patients with complete data including admission H3.1 levels. 443 patients (45.6%) presented with sepsis, 520 (53.6%) had septic shock, and eight patients had an unknown diagnosis as defined by Sepsis-3. Admission H3.1 levels were higher in patients with septic shock than with sepsis (median 921.84 vs 432.71 ng/mL; p<0.001). Admission H3.1 levels were higher in non-survivors, and in a univariate Cox analysis, each log-10 increase in H3.1 was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.86 (95% confidence interval 1.41-2.47, p<0.05). H3.1 was also higher in patients requiring renal replacement therapy with septic shock vs sepsis (1832 ng/mL vs 801.4 ng/mL, p=0.01) and demonstrated a dose-response relationship with the severity of AKI.

ConclusionElevated levels of H3.1 nucleosomes at admission are independently associated with mortality and severe kidney dysfunction requiring renal replacement therapy.

This is largely a consequence of the inherent biological and technical variation that cannot be captured with small numbers of replicates. When thresholds for p-values and log fold changes are introduced, this variability can propagate an incomplete description of the data, leading to differing interpretations. Here, we compare traditional binary DEG classification with a rank-based method, grounded in Bayesian statistics, using a published yeast dataset comprising over 40 replicates. This analysis reveals how the choice of thresholds and number of replicates results in discrepancies between studies and potentially interesting genes being overlooked. Furthermore, by comparing wild-type with wild-type samples, we show how variability in gene expression can be mistaken for differential expression. Evaluating current practices for navigating the accuracy-error trade-off in the search for differentially expressed genes leads us to advocate rank-based methods and Bayesian statistics to mitigate the limitations of binary classifications and communicate uncertainty.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

A proper error analysis for time series data leads to significantly wider confidence intervals than the official evaluation. In addition to vaccination and seasonality, only few NPIs - such as restrictions in public spaces - can be confidently associated with variations in [R](t), but even then effect sizes have large uncertainties. Furthermore, due to multicollinearity in NPI activation patterns, it is difficult to distinguish potential effects of NPIs in public spaces from other interventions that came into force early, such as physical distancing. In future, NPIs should be more carefully designed and accompanied by plans for data collections to allow for a timely evaluation of benefits and harms as a basis for an effective and proportionate response.","NA","medrxiv",1738447547796

Here, we present the discovery and engineering of NanoCas, an ultracompact CRISPR nuclease capable of extending CRISPR's reach in vivo beyond liver targets. We experimentally screened 176 ultracompact CRISPR systems found in metagenomic data and applied protein engineering approaches to enhance the editing efficiency of NanoCas. The optimized NanoCas exhibits potent editing capabilities across various cell systems and tissues in vivo when administered via adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. This is accomplished despite NanoCas being approximately one-third the size of conventional CRISPR nucleases. In proof-of-concept experiments, we observed robust editing with our optimized NanoCas in mouse models targeting Pcsk9, a gene involved in cholesterol regulation, and targeting exon splice sites in dystrophin to address Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mutations. We further tested the efficacy of our NanoCas system in vivo in non-human primates (NHPs) resulting in editing levels above 30% in muscle tissues. The compact size of NanoCas, in combination with robust nuclease editing, opens the door for single-AAV editing of non-liver tissues in vivo, including the use of newer editing modalities such as reverse transcriptase (RT) editing, base editing, and epigenetic editing.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

Coinfection is restricted by a mechanism known as superinfection exclusion (SIE), which prohibits the infection of a previously infected cell by a related virus after a period of time. SIE regulates coinfection for many different viruses, but its relevance to the infection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was unknown. In this study, we investigated this using a pair of SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses encoding distinct fluorescent reporter proteins. We show for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 coinfection of individual cells is limited temporally by SIE. We defined the kinetics of the onset of SIE for SARS-CoV-2 in this system, showing that the potential for coinfection starts to diminish within the first hour of primary infection, and then falls exponentially as the time between the two infection events is increased. We then asked how these kinetics would affect the potential for coinfection with viruses during a spreading infection. We used plaque assays to model the localised spread of SARS-CoV-2 observed in infected tissue, and showed that the kinetics of SIE restrict coinfection, and therefore sites of possible genetic exchange, to a small interface of infected cells between spreading viral infections. This indicates that SIE, by reducing the likelihood of coinfection of cells, likely reduces the opportunities for genetic exchange between different strains of SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is an underappreciated factor in shaping SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

However, when activated by WISH/DIP/SPIN90 family proteins, Arp2/3 nucleates linear actin filaments. Unexpectedly, we found that human SPIN90 is a dimer that can nucleate bidirectional actin filaments. To understand the basis for this, we determined a 3 [A] resolution structure of human SPIN90-Arp2/3 complex nucleating actin filaments. Our structure shows that SPIN90 dimerises via a 3-helix bundle and interacts with two Arp2/3 complexes. Each SPIN90 molecule binds both Arp2/3 complexes to promote their activation. Our analysis demonstrates that single filament nucleation by Arp2/3 is mechanistically more like branch formation than previously appreciated. The dimerisation domain in SPIN90 orthologues is conserved in metazoans, suggesting that this mode of bidirectional nucleation is a common strategy to generate anti-parallel actin filaments.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

Fine-mapping of such variants has become a priority and since most associations are located within regulatory regions, it is also assumed that they colocalize with regulatory variants that influence the expression of nearby genes. Here we examine these assumptions by using a moderate throughput expression CROPseq protocol in which Cas9 nuclease is used to induce small insertions and deletions across the credible set of SNPs that may account for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for genes associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Of the 4,384 SNPs targeted in 88 loci (an average of 50 per locus), 439 were significant and further examined for validation. From these, 98 significantly altered target gene expression in HL-60 myeloid cell line, 74 in induced macrophages from these HL-60 cells, and 78 in induced neutrophils for a total of 201 validated effects (46%), 43 of which were observed in at least two of the cell types. Considering the observed sensitivity and specificity of the controls, we estimate that there are at least 150 true positives per cell type, an average of almost 2.4 for each of the 64 eQTL for which putative causal variants have been fine-mapped. This implies that haplotype effects are likely to explain many of the associations. We also demonstrate that the same approach can be used to investigate the activity of very rare variants in regulatory regions for 89 genes, providing a rapid strategy for establishing clinical relevance of non-coding mutations.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

Alternative transcription start site usage generates two isoforms of BNT1: BNT1.2, which is targeted to the plastid envelope via an N-terminal signal-anchored mechanism, and BNT1.1, which resides in the cytoplasm. Moreover, BNT1.2 is predominantly expressed in epidermal cells, where it localizes to the so-called sensory plastids. Functional analysis revealed that bnt1 mutants exhibit compromised PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) responses, including impaired callose deposition and reduced flg22-induced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, while flg22-induced apoplastic reactive oxygen species production remains unaffected. Notably, only the plastid-localized BNT1.2 isoform is required for these PTI responses.

In the current study, we evaluated the relative contributions of action, agent, and scene features in predicting cortical activity while participants viewed a 1-hour nature documentary. We tested four sets of model features: semantic vectors capturing the observed action, agent, and scene features derived from an annotation of the stimulus, as well as low-level visual motion-energy features. We used banded ridge regression to fit vertex-wise encoding models from the combination of all four sets of features. While each set of features predicted neural activity in the expected areas, the action features predicted more widespread activity. A variance partitioning analysis revealed that the action features captured the most unique variance in neural activity across ten times as many cortical vertices as the agent or scene features. Our findings suggest that cortical activity during dynamic, natural vision is dominated by features for understanding the actions of others.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

Efforts have been made to experimentally define the escape mutations from specific antibodies in specific viral strains, but it remains unclear how much the effects of mutations on neutralization differ among HIV strains. Here, we use pseudovirus deep mutational scanning to comprehensively map escape mutations from the V3 loop targeting antibody 10-1074 and the CD4-binding site targeting antibody 3BNC117 for both a clade A (BF520) and a clade B (TRO.11) HIV Envelope (Env). Mutations that escape neutralization by antibody 10-1074 are largely similar for the two Envs, but mutations that escape 3BNC117 differ greatly between Envs. Some differences in the effects of mutations on escape between Envs can be explained by strain-to-strain variation in mutational tolerance or glycosylation patterns, but other mutations have different effects on escape for unclear reasons. Overall, the extent that measurements of mutational effects on antibody neutralization can be generalized across HIV strains differs among antibodies.

ImportanceBroadly neutralizing antibodies are promising candidates as prophylactics and therapeutics for HIV.

Increasingly that goal is understood as requiring huge numbers of people to be sequenced from every broadly-defined genetic ancestry group, so as not to miss ""ancestry-specific variants."" Here, we argue that this focus is unwarranted. We start with first principles considerations, based on models of mutation-drift-selection balance, which suggest highly pathogenic mutations should be at similarly low frequencies across ancestry groups. Severe disease mutations tend to be strongly deleterious, and thus evolutionarily young, and are kept at relatively constant frequency through recurrent mutation. Therefore, highly pathogenic alleles are shared identical by descent within extended families, not broad ancestry groups, and sequencing more people should yield similar numbers regardless of ancestry. We illustrate these points using gnomAD genetic ancestry groupings, and show that the classes of variants most likely to be highly pathogenic, notably sets of loss of function alleles at strongly constrained genes, conform well to these predictions. While there are many important reasons to diversify genomic research, strongly deleterious alleles will be found at comparable rates in people of all ancestries, and the information they provide about human biology is shared across ancestries.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

This approach enables the quantification of relative lipid densities in membrane nanodomains. We find differential partitioning of sphingomyelin into intraluminal vesicles, recycling tubules, and the boundary membrane of the early endosome, representing a degree of nanoscale organization previously observed only for proteins. We anticipate that our Lipid-CLEM workflow will greatly facilitate the mechanistic analysis of lipid functions in cell biology, allowing for the simultaneous investigation of proteins and lipids during membrane nanodomain assembly and function.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

FER is required for the perception of endogenous RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides to control various aspects of plant growth, development and immunity. RALFs are perceived by FER-LORELEI-LIKE GPI-ANCHORED PROTEIN (LLG) heterocomplexes to induce cellular responses and bind to LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT EXTENSIN (LRX) proteins as structural components of the cell wall. We show that FER`s RALF ligands are necessary for full success of powdery mildew colonization. Our data reveals that LLGs and LRXs are also powdery mildew susceptibility factors, and that the susceptibility function of RALFs is best explained by a combination of peptide signalling and cell wall-related effects. We further reveal that cell wall and apoplastic pH homeostasis, hallmark features of RALF function, support powdery mildew reproductive success. The function of host RALF peptides is underlined by the fact that, in contrast to previously described pathogens that hijack FER for colonization, powdery mildew fungi do not produce functional RALF mimics. Surprisingly, RALF-dependent powdery mildew pathogenesis is partially independent of FER. The resistance phenotype of ralf and fer mutants is not associated with de-regulated salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signalling, important defense-related phytohormones. Collectively, powdery mildew fungi require RALF signalling for apoplastic pH regulation and cell wall structural organization for successful colonization, highlighting a novel mechanism for host susceptibility by obligate biotrophic fungi.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

Whilst aspects of quantitative agreement have been achieved for flat monolayers, the most striking features of tissue morphogenesis -- such as symmetry breaking, folding and invagination -- concern surfaces with complex curved geometries. As yet, however, characterizing such complex behaviors in three dimensions has been frustrated due to the absence of proper image analysis methods; current state-of-the-art methods almost exclusively rely on two-dimensional (2D) intensity projections of multiple image planes, which superimpose data and lose geometric information that can be crucial. Here, we describe an analysis pipeline that properly captures the nematic order of tissue surfaces of arbitrary geometry, which we demonstrate in the context of in vitro multicellular aggregates, and in vivo zebrafish hearts. For the former, we correlate the number of topological defects with the aggregates surface area and verify theoretical predictions, whilst for the latter, we link biological properties to physical concepts (Laplace pressure) through spatio-temporal correlations of the heart geometry with fluorescence signals of intracellular proteins.

Here we report the synthesis and chemical proteomic characteri-zation of stereoprobes bearing a P(V)-oxathiaphospholane (OTP) reactive group. ABPP experiments identified numerous proteins in human cancer cells that showed stereoselective reactivity with OTP stereoprobes, and we confirmed several of these liganding events with recombinant proteins. OTP stereoprobes engaging the poorly characterized transmembrane protein TLCD1 impaired the incorporation of monounsaturated fatty acids into phosphatidylethanolamine lipids in cells, a lipidomic phenotype that mirrored genetic disruption of this protein. Using AlphaFold2, we found that TLCD1 structurally resembles the ceramide synthase and fatty acid elongase families of coenzyme A-dependent lipid processing enzymes. This structural similarity included conservation of catalytic histidine residues, the muta-tion of which blocked the OTP stereoprobe reactivity and lipid remodeling activity of recombinant TLCD1. Taken together, these data indicate that TLCD1 acts as a lipid acyltransferase in cells, and that OTP stereoprobes function as inhibitors of this enzymatic activity. Our findings thus illuminate how the chemical proteomic analysis of electrophilic compounds can facilitate the functional annotation and chemical inhibition of a key lipid metabolic enzyme in human cells.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

More education was associated with better memory, larger intracranial volume and slightly larger volume of memory-sensitive brain regions. However, education did not protect against age-related decline or weakened effects of brain decline on cognition. The most parsimonious explanation for the results is that the associations reflect factors present early in life, including propensity of individuals with certain traits to pursue more education. While education has numerous benefits, the notion that it provides protection against cognitive or brain decline is not supported.","NA","medrxiv",1738447547796

Bivalves, a diverse class of molluscs with a variety of reproductive modes, represent an ideal yet challenging clade for investigating SD and the evolution of sexual systems. However, the absence of a comprehensive framework has limited progress in this field, particularly regarding the study of sex-determination related genes (SRGs). In this study, we performed a genome-wide sequence evolutionary analysis of the Dmrt, Sox, and Fox gene families in more than 40 bivalve species. For the first time, we provide an extensive and phylogenetic-aware dataset of these SRGs, and we find support to the hypothesis that Dmrt-1L and Sox-H may act as primary sex-determining genes, by showing their high levels of sequence diversity within the bivalve genomic context. To validate our findings, we studied the same gene families in two well-characterized systems, mammals and Drosophila. In the former, we found that the male sex-determining gene Sry exhibits a pattern of amino acid sequence diversity similar to that of Dmrt-1L and Sox-H in bivalves, consistent with its role of master SD regulator. In contrast, no such pattern was observed among genes of the fruit fly SD cascade, which is controlled by a chromosomic mechanism. Overall, our findings highlight similarities in the sequence evolution of some mammal and bivalve SRGs, possibly driven by a comparable architecture of SD cascades. This work underscores once again the importance of employing a comparative approach when investigating understudied and non-model systems.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

Yet, even isogenic cells in a homogenous environment show heterogeneity in their intracellular ""cell-state"", as well as their response to extracellular signals. Here, we aimed to better understand this relation between these phenomena by investigating how information flows through the EGF-receptor centered network upon targeted drug treatment, and how this is affected by cell-to-cell-state differences. Using single-cell ID-seq, we profiled the cell-state and signaling activity of primary human epidermal stem cells by measuring 69 (phospho-)proteins upon inhibition of the Erk/MAPK (p90RSK) and Akt/mTOR (p70S6K) routes downstream of the EGF pathway. We found that the effects of drug treatment propagated from the EGF-signaling pathway to other connected parts of the cellular signaling network, indicating altered signaling flow. We identified nine distinct cell-states that show pervasive state-dependent drug-responses for many (phospho-)proteins. Computational modeling of the signaling network using single-cell Comparative Network Reconstruction showed that many interactions between phospho-proteins (i.e. network wiring) were quantitatively different between cell-states. Furthermore, (phospho-)proteins with a cell-state dependent drug response, were more likely to be involved in interactions that showed a cell-state dependent strength. Overall, our results indicate that drug treatment response and signaling interactions between proteins are closely related and modulated by cell-state.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

Here, we fine-tune the mechanical environment of murine gastruloids, three-dimensional in vitro models of early embryogenesis, by embedding them in bioinert hydrogels with precisely tunable stiffness and timing of application. This approach reveals that external constraints can selectively influence transcriptional profiles, patterning, or morphology, depending on the level and timing of mechanical modulation. Gastruloids embedded in ultra-soft hydrogels (< 30 Pa) elongate robustly, preserving both anteroposterior patterning and transcriptional profiles. In contrast, embedding at higher stiffness disrupts polarization while leaving gene expression largely unaffected. Conversely, earlier embedding significantly impacts transcriptional profiles independently of polarization defects, highlighting the uncoupling of patterning and transcription. These findings suggest that distinct cellular states respond differently to external constraints. Live imaging and cell tracking demonstrate that impaired cell motility underlies polarization defects, underscoring the role of mechanical forces in shaping morphogenesis independently of transcriptional changes. By allowing precise control over external mechanical boundaries, our approach provides a powerful platform to dissect how physical and biochemical factors interact to orchestrate early embryonic development.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

While significant advances have been made in elucidating the anterior-posterior (AP) axis patterning across well-studied bilaterian lineages, our understanding of the conservation of AP-patterning gene expression in underexplored protostomes with a phylogenetically informative position remains limited. Chaetognaths, a group of marine invertebrates, form a clade with Gnathifera as a sister to the remaining Lophotrochozoa, occupying an early-diverging branch of the spiralian lineage. Their phylogenetic position provides potentially valuable evolutionary insights into whether the AP patterning reflects conserved bilaterian mechanisms or reveals distinct lineage-specific adaptations. Here, we investigate the expression patterns of anterior nervous system markers (otx, nk2.1, six3/6) and Hox genes in post-embryonic stages of the chaetognath Spadella cephaloptera using fluorescence whole-mount in situ hybridization. We identify expression domains of anterior-patterning genes in the cerebral ganglion and head structures, consistent with their conserved role in anterior central nervous system (CNS) specification in bilaterians. Additionally, we describe a staggered expression pattern of Hox genes, including previously undescribed central (Sce-med6) and posterior class (Sce-postC and Sce-postD), along the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and post-anal tail. Our results demonstrate that chaetognaths exhibit the most extensive repertoire of Hox genes among protostomes, within metazoans only surpassed by chordates. All AP patterning genes are expressed in a staggered manner, with Hox gene expression absent in the head region. This pattern resembles the conserved expression profile inferred for the last common bilaterian ancestor and is only rudimentarily visible in other spiralians, including annelids and mollusks. Posterior Hox genes including the newly discovered postC and postD genes are absent in the hitherto investigated gnathiferan sister groups such as rotifers. The absence of a postanal tail in rotifers and other gnathiferans, combined with the expression of posterior Hox genes in the elongated postanal tail region, suggests their involvement in the formation of this unique chaetognath structure. Posterior flexibility of Hox genes, as previously hypothesized for chordates, likely contributed to the formation of the chaetognath tail during the early Cambrian period.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

Here, we introduce FastCCC, a permutation-free framework that enables scalable, robust, and reference-based analysis for identifying critical CCCs and uncovering biological insights. FastCCC relies on fast Fourier transformation-based convolution to compute p-values analytically without permutations, introduces a modular algebraic operation framework to capture a broad spectrum of CCC patterns, and can leverage atlas-scale single cell references to enhance CCC analysis on user-collected datasets. To support routine reference-based CCC analysis, we constructed the first human CCC reference panel, encompassing 19 distinct tissue types, over 450 unique cell types, and approximately 16 million cells. We demonstrate the advantages of FastCCC across multiple datasets, most of which exceed the analytical capabilities of existing CCC methods. In real datasets, FastCCC reliably captures biologically meaningful CCCs, even in highly complex tissue environments, including differential interactions between endothelial and immune cells linked to COVID-19 severity, dynamic communications in thymic tissue during T-cell development, as well as distinct interactions in reference-based CCC analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

In the Drosophila circadian clock network, the four pairs of small ventral lateral neurons (sLNvs) serve as main pacemakers. Peptidergic communication via sLNv, which release the key output neuropeptide, Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF), has been well characterized. In the absence of PDF, flies become largely arrhythmic, similar to the phenotype associated with the loss of the mammalian circadian peptide, VIP. In contrast, little is known about the role of the synaptic connections that sLNvs form with downstream neurons. Connectomic analyses revealed that despite their role as key pacemaker neurons within the clock network, the sLNvs form very few monosynaptic connections with other clock neurons. However, they form strong synaptic connections with a small group of previously uncharacterized neurons, SLP316, which in turn synapse onto dorsal clock neurons. Here, we show that silencing SLP316 neurons via tetanus toxin (TNT) expression shortens the free-running period, whereas hyper-exciting them by expressing the constitutively open Na[+] channel, NaChBac, results in period lengthening. Under light-dark cycles, silencing SLP316 neurons also causes lower daytime activity and higher daytime sleep, likely due to increased sleep pressure. Our results revealed that the main postsynaptic partners of the Drosophila pacemaker neurons are a non-clock neuronal cell type that regulates the timing of sleep and activity.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

The estrogen-related receptor (ERR) subfamily of orphan nuclear receptors are major transcriptional regulators of metabolism. In mammals, ERRs have roles in regulating mitochondrial biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, as well as stem cell maintenance. The sole Drosophila ERR ortholog promotes larval growth by establishing a metabolic state during the latter half of embryogenesis. In addition, ERR is required in adult Drosophila males to coordinate glycolytic metabolism with lipid synthesis and within the testis to regulate spermatogenesis gene expression and fertility. Despite extensive work characterizing of the role of ERR in Drosophila metabolism, whether ERR has a conserved requirement in regulating stem cell behavior has been understudied. To determine whether ERR regulates stem cell activity in Drosophila, we used the established adult female germline stem cell (GSC) lineage as a model. We found that whole-body ERR knockout in adult females using conditional heat shock-driven FLP-FRT recombination significantly reduces egg production and decreases GSC number. In addition, we found that ERR activity is required cell-autonomously in the adult female germline for maintenance of GSCs; whereas ERR regulation of GSCs is independent of its activity in adult female adipocytes. Our results highlight an ancient and conserved role for ERRs in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal.

SUMMARYTissue function and regeneration are dependent on stem cell populations, which relies on the coordination of energy homeostasis between multiple tissues within an organism. Zike et al report that the estrogen-related receptor (ERR) is required in adult Drosophila females to maintain germline stem cell number in the ovary to promote egg production. Furthermore, ERR regulation of stem cell maintenance is dependent on its cell autonomous role in the germline, but not through adipocyte-specific ERR activity. These findings demonstrate that the sole Drosophila ERR has a conserved role in regulating stem cell lineages (similar as the mammalian ERR{beta} ortholog) and can be used as a model to understand regulation of stem cell lineages as well as metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

This switch is ""flipped"" by the expression of genes that promote male- or female-specific development. Many lineages have evolved sex chromosomes that act as primary signals for sex determination. However, haplodiploidy (males are haploid and females are diploid), which occurs in ca. 12% of animal species, is incompatible with sex chromosomes. Haplodiploid taxa must, therefore, rely on other strategies for sex determination. One mechanism, ""complementary sex determination"" (CSD), uses heterozygosity as a proxy for diploidy. In CSD, heterozygosity at a sex determination locus triggers female development, while hemizygosity or homozygosity permits male development. CSD loci have been mapped in honeybees and two ant species, but we know little about their evolutionary history. Here, we investigate sex determination in the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi. We identified a 46kb candidate CSD locus at which all females are heterozygous, but diploid males are homozygous for either allele. As expected for CSD loci, the candidate locus has more alleles than most other loci, resulting in a peak of nucleotide diversity. This peak negligibly affects the amino acid sequences of protein-coding genes, suggesting that heterozygosity of a non-coding genomic sequence triggers female development. This locus is distinct from the CSD locus in honeybees but homologous to a CSD locus mapped in two distantly related ant species, implying that this molecular mechanism has been conserved since a common ancestor that lived approximately 112 million years ago.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

The scanning statistics in selection studies are often too complicated to theoretically derive a genome-wide significance level or empirically validate control of the family-wise error rate (FWER). By modeling the autocorrelation of identity-by-descent (IBD) rates, we propose a computationally efficient method to determine genome-wide significance levels in an IBD-based scan for recent positive selection. In whole genome simulations, we show that our method has approximate control of the FWER and can adapt to the spacing of tests along the genome. We also show that these scans can have more than fifty percent power to reject the null model in hard sweeps with a selection coefficient s >= 0.01 and a sweeping allele frequency between twenty-five and seventy-five percent. A few human genes and gene complexes have statistically significant excesses of IBD segments in thousands of samples of African, European, and South Asian ancestry groups from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine project and the United Kingdom Biobank. Among the significant loci, many signals of recent selection are shared across ancestry groups. One shared selection signal at a skeletal cell development gene is extremely strong in African ancestry samples.

Conventional genetic and biochemical approaches aimed at identifying ligand-receptor pairs in plant immunity have been limited by the vast diversity of potential ligand molecules and functional redundancy of putative receptors. Here, we developed a high-throughput screening pipeline that simultaneously examines multiple interactions between plant cell wall-derived glycans and >350 extracellular domains (ECDs) of receptor kinases and receptor like proteins in Arabidopsis, resulting in the screening of >40,000 interactions. We discovered a group of leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases named ARMs (AWARENESS of RG-I MAINTENANCES) that interact with rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I), a major component of pectin. RG-I treatment induced pattern-triggered immunity responses, with distinct kinetics compared to oligogalacturonide responses.

Early-life stress can have severe and lifelong effects on Darwinian fitness. Indeed, it is well established that being reared in a larger brood impairs growth and fitness prospects of birds, but the mechanistic underpinnings of this effect are still largely unknown. Specifically, it is not well known to what extent the reduced growth and fitness prospects of nestlings reared in large broods is due to increased resource allocation to competition versus a per capita reduction in parental provisioning rate, or a combination of the two. We cross-fostered zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) chicks into small and large broods, and recorded their growth as well as the behavior of parents and offspring throughout the nestling period. As in previous experiments, growth rate was higher in small broods. In large broods, chicks begged more and parents invested more time feeding which more than compensated for the difference in brood size. We therefore conclude that the lower growth rate for nestlings raised in large broods must be attributed to increased energy expenditure on begging rather than a reduction in the amount of food received. These results suggest significant energetic costs associated with begging and raise the interesting possibility that brood size would not have negatively affected growth in large broods if chicks had not increased their begging effort due to increased levels of competition in nest.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

Traditionally, research has largely focused on Radial Glial Cells (RGCs), which produce neurons and glia. However, recent findings revealed that the progenitor landscape is more complex and heterogeneous than previously understood. Emerging evidence indicates that NG2 glia, also known as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), may contribute to generating other cell types, including neurons and astrocytes. This suggests that NG2 glia, or a specific subset, may act as multipotent NPCs, expanding their role in brain development beyond their known lineage.

We explore the cellular, molecular, and functional differences between NG2- and GFAP- expressing progenitors (NG2-NPCs and GFAP-NPCs) across different developmental stages. Using in-utero electroporation and StarTrack technology, we examined whether these progenitors represent distinct populations and analyzed how their differences influence their functional roles based on cell fate decisions. Our findings uncover functional divergence between NG2-NPCs and GFAP-NPCs, particularly regarding their cell fate decisions. While both populations contribute to the formation of neurons and glial cells, the progeny of NG2-NPCs and GFAP-NPCs differ markedly in their contributions to neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Further, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of NG2-NPCs and GFAP-NPCs to elucidate the molecular basis for these functional differences. This study demonstrates distinct gene expression profiles. While NG2-NPCs show enrichment for genes associated with neurogenesis and synaptic transport, GFAP-NPCs displayed upregulation of genes involved in progenitor cell maintenance. This indicates that each progenitor type is governed by distinct molecular programs, shaping their contributions to brain architecture and function. In summary, our findings underscore the divergent roles of NG2-NPCs and GFAP-NPCs in driving cellular diversity and functional maturation in brain development, providing new insights into how these progenitor populations contribute to neural diversity and brain function.

We trained macaque monkeys to perform an oculomotor version of the n-back task, in which the animals were required to remember the location of serially presented visual stimuli and generate a saccade to the location of the most recent or previous stimulus according to the instructions. We found that many neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex showed transient activity when the memory of a particular stimulus location was no longer needed, whereas other neurons showed sustained activity when the stimulus location was maintained in memory. Decoding analysis successfully predicted future target selection from neuronal activity, indicating that these neuronal populations contain sufficient information to guide behavior. Furthermore, electrical stimulation applied to recording sites during the task erased specific spatial memories, suggesting that these neurons are causally involved in the retention of short-term memories and their dynamic control.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

Animal studies have shown that intracortical myelin consolidates neural circuits to close periods of plasticity. Here, we use quantitative myelin imaging collected from youth (ages 10-32 years) at ultra-high field (7T) to investigate whether deep and superficial PFC layers exhibit different timeframes of plasticity. We find that myelin matures along a deep-to-superficial axis in the PFC; this axis of maturational timing is expressed to a different extent in cytoarchitecturally distinct regions along the frontal cortical hierarchy. By integrating myelin mapping with electroencephalogram and cognitive phenotyping, we provide evidence that deep and superficial prefrontal myelin dissociably impact timescales of neural activity, task learning rates, and cognitive processing speed. Heterochronous maturation across deep and superficial layers is an underrecognized mechanism through which association cortex balances cognitively-relevant increases in circuit stability and efficiency with extended neuroplasticity.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

To begin to understand how Mtb survives aerosolization, we mimicked liquid and atmospheric conditions experienced by Mtb before and after exhalation using a model aerosol fluid (MAF) based on the water-soluble, lipidic and cellular constituents of necrotic tuberculosis lesions. MAF induced drug tolerance in Mtb, remodeled its transcriptome and protected Mtb from dying in microdroplets desiccating in air. Yet survival was not passive: Mtb appeared to rely on hundreds of genes to survive conditions associated with transmission. Essential genes subserving proteostasis offered most protection. A large number of conventionally nonessential genes appeared to contribute as well, including genes encoding proteins that resemble anti-desiccants. The candidate transmission survival genome of Mtb may offer opportunities to reduce transmission of tuberculosis.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

However, only a minority of patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) benefit from ICI, and the determinants of response remain largely unknown. To better understand the factors influencing patient outcome, we assembled a longitudinal cohort with tissue from multiple timepoints, including primary tumor, pre-treatment metastatic tumor, and on-treatment metastatic tumor from 117 patients treated with ICI (nivolumab) in the phase II TONIC trial. We used highly multiplexed imaging to quantify the subcellular localization of 37 proteins in each tumor. To extract meaningful information from the imaging data, we developed SpaceCat, a computational pipeline that quantifies features from imaging data such as cell density, cell diversity, spatial structure, and functional marker expression. We applied SpaceCat to 678 images from 294 tumors, generating more than 800 distinct features per tumor. Spatial features were more predictive of patient outcome, including features like the degree of mixing between cancer and immune cells, the diversity of the neighboring immune cells surrounding cancer cells, and the degree of T cell infiltration at the tumor border. Non-spatial features, including the ratio between T cell subsets and cancer cells and PD-L1 levels on myeloid cells, were also associated with patient outcome. Surprisingly, we did not identify robust predictors of response in the primary tumors. In contrast, the metastatic tumors had numerous features which predicted response. Some of these features, such as the cellular diversity at the tumor border, were shared across timepoints, but many of the features, such as T cell infiltration at the tumor border, were predictive of response at only a single timepoint. We trained multivariate models on all of the features in the dataset, finding that we could accurately predict patient outcome from the pre-treatment metastatic tumors, with improved performance using the on-treatment tumors. We validated our findings in matched bulk RNA-seq data, finding the most informative features from the on-treatment samples. Our study highlights the importance of profiling sequential tumor biopsies to understand the evolution of the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the temporal and spatial dynamics underlying patient responses and underscoring the need for further research on the prognostic role of metastatic tissue and its utility in stratifying patients for ICI.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

In areas with lower UV radiation, light pigmentation alleles increased in frequency because of their adaptive advantage and of other contingent factors such as migration and drift. However, the tempo and mode of their spread is not known. Phenotypic inference from ancient DNA is complicated, both because these traits are polygenic, and because of low sequence depth. We evaluated the effects of the latter by randomly removing reads in two high-coverage ancient samples, the Paleolithic Ust-Ishim from Russia and the Mesolithic SF12 from Sweden. We could thus compare three approaches to pigmentation inference, concluding that, for subop-timal levels of coverage (<8x), a probabilistic method estimating genotype likelihoods leads to the most robust predictions. We then applied that protocol to 348 ancient genomes from Eura-sia, describing how skin, eye and hair color evolved over the past 45,000 years. The shift to-wards lighter pigmentations turned out to be all but linear in time and place, and slower than ex-pected, with half of the individuals showing dark or intermediate skin colors well into the Copper and Iron ages. We also observed a peak of light eye pigmentation in Mesolithic times, and an accelerated change during the spread of Neolithic farmers over Western Eurasia, although local-ized processes of gene flow and admixture, or lack thereof, also played a significant role.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

We sought to investigate whether symptom severity is influenced by changes in sex hormones over the menstrual cycle, or by hormonal contraception.

MethodsWe carried out a retrospective analysis of menstrual and symptom data, prospectively collected via the Visible app from individuals with long COVID, ME/CFS, or both, who had regular menstrual cycles, between 7th September 2022 and 6th March 2024. Mixed-effects models were used to examine associations between symptom severity, menstrual cycle phase and contraception type.

Findings948 users were included; 100% of users were female and 92.6% identified as women. The most tracked symptoms were fatigue (99{middle dot}5% of users), brain fog (88{middle dot}3%), headaches (85{middle dot}1%) and muscle aches (78{middle dot}6%). All menstrual cycle phases showed a modest, but significant, improvement compared to the menstrual phase, most markedly the early luteal (IRR = 0{middle dot}963, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}958-0{middle dot}968), but also the follicular (IRR = 0{middle dot}985, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}981-0{middle dot}990) and late luteal phases (IRR = 0{middle dot}980, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}974- 0{middle dot}985). Crashes (sudden and severe worsening of symptoms following exertion) were significantly more frequent during menstruation than in other phases. Users of combined hormonal contraception (n=70) had a statistically significant reduction in overall symptom score (OR = 0{middle dot}827, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}690-0{middle dot}992) and crash incidence (OR = 0{middle dot}548, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}350-0{middle dot}856) compared to those not using contraception (n=786).

InterpretationMenstruation is associated with worsened symptoms in long COVID and ME/CFS. Users of combined hormonal contraception report a lower symptom burden than non-users, suggesting a modulatory role of ovarian hormones. These findings could empower menstruating people living with long COVID and ME/CFS to anticipate cyclical changes in symptoms and plan their activities accordingly, and could also inform their use of contraception.

Retrons typically comprise a reverse transcriptase, a template noncoding RNA that is partially reverse transcribed into RT-DNA, and a toxic effector. The reverse transcriptase, noncoding RNA, and RT-DNA complex sequester the toxic effector until triggered by phage infection, at which point the toxin is released to induce cell death. Due to their ability to produce single-stranded DNA in vivo, retrons have also been engineered to produce donor templates for genome editing in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the current repertoire of experimentally characterized retrons is limited, with most retrons sourced from clinical and laboratory strains of bacteria. To better understand retron biology and natural diversity, and to expand the current toolbox of retron-based genome editors, we developed a pipeline to isolate retrons and their bacterial hosts from a variety of environmental samples. Here, we present six of these novel retrons, each isolated from a different host bacterium. We characterize the full operon of these retrons and test their ability to defend against a panel of E. coli phages. For two of these retrons, we further unravel their mechanism of defense by identifying the phage genes responsible for triggering abortive infection. Finally, we engineer these retrons for genome editing in E. coli, demonstrating their potential use in a biotechnological application.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

The helicase RECQL5 has been proposed as an important factor to help safeguard the genome, and is the only member of the human RecQ helicase family that directly binds to RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) and affects its progression. RECQL5 mitigates transcription stress and genome instability in cells, yet the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unclear. Here, we employ cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of stalled Pol II elongation complexes (ECs) bound to RECQL5. Our structures reveal the molecular interactions stabilizing RECQL5 binding to the Pol II EC and highlight its role as a transcriptional roadblock. Additionally, we find that RECQL5 can modulate the Pol II translocation state. In its nucleotide-free state, RECQL5 mechanically twists the downstream DNA in the EC, and upon nucleotide binding, it undergoes a conformational change that allosterically induces Pol II towards a post-translocation state. We propose this mechanism may help restart Pol II elongation and therefore contribute to reduction of transcription stress.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

However, such synthesis depends on the integration of vast amounts of mostly scattered and often hard-to-extract information that is published and dispersed across hundreds of thousands of scientific papers, for example describing species-specific interactions and trophic relationships. Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and in particular the emergence of large language models (LLMs) offer a novel, and potentially revolutionary solution to this persistent challenge, for the first time creating the opportunity to access and extract virtually all data ever published. Here, we demonstrate the transformative potential of LLMs by extracting all types of biological interactions among species directly from a corpus of 83,910 scientific articles. Our approach successfully extracted a network of 144,402 interactions between 36,471 taxa. Performance analysis shows that the model exhibits a high sensitivity (70.0%) and excellent precision (89.5%).

We hypothesized that sensory-evoked awakenings are predominantly regulated by specific LC-NE efferent pathways. Anatomical, physiological, and functional modularities of LC-NE pathways involving the mouse basal forebrain (BF) and pontine reticular nucleus (PRN) were tested. We found partial anatomical segregation between the LC->PRN and LC->BF circuits. Extracellular NE dynamics in BF and PRN exhibited distinct sound-evoked activation during sleep, including a fast sound-evoked NE peak specific to PRN. Causal optogenetic interrogation of LC efferent pathways, by retro-ChR2 activation or PdCO silencing of synapses in target regions, revealed a pivotal role for early LC->PRN activity in driving arousal and sound-evoked awakenings. Together, our results uncover a prominent role for early LC-NE PRN activity in connecting sensory and arousal pathways and establish LC heterogeneity in regulating arousal.

Herein, we address these challenges by developing covalent fluorescent probes for endogenous tubulin, a critical cytoskeletal protein involved in processes such as cell movement, division, and biomolecule trafficking. Using well-known tubulin binder cabazitaxel and cell permeable fluorophore silicon-rhodamine--as a basis, we introduce a novel biocompatible cleavable linker containing a sulfonium center. This allowed the construction of the optimized probe, 6-SiR-o-C9-CTX, demonstrating excellent cell permeability, fluorogenic properties, and the ability to covalently label tubulin across various human cell lines. Importantly, the targeting moiety could be washed out while preserving tubulin staining, ensuring minimal disruption of tubulin function. This labeling technique is compatible with STED nanoscopy in both live and fixed cells, offering a powerful high-resolution imaging tool.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

We here developed an algorithm for automatic detection of micro-arousals based on EMG activity and used it to explore how micro-arousals modulate laminar neural activity in the motor cortex, and how this relationship is affected by sleep pressure in mice. Our analysis showed that micro-arousals were associated with a general suppression of local field potential (LFP) power across the cortical column. Slow wave activity (SWA, 1-4 Hz) immediately after micro-arousals was tightly correlated with sleep pressure and even surpassed average SWA levels during NREM sleep in sleep deprived animals. In addition, analysis of single-channel firing showed that some channels exhibited increased activity immediately prior to micro-arousals, while others exhibited decreased activity. This study provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying micro-arousals and identifies a new link between micro-arousals and sleep homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

Atherosclerosis is driven by the accumulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the formation of foam cells, accompanied by oxidative stress and the deposition of oxidized LDL (OxLDL), a pro-inflammatory molecule. Lowering LDL is the mainstay of current medical treatment in addition to blood pressure control and lifestyle changes, but to date, specifically targeting the inflammatory pathways contributing to plaque development without significant systemic side effects has not been feasible. Over the past decade, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have treated cancer and restored immune imbalance in autoimmune diseases in patients and resolved cardiac fibrosis in preclinical models. Using an inducible T regulatory cell (Treg) platform, we created an anti-OxLDL-specific CAR Treg therapy that exerts cell- and cytokine-mediated immunosuppression to reduce macrophage-foam cell formation in vitro.

While U. maydis induces tumors locally at sites of infection, S. reilianum systemically colonizes the host and causes symptoms in the inflorescences. To investigate the genetic basis of these differences, an interspecific recombinant hybrid (rUSH) with the mating type system of S. reilianum was generated. rUSH exhibited extensive in-planta proliferation, showing a S. reilianum-like phenotype at all developmental stages except teliospore formation. Transcriptome profiling revealed that expression of pathogenicity-related effector gene orthologs was induced in rUSH, but not in a wild-type hybrid control. Multiple transcriptome comparisons identified 253 differentially expressed one-to-one effector orthologs with distinct regulatory patterns, including cis-, trans-, and rUSH-specific regulation. Functional analysis via CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis uncovered three novel virulence factors among the rUSH-specific regulated effectors. Ultimately, rUSH facilitated to identify the transcription factor UmHdp2 as key regulator of U. maydis-induced tumorigenesis. Together, these findings highlight the utility of a recombinant, interspecific hybrid in unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenic differences in closely related fungal pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

Yet, modern recording probes have limited power to resolve neuron type. Here, we leverage the well-characterized architecture of the cerebellar circuit to perform expert identification of neuron type from extracellular recordings in behaving non-human primates. Using deep-learning classifiers we evaluate the information contained in readily accessible extracellular features for neuron identification. Waveform, discharge statistics, anatomical layer, and functional interactions each can inform neuron labels for a sizable fraction of cerebellar units. Together, as inputs to a deep-learning classifier, the features perform even better. Our tools and methodologies, validated during smooth pursuit eye movements in the cerebellar floccular complex of awake behaving monkeys, can guide expert identification of neuron type during cerebellar-dependent tasks in behaving animals across species. They lay the groundwork for characterization of information processing in the cerebellar cortex.

Cilia structures rely on intraflagellar transport (IFT), which involves dynein-2 for retrograde and kinesin-2 for anterograde movements along doublet microtubules. Unlike dynein-1, which works on singlet microtubules within the cytoplasm, dynein-2 specifically works on the doublet microtubules inside the cilia. Previous cryo-electron tomography studies have shown that retrograde IFT, driven by dynein-2, occurs on the A-tubule of the doublet, suggesting a specialized regulatory mechanism involving dynein-2. However, the molecular basis of this specificity remains unclear. Here, we investigated this mechanism using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) with Volta Phase Plate (VPP), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and biochemical analysis. Our biochemical assay revealed that the microtubule-binding domain of dynein-2 exhibits a higher affinity for the ciliary doublet microtubule compared to dynein-1. Cryo-ET with VPP further visualized the preferential binding of dynein-2 to the A-tubule of the doublet microtubule. MD simulations suggest that the preferential binding of dynein-2 is attributed to the tyrosinated tubulin in the A-tubule. These findings uncover a tyrosination-dependent regulatory mechanism that governs the bidirectional transport of IFT on doublet microtubules, providing new insights into the spatial and functional specialization of ciliary transport systems.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

We find that the previously identified open-interface trimer conformation is sampled in all eVLP-displayed spike variants studied including sequences from engineered vaccine constructs and native viral sequences. The D614G mutation, which arose early in the pandemic, favors the canonical  closed-interface prefusion conformation, potentially mitigating premature S1 shedding in the presence of a cleaved furin site and providing an evolutionary advantage to the virus.

However, functional characterization of smRNAs remains limited by the scale and simplicity of phenotypic readouts. Recently, single-cell perturbation screening methods, which link CRISPR-mediated genetic perturbations to rich transcriptomic profiling, have emerged as foundational and scalable approaches for understanding gene functions, mapping regulatory networks, and revealing genetic interactions. However, a comparable approach for probing the regulatory consequences of smRNA perturbations is lacking. Here, we present Decoy-seq as an extension of this approach for high-content, single-cell perturbation screening of smRNAs. This method leverages U6-driven tough decoys (TuD), which form stable duplexes with their target smRNAs, for inhibition in the cell. Lentiviral-encoded TuDs are compatible with conventional single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, allowing joint identification of the smRNA perturbation in each cell and its associated transcriptomic profile. We applied Decoy-seq to 336 microRNAs (miRNAs) and 196 tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) in a human breast cancer cell line, demonstrating its ability to uncover complex regulatory pathways and novel functions of these smRNAs. Notably, we show that tRFs influence mRNA polyadenylation and regulate key cancer-associated processes, such as cell cycle progression and proliferation. Therefore, Decoy-seq provides a powerful framework for exploring the functional roles of smRNAs in normal physiology and disease, and holds promise for accelerating future discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

Here, we describe an additional level of regulation beyond LexA properties that modulates the SOS response gene expression pattern. Using transcriptomic analyses, we reveal a distinct temporal hierarchy in the induction of SOS-regulated genes in Caulobacter crescentus.

The approach has been successful in pinpointing risk genes for various diseases, including Alzheimers disease, schizophrenia, and different types of cancers. TWAS typically involves two key steps: imputation and association analysis. In the imputation step, the original PrediXcan employs the elastic-net model, while subsequent research endeavors have delved into more intricate models such as FUSION and TIGAR. Despite these advancements, the existing individual methods may not capture the intricate genotype-expression relationships in a comprehensive way. Given the complexity of genetic contributions of genotypes to gene expression, sophisticated modeling techniques are imperative. In response to this, we have introduced Aggregated-TWAS (A-TWAS), a comprehensive tool that amalgamates multiple imputation models to accommodate diverse genetic architectures. A-TWAS utilizes several continuous shrinkage priors, including Laplace, Horseshoe, and Horseshoe+, to ensure precise imputation results while incorporating the benefits of Bayesian variable selection methods. In the association phase of TWAS, we employ the aggregated Cauchy association test (ACAT) to obtain an omnibus p-value.

ResultWe demonstrate the effectiveness of A-TWAS through comprehensive simulations and real data analyses. Simulation studies highlight that A-TWAS produces substantial improvements in predictive R2 and statistical power, while maintaining the type error I at a low level. Furthermore, TWASs are conducted on schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive symptoms datasets. In comparison to standard methods, the Bayesian imputation model demonstrates superior accuracy, and A-TWAS, by integrating multiple Bayesian priors, identifies a notably greater number of disease-relevant genes.

Despite the high efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in preventing HIV, its accessibility and uptake remain uneven across countries. This study examines the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different PrEP policies across 20 EU countries. Methods We employed a stochastic agent-based model of HIV transmission among MSM. The model incorporated data on sexual behavior, PrEP adherence and healthcare costs to evaluate the impact of five distinct PrEP eligibility policies. Outcomes included HIV infections averted, HIV-related deaths prevented, PrEP coverage, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Findings Policies by the US CDC and Belgian authorities were the most effective in reducing HIV infections and deaths, driven by higher PrEP coverage. However, the WHO policy emerged as the most costeffective across the 20 countries, despite its current use being limited to Denmark. The European AIDS Clinical Society guidelines also showed potential, although not currently implemented. In countries without PrEP reimbursement, reducing drug costs would significantly expand the range of cost-effective policy options. Interpretation Optimizing PrEP policies is crucial for reducing HIV incidence among MSM in the EU. Broad eligibility criteria maximize effectiveness, while WHO guidelines offer a cost-effective alternative in constrained economic contexts.

Our findings reveal that conjugative plasmids (pCONJ) are less common than previously estimated, comprising only 4.14% of the dataset. Mobilizable plasmids (pMOB) are the most prevalent (66.82%), followed by non-transmissible plasmids (pNT) at 29.04%.

These findings contrast with earlier estimates, which overrepresented clinically associated plasmids. Interestingly, ARGs are more frequently associated with pMOB plasmids, which exhibit higher ARG density. In contrast, VGs are primarily found in pCONJ plasmids.

Despite their evolutionary importance, the drivers of their diversity dynamics remain poorly understood. This study investigates the diversification patterns of Demospongiae, the largest class of sponges with a well-documented fossil record throughout the Phanerozoic Eon (541-0 Ma). Using fossil occurrence data and a Bayesian framework, we modeled origination and extinction rates to understand their evolutionary history.

Our findings reveal key extinction events, including three previously unrecognized events in the Cambrian, Late Silurian, and Late Jurassic, alongside known events such as the Permian-Triassic and Triassic-Jurassic extinctions. Notably, there was no statistical evidence for mass extinction during the Late Ordovician or Late Devonian. Additionally, Demosponges underwent a significant decline prior to the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction.

To explore abiotic influences, we applied the Multivariate Birth-Death (MBD) model across all extinction events. This analysis identified correlations between major speciation and extinction events and key variables, including temperature, continental fragmentation, oxygen levels, and sea level, as well as geochemical proxies such as sulfur and strontium, which may reflect underlying drivers like anoxia, weathering, or tectonic activity. Temperature and oxygen levels, in particular, correlated with speciation and extinction during the Permian-Triassic extinction.

These findings underscore the role of environmental fluctuations in shaping demosponge diversity and highlight the complex interplay between changes in abiotic factors and sponge evolution. Our work provides critical insights into the factors driving sponge biodiversity and offers perspectives on how modern sponges might respond to ongoing climate change.

Significance StatementSponges are ancient and ecologically pivotal marine organisms that have persisted through Earths major environmental upheavals. Despite their resilience, the mechanisms driving their evolutionary responses to past climate shifts remain unclear. By leveraging the fossil record of Demospongiae, this study identifies previously unrecognized extinction events and elucidates how abiotic factors, including temperature and oxygen levels, shaped their diversity during these crises. These findings enhance our understanding of sponge evolutionary dynamics and resilience, offering critical insights into the vulnerability of marine ecosystems under current and future climate change scenarios.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

While somatic hallucinations and misperceptions are common, the underlying disruptions in basic bodily self-processing remain unclear.

We aimed to investigate alterations in bodily self-processing, including touch and interoception, in psychosis using a multimodal, multi-method approach.

A total of 70 participants were included (35 patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders [DSM-IV F20-29], 35 age-and sex-matched controls).

Participants performed self-/other-touch-tasks and interoceptive assessments during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), evoked potentials (EP) measurements, and/or behavioral and psychophysical tests.

Primary outcomes included neural and behavioral responses to self-and externally-generated sensations (touch and heartbeat). Brain activation (fMRI), spinal responses (EPs), heartbeat perception and processing (EPs), and behavioral measures were analyzed, with preregistered hypotheses.

Patients demonstrated heightened neural activity during touch tasks, including increased right superior temporal gyrus activation during self-touch and heightened activity in a right temporoparietal cluster during social touch. Tactile self-other distinction impairments were evident at the spinal cord level (EPs). Behaviorally, patients showed reduced differentiation in tactile thresholds for self-vs. other-touch. Interoceptive impairments included diminished cortical responses to heartbeat signals (EPs), lower interoceptive accuracy (heartbeat detection), and reduced self-reported interoceptive sensitivity.

These findings reveal pervasive sensory and self-related disturbances in psychotic disorders. Impairments in differentiating self-and externally-evoked responses, detectable as early as the spinal cord level, may contribute to higher-order symptoms of psychosis.","NA","medrxiv",1738447547796

The cell envelopes assembly and maintenance influence permeability, making it a key target against multidrug-resistant strains. Disulfide bond (DSB) formation is crucial for the folding of cell envelope proteins. The DSB pathway in mycobacteria includes two enzymes, DsbA and VKOR, required for survival. Using bioinformatics and cysteine profiling proteomics, we identified cell envelope proteins dependent on DSBs. We validated via in vivo alkylation that key proteins like LamA (MmpS3), PstP, LpqW, and EmbB rely on DSBs for stability. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of VKOR results in phenotypes similar to those of {Delta}vkor. Thus, targeting DsbA-VKOR systems could compromise both cell division and mycomembrane integrity. These findings emphasize the potential of DSB inhibition as a novel strategy to combat mycobacterial infections.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

OAS2 comprises two OAS domains, only one of which can synthesize 2-5-oligoadenylates for RNase L activation. Existing structures of OAS1 provide a model for enzyme activation, but do not explain how multiple OAS domains discriminate RNA length. Here, we discover that OAS2 exists in an autoinhibited state as a zinc-mediated dimer and present a mechanism for RNA length discrimination: the catalytically deficient domain acts as a molecular ruler that prevents autoreactivity to short RNAs. We demonstrate that dimerization and myristoylation localize OAS2 to Golgi membranes and that this is required for OAS2 activation and restriction of viruses that exploit the endomembrane system for replication, e.g. coronaviruses. Finally, our results highlight the non-redundant role of OAS proteins and emphasize the clinical relevance of OAS2 by identifying a patient with a loss-of-function mutation leading to autoimmune disease.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

Liquid biopsy of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) represents a promising minimally-invasive approach, but its ability to reflect immune responses against tumors remains unclear. Here, we used single-cell sequencing of CSF cells and spatial transcriptomics of CNS lesions to compare and contrast LMD patients with CNS lymphoma (CNSL), glioblastoma (GB) and brain metastases (BrM), to neuroinflammatory CNS disorders. We identified disease-specific CSF environments, reflecting parenchymal tumor microenvironment features. CNSL showed robust T cell responses, while BrM and GB were dominated by both blood-derived and tissue-resident myeloid cells. Longitudinal CSF sampling unveiled mechanisms of disease progression and therapy resistance, highlighting the potential of CSF liquid biopsies for uncovering disease biology, discovering cellular biomarkers and developing personalized therapies for CNS neoplasms.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

The uniformity of the feature space provides a straightforward way for AI models to learn all three billion tokens for reading the human genome as a first language. We propose a diffusion transformer, dnaSORA, for learning these features. dnaSORA has generative capacity similar to Stable Diffusion but for DNA point clouds. The models architecture is novel because it is unified; thus, it also functions as a discriminator that uses a frozen latent representation for classification. dnaSORA transfer learns from synthetic data emulating real genome point clouds to classify misrepresented tokens in C. elegans Hawaiian data at state-of-the-art 0.3 Mb resolution. Pre-training large genome models typically requires expensive and difficult-to-obtain genomes. However, our solution provides nearly unlimited synthetic training data at negligible compute costs. Inference for new token assignments (e.g., new diseases) requires genomes from several dozen rather than thousands of individuals. These efficiencies, combined with state-of-the-art resolution, provide a pathway for rapid, massive scaling of token annotation of the entire human genome at orders of magnitude below expected costs.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

Salmonella Typhimurium, a key human pathogen, exploits host and environmental pH cues to transition between planktonic, biofilm, and virulence-associated states. However, precise tools to monitor bacterial pH dynamics at subcellular resolution have been limited. Herein, we report the development and application of mCherryTYG, a genetically encoded pH-sensitive fluorophore optimized for fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), enabling robust and high-resolution pH measurements across diverse conditions. mCherryTYG demonstrated exceptional sensitivity across a broad pH range (5.5-8.5) with consistent lifetime responses, and was unaffected by temperature, buffer composition, or ionic strength. Using FLIM, we characterized the pH dynamics of Salmonella across in vitro, host, and biofilm contexts. Under acidic stress in vitro, Salmonella maintained a uniform intracellular pH ([~]6.04), providing clarity on previously debated heterogeneity. In infections of HeLa cells, Salmonella existed in distinct pH environments: acidic vacuolar pH ([~]5.89) and neutral cytoplasmic pH ([~]7.10). During the late infection stage, [~]17% of the bacterial population retained an acidic pH. Biofilm studies revealed stratified pH profiles, with acidic pH near the bottom and neutral pH at the surface, mirroring patterns observed in other pathogens. In heterologous host models, pH gradients shaped bacterial adaptation strategies. In C. elegans, Salmonella experienced a progressive pH gradient from neutral pH ([~]7.10) in the anterior lumen to acidic pH ([~]6.45) in the posterior. Similarly, in zebrafish, Salmonella encountered acidic lysosome-rich enterocytes ([~]5.84) and neutral regions ([~]7.33) in the anterior gut. This study establishes mCherryTYG-FLIM as a transformative tool for studying bacterial pH regulation, revealing pH as a critical modulator of Salmonella lifestyle transitions: virulence, and persistence. Our findings provide new insights into host-microbe interactions and present pH as a promising target for therapeutic interventions against bacterial infections.","NA","biorxiv",1738447547796

By using a Nematostella transgenic reporter line expressing mCherry under the RLRb antiviral promoter we show that cells fluorescent upon stimulation with the viral mimic poly(I:C) are morphologically and transcriptomically distinct. These cells exhibit upregulation of immune effector and regulator genes. Cellular assays revealed an increase in phagocytic activity upon poly(I:C) treatment in this cell population. Lastly, we used a combination of immunofluorescent staining followed by FACS and bulk RNA sequencing, accompanied by single-cell transcriptomic analysis, to reveal the gene regulatory programs associated with immune cells in Nematostella. Comparing the sea anemone immune expression profile with gene expression of stony corals treated with the immunostimulant 2131-Cyclic GMP-AMP revealed remarkable similarity, suggesting that the immune response to viral challenge is conserved across the cnidarian class Hexacorallia.

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1738447547796

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1738447547796
