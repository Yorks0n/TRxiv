While studies report post-COVID increases chronic disease incidence including diabetes mellitus (DM), they frequently underrepresent racial/ethnic minorities and lack controls for potential confounds (e.g., increased DM testing after COVID-19).

MethodsWe conducted a case-control cohort time-to-event study of 29,470 individuals incarcerated in 31 California state prisons. The main outcome was incident diagnosed DM among individuals incarcerated continuously since January 1, 2019 with no DM diagnosis prior to March 1, 2020 (beginning of the unexposed period of observation). The main exposure was a positive COVID-19 test, with the exposure period beginning 31 days afterwards (post-acute period). Covariates included age, gender, race/ethnicity, BMI, and blood glucose at the start of the pandemic, frequency of healthcare contacts prior to the pandemic, and COVID-19 testing frequency prior to testing positive. We excluded individuals who lacked BMI or blood glucose measurements prior to or during the pandemic or were never tested for COVID-19 along with those who had been prescribed blood glucose-altering medications or had a diagnosed condition that could alter blood glucose. We estimated multivariate Cox proportional hazard models: 1) exposure variable and all covariates; 2) adding interactions between the exposure and each covariate. We assessed whether confounding due to changes in DM testing post-COVID could explain our results.

ResultsCOVID-19 infection significantly increased the rate of incident DM (main effects model HRR: 1.17 [95%CI: 1.03-1.34]; no significant interaction effects were observed). If all individuals in our study had had a COVID-19 infection, the 2-year cumulative risk of DM would have been 3.2% [2.5%-3.9%] compared to 2.7% [2.1%-3.4%] if none had been infected. While our findings were consistent to different definitions of the post-acute COVID period, confounding due to changes in DM testing post-COVID may imply that the effect is halved (HRR: 1.08-1.10).

ConclusionCOVID-19 may increase the risk of incident DM long after acute infection, warranting additional provider awareness and clinical consideration.","NA","medrxiv",1750371001025

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1750371001025

We investigated how the body and brain gather informative sensory signals from a wearable augmentation interface (a robotic digit for motor augmentation), and whether naturally-mediated feedback can support technological embodiment.

Participants intuitively interpreted natural feedback across perceptual tasks, performing comparably to state-of-the-art artificial feedback systems. fMRI revealed an immediate and distinct, topographically-organised representation of the robotic digit. After longitudinal training, this representation was further refined, becoming more similar to the biological digits, which correlated with increased subjective somatosensory embodiment.

Panic disorder, diagnosed in 2- 4%3, involves recurrent attacks followed by persistent worry about further attacks, leading to functional impairment and avoidance behaviours1,2. We conducted genome-wide association meta-analyses of panic attacks and panic disorder (61,746 and 29,775 cases, respectively, and 105,814 controls), identifying the first genome-wide significant variants for both traits (16 for panic attacks; 7 for panic disorder). Geneset analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing data implicated afferent neurons from the eye, heart, and lung in panic attacks, suggesting a critical role for sensory processing and interoceptive awareness. Further analyses suggested that these associations generalize to other psychiatric disorders. These findings offer novel insights into the biological mechanisms underlying panic, the role of afferent neurons, and may inform the development of more targeted and effective interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1750371001025

In ovules of Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana), one of the two synergid cells degenerates at fertilization, while the fertilized egg cell (zygote) undergoes directional elongation followed by asymmetric division to initiate embryonic patterning. However, morphological analysis of these events has been hampered by the limitations of conventional cell wall staining, which fails to label cells lacking complete walls, and by the requirement for transgenic fluorescent reporters to visualize cell outlines. Here, we report that the membrane-specific fluorescent dye FM4-64 readily permeates ovules, allowing clear visualization of reproductive cell morphology both before and after fertilization. This staining method supports high-resolution time-lapse imaging and quantitative analysis of early embryogenesis in living tissues. Importantly, it is applicable not only to the angiosperm A. thaliana but also to the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (M. polymorpha) and the fern Ceratopteris richardii (C. richardii), enabling the visualization of live reproductive cell structures within maternal tissues and revealing fertilization-associated morphological changes. This simple and robust method thus provides a valuable tool for spatiotemporal and quantitative analyses of reproductive processes across a broad range of plant species, without the need to generate transgenic lines.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

Here, we leveraged a virus-like particle (VLP) system to establish a cryo-electron microscopy workflow for lattice-forming viral glycoproteins. This enabled the determination of a 2.35 A resolution structure of the membrane-embedded Andes virus (ANDV) glycoprotein tetramer, as well as structures of dimers of tetramers and a complex with antibody ADI-65534. These structures reveal previously uncharacterized features of glycoprotein organization, stability, and pH-sensing. Immunization of mice with self-amplifying replicon RNA (repRNA) encoding ANDV-VLPs elicited high levels of glycoprotein-binding antibodies but equivalent titers of neutralizing antibodies compared to repRNA-encoded native ANDV glycoprotein complex.

Simultaneously, pathogens secrete effectors to promote host colonization through various mechanisms, including targeted host microbiota manipulation. Here, we characterize the Av2 effector of the vascular wilt fungus Verticillium dahliae as a suppressor of the cry for help. Inspired by in silico antimicrobial activity prediction, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of Av2 in vitro. Furthermore, its role in V. dahliae virulence was assessed through microbiota sequencing of inoculated plants, microbial co-cultivation assays, and inoculations in a gnotobiotic plant cultivation system. We show that Av2 inhibits bacterial growth, and acts as a virulence factor during host colonization. Microbiota sequencing revealed involvement of Av2 in suppression of Pseudomonas spp. recruitment upon plant inoculation with V. dahliae, suggesting that Av2 suppresses the cry for help. We show that several Pseudomonas spp. are antagonistic to V. dahliae and sensitive to Av2 treatment. We conclude that V. dahliae secretes Av2 to supress the cry for help by inhibiting the recruitment of antagonistic Pseudomonas spp. to pave the way for successful plant invasion.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

MethodsWe conducted a national retrospective database study including children born in 2008-2020. Individual-level data-linkage allowed examination of associations of sociodemographic variables with MMR and DTaP-IPV vaccination status at 2 years of age. Coverage for each variable, stratified by birth cohort, was calculated. Multivariable Poisson regression assessed independent associations and changes in coverage over time.

ResultsMMR coverage decreased in all population subgroups (overall 95% to 89% in 2008 and 2020 cohorts), with more substantial declines in some groups. The multivariable analysis showed that Dutch children of non-Dutch origin, particularly those of Moroccan and Turkish origin showed more pronounced declines (-25% and -12% compared to children of Dutch origin in cohort 2020, respectively). Among children not attending day care and children living in larger families ([&ge;]4 children), a faster decline in coverage was observed compared to those attending day care and living in smaller families (both -12% in cohort 2020). Among children of self-employed mothers and children in the lowest income households, lower coverage was observed compared to children of mothers in employment and children in the highest income households (-8% and -7% in cohort 2020, respectively). Nearly identical trends were observed for DTaP-IPV vaccination.

ConclusionOur study reveals a significant decline in childhood vaccination coverage in the Netherlands, with increasing disparities between sociodemographic groups. This is crucial for prioritising vaccination efforts to protect public health equitably.","NA","medrxiv",1750371001025

While this protective niche has been described, the molecular determinants orchestrating its formation and dictating its immune interactions are not well defined. Using Perturb-map, we determine how dozens of different gene perturbations shape the growth and cellular environments of PDAC clones through space and time. Our study reveals dynamic, gene-specific adaptations of immune neighborhoods during clonal selection. We identified Serpinb2 (PAI2) and Serpine1 (PAI1) as key cancer-derived mediators of TME remodeling and immune evasion. These factors promote the deposition of a fibrin-rich ECM that shapes immune cell composition, locally retains and polarizes immunosuppressive macrophages and excludes cytotoxic T cells. Deletion of either Serpinb2 or Serpine1 greatly enhanced tumor response to anti-PD1 immunotherapy in an aggressive PDAC model. Transcriptomic analysis further linked their expression to distinct PDAC subtypes and poor patient survival. Our findings demonstrate that Serpinb2 and Serpine1 establish a permissive niche for tumor progression and show how PDAC cells exploit components of the fibrinolysis pathway to remodel the ECM, alter macrophage composition, and protect themselves from immune editing, ultimately reinforcing the role of extracellular factors in shaping an immune-privileged tumor niche.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

In such cases, we understand the information by selectively attending to one of the modalities. Previous research has shown that selective attention to a specific stimulus modality modulates cortical activity patterns. However, it remains unclear which aspects of linguistic information are selectively modulated by attention and how such modulation influences the decodability of semantic content. To address this question, we constructed decoding models of latent semantic features from the functional magnetic resonance imaging data of six participants in both unimodal (either visual or auditory) and bimodal conditions (simultaneously visual and auditory, with participants attending to a single modality at a time). In unimodal conditions, we successfully decoded the semantic contents from the brain activity. Decodable features were consistent across modalities in both intra-modal and cross-modal decoding. For bimodal conditions, decoding accuracies for the attended stimuli were higher than for the ignored when training and test stimuli belonged to the same modality. Furthermore, decodable features were more consistent across modalities with attended than ignored stimuli in both intra-modal and cross-modal decoding. These results indicate common decodable semantic features regardless of the presentation modality and that selective attention enhances the semantic representations contributing to such decodability.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

Mathematical models of spreading have been developed leading to several established methods of inferring whether information spreads via social or individual learning. Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) has emerged as a leading frequentist framework for inferring and quantifying social transmission, particularly in non-human animal populations.
C_LIO_LINBDA has been extended several times to account for multiple diffusions, multiple networks, individual-level variables, and complex transmission functions. Bayesian implementations of NBDA were introduced in two prior studies. However, there is not yet a user-friendly package to implement a Bayesian NBDA, and the approach has seen limited usage by other researchers.
C_LIO_LIHere, we present a unified framework for performing Bayesian analysis of social transmission using NBDA-type models, implemented in the widely used Stan programming language. We provide a user-friendly R package ""STbayes"" (ST: social transmission) for other researchers to easily use this framework. STbayes accepts user-formatted data, but can also import data directly from the existing NBDA R package. Based on the data users provide, STbayes automatically generates multi-network, multi-diffusion models that allow for individual covariates that may influence transmission, as well as individual-level varying (random) effects.
C_LIO_LIUsing simulated data, we demonstrate that this model can accurately differentiate the relative contribution of individual and social learning in the spread of information through networked populations. We illustrate how incorporating upstream uncertainty about the relationships between individuals in the social group can improve model fit. We show that our framework can be used to infer complex transmission rules and describe a new parameterization of frequency-dependent transmission that is more numerically stable than prior parameterizations. Finally, we introduce support for dynamic transmission weights and a ""high-resolution"" data mode, which allows users to make use of fine-scale data collected by contemporary automated tracking methods. These extensions increase the set of contexts that this type of model may be used for.

CRISPR-Cas systems are known to be important regulators of these host-MGE interactions, but a global understanding of CRISPR-Cas diversity, activity, and roles across Earths biomes is still lacking. Here, we use an optimized computational approach to search short-read data and collect [~]800 million CRISPR spacers across [~]450,000 public metagenomes. Comparing spacers across samples and taxa revealed a high population diversity for CRISPR loci overall, with typically only a small subset of spacers detected as prevalent and conserved within a microbial population. From this extensive CRISPR spacer dataset, we identified 1.18 billion hits between 41 million spacers and 2.5 million viruses and plasmids. Prevalent and conserved spacers were over-represented in these MGE-matching spacers, and CRISPR spacers frequently matched multiple MGEs, consistent with a positive selection pressure associated with MGE targeting. Focusing on the role of CRISPR as anti-phage defense, we observed surprising cases of viruses targeted by microbes not expected to be viable hosts. These were more frequent for viruses encoding a diversification mechanism (DGR) for their host attachment proteins, and associated with a reduced rate of escape mutations. This suggests that broad spacer targeting may derive from the recurring entry of a virus genome into a non-host microbial cell, leading to some viruses being targeted by taxonomically diverse microbes well outside of their actual host range. Taken together, this petabase-scale exploration of CRISPR arrays in nature outlines the extensive diversity of CRISPR array loci across microbiomes. It highlights several key genomic and ecological parameters driving the activity of CRISPR arrays that are likely influencing strain-level diversification and selection processes within microbial populations.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

The fast spreading of newly emerging Omicron variants LP.8.1 and NB.1.8.1 has brought many questions regarding the evolution course and spreading trend. In this study we analyzed the evolutionary relationship among representative Omicron subvariants, and investigated spreading trend by analyzing the relative growth advantage of the newly emerging Omicron variants LP.8.1 and NB.1.8.1. The results have revealed a modest relative growth advantage of LP.8.1, and one much larger relative growth advantage of NB.1.8.1 over co-circulating BA.2.86/JN.1 subvariants including LP.8.1, indicating that NB.1.8.1 will possibly become the next dominant variant worldwide. As NB.1.8.1 is a product of intricate evolutionary events, the spreading of this variant would further complicate the prediction about future evolution and spreading trend of the SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the importance and necessity of performing genomic surveillance and monitoring SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","NA","medrxiv",1750371001025

"Gene duplication, translocation and molecular evolution of Dmrt1 and related sex-determining genes in anurans","10.1101/2025.06.11.659201","biorxiv",3,3,3,3,3,"Shinde, S.

In contrast to the highly differentiated sex chromosomes of mammals, birds, and Drosophila, most anurans (frogs and toads) maintain homomorphic sex chromosomes that exhibit a rapid turnover, even among closely related species. To uncover the mechanisms underlying the emergence of new master sex-determining genes and sex chromosome turnover, we analysed 53 published anurans and one caecilian genome (>200 Ma divergence) and available transcriptomes. We asked how often new master sex-determining genes arise by gene duplication, whether and how often gene translocation associates with sex chromosome turnover, and if new master sex-determining genes evolve under positive selection. We find that chromosome-level synteny is remarkably conserved, with only a few fusions or fissions and no evidence for translocation of four candidate master sex-determining genes (Dmrt1, Foxl2, Bod1l, Sox3). Only Dmrt1 duplicated in 3 out of 50 species (excluding tetraploid Xenopus), and it showed strong testis-biased expression in all 8 species with available gonadal expression data. While Dmrt1 has evolved under purifying selection, Dmrt1 duplicates exhibit elevated nonsynonymous substitution rates and a tendency towards positive selection. Lineage-specific amino acid changes were observed in the conserved DM domain of Dmrt1. These results demonstrate that, in anurans, master sex-determining genes arise rarely via gene duplication, and more likely evolve via allelic diversification. Sex chromosome turnover is not associated with gene translocation, and is more likely driven by mutations on genes involved in sexual developmental pathway. All candidate sex-determining genes were under strong purifying selection, with the exception of duplications which are linked to positive selection. Our results suggest future research on anuran sex determination and sex chromosome evolution should focus on identifying allelic diversification and novel mutations on genes involved in sexual developmental pathway.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

Viral antigen triggered innate immune response leads to induction of interferons (IFNs) and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) including ADAR1 p150 isoform, which edits adenosine (A) residues within double stranded RNAs in both the virus and the host. Such RNA editing mediated by ADARs plays a crucial role in innate immune responses during viral infections through modulation of host-virus interactions. Additionally, ADAR editing acts post-transcriptionally, and serves as a mechanism of dynamic regulation of transcriptome and proteome diversity. While evidence points to changes in ADAR editing during infection, we do not know whether editing targets change over the course of the infection. Here, we explored temporal changes in ADAR expression and editing patterns, across three distinct stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we examined whether infection-triggered dysregulation in ADAR editing persists or returns to pre-infection states post-viral clearance. We addressed this question by analyzing publicly available whole blood RNA sequencing samples from forty-five, age-matched individuals. The individuals selected had no documented comorbidities, developed mild COVID-19, and were sampled across three distinct stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection: pre-, mid-, and post-infection. Our results demonstrate dynamic changes in ADAR expression and editing across the three stages. We further identified unique editing sites resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection, across all three stages of infection, within genes involved in immune response pathways. Noteworthy, genes within neutrophil degranulation pathway appear to be edited, suggesting they may play a role in inflammation and sequelae observed post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results demonstrate a consistent trend of elevated ADAR expression and reduced overall ADAR editing within each individual mid-infection. Subsequently, in some post-infection samples ADAR expression returns to approximately pre-infection levels, while in others it remains dysregulated. These differences may be contributing to heterogeneity in disease outcomes seen in individuals post-SARS-CoV-2 infection.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

We also try prompt augmentation with LLM-generated differential definitions. We tested these prompts on open-source Llama and medically fine-tuned Llama models to steer their alignment toward accurate concept assignment across multiple prompt formats. Domain-tuned models consistently outperform general models of the same size in retrieval and generative tasks. However, performance is sensitive to prompt design and model size, and the benefits of adding LLM-generated context are inconsistent.

Studies of neural circuit evolution often focus on a few elements within a network. However, addressing fundamental questions in evolutionary neuroscience, such as whether some elements are more evolvable than others, requires a more global and unbiased approach. Here, we used synapse-level comparative connectomics to examine how an entire olfactory circuit evolves. We compared the full antennal lobe connectome of the larvae of two closely related Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. erecta, which differ in their ecological niches and odour-driven behaviours. We found that evolutionary change is unevenly distributed across the network. Some features, including neuron types, neuron numbers and interneuron-to-interneuron connectivity, are highly conserved. These conserved elements delineate a core circuit blueprint presumably required for fundamental olfactory processing. Superimposed on this scaffold, we find rewiring changes that mirror each species ecologies, including a systematic shift in the excitation-to-inhibition balance in the feedforward pathways. We further show that some neurons have changed more than others, and that even within individual neurons some synaptic elements remain conserved while others display major species-specific changes, suggesting evolutionary hot-spots within the circuit. Our findings reveal constrained and adaptable elements within olfactory networks, and establish a framework for identifying general principles in the evolution of neural circuits underlying behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

DNA methylation (DNAm) is an epigenetic modification that plays a critical role in gene regulation and has been implicated in both aging and AD. In this study, we performed a meta analysis of DNAm profiles in the prefrontal cortex using two large, independent postmortem brain cohorts, the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) and Brains for Dementia Research (BDR), to identify DNAm differences associated with aging in late life. We identified 3264 CpGs significantly associated with aging, the majority of which were hypermethylated and enriched in promoter regions and CpG islands. These aging associated DNAm changes were significantly overrepresented in genes involved in immune regulation and metabolic pathways. When compared with AD associated DNAm changes, we found a significant overlap, with nearly all CpGs and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that were associated with both aging and AD Braak stage displaying concordant directionality. This supports the hypothesis that aging and AD are interconnected at the molecular level. Further integrative analyses indicated that a number of these DNAm variants may have functional relevance in AD. By integrating blood DNAm data, we identified multiple CpGs that showed significant brain to blood correlations and were involved in both aging and AD pathogenesis. Colocalization analyses with genomewide association study (GWAS) data revealed shared genetic regulation of DNAm and dementia at several AD risk loci. Out of sample validation using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrated that, among 334 CpGs showing concordant DNAm changes in aging and AD, baseline DNAm levels at cg10752406 in the AZU1 promoter were significantly associated with AD progression at a 5% false discovery rate, even after adjusting for age, sex, APOE {varepsilon}4 allele status, years of education, and baseline MMSE. Notably, this CpG also showed a strong brain blood DNAm correlation, further supporting its potential as a peripheral biomarker for AD. Our study provides valuable insights into the epigenetic landscape of aging and its implications for AD, suggesting that aging related epigenetic modifications may provide a viable source of biomarkers for AD.","NA","medrxiv",1750371001025

Methods Paid and earned media, referral cohorts, and individual and community ambassadors were leveraged as recruitment strategies to attract and enroll a broad study population. The success of each strategy was measured as conversion to (i) informed consent, (ii) smell test completion, and (iii) identification of hyposmic individuals. Participants completed an eConsent and questionnaire online, followed by remote smell test screening for Parkinson's risk. Participants with hyposmia were invited to complete dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging. Those who continued to meet eligibility criteria were invited to enroll in the PPMI clinical study, for comprehensive longitudinal follow-up. Results Over 1.2 million visits to the smell test website were recorded and 79,837 participants consented to remote hyposmia screening. A smell test was sent to 57,754 participants and completed by 38,419; 6,649 were identified to be hyposmic (as defined by PPMI study cutoffs). DAT imaging was completed by 1,720, with 1,120 identified as eligible for longitudinal follow-up. The greatest number of participants who consented to smell testing came from paid media and social media ads, referral networks (commercial and study partners), and the MJFF community. Overall, 14.4% of participants who completed smell testing were confirmed to be hyposmic. The highest rates of conversion from completed UPSIT to confirmed case of hyposmia occurred with promoted online search results, earned press coverage, and radio ads. Conclusion PPMI provides a useful example of overcoming challenges to enrollment of participants with biomarkers and/or early symptoms (but without typical symptoms) of disease. Important lessons from these data for this study team, and other researchers alike, are to be agile in recruitment strategies, to utilize effective participant engagement approaches, and to prioritize centralized study teams/resources to offload site burden and streamline participant experience.","NA","medrxiv",1750371001025

MethodsIn 543 cognitively unimpaired DELCODE participants, we modelled four-year interrelations between medial temporal lobe to ventricle ratio (MTLV-ratio), WMH, and PACC5 performance using latent growth curve modelling. We quantified unique contributions of brain changes to cognitive change and derived a domain-general brain maintenance index. Associations with lifestyle and personality were examined post-hoc.

ResultsSteeper MTLV-ratio decline related to baseline WMH and its progression. Brain-domain changes independently contributed to cognitive changes. Neuroticism, depressive symptoms, and low cognitive engagement related to unfavourable domain-specific trajectories and brain maintenance index.

DiscussionDynamics of WMH and ageing-related atrophy on cognitive ageing highlight their relevance for brain maintenance. Our results suggest that maintaining cerebrovascular and mental health alongside cognitive engagement could promote brain maintenance, delay cognitive decline and dementia.","NA","medrxiv",1750371001025

Here we propose a new method, pleiotropic heritability with bias correction (PHBC), to estimate pleiotropic heritability (h2pleio), defined as the liability-scale genetic variance of a target disease that is shared with a specific set of auxiliary diseases. We estimate h2pleio from GWAS summary statistics by estimating the proportion of variance explained from an estimated genetic correlation matrix and employing a Monte-Carlo bias correction procedure to account for sampling noise in genetic correlation estimates. Simulations showed that PHBC produces approximately unbiased estimates of pleiotropic heritability. The average ratio of pleiotropic heritability vs. total SNP-heritability (h2pleio/h 2) across 15 diseases from the UK Biobank (spanning 7 disease categories) was 34% (s.e. 7%). Several diseases were dominated by pleiotropic heritability, including depression (71%) and type 2 diabetes (65%). Pleiotropic heritability was broadly distributed across disease categories, with h2pleio /h2decreasing only slightly when removing all auxiliary diseases in the target disease category (avg = 31% (s.e. 7%)) and only moderately when further removing one other (most informative) category whose removal had the greatest impact (avg = 20% (s.e. 3%)). Average 2pleio 2 increased to 44% (s.e. 9%) when adding 16 auxiliary quantitative traits in UK Biobank, and 50% (s.e. 5%) when further adding 30 auxiliary diseases from large GWAS meta-analyses. On average, h2pleio/h2 was 2.4x larger than the proportion of liability-scale total phenotypic variance explained by the same set of auxiliary diseases, implying higher pleiotropy for genetic effects than the effects of non-genetic exposures. In conclusion, we have uncovered pervasive sharing of genetic aetiologies, with roughly half of common disease heritability being pleiotropic with diseases from a broad range of disease categories, which strongly motivates the importance of multi-disease approaches to risk prediction and therapeutic development.","NA","medrxiv",1750371001025

The core challenge lies in balancing quality and scalability. Manual curation delivers high quality, reliable annotations but is time-intensive and non-scalable; automated approaches, including those based on natural language processing, can scale but often fall short in accuracy and completeness. This tradeoff is particularly severe in public datasets, where metadata is frequently distributed across multiple sources for a single dataset. A notable example includes multi-omics datasets available on GEO and similar public repositories, which are often accompanied by associated publications. These supplementary sources can be leveraged to substantially enhance metadata quality, thereby supporting downstream applications such as classifier model development or the identification of biologically relevant cohorts, etc.

We present a first-in-class multi-agent AI system that bridges the gap, achieving both high quality and scalability in metadata curation. Built on large-language models (LLMs), our system orchestrates a set of specialized agents that collaboratively extract, normalize, and infer critical metadata fields such as tissue, disease, cell line, sampling site, demographics, and experimental context from GEO entries, associated publications. A central orchestrator agent delegates tasks such as data retrieval, document parsing, ontology mapping, and context inference to expert sub-agents, enabling scalable, end-to-end automation.

Applied to GEO data sets, a notoriously difficult metadata domain, our system achieves a 93% recall on average across 23 key fields (all original terms, normalized terms, and corresponding ontology ids) that include information about disease, tissue, treatment, donor-related information, outperforming existing automated baselines and approaches expert level quality. We also present a system that can easily scale to curate hundreds of metadata fields of interest with similar precision. This work demonstrates that an LLM-based multi-agent architecture can overcome traditional trade-offs in metadata curation, enabling both precision and scale, and offers a promising path forward for curating large public biomedical repositories for downstream AI applications.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

Previous studies highlighted neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier disruption. Here, we identify distinct biomarkers and dysregulated pathways, with a focus on cardiovascular and neurovascular involvement.

MethodsWe analyzed public RNA-sequencing data (GEO: GSE251849) comparing long COVID-19 patients with brain fog, long COVID-19 patients without cognitive symptoms, convalescent patients, and healthy controls. Differential gene expression, principal component analysis, and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DESeq2, KEGG, GO, and Enrichr tools.

ResultsOur analysis revealed a distinct gene expression profile in patients with brain fog, identifying exclusive biomarkers such as NRCAM, GRIN2C, NOS2, and EDNRB. Pathway analysis revealed significant dysregulation in cardiovascular, calcium signaling, and relaxin signaling pathways, suggesting novel biological mechanisms that contribute to cognitive impairment. These findings expand beyond neuroinflammation and highlight potential cardiovascular involvement in long COVID-related cognitive dysfunction.

ConclusionOur study reveals novel transcriptomic signatures that highlight cardiovascular and neurovascular dysregulation, providing promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Future research should validate these findings and investigate therapeutic interventions addressing these unique pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

In this study, we investigated time-resolved changes in cortical E/I balance and their network-level and structural correlates in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. High-density EEG recordings encompassing at least one recorded seizure were obtained from pre-surgical evaluations. Using source-reconstructed EEG, we tracked dynamic changes in the aperiodic exponent of the power spectrum--a non-invasive proxy for E/I balance--during preictal and interictal periods. Directed functional connectivity was assessed using spectral Granger causality, and correlations with cortical thickness and neurotransmitter receptor density were evaluated. We found that the aperiodic exponent increased progressively in the minutes preceding seizures, reflecting a widespread shift toward cortical inhibition. This pattern was specific to the preictal state and evident across both epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic regions. Periodic activity in delta and theta bands also increased prior to seizures, supporting a global reorganization of cortical excitability. At the functional profile level, epileptogenic regions demonstrated significantly greater outward connectivity than both their inward connectivity and that of non-epileptogenic areas during the preictal phase. Moreover, E/I balance was differentially related to connectivity patterns: non-epileptogenic regions showed a positive correlation between inhibition (higher aperiodic exponent) and outward connectivity, whereas epileptogenic regions displayed a trend toward the opposite pattern. Structure-function coupling also diverged: cortical thickness positively correlated with inhibitory tone in non-epileptogenic regions but not in epileptogenic ones. Finally, we observed that lower values of muscarinic receptor density corresponded to an E/I balance shifted towards inhibition (ie., higher aperiodic exponent), linking cholinergic tone with preictal E/I dynamics. These findings indicate that seizure onset is preceded by a shift toward inhibition at the whole-brain level, accompanied by distinct patterns of directed connectivity and disrupted structural coupling in epileptogenic networks. This multiscale perspective highlights the interplay between electrophysiology, network topology and cortical architecture systems in the moments leading up to seizure onset. Our results support and enlarge the interictal suppression hypothesis, suggesting a network protective mechanism through inhibition, related to a perturbatory event as the seizure onset. Overall, the dynamic aperiodic exponent emerges as a promising non-invasive marker with potential applications in seizure prediction and network-targeted neuromodulation.","NA","medrxiv",1750371001025

A normative model of regional MIND values trained on UK Biobank (N=35,133) was applied to the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center cohort (N=3,567). We examined brain deviations across clinical stages, APOE genotypes, mortality risk, and neuropathological burden.

RESULTSNegative deviations (reduced MIND) stratified disease stages (p<0.01) and showed functional network enrichment in AD. Greater negative deviations characterised APOE {varepsilon}4 homozygotes and correlated with postmortem neuropathological severity (p=0.032). Neurobiological decoding revealed associations with neurotransmitter receptor distributions and cortical organisation properties.

Here we investigated individual and compound effects of particulate matters (PM10, PM2.5, PMcoarse, PMabs) and nitric oxides (NO2, NO) on risk of all-cause dementia, and its most common sub- types, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VAD), using data from UK Biobank. We addressed factors that hinder causal interpretation of associ- ations previously shown in the literature and their translation into clear public health policies. Specifically: 1) spatial confounding by area-level covariates, 2) collinearity among and identification of the most relevant air pollutants, and 3) the time window for pollution exposure. Furthermore, we used chronic obstruc- tive pulmonary disease (COPD) and frequency of oily fish intake in positive and negative control analyses. We found NO2 to be the strongest risk factor for dementia, especially when considering longer periods ([&ge;] 5 years) of exposure (all-cause dementia hazard ratio HR=1.06, 1.02-1.11 per 9.86 g/m3 interquar- tile range). There was stronger evidence of an effect on risk for AD than VAD. Positive control analysis did not provide any evidence against causality, although the analyses of spatial confounding and negative control analyses revealed the presence of some residual bias, thus warranting care in the interpretation of the results.

Design: Prospective longitudinal study Participants: Eyes with early or intermediate AMD at baseline were defined based on the Age-Related Eye Disease Study severity scale. High genetic risk was defined as the third tertile of a genetic risk score for progression, adjusted for age, race and sex. Methods: Information on lifestyle behaviors was obtained from baseline risk and food frequency questionnaires. Risk-inducing and health-promoting lifestyle profiles were defined based on dichotomous categorizations of smoking, body-mass index (BMI), and dietary caloric intake, green leafy vegetables and fish, in never and ever smokers. Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs), relative risks (RRs) and population attributable risks (PARs) were calculated, adjusting for inter-eye correlation, demographic factors, macular status and family history. Main Outcome Measures: Progression to advanced AMD (AAMD) and subtypes geographic atrophy (GA) and neovascular (NV), confirmed at 2 consecutive visits over 5 years of follow-up. Results: Among 898 high genetic risk eyes, 207 eyes progressed to AAMD (23%). Among never smokers, a high risk-inducing lifestyle profile conferred a 3-fold increased incidence of AAMD, compared to an ideal health-promoting lifestyle profile [HR = 3.3 (CI 1.8, 6.4), P <0.001]. In ever smokers, a risk-inducing profile was independently associated with a 5-fold increased incidence of AAMD [HR = 5.3 (CI 2.3,11.9), P <0.001]. Stronger effects of these lifestyle behaviors were seen for GA compared to NV. Estimated PARs suggested adopting an ideal health-promoting profile could prevent 56% of incident AAMD in never smokers and 60% in ever smokers. Conclusion: Unhealthy behaviors increased incidence of AAMD by 3 to 5-fold among a highly genetically susceptible population, and 56-60% of AAMD incidence was attributed to the modifiable factors of smoking, high BMI, high caloric intake and low intake of foods rich in lutein-zeaxanthin and omega-3 fatty acids. These results underscore the importance of lifestyle interventions even in high genetic risk populations, such as relatives of affected patients, to reduce progression from early and intermediate AMD to advanced vision-threatening stages.","NA","medrxiv",1750371001025

However, their inherent heterogeneity and dynamic nature pose significant challenges for standardization, reproducibility, and real-time manipulation. Here, we present VISIBLE (Versatile Imaging-Based Interactive Sampling and Bioprinting System), a modular, imaging-guided platform that integrates real-time monitoring with automated manipulation and 3D bioprinting that addresses these challenges. VISIBLE employs a dual-axis system comprising independently controlled tool-heads and microscope stages, enabling precise spatiotemporal interventions within live cultures. We demonstrate the system capabilities across a range of applications, including morphology- and function-based sampling of organoids and neurospheres, interactive 3D bioprinting, serial scratch assays, and real-time cell-cell interaction studies. Furthermore, we illustrate the system utility in translational contexts through the selective sampling and implantation of patient-derived xenograft organoids. VISIBLE supports long-term culture within an integrated incubation environment and accommodates interchangeable tool-heads for scalable, high-throughput workflows. By enabling closed-loop, feedback-controlled experimentation, VISIBLE addresses some of the critical limitations in existing complex in vitro model platforms and offers a new versatile solution for a wide range of biomedical research applications.

Understanding shared genetic factors underlying CVD and its comorbidities can help develop more effective prevention and treatment strategies. Methods: In this study, we investigated genetic correlations between CVD and common comorbidities using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from the FinnGen R12 release. Following standard quality control procedures, we examined 19 disease endpoints using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) to estimate heritability and pairwise genetic correlations. Disease traits with significant heritability (z-score [&ge;] 4) and Bonferroni-corrected significant correlations (adjusted p < 0.05) were selected for genomic structural equation modeling (Genomic SEM) to construct a latent genomic factor (LGF), representing shared genetic liability. Results: Out of the 19 diseases, four CVDs (transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction and heart failure) and seven comorbidities (type 2 diabetes, asthma, obesity, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gingivitis and hypertension) showed statistically significant genetic correlations. A multivariate GWAS of the LGF identified 141 novel associated loci across 29 independent SNPs. These loci overlapped with 16 protein-coding genes, including NPC1, TMEM106B, PTPN22, MAP2K5 and MSRA, implicating them in the shared pathogenesis of CVD and its comorbidities. Conclusions: These findings highlight a shared genetic architecture underlying CVD and its comorbidities, revealing cross-disease genetic risk factors that may enhance joint risk prediction, inform precision medicine strategies, and offer insights into common biological mechanisms and potential targets for integrated therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1750371001025

While clinical research on SCAs has expanded over the past two decades, it is unclear whether the populations included in these studies reflect the demographic diversity of those affected. Assessing representation is critical to ensuring research findings are generalizable and applicable to diverse patient populations. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of global clinical research on SCAs published in English between January 2004 and May 2024. Searches were performed in Ovid MEDLINE ALL, Embase, and Web of Science. Studies were included if they enrolled <10 participants and excluded if they were case reports, reviews, or meta-analyses. We extracted data from 1,474 studies on geographic location, participant karyotypes, and demographic metrics, including race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES) reported. Trends in demographic reporting were examined over time and by geographic region. For U.S.-based studies reporting race/ethnicity, we compared pooled participant demographics to national census data. Results: SCA research is concentrated within a small number of geographic areas, primarily in Europe (51.4%) and the U.S. (23.6%). Reporting rates of race or ethnicity for U.S. papers increased over the 20-year observation period, with an average increase of 1.5% +/- 0.4% per year (p = 0.003), peaking in 2024 with 61.4% of U.S.-based papers presenting demographics. When reported, studies consistently overrepresented non-Hispanic White (p<0.001) and college-educated (p<0.001) participants relative to U.S. census benchmarks. Conclusions: This systematic review reveals persistent gaps in the demographic reporting and representation of participants in SCA research. Even in the U.S., where population diversity is high, published studies do not reflect the expected racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic makeup of affected individuals. To ensure that research findings are equitable and clinically relevant, future studies should adopt standardized demographic reporting and prioritize inclusive enrollment strategies to reflect the full spectrum of individuals with SCAs.","NA","medrxiv",1750371001025

Yet, in sub-Saharan Africa, only 5% of CC patients receive appropriate treatment. In 2021, Mozambique integrated the prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine into its national immunization program as a primary prevention strategy. As part of a qualitative research effort on participatory modeling, this study aimed to quantify the magnitude and distribution of expected health and economic outcomes of the current HPV vaccination program, hypothetical scale-up scenarios, and global targets.

We applied and extended a closed cohort model to quantify the vaccine programs direct potential population health benefits (in averted CC cases and deaths), financial savings to patients (in direct medical treatment costs saved and in financial risk protection provided), health provider benefits measures in saved labour (full-time equivalents, FTEs) and distribution of benefits under empirically informed and potential vaccination coverage scenarios.

With a coverage of 18.9% in 2021, the vaccination program is estimated to avert up to 9.7% of expected CC cases and deaths (from 4.0% in the highest socioeconomic quintile (HQ) to 11.6% in the lowest socioeconomic quintile (LQ)). Across the lifetime of a single vaccination cohort, an average of US$106,532 (min: US$48,382, max: US$157,811) in direct medical CC treatment expenditure for patients and the time equivalent to 59 full-time healthcare workers is saved per year. Over 30 years, 50% vaccination coverage could prevent 23.9% of predicted cases and fatalities (LQ: 25.2% to HQ: 14.8%). With a gradient in vaccine coverage favoring higher socioeconomic quintiles in urban areas, the benefits in the LQ rural population are estimated to be six times greater than in the LQ urban population.

These findings can contribute to fair and efficient planning decisions from various stakeholder perspectives in policy dialogues around the HPV vaccination programme in Mozambique, and at a global level.

This paper describes how two financial metrics were used to estimate the return on investments of drugs developed by the PDP Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) as a case study. Methods The internal rate of return (IRR) and benefit-cost ratio (BCR) were used to estimate the economic return on investment for the PDP. IRR was based on total investments from 2000 to 2023 and health gains derived from PDP-supported drugs, measured as monetized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) minus the delivery cost of the products. BCR was calculated by dividing the present value of monetized DALYs by the present value of cost, indicating the overall efficiency and impact of the investments received by MMV. Findings Total investment received was $2.3 billion over the study period, and the antimalarial drugs developed and launched with the support of MMV averted an estimated 1.6 million deaths and 87 million DALYs for a cost of delivery estimated at $785 million. The IRR for the base scenario was 52.13% (CI: 52.11% - 52.16%) and the BCR 12.99 (CI: 12.92 - 13.06). Interpretation The substantial IRR and BCR generated by investment in antimalarial drug development suggest that the PDP model has a potentially pivotal role to play in global health.","NA","medrxiv",1750371001025

Previous genome-wide association studies on these pregnancy outcomes have been successful but have overlooked the number of a mothers previous pregnancies. In this study, we explored if parity (the number of children a mother has previously delivered) modifies the maternal or foetal genetic effect of gestational duration and birth weight (gene x parity interactions) using data from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study in up to 58,528 mothers and their offspring. Potential genetic effect differences were investigated by: (1) performing parity-stratified genome-wide association studies, (2) testing SNP x parity interactions, (3) testing the interaction between a polygenic prediction of the traits and parity, and (4) assessing the genetic correlation within each outcome across parity. For both phenotypes, we identified shared and distinct loci for each outcome in terms both of genetic region and number in the parity-stratified genome-wide association studies, and the genetic correlation by parity deviated from one for all outcomes. The strongest evidence of genetic modification effect by parity was found for gestational duration in the maternal genome where genetic effects were stronger in the first pregnancy compared to later pregnancies. For instance, the polygenic prediction of the maternal genome on gestational duration had a significant interaction with parity (p-value interaction = 5 x 10-5). The results for birth weight were more uncertain, suggesting that the identified gene x parity interactions is largely limited to gestational duration. In conclusion, our study reveals that parity modifies the genetic effects on gestational duration and highlights the relevance of considering parity in genetic studies on pregnancy outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1750371001025

MethodWe leveraged 93 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as genetically proxies for targets of antihypertensives (Ca-channel blockers/CCB, beta-blockers/BB, ACE inhibitors/ACEI), lipid-lowering drugs (PCSK9 inhibitors/PCSK9I, statins, NPC1L1 inhibitors/NPC1L1I), and antidiabetics (metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors/SGLT2I, GLP1R agonist/GLP1RA) drugs. Genetic instruments reflected lowering of systolic blood pressure (SBP), LDL cholesterol, and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). We used summary statistics from genome-wide association study (GWAS) of log natural annual change of estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (n=334,339), cross-sectional creatinine- and cystatin-based eGFR, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (n=1,201,909) as kidney function outcome.

ResultsThe annual change of eGFR was attenuated by genetically proxied PCSK9I ({beta}=0.066 per mmol/L LDL lowering; 95%CI 0.008,0.125). Cross-sectional eGFRcrea was increased by CCBs ({beta}=0.006 per 10 mmHg SBP lowering; 95%CI 0.001,0.011), SGLT2I ({beta}=0.024-0.028), MC1 ({beta}=0.022), and GDF15 ({beta}=0.094-0.100) per 6.7 mmol/mol HbA1c lowering. Statins and NPC1L1I may reduce eGFR and SGLT2I may decrease annual eGFR change.

This systematic review examines the hypothesis that therapeutic efficacy correlates with the developmental origin of neoplasms, specifically proposing differential responses to cellular immunotherapy (mesoderm), protein/organelle-targeted therapy (endoderm), and nucleic acid-based interventions (ectoderm). Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and clinical trial registries from January 2020 to June 2025. Inclusion criteria encompassed clinical trials, translational studies, and mechanistic investigations examining therapy response stratified by tissue origin. Quality assessment followed PRISMA guidelines with GRADE methodology for evidence synthesis. Results: Analysis of 127 studies (n=487,293 patients) revealed significant associations between germ layer origin and treatment response. Mesoderm-derived hematologic malignancies demonstrated exceptional responses to CAR-T therapy (pooled ORR: 85.3%, 95% CI: 82.1-88.5%), significantly exceeding responses in solid tumors (p<0.001). Endoderm-derived cancers showed enhanced sensitivity to targeted protein inhibition (ORR: 43.7%, 95% CI: 39.2-48.2%) and organelle-directed therapies. Ectoderm-derived neoplasms exhibited promising responses to nucleic acid interventions, with mRNA vaccines reducing recurrence risk by 49% (HR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.29-0.91) in melanoma. However, molecular biomarkers including microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) frequently demonstrated stronger predictive value than developmental origin alone. Conclusions: While embryonic germ layer origin influences therapeutic response patterns, the relationship proves more complex than initially hypothesized. Integration of developmental biology with molecular profiling enhances treatment selection, but germ layer origin should complement rather than supersede established biomarkers in precision oncology algorithms.

Despite their relevance to human pulmonary fibrosis, the exotic molecular profile of Aberrant Basaloid cells has obscured their etiology, preventing insights into how or why these cells emerge with fibrosis. Here we identify cellular intermediaries between Aberrant Basaloid and normal alveolar epithelial cells in human IPF tissue. We track the emergence of Aberrant Basaloid cells from alveolar epithelial cells ex vivo and uncover a role for similar cells in epithelial regeneration under normal conditions. Lastly, we characterize the epigenetic changes that distinguish Aberrant Basaloid cells from their progenitors and identify hallmarks of AP-1 injury memory retention.

However, current tools employing variational inference on single-cell datasets, including methods for paired and mosaic integration, transfer learning, and modality imputation, typically act as black boxes. This lack of interpretability makes it challenging to evaluate whether biological variation is preserved, which can compromise downstream analyses. Here, we introduce NetworkVI, a sparse deep generative model designed for the integration and interpretation of multimodal single-cell data. NetworkVI utilizes biological prior knowledge as an inductive bias, specifically it relies on gene-gene interactions inferred from topologically associated domains and structured ontologies like the Gene Ontology to aggregate gene embeddings to cell embeddings, enhancing the interpretability at the gene and subcellular level. While achieving state-of-the-art data integration, modality imputation, and cell label transfer via query-to-reference mapping benchmarks across bimodal and trimodal datasets, NetworkVI additionally excels in providing biologically meaningful modality- and cell type-specific interpretations. NetworkVI aids researchers in identifying associations between genes and biological processes and uncovers immune evasion mechanisms in a Perturb CITE-seq dataset of melanoma cells. NetworkVI will support researchers in interpreting cellular disease mechanisms, guiding biomarker discovery, and ultimately aiding the development of targeted therapies in large-scale single-cell multimodal atlases.

In modern landscape models, attractors represent cell types, and stochastic jumps and bifurcations drive cellular decisions, allowing for quantitative and predictive descriptions. However, given a biological problem of interest, we still lack tools to infer and build possible Waddington landscapes systematically. In this study, we propose a generative model for deriving epigenetic landscapes compatible with data. To build the landscapes, we combine gradient and rotational vector fields composed of locally weighted elements that encode  valleys of the Waddington landscape, resulting in interpretable models. We optimize landscapes through computational evolution and illustrate our approach with two developmental examples: metazoan segmentation and neuromesoderm differentiation. In both cases, we obtain ensembles of solutions that reveal both known and novel landscapes in terms of topology and bifurcations. Conversely, topographic features appear strongly constrained by dynamical data, which suggests that our approach can generically derive interpretable and predictive epigenetic landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

Unlike traditional learning rules, BTSP learns correlations on the timescales of seconds and rapidly changes single-unit activity in only a few trials. To explore how BTSP-like learning can be integrated into network models, we propose a generalized BTSP rule (gBTSP), which we apply to unsupervised and supervised learning tasks, in both feedforward and recurrent networks. Unsupervised gBTSP mirrors classical frameworks of competitive learning, learning place field maps (in the feed-forward case), and attractive memory networks (in the recurrent case). For supervised learning, we show that plateau events can reduce task error, enabling gBTSP to solve tasks such as trajectory matching and delayed non-match-to-sample. However, we find that credit assignment via gBTSP becomes harder to achieve with increased network depth or CA3-like recurrence. This suggests that additional features may be needed to support BTSP-mediated few-shot learning of complex tasks in the hippocampus.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

Their carriage often corresponds with changes to the host transcriptome, but it is unknown during which stage of the conjugation process these transcriptional changes are initiated, and how gene transfer is modulated as they occur. This is because they are normally studied after their full acquisition by conjugation has already occurred, not during the process. Here, active RP4 conjugation revealed that the transcriptional response to plasmid acquisition is almost immediate and is host and surface factor dependent. Responses included activation of non-SOS stress pathways, motility, exopolysaccharide production, anaerobic respiration, and metabolic adaptation. These responses were not a barrier to conjugation, indicating that their significance relates to host homeostasis rather than gene transfer. The recipient could prevent these responses by blocking conjugation through capsule expression. RP4 expression was also inhibited by recipient capsule, since capsule physically blocked donor-recipient contact. Unexpectedly, within a population, RP4 was found to exploit single cell variation in recipient capsule thickness and to successfully conjugate with recipient bacteria with reduced capsule. These results show a novel interplay between plasmid and surface architecture across diverse species that controls the conjugation transcriptional landscape, with important ramifications for plasmid dissemination and evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

For this reason, the genetic profiles of Genghis Khan and his descendants are of keen academic and public interest. His Y-chromosome has been hypothesized to belong to haplogroup C3* (C2a1a3-F1918) but this has yet to be substantiated. To explore the genetic ancestry of Genghis Khan, we analyzed four archaeological individuals from the Golden Horde, including three males and one female, who were buried in separate medieval elite mausoleums in the Ulitau region of Kazakstan. One of the males is believed to be Joshi (Juchi), the eldest son of Genghis Khan. We generated genomic data from these archaeological individuals and found that the three males were paternally related, sharing the Y-chromosome haplogroup C3*, consistent with the hypothesized signature haplotype of Genghis Khan. In addition, we confirm that the Golden Horde elites derived most of their genomes from Ancient Northeast Asians (ANA) while having an additional ancestral component from either Ancient North Eurasians (ANE) or a Berel Scythian related population. Furthermore, we were able to identify their medieval relatives in the Mongolian Plateau through constructing an Identity by Descent (IBD) network.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

Evolutionarily-young L1s are transcribed in human pluripotent stem cells, but how CpG methylation is patterned to these L1s upon exit of pluripotency is unknown. Here we investigate the critical functions of chromatin regulator MORC2 in epigenome reprogramming of the repetitive genome in early human neurodevelopment. We find that reversible ATP-dependent dimerization is required for MORC2 accumulation over L1s but not gene promoters. Mutation of the MORC2 ATPase module, causative for neurodevelopmental disorders, severely disrupts the distribution of MORC2 chromatin binding, leading to simultaneous loss of L1 transcriptional control and hyper-repression of clustered ZNF genes in human pluripotent stem cells. Upon neural differentiation these phenotypes persist due to striking, targeted defects in CpG methylation patterning. Together our results define the vital role of MORC2 in safeguarding the somatic human genome upon exit of pluripotency by directing CpG methylation patterning over transcriptionally-active retrotransposons in a manner analogous to the piRNA pathway in the germline.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

Here, we present a comprehensive proximity labeling study of five conserved Caenorhabditis elegans proteins--NEKL-2, NEKL-3, MLT-2, MLT-3, and MLT-4--that form two NEKL-MLT kinase-scaffold subcomplexes involved in membrane trafficking and actin regulation. Using endogenously expressed TurboID fusions and a data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry (MS) pipeline, we profiled NEKL-MLT interactomes across 23 experiments, including several methodological variations, applying stringent controls and filtering strategies. By analyzing and comparing experimental outcomes, we develop a set of intuitive quantitative metrics to assess experimental outcomes and quality. We demonstrate that DIA-based workflows produce sensitive physiologically relevant findings, even in the presence of experimental noise and variability across biological replicates. Our approach is validated through the identification of known NEKL-MLT binding partners and conserved genetic suppressors of nekl-mlt mutant phenotypes. Gene ontology enrichment further supports the involvement of newly identified NEKL-MLT interactors in processes including membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal regulation, and cell adhesion. Additionally, several novel proximate interactors were functionally validated using genetic assays. Our findings underscore the utility of DIA-MS in proximity labeling applications and highlight the value of incorporating internal controls, quantitative metrics, and biological validation to enhance confidence in candidate interactors.

Spacer acquisition relies on the Cas1-Cas2 integrase and accessory proteins like Cas4, which select DNA sequences flanked by the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and insert them into the CRISPR array. It has been shown that in type II-A systems selection of PAM-proximal prespacers is mediated by the effector nuclease Cas9, which forms a  supercomplex with the Cas1-Cas2 integrase and the Csn2 protein.

Although dietary tryptophan is associated with various health benefits, excessive intake can result in adverse physiological effects. The specific tryptophan-derived metabolites responsible for such toxicity, however, remain incompletely characterized. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying tryptophan-induced toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We observe that tryptophan concentrations of 1 mM or higher are highly toxic to C. elegans, blocking egg hatching. Notably, supplementation with various sugars alleviates this toxicity. Genetic analyses reveal that host tryptophan metabolism is dispensable for the observed effects. Instead, bacterial metabolism, particularly the conversion of tryptophan to indole, is essential for mediating toxicity. Bacterial strains deficient in indole production abolished tryptophan-induced toxicity, and all sugars that conferred protection also suppressed bacterial indole synthesis. These findings demonstrate that tryptophan toxicity in C. elegans is primarily mediated by microbial metabolism and underscore the pivotal role of host-microbiota interactions in shaping the physiological consequences of dietary amino acid intake.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

Common wisdom holds that G should respond to drift only as a scaled reduction. In contrast, I find that drift causes drastic and predictable shifts in the orientation of G by driving genetic correlations to their extremes. Biologically, this is a consequence of linkage build-up introduced by drift. I compare these theoretical results to empirical observations based on experiments conducted by Phillips et. al. (2001). Additionally, to derive the model of G-matrix evolution, I developed a novel synthetic framework for modelling ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations carrying multivariate traits. By striking a balance between genetic detail and analytical tractability, and by minimizing requisite technical background, this framework is optimized for deriving new models across a wide range of topics in population biology. Foundations of the framework are formalized by the theory of measure-valued processes, but application of the framework only requires multivariate calculus, and heuristics are presented in the main text for making additional calculations involving stochastic processes. Collectively, this work establishes a powerful framework enabling efficient formal analysis of integrated population processes across evolution and ecology, and its potential for making new discoveries is illustrated by novel findings on fundamental aspects of G-matrix evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

Search queries may vary in size from short gene sequences to multiple whole genomes that are too large to fit in computer memory. In microbial genomics, a routine search application involving both large queries and large collections is the removal of contaminating host genome sequences from microbial (meta)genomes. Where the host is human, sensitive classification and excision of host sequences is usually necessary to protect host genetic information. Precise classification is also critical in order to retain microbial sequences and permit accurate microbial genomic analysis. While human pangenomes have been shown to increase sensitivity of human sequence classification, existing bioinformatic host depletion approaches have either limited precision when used with metagenomes or large computing resource requirements.

ResultsWe present Deacon, an efficient and versatile sequence filter for raw sequence files and streams. We demonstrate its leading accuracy for the task of host depletion, using less computing resource than existing approaches. By querying a human pangenome index for minimizers contained in each input sequence, Deacon is able to accurately classify and discard diverse human sequences from long reads at over 250Mbp/s with a commodity laptop. We present validation of classification sensitivity, specificity and speed with simulated short and long reads for diverse catalogues of human, bacterial and viral genomes alongside existing methods. Beyond host depletion, Deacon is well suited to common sequence search and filtering applications, particularly those involving large queries. Capable of indexing a human genome in under 30s, Deacon is equipped to rapidly compose custom minimizer indexes using set operations, facilitating efficient search and filtering of massive sequence datasets using gigabase queries.

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.

Growth suppression by ppGpp is implicated in the formation of persister cells, which survive antibiotic challenge only to regrow once the drug is removed. However, there is also evidence that low levels of ppGpp contribute to resistance to certain cell wall-active antibiotics in actively growing cells. To characterize ppGpps contribution to antibiotic resistance, we measured MICs of a panel of {beta}-lactams in actively growing Escherichia coli cells overexpressing a ppGpp synthase (relA*). Cells engineered to modestly overproduce ppGpp exhibited up to 64-fold increases in resistance to PBP2-targeting {beta}-lactams only, with mecillinam the most dramatically affected. Resistance required the transcription factor DksA and the class A penicillin binding protein (PBP) PBP1B. PBP1B variants defective for transpeptidase activity, glycosyltransferase activity, or both were incapable of mediating resistance, suggesting the full enzymatic activity of PBP1B is required for resistance. Transcriptomics revealed that ppGpp overproduction leads to increased expression of lpoB, which encodes an activator of PBP1B. LpoB was required for mecillinam resistance, with an lpoB deletion mutant exhibiting a loss of ppGpp-dependent resistance. Resistance was partially lost in an lpoB deletion strain expressing an LpoB-bypass variant of PBP1B (mrcB*). Together these results support a model wherein overproduction of ppGpp favors cell wall synthesis by PBP1B, in part via increased expression of lpoB, allowing PBP1B to substitute for PBP2 when it is inhibited by {beta}-lactams.

ImportanceAntimicrobial resistance is an increasing global health threat, but the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance remain incompletely understood. This work clarifies the role of the alarmone ppGpp in mediating antibiotic resistance in the model bacterium Escherichia coli. Elevated levels of ppGpp were found to cause resistance to {beta}-lactam antibiotics targeting the cell wall synthesis enzyme PBP2. Resistance required transcriptional regulation by ppGpp and enzymatic activity of the cell wall enzyme PBP1B. This work suggests that ppGpp causes resistance in part by increasing expression of lpoB, which encodes an activator of PBP1B. Because ppGpp levels are controlled by nutritional conditions, this work suggests that nutritional availability could impact the efficacy of antibiotics. Furthermore, this study adds to a number of studies demonstrating that cell wall synthesizing PBP enzymes can compensate for one another under certain conditions, leading to {beta}-lactam resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

Chronic active white matter lesions (CAL), identifiable radiologically as paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), indicate progression-relevant chronic neuroinflammation. Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) and T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood immune cells of 34 radiologically characterized adults with MS (17 untreated, 6 treated with B-cell-depletion) and 5 healthy controls. Coupled with proteomics, we found PRL-associated enrichment of interferon (IFN) signaling and upregulation of TCR signaling in CSF and blood. This was accompanied by clonal expansion of CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, with the highly expanded clonal cells exhibiting T helper type 1 (TH1) and cytotoxic profiles. Validating the cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells. Despite B-cell depletion, PRL-associated neuroinflammation, driven by myeloid activation and CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, persisted. Serum and CSF proteomic networks showed PRL-pertinent signatures, including networks unaffected by B-cell depletion. Using in silico perturbation, we nominated therapeutic targets, including MYD88, TNF, MYC, TYK2, JAK2, and BTK, for alleviating chronic neuroinflammation in MS. Our findings highlight mechanisms of chronic neuroinflammation in MS and point to potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

Lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenases (encoded by the gene xoxF) are now recognized as the key catalysts for methylotrophy in many environments, yet the identity of the most transcriptionally active methylotrophs (""Clade X"") has remained elusive. Here we show that ""Clade X"" methylotrophs belong to the deep-branching alphaproteobacterial order TMED127, which we propose be renamed  Methylaecorales;  methyl for  methylotrophic metabolism and  aecor for  ocean surface, as these bacteria are most transcriptionally active near the sea surface. TMED127/Methylaecorales have small, streamlined genomes ([~]1.5 Mb) and appear to be obligate methylotrophs that use the serine cycle for carbon assimilation. TMED127/Methylaecorales showed a diel pattern of xoxF5 and glucose dehydrogenase (gdh) transcription, peaking in the late afternoon, in oligotrophic surface water of the Sargasso Sea. Several other highly transcribed genes of unknown function had no homologs outside of TMED127/Methylaecorales genomes. Our findings illuminate an overlooked marine methylotrophic bacterium and predict a diel cycle of methanol production in surface seawater by an unknown pathway.

ImportanceMethanol metabolism is increasingly recognized as an important process in the marine carbon cycle, yet the identity and metabolism of the microorganisms mediating methylotrophy in the open ocean have remained unknown. This study reveals that bacteria in the TMED127 order of Alphaproteobacteria, proposed new name of ""Methylaecorales"", abundantly transcribe the key gene for lanthanide-dependent methylotrophy in oligotrophic surface waters of the worlds oceans. TMED127/Methylaecorales likely require methanol as a carbon and energy source, and display a diel pattern of transcription of key genes for methylotrophy that peaks in the late afternoon. These findings motivate future studies on the mechanisms of methanol production in surface seawater.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

E has proton channel activity that prevents premature rearrangement of the spike glycoprotein as virions encounter acidic compartments as they exit the cell. How infected cells respond to this pH disruption during coronavirus infection is unknown. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 E ion channel activity triggers the proton pump V-ATPases to recruit the ATG16L1 complex during infection. This results in ATG8 molecules such as LC3B decorating perturbed compartments. This recruitment of autophagy machinery does not inhibit viral replication, rather SARS-CoV-2 exploits this response. Inhibition of the V-ATPase/ATG16L1 interaction using the Salmonella effector SopF inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Careful distinction between use of the autophagic machinery from canonical macroautophagy is required in order to better understand coronavirus replication and for rational targeting of any potential host-directed therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1750371001025

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1750371001025

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1750371001025
