MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1744150111062

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

Early cases were associated with this market, and environmental sequencing placed the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity within the market. Phylogenetic analysis also suggested separate introductions of lineages A and B into the human population, a finding that can be tested with additional data. Here, we curated an expanded sequence dataset of early SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes, including newly available sequences from mid-January 2020. In this dataset, we found no additional support for previously proposed alternative progenitor sequences, or for any evolutionary intermediates between lineages A and B in the human population. Instead, we identified SARS-CoV-2 lineages that may have spread from the market, and additional samples of a sublineage of lineage A with three mutations, including one found in closely related bat coronaviruses. Although our analysis of early pandemic genomes suggests that this mutation is unlikely to characterize the immediate SARS-CoV-2 ancestor, it is more plausible than two previously proposed ancestral genomes. These findings reinforce the proposed emergence of SARS-CoV-2 from the wildlife trade at the Huanan market, demonstrating how new data continues to both solidify and clarify our understanding of how the pandemic began.","NA","biorxiv",1744150111062

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt). Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges' g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges' g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms. Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta 2 and M 2 against G protein coupled alpha 1, beta 1, beta 2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3 mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014). These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta 2 and M 2), specific epitopes of the COVID virus's SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000) Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.

The effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in adolescents in real-world settings is not well understood.

OBJECTIVETo evaluate the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in adolescents aged 12 to 20 years given within the first five days of acute COVID-19 illness on illness severity during the acute (days 0 to 27) and post-acute phases (days 28 to 179).

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSThis target trial emulation used the electronic health records (EHR) data from twenty-nine medical institutions participating in the NIHs RECOVER consortium. We included data collected between April 1, 2022 and December 31, 2023, and included all patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not hospitalized on the day of entry. Those who were treated with oral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days after the positive test (n=2,923) and those who did not received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days after the positive test during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection (control group, n=31,947) were identified.

EXPOSURESTreatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir based on prescription records.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESWe used modified Poisson regression models for binary outcomes to examine the effects of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir on acute phase hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visits, and outpatient visits as well as progression to moderate or severe acute illness among individuals treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir compared to control counterparts. Additionally, we assessed the medications associations with 16 conditions and symptoms during the acute phase of illness and its subsequent association with specific Long COVID diagnostic code U09.9 during the post-acute phase. We reported the absolute risks and estimated the relative risks (RRs), with adjustments made for demographic variables, clinical characteristics, and healthcare utilization, using propensity score matching.

RESULTSThe study cohort included 34,870 adolescents (median [Q1, Q3] age 16.0 [14.0, 18.0]); 46.0% male and 43.2% Non-Hispanic White. Among these patients, 2,923 were treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days of cohort entry and 31,947 received no treatment. The absolute rates were 0.58% vs. 0.96% for hospitalization, 74.17% vs. 82.66% for outpatient visits, 1.81% vs. 2.28% for ED visits, 3.08% vs. 3.99% for moderate/severe acute illness, and 0.21% vs. 0.20% for long COVID diagnosis in the treatment vs. control group. After propensity score matching, during acute-phase period, compared to the control group, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was associated with reduced risk of any hospitalization (relative risk (RR) 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29-0.80), outpatient visit (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.82-0.90), and moderate/severe acute illness (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.56-0.87). Additionally, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was associated with reduced risk of 7 of 16 specified conditions in chest pain (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.26-0.63), fatigue and malaise (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.32-0.76), generalized pain (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.45-0.95), headache (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.44-0.83), mental health (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.39-0.80), musculoskeletal (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.94), and respiratory signs and symptoms (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52-0.71). No evidence was found to suggest that the treatment was associated with the risk of long COVID diagnosis U09.9 (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.40-2.32).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEThis study found that treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in adolescents within 5 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection, was associated with reduced risk of acute-phase COVID-19 illness and subsequent healthcare utilization. However, treatment was not associated with a lower risk of Long COVID diagnosis.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduce the acute COVID-19 illness severity and the risk of developing Long COVID in adolescents aged 12 to 20 years?

FindingsIn this target trial emulation study of 34,870 adolescents with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not hospitalized on the cohort entry day, 2,923 who were treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir exhibited lower acute illness severity including reduced risk of 7 of 16 specified conditions and symptoms, as well as reduced risk of acute-phase hospitalization and outpatient visits, compared with 31,947 who received no treatment. The association with reduced risk of Long COVID was not observed in this study.

MeaningIn adolescents, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir appears to be effective at reducing the severity of acute COVID illness but was not associated with the risk of developing Long COVID.","NA","medrxiv",1744150111062

Many recent studies have quantified their adverse events with a focus on gastrointestinal adverse events. However, no large epidemiologic study has investigated the risk of hair loss with these medications. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of hair loss. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone. The adjusted hazard ratio for hair loss for all patients using semaglutide, for men, and for women compared to bupropion-naltrexone were 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.86-2.69), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.05-14.49), and 2.08 (95% CI: 1.17-3.72) respectively. Our results demonstrate an increased risk of hair loss with semaglutide in women. Future studies are required to ascertain the association between semaglutide and hair loss.","NA","medrxiv",1744150111062

Recently, a novel approach for the fast and efficient differentiation of ovarian support cells (OSCs) to generate a versatile platform for basic research and clinical applications was demonstrated. This study details the clinical process development and application of an OSC product, known as Fertilo, to improve the in vitro maturation (IVM) of human oocytes, a method referred to as OSC-IVM. First, transcription factor (TF) mediated OSC differentiation using research-grade raw materials was shown to produce granulosa-like cells that improve the MII maturation rate of human oocytes. To support clinical application, several raw material upgrades were initiated, including substitution of the differentiation matrix with a higher-quality alternative, laminin-521, and the generation of a clinically suitable hiPSC seed bank and master cell bank. Single cell RNA sequencing of OSCs generated using the updated protocol for clinical translation demonstrated the consistency and reproducibility of cellular outcomes. Next, analytical release testing of the clinical product was performed and a murine oocyte maturation assay was developed to establish the potency of OSCs for use in OSC-IVM. Finally, the qualified Fertilo product was applied in a two-phase longitudinal cohort analysis, with the results showing improvement in key outcomes compared to traditional IVM treatment. Our findings demonstrate the first-time clinical development and application of an hiPSC-derived product to improve reproductive outcomes after IVM and advance womens health.","NA","medrxiv",1744150111062

Early studies of mtDNA variation provided the first genetic evidence for the African origin of modern humans. With complete mitochondrial genome sequencing, we can now reconstruct maternal lineages with high resolution, yet large parts of the continent remain underrepresented. Using a newly developed long-range sequencing assay, we generated 1,288 complete mitochondrial genomes from 14 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on previously understudied regions. We combined these with over 3,600 publicly available African mitogenomes to produce a comprehensive dataset and updated overview of maternal genetic diversity across the continent. We contextualized this diversity with autosomal structure and information on major human expansions, integrating archaeological and linguistic evidence. Our analyses reveal a demographic expansion of Niger-Congo speakers around 17 thousand years ago (kya), followed by a second expansion associated with Bantu-speaking groups around 6 kya. We identify haplogroup L3e as a key marker of this early Bantu expansion, tracking its spread across sub-Saharan Africa. Distinct demographic signatures also emerge for different geographic sub-branches of Bantu speakers. These findings highlight the power of mitochondrial DNA to trace maternal ancestry and demographic history in Africa, while also acknowledging its limitations for phylogeographic reconstruction.","NA","biorxiv",1744150111062

While previous studies have focused on characterizing PASC and identifying its subphenotypes in children and adolescents following an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, the risks of PASC with Omicron-variant reinfections remain unclear. Using a real-world data approach, this study investigates the risks of PASC following reinfections during the Omicron phase in the pediatric population.

OBJECTIVETo investigate the risks of PASC diagnosis and 24 PASC symptoms and conditions after reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 during Omicron period in the pediatric population.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 40 childrens hospitals and health institutions in U.S. between January 2022 and October 2023.

EXPOSURESA second SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) or antigen tests, or a diagnose of COVID-19, occurring at least 60 days after the initial infection, compared to the initial infection.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESPASC was identified using two approaches: (1) the ICD-10- CM diagnosis code U09.9 and (2) a symptom-based definition including 24 physician-identified symptoms and conditions. Absolute risks of incident PASC were reported, and relative risks (RRs) were calculated by comparing the second infection episode with the first infection episode groups using a modified Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through exact matching and propensity scoring matching.

RESULTSA total of 465,717 individuals under 21 years old (mean [SD] age 8.17 [6.58] years; 52% male) were included. Compared to the first infection, a second infection was associated with significantly increased risk of an overall PASC diagnosis (RR, 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-2.59), and with many specific conditions including: myocarditis (RR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.46-8.86); changes in taste and smell (RR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.41-5.67); thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism (RR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.71-3.04); heart disease (RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.69 to 2.28); acute kidney injury (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.38 to 2.61); fluid and electrolyte (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.62 to 2.20); generalized pain (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.48 to 1.95); arrhythmias (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.45-1.74); abnormal liver enzyme (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.96); fatigue and malaise (RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.64); musculoskeletal pain (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.37 to 1.54); abdominal pain (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.34 to 1.50); postural orthostatic tachycardia syndromes (POTS)/dysautonomia (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.51); cognitive functions (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.50); and respiratory signs and symptoms (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.33). The risks were consistent across various organ systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEChildren and adolescents face significantly higher risk of various PASC outcomes after reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest a cumulative risk of PASC and highlight the urgent need for targeted prevention strategies to reduce reinfections, which includes an increased emphasis on initial or re-vaccination of children.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDo children and adolescents face an increased risk of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) following reinfection during the Omicron era?

FindingsDuring the post-acute phase, children and adolescents with reinfection are at statistically significant increased risk of incident PASC outcomes, including an overall PASC diagnosis and 24 most commonly complaints/symptoms/diagnoses associated with PASC. The risks remained consistent across different demographic and clinical subgroups.

MeaningThese findings underscore the significant long-term health risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in children and adolescents. Public health strategies should prioritize reinfection prevention, including enhanced vaccination efforts, to mitigate the burden of PASC in the pediatric population.","NA","medrxiv",1744150111062

We present BoltzDesign1, which inverts the Boltz-1 model, an open source reproduction of AlphaFold3, to enable the design of protein binders for diverse molecular targets without requiring model fine-tuning. By utilizing only the Pairformer and Confidence modules, our method significantly reduces computational costs while achieving outstanding in silico success rates and diversity in binder generation. Optimizing directly on the distogram allows us to shape the probability distribution of atomic distances, rather than adjusting a single structure, steering the design toward sequences that yield robust structures with well-defined energy minima. By leveraging a fully atomic model trained on a wide variety of macromolecules, we can generate diverse heterocomplexes with flexible ligand conformations a capability not currently matched by existing methods. This approach enables the design of novel protein interactions with potential applications in biosensors, enzyme engineering, therapeutic development, and biotechnological innovations.","NA","biorxiv",1744150111062

In nature, protein folds are well-conserved over the course of evolution, such that there are 100,000 times as many extant protein sequences than there are folds. Despite their common shapes, similar protein folds can adopt wide-ranging functions, raising the question: are protein folds so strongly conserved for the purpose of maintaining function-driving energetic changes in protein families? Here we show that a set of key energetic relationships in a family of bacterial transcription factors (TFs) is conserved using high-resolution hydrogen exchange/mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations. We compared the TFs to their anciently diverged structural homologs, the periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs), expecting that protein families that share the same fold and bind the same sugars would have similar energetic responses. Surprisingly, our findings reveal the opposite: the ""energetic blueprints"" of the PBPs and the TFs are largely distinct, with the allosteric network of the TFs evolving specifically to support the functional requirements of genome regulation, versus conserved interactions with membrane transport machinery in PBPs. These results demonstrate how the same fold can be adapted for different sense/response functions via family-specific energetic requirements - even when responding to the same chemical trigger. Understanding the evolutionarily conserved energetic blueprint for a protein family provides a roadmap for designing functional proteins de novo, and will help us treat aberrant protein behavior in conserved domains in disease-related drug targets, where engineering selectivity is challenging.","NA","biorxiv",1744150111062

Despite nearly a century of research, the computations underlying this projection have not been adequately addressed. In the present study, we employed model-driven psychophysics to fill this gap. We hypothesized that tool-based sensory projection involves the remapping of touch from sensory feedback in the hand into an egocentric coordinate system. We first formalized the computational steps underlying tactile remapping. We designed a novel tool-sensing experiment that allowed us to rigorously test this model. In this task, participants contacted an object with a hand-held rod and then judged whether the object was above or below where they were currently looking. This comparison would only be possible if touch on the tool was projected outside the hand. Crucially, both object location and gaze position varied independently, allowing us to characterize the hand-to-space-to-gaze remapping process. Model-based curve fitting provided strong evidence that all participants in our task projected touch outside their body and into gaze-centered coordinates. Crucially, the resolution of this projection was similar to what has been found for touch on the body. These findings provide the first step towards characterizing the computations underlying the spatial projection of touch on external objects, highlighting the incredible versatility of the sensorimotor system.","NA","biorxiv",1744150111062

While abnormal crossover recombination is known to confer risk for aneuploidy, limited data have hindered understanding of the potential shared genetic basis of these key molecular phenotypes. To address this gap, we performed retrospective analysis of preimplantation genetic testing data from 139,416 in vitro fertilized embryos from 22,850 sets of biological parents. By tracing transmission of haplotypes, we identified 3,656,198 crossovers, as well as 92,485 aneuploid chromosomes. Counts of crossovers were lower in aneuploid versus euploid embryos, consistent with their role in chromosome pairing and segregation. Our analyses further revealed that a common haplotype spanning the meiotic cohesin SMC1B is significantly associated with both crossover count and maternal meiotic aneuploidy, with evidence supporting a non-coding cis-regulatory mechanism. Transcriptome- and phenome-wide association tests also implicated variation in the synaptonemal complex component C14orf39 and crossover-regulating ubiquitin ligases CCNB1IP1 and RNF212 in meiotic aneuploidy risk.

Unlike sharks, chimaeras lack scales and do not have serially replacing rows of serrated teeth crowned with enameloid. Instead, they possess a fused dentition of dentine toothplates. Additionally, male chimaeras develop an articulated cartilaginous facial appendage, the tenaculum, which is covered in an arcade of tooth-like structures. These seeming extraoral teeth remain poorly understood, and their evolutionary origin is unclear. We investigate the development of the tenaculum and its teeth throughout the ontogeny of the Spotted Ratfish, Hydrolagus colliei, to assess homology and convergence between this novel craniofacial feature and oral jaws. Our study aims to: (1) describe the development of the tenaculum, (2) assess tenaculum tooth development in comparison to oral teeth and denticles, and (3) characterize the genes and tissues responsible for tenaculum tooth emergence. We found that juvenile male chimaeras develop a full tenaculum before tooth development is complete and that only mature males possess a fully toothed tenaculum. These extraoral teeth emerge from within the tenaculum rather than from the surrounding epithelium. We integrate our developmental data with fossil evidence of the tenacula dentition from the Carboniferous holocephalan Helodus simplex. Our findings show that the tenaculum is closely associated with the upper jaw and that tenacula dentition resembles separate shark-like oral tooth whorls more than modified dermal denticles.

Significance StatementThe development and evolutionary history of extraoral dentition in vertebrates remain largely unexplored. This study investigates the ontogeny of the male tenaculum, a unique feature of chimaeras, revealing a tooth development pathway similar to the oral dentition in sharks. By integrating fossil data and molecular techniques, we hypothesize that tenaculum teeth are homologous to oral teeth rather than modified skin denticles, providing key insights into the plasticity of odontogenesis and craniofacial diversity in vertebrates.","NA","biorxiv",1744150111062

There has been increasing evidence for post-transcriptional control of SPI gene expression by Hfq-dependent small RNAs (sRNAs) such as PinT. This 80-nucleotide sRNA is highly expressed after Salmonella enters host cells and modulates the transition from the SPI-1 to SPI-2 program by targeting different virulence factor mRNAs. It has been elusive, however, how PinT activity could be counteracted when virulence gene suppression were to be relieved. To identify putative inhibitors of PinT, we have mapped the RNA interactome of Salmonella recovered from infected macrophages, using an optimized version of the RIL-seq method. Next to offering an unprecedented view of Hfq-mediated RNA interactions during Salmonella's intracellular infection stage, RIL-seq uncovered the 3' end-derived sRNA InvS as a direct negative regulator of PinT. Biochemical and genetic experiments suggest a decoy mechanism whereby InvS lifts the PinT-mediated repression of virulence factors. Additionally, InvS acts as an mRNA repressor of the host cell adhesion protein, MipA, and PinT interaction with InvS relieves mipA repression.

Earlier studies in Arabidopsis thaliana and other plant species have revealed the eminent role of alternative precursor mRNA splicing (AS), which allows fine-tuning the expression of numerous genes including light signaling and photosynthesis-related components in response to the ambient light conditions. Starting from the previous finding that AS changes induced by either light or metabolic signals are linked to phospho-signaling, we applied phospho-proteomics to identify proteins that undergo rapid changes in their phosphorylation status upon exposing etiolated seedlings to either light or sucrose. This approach revealed hyperphosphorylation of RS41, a member of the RS subfamily of serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins. To study the function of the four RS genes RS31, RS31a, RS40, and RS41, a comprehensive set of single and higher order mutants was generated. A complete loss of RS function in the quadruple mutant caused sterility. Moreover, the important role of the RS proteins in seedling photomorphogenesis was demonstrated, with both redundant and specific functions in the regulation of hypocotyl elongation and cotyledon opening. We further identified the critical contribution of the RS proteins to light-dependent alternative splicing, being part of an intricate network of splicing regulatory components.

Transposable elements (TEs) are increasingly recognized as contributors to genome evolution, but their role in shaping neural crest regulatory programs remains underexplored. Here, we investigate the domestication of human-specific TEs as transcriptional enhancers during cranial neural crest cell (CNCC) specification, a process critical for vertebrate head development. Using human iPSC-derived CNCCs, we identified ~250 human-specific TEs acting as active enhancers. These TEs were predominantly LTR5Hs and, to a lesser extent, SVA-E/Fs. We demonstrate that these elements have been co-opted through the acquisition of the conserved CNCC coordinator motif, and are bound by the CNCC signature factor TWIST1, and that their co-option appears to be largely exclusive to CNCCs. To assess their functional relevance, we used CRISPR-interference to repress ~75% of all the LTR5Hs and SVAs active in CNCCs, which led to widespread transcriptional changes in genes associated with neural crest migration, a process essential for CNCCs to populate the embryo and form craniofacial structures. Using a cell migration assay, we showed that CNCC migration was significantly impaired by CRISPR-mediated TE repression. Finally, we demonstrate that genes near human-specific TEs are more highly expressed in human CNCCs relative to chimpanzee, and TE repression returns their expression to chimpanzee levels. These findings reveal how human-specific TEs have been co-opted to fine-tune CNCC regulatory networks, potentially contributing to the evolution of lineage-specific craniofacial traits.","NA","biorxiv",1744150111062

However, it remains unclear how diverse cellular phenotypes are modulated by p53. In this study, we developed an optogenetic tool, Opto-p53, to control p53 signaling by light. Opto-p53 was designed to trigger p53 signaling by reconstituting p53 N-terminal and C-terminal fragments with a light-inducible dimerization (LID) system. Upon light exposure, cells expressing Opto-p53 demonstrated p53 transcriptional activation, resulting in cell death and cell cycle arrest. We further enhanced the efficacy of light-induced p53 activation by introducing specific mutations into Opto-p53 fragments. Our findings unveil the capability of Opto-p53 to serve as a powerful tool for dissecting the complex roles of p53 in cellular processes, thereby contributing to the field of synthetic biology and providing general design principles for optogenetic tools using endogenous transcription factors.","NA","biorxiv",1744150111062

To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1744150111062

Here, we describe a molecular technology for imaging and manipulation of homeostatic microglia in live organisms (e.g., in zebrafish and mice) by covalently targeting the purinergic receptor, P2RY12. Using this technology, we imaged microglia-pathogen interactions in the larval zebrafish brain and revealed various morphological states of microglia in the adult mouse brain. We further expanded the microglia labelling approach to single-microglia tracking and microglial surfaceome mapping using photoactivatable fluorophores and photoproximity labelling, respectively. We anticipate the use of this universal tool for studying microglial biology across species to reveal the dynamics and polarization of resting microglia into a reactive state found in many neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1744150111062

We previously showed that chromosome segregation error phenotypes are frequent in the first mitotic division of the human embryo. However, the cause of these errors and impact on daughter cell karyotype is unknown. Here, using live chromosome imaging and next generation sequencing we show that activation of the microtubule depolymerase KIF2C reduces chromosome segregation errors and mitotic-origin aneuploidy at the 2-cell stage. The number of first divisions that show alternative cleavage patterns (associated with failed embryo development in IVF clinics) are also reduced with KIF2C activation.

Mental symptoms of PCS (fatigue/exhaustion/weakness, reduced performance, concentration and memory problems, sleep disorders and depressed mood) were reported by 12.1% and mental symptoms of PCVS were reported by 12.6% of all respondents. Concerning PCS, mental symptoms were reported more often by females compared to males (13.5% versus 10.7%), whereas no gender differences were found for PCVS. With the increasing number of booster vaccinations, mental PCVS decreased from 20.8% with one vaccination to 8.9% with four or more vaccinations. Overall, non-mRNA vaccines did not lead significantly to more mental symptoms than mRNA vaccines (12.9% versus 12.5%) but did differ concerning mental symptom patterns: concentration and memory problems (8.2% versus 3.3%), impaired performance (5.7% versus 4.2%) and sleep disorders (6.6% versus 3.2%) were reported more frequently in non-mRNA vaccines. The reported rate of mental PCVS being 12.6% is clearly higher than the 0.5% recorded by official documentation systems (Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI)), suggesting a major underreporting.

While vaccination played a key role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, variants of concern (VOC) with immune evasive substitutions emerged on multiple occasions, causing widespread breakthrough infections. The combined threats of zoonosis and newly emerging VOCs, coupled with the potential for recombination, underscore the need to assess the breadth of existing vaccine-mediated protection. Here, we investigate a cohort of older individuals (median age 68.5 years) for the potential of cross-neutralisation against Omicron lineage VOC and animal sarbecoviruses induced by four COVID-19 vaccine doses. Despite the recent use of a bivalent mRNA vaccine dose (encoding spike from Wu-1 and omicron), we observed that neutralisation of Omicron lineage VOCs such as BA.1 and BA.2 were reduced compared to SARS-CoV-2 Wu-1, suggesting an imprinted immune response from pre-Omicron lineage viruses. Similarly, both SARS-CoV-1 and a SARS-CoV-1-related bat CoV were neutralised less efficiently than SARS-CoV-2 Wu-1. Unexpectedly, however, we observed that two animal SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, BANAL-20-52 (from bats) and a pangolin-CoV, were more sensitive to serum neutralising antibodies than SARS-CoV-2 Wu-1 itself. These surprising findings suggest that vaccine-mediated adaptive immunity may provide efficient cross-protection against certain animal sarbecoviruses.","NA","biorxiv",1744150111062

Whilst there is evidence of a general intestinal microbial dysbiosis, differences across CP resulting from diverse triggers remains poorly elucidated.

MethodsIn this study, we investigated how different CP triggers, namely alcohol-induced CP (AIP) and CFTR-related CP (CFRP), might undermine differences across microbiota structure and predicted function. Faecal samples from 25 CP participants were collected, alongside 9 healthy controls for microbiota analyses. Both full and short (V4) 16S rRNA sequencing was performed, including predicted functionality using PICRUSt2. Clinical metadata was integrated to investigate relationships with microbiota structure and predicted functionality with ordination-based approaches.

ResultsMicrobiota diversity patterns between groups varied slightly by sequencing approach, with differences across common core and rarer satellite taxa diversity evident. Importantly, microbiota compositional profiles were shared between approaches, with control samples clustering closer than CP samples. Between groups, significant differences in microbiota composition were apparent, with the AIP group significantly different to both control and CFRP groups across various microbiota partitions (P < 0.05). Notable genera drove the observed dissimilarity, including Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and Ruminococcus, which were decreased in relative abundance across CP. Predictive functional analyses further demonstrated increased similarity of controls as compared to CP groups. Significant variation across both microbiota structure and predicted function was explained by CP subtype (P < 0.01). When compared back to controls, the relative abundance of various predicted functional pathways from both the core and satellite taxa was significantly different across groups (P < 0.05).

ConclusionsOverall, we demonstrate that gut microbiota structure and predicted function differs between not only healthy controls and CP, including across CP subtypes themselves. Various taxa with important physiological roles were implicated across CP. Differences in predicted functionality of the core and satellite taxa were evident, relating to microbial processes that may have downstream consequences at the site of the GI tract. Future studies will employ larger cohorts with the incorporation of additional omics-based approaches. This will better elucidate differences in microbiota structure and functionality across CP, including relationships with pancreatic-based clinical outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1744150111062

However, the mechanism of ribosome recruitment to mRNA start sites strikingly differs between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The eukaryotic small (40S) ribosomal subunit binds 5' end caps and scans for the start codon while the bacterial small (30S) subunit directly binds to the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) motif close to the initiation site. Pioneer studies have shown rare 30S loading events further upstream within 5' untranslated regions (5'UTRs), at ribosome standby sites (1-3). Together with the frequent occurrence of long bacterial mRNA 5'UTRs and degenerated SD sequences, this indicates that the 30S subunit might bind upstream of the SD more commonly than currently thought. We therefore developed 30S-seq to map 30S-mRNA interactions in a bacterial transcriptome (Escherichia coli), inspired by translation complex profile sequencing (TCP-seq) previously used in eukaryotes (4,5). Our results provide new and unsuspected insights into the behaviour of 30S and 70S complexes during the canonical translation initiation process. Notably, 30S subunits are recruited upstream of the start codon, primed to receive the SD released by the departing 70S ribosome. Remarkably, we also find hundreds of non-canonical 30S binding sites within mRNA 5'UTRs, sometimes over 100 nucleotides upstream of the start region. We validated several of these upstream ribosome binding sites, and demonstrated their strong impact on gene expression. Thus, even in bacteria, ribosomes frequently bind mRNAs outside of the start region to initiate translation, challenging the classic ribosome binding site model.","NA","biorxiv",1744150111062

As an alternative, we tested the effectiveness of the Minos transposase, a Tc1/mariner family element derived from a dipteran insect, for stable germline transformation in the pantry moth Plodia interpunctella.

Most land plants form arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, an ancient trait for enhanced nutrition that was convergently lost in some clades. Carnivory, another nutritional trait, is a more recent adaptation that has convergently arisen in several angiosperm orders. The two biotic interactions similarly help plants acquire mineral nutrients, raising the question of whether they can coexist. However, the mycorrhizal status of carnivorous plants has long remained speculative. Here, we surveyed the occurrence of AM-associated genes in five angiosperm orders harbouring carnivorous species, revealing convergent losses of the AM trait either coincident with or predating the emergence of carnivory. Exceptionally, the carnivorous plant species Roridula gorgonias retains symbiosis-related genes and forms arbuscules upon inoculation assays, demonstrating the two nutritional strategies, although rare, can coexist. The youngest carnivorous lineage, Brocchinia reducta, showed signatures of the early stages of AM trait loss, as reflected by its gene retention and AM colonization patterns.

Recently, engineered versions of these defective interfering particles (DIPs) have been proposed as an HIV-1 therapeutic. However, DIPs have yet to be reported in people with HIV-1 (PWH). Here, we find DIPs in PWH who have a rare, polyclonal form of non-suppressible viremia (NSV). While antiretroviral therapy (ART) rapidly reduces viremia to undetectable levels, some individuals experience sustained viremia due to virus production from cell clones harboring intact or defective proviruses. We characterized the source of NSV in two PWH who never reached undetectable viral load despite ART adherence. Remarkably, in each participant, we found a diverse set of defective viral genomes all sharing the same fatal deletions. We found that this paradoxical accumulation of mutations by viruses with fatal defects was driven by superinfection with intact viruses, resulting in mobilization of defective genomes and accumulation of additional mutations during untreated infection. We show that these defective proviruses interfere with WT virus replication, conditionally replicate, and, in one case, have an R0 > 1, enabling in vivo spread. Despite this, clinical outcomes show no evidence of a beneficial effect of these DIPs.","NA","biorxiv",1744150111062

Over the past decade, the concept of minimum selective concentrations (MSC) has been adopted in environmental regulation to define maximum permissible antibiotic concentrations. Such empirically determined MSC values often fail to reflect the complexity of natural communities, where susceptibility and resistance-associated fitness costs vary widely across species. To address this limitation, computational approaches have been developed to predict no-effect concentrations for selection of antibiotic resistance (PNECres) from routinely collected minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data. However, these approaches often lack a strong ecological basis, undermining confidence in their predictions.

Here, we propose a simple but biologically consistent framework to derive PNECres values by integrating MIC data with probabilistic estimates of resistance-related fitness costs. Our results suggest that current regulatory environmental threshold concentrations should be lowered by at least one order of magnitude to guard against selection for antibiotic resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1744150111062

Here, we introduce LLOKI, a novel framework for integrating imaging-based ST data from diverse platforms without requiring shared gene panels. LLOKI addresses ST integration through two key alignment tasks: feature alignment across technologies and batch alignment across datasets. Feature alignment constructs a graph based on spatial proximity and gene expression to propagate features and impute missing values. Optimal transport adjusts data sparsity to match scRNA-seq references, enabling single-cell foundation models such as scGPT to generate unified features. Batch alignment then refines scGPT-transformed embeddings, mitigating batch effects while preserving biological variability. Evaluations on mouse brain samples from five different technologies demonstrate that LLOKI outperforms existing methods and is effective for cross-technology spatial gene program identification and tissue slice alignment. Applying LLOKI to five ovarian cancer datasets, we identify an integrated gene program indicative of tumor-infiltrating T cells across gene panels. Together, LLOKI provides a robust foundation for cross-platform ST studies, with the potential to scale to large atlas datasets, enabling deeper insights into cellular organization and tissue environments.","NA","biorxiv",1744150111062

Beyond their metabolic roles, amino acids have been increasingly recognized as regulators of plant immunity. However, the molecular mechanisms by which amino acids modulate defense responses remain unclear. In this study, we identify a novel function for serine as a defense-priming signal. Serine pretreatment enhances immune gene expression and primes plants for a more rapid and robust response to pathogen infection, resulting in a significant delay in programmed cell death (PCD) during effector-triggered immunity (ETI). We further demonstrate that serine-induced defense activation is mediated by glutamate receptor-like calcium channel 3.4 (GLR3.4), which subsequently activates calcium-dependent protein kinase 5 (CPK5). CPK5 in turn phosphorylates WRKY transcription factors, including WRKY33, to induce key immune genes. Our findings uncover a previously unrecognized serine-initiated signaling pathway that primes plant defense, highlighting both its mechanistic novelty and its potential application in sustainable agriculture. Given that serine is a naturally occurring metabolite, its exogenous application-or the use of structurally similar analogs-may offer a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and non-genetic strategy to enhance disease resistance in crops.","NA","biorxiv",1744150111062

To increase the yield of transformants, DNA from the in vitro transposition reaction was amplified using isothermal multiple displacement amplification. The resulting product was first transformed into the high-transformation efficiency DaddAB/ppol strain and then into a wild-type HB27 strain. Tn-seq analysis of the libraries showed that almost all genes contained insertions and the distribution of the number of insertions per gene was unimodal, unlike the bimodal distribution reported in most Tn-seq analyses, thus hindering the discrimination of required or essential genes. Upon comparing the Tn-seq results with gene conservation in pangenomic analysis from Thermus thermophilus to Deiococcota levels, as well as with available HB27 RNA-seq data, we observed a very low correlation between core genes or gene transcription levels and Tn-seq insertion frequency. Notably, many genes largely deemed part of the essential bacterial core, supporting critical cellular pathways, showed relatively high transposon insertion numbers. In the case of DNA repair routes, which are essential but somewhat redundant, our results align well with previously published essentiality data, indicating that many genes are dispensable and permissive to insertions. The analysis of these striking results in the context of Thermus biology suggests that the polyploidy of the Thermus genome and the differential stability of proteins may explain the apparent non-essentiality of key genes.","NA","biorxiv",1744150111062

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1744150111062

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1744150111062
