The fossil, known on the basis of two specimens, has been historically assigned to seamoths (Pegasidae), then to oarfish and relatives (Lampriformes). We describe its enigmatic skeletal anatomy in detail, and provide a new genus name. ""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676048

Available data support that the burst of cytokines and bradykinin, observed in some COVID-19 patients, sustains systemic inflammation and the hypercoagulant state, thus increasing thrombotic risk. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) can play a direct role in the activation of the coagulation cascade. Adding Mpro to human plasma from healthy donors increased clotting probability by 2.5-fold. The results of enzymatic assays and degradomics analysis indicate that Mpro triggers plasma clotting by proteolytically activating coagulation factors zymogens VII and XII at their physiological activation sites, i.e. Arg152-Ile153 bond for FVII and Arg353-Val354 bond for FXII, where FVII and FXII are strategically positioned at the very beginning of the extrinsic or intrinsic pathways of blood coagulation. These findings are not compatible with the substrate specificity of the protease known so far, displaying a prevalence for a Gln-residue in P1 and a hydrophobic amino acid in P2 position. This apparent discrepancy was resolved by High Throughput Protease Screen assay, unveiling an extended, time-dependent, secondary specificity of Mpro for Arg-X bonds, which was further confirmed by Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass spectrometry analysis of Arg-containing inhibitors binding to Mpro and by enzymatic assays showing that the protease can cleave peptide substrates containing Arg in P1. Overall, integrating biochemical, proteomics and structural biology experiments, we unveil a novel mechanism linking SARS-CoV-2 infection to thrombotic complications in COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676048

Synthetic genetic constructs compete with a host cells native genes for expression resources, burdening the cell and impairing its growth. This creates a selective pressure favouring mutations which alleviate this growth defect by removing synthetic gene expression. Non-functional mutants thus spread in cell populations, eventually making them lose engineered functions. Past work has attempted to limit mutation spread by coupling synthetic gene expression to survival. However, these approaches are highly context-dependent and must be tailor-made for each particular synthetic gene circuit to be retained.

In contrast, we develop and analyse a biomolecular controller which depresses mutant cell growth independently of the mutated synthetic genes identity. Modelling shows how our design can be deployed alongside various synthetic circuits without any re-engineering of its genetic components, outperforming extant gene-specific mutation spread mitigation strategies. Our controllers performance is evaluated using a novel simulation approach which leverages resource-aware cell modelling to directly link a circuits design parameters to its population-level behaviour.

Our designs adaptability promises to mitigate mutation spread in an expanded range of applications, whilst our analyses provide a blueprint for using resource-aware cell models in circuit design.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676048

However, it remains uncertain whether such diverse tuning corresponds to distinct functions within the hippocampal network or if a more generic computation can account for these observations. To disentangle the contribution of externally driven cues versus internal computation, we developed a task in mice where space, auditory tones, rewards, and context were juxtaposed with changing relevance. High-density electrophysiological recordings revealed that neurons were tuned to each of these modalities. By comparing movement paths and action sequences, we observed that external variables had limited direct influence on hippocampal firing. Instead, spiking was influenced by online action plans modulated by goal uncertainty. Our results suggest that internally generated cell assembly sequences are selected and updated by action plans toward deliberate goals. The apparent tuning of hippocampal neuronal spiking to different sensory modalities might emerge due to alignment to the afforded action progression within a task rather than representation of external cues.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676048

By exploiting the mechanistic connection between the locus coeruleus (LC), a key regulator of central arousal, and pupil dynamics, we recently demonstrated that participants can gain volitional control over arousal-regulating centers including the LC using a pupil-based biofeedback approach. Here, we test whether pupil-based biofeedback modulates electrophysiological markers of cortical excitability, cortical arousal, and phasic LC activity. Combining pupil-based biofeedback with single-pulse TMS, EEG recordings, and an auditory oddball task revealed three main results: pupil self-regulation significantly modulates (i) cortical excitability, (ii) the EEG spectral slope, a marker of cortical arousal, and (iii) the P300 response to target tones, an event-related potential suggested to be tightly linked to phasic LC activity. Interestingly, pupil self-regulation strength was linearly linked to the modulation of the spectral slope, suggesting a common physiological mechanism. Here, we have shown that pupil-based biofeedback modulates fundamental aspects of brain function. Whether this method could further be used to modulate these aspects in case of disturbances associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders needs to be investigated in future studies.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676048

The bacteria is known to establish direct physical contact with the host compartment prior to phagosome disruption. However, the impact of direct-physical contact on the phagosome remodeling and deformation remains elusive. To probe this, we first developed a method wherein we reconstitute a phagosome-like giant compartment encapsulating Mycobacterium smegmatis, a non-motile opportunistic bacterium. We discover that the direct contact between the bacteria and the encapsulating host membrane induces membrane bending, lipid wrapping, and local lipid phase separation at the contact site. The degree of phase separation is driven by the bacterial load leading to fluidization of the membrane, as evident from the decreased area stretch and bending modulus, making the host compartment more deformable. Surprisingly, for saturating bacterial load the fluid host membrane transforms into a scaffold-like rigid layer. We also find that the direct contact of the bacteria enhances the membranolytic potential of ESAT-6 thus contributing to its virulence. Together our findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of direct physical contact of the bacteria during phagosome disruption.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676048

In this study, we report on the neutralizing antibody (nAb) escape, infectivity, fusion, and stability of these subvariants--LB.1, KP.2.3, KP.3, and KP.3.1.1. Our findings demonstrate that all of these subvariants are highly evasive of nAbs elicited by the bivalent mRNA vaccine, the XBB.1.5 monovalent mumps virus-based vaccine, or from infections during the BA.2.86/JN.1 wave. This reduction in nAb titers is primarily driven by a single serine deletion (DelS31) in the NTD of the spike, leading to a distinct antigenic profile compared to the parental JN.1 and other variants. We also found that the DelS31 mutation decreases pseudovirus infectivity in CaLu-3 cells, which correlates with impaired cell-cell fusion. Additionally, the spike protein of DelS31 variants appears more conformationally stable, as indicated by reduced S1 shedding both with and without stimulation by soluble ACE2, and increased resistance to elevated temperatures. Molecular modeling suggests that the DelS31 mutation induces a conformational change that stabilizes the NTD and strengthens the NTD-Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) interaction, thus favoring the down conformation of RBD and reducing accessibility to both the ACE2 receptor and certain nAbs. Additionally, the DelS31 mutation introduces an N-linked glycan modification at N30, which shields the underlying NTD region from antibody recognition. Our data highlight the critical role of NTD mutations in the spike protein for nAb evasion, stability, and viral infectivity, and suggest consideration of updating COVID-19 vaccines with antigens containing DelS31.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676048

It is an oviparous species that is distinctive because it undergoes sex reversal (from XX genotypic females to phenotypic males) at low incubation temperatures. We present a chromosome-scale genome assembly of a Bassiana duperreyi XY male individual, constructed using a combination of PacBio HiFi and ONT long reads scaffolded using Illumina HiC data. The genome assembly length is 1.57 Gb with a scaffold N50 of 222 Mbp, N90 of 26 Mbp, 200 gaps and 43.10% GC content. Most (95%) of the assembly is scaffolded into 6 macrochromosomes, 8 microchromosomes and the X chromosome, corresponding to the karyotype. Fragmented Y chromosome scaffolds (n=11 > 1 Mbp) were identified using Y-specific contigs generated by genome subtraction. We identified two novel alpha-satellite repeats of 187 bp and 199 bp in the putative centromeres that did not form higher order repeats. The genome assembly exceeds the standard recommended by the Earth Biogenome Project; 0.02% false expansions, 99.63% kmer completeness, 94.66% complete single copy BUSCO genes and an average 98.42% of transcriptome data mappable to the genome assembly. The mitochondrial genome (17,506 bp) and the model rDNA repeat unit (15,154 bp) were assembled. The B. duperreyi genome assembly has one of the highest completeness levels for a skink and will provide a resource for research focused on sex determination and thermolabile sex reversal, as an oviparous foundation species for studies of the evolution of viviparity, and for other comparative genomics studies of the Scincidae.

However, the position of the root remains contentious due to pervasive phylogenetic artefacts stemming from inadequate evolutionary models, poor taxon sampling, and limited phylogenetic signal. Here, we estimate the root of the eToL with unprecedented resolution based on a new, much larger, dataset of mitochondrial proteins which includes all known eukaryotic supergroups. Our comprehensive analyses with state-of-the-art phylogenetic models reveal that the eukaryotic root lies between two multi-supergroup assemblages:  Opimoda+ and  Diphoda+.

However, the data acquisition is limited by low spatial frequency EPI artifacts; termed here as Fuzzy Ripples. These artifacts limit the practical applicability of acquisition protocols with higher spatial resolution, faster acquisition speed, and they challenge imaging in lower brain areas. Methods: We characterize Fuzzy Ripple artifacts across commonly used sequences and distinguish them from conventional EPI Nyquist ghosts, off-resonance effects, and GRAPPA artifacts. To investigate their origin, we employ dual polarity readouts. Results: Our findings indicate that Fuzzy Ripples are primarily caused by readout-specific imperfections in k-space trajectories, which can be exacerbated by inductive coupling between third-order shims and readout gradients. We also find that these artifacts can be mitigated through complex-valued averaging of dual polarity EPI or by disconnecting the third-order shim coils. Conclusion: The proposed mitigation strategies allow overcoming current limitations in layer-fMRI protocols: (1) Achieving resolutions beyond 0.8mm is feasible, and even at 3T, we achieved 0.53mm voxel functional connectivity mapping. (2) Sub-millimeter sampling acceleration can be increased to allow sub-second TRs and laminar whole brain protocols with up to GRAPPA 8.

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1725919676048

Diet is a risk factor for inflammatory bowel diseases such as CD and represents a promising adjunctive treatment, yet there are few well-controlled dietary intervention studies in CD patients. Fiber may have beneficial effects; however, most CD patients are told to avoid high-fiber foods. We conducted a longitudinal patient-preference study to examine the effect of a catered low-fat, high- fiber diet (the Mi-IBD diet) on CD symptoms, inflammation, and the microbiome.

MethodsCD patients (n=73) received one-time diet counseling (Group 1, n=23), the Mi-IBD diet (Group 2, n=26), or the Mi-IBD diet along with a healthy household control (Group 3, n=24 patient- HHC dyads). The Mi-IBD diet was catered for 8 weeks, and CD symptoms were recorded. Serum samples were collected to measure inflammatory marker levels and evaluate systemic changes via proteomic analyses (SomaScan Discovery v4.1 assays). Stool samples were collected to perform metabolomic analyses.

ResultsAt baseline, CD patients had a low-fiber, high-fat diet. One-time diet counseling did not result in dietary changes. In contrast, catering led to marked dietary changes in CD patients (increased fiber intake, decreased fat intake; all ps < 0.001) and high adherence rates (96%). Group 3 exhibited improvements in CD symptoms (PRO2 and sCDAI scores). Proteomic analysis revealed higher baseline serum levels of proinflammatory proteins (SAA and CRP) in CD patients than in HHCs; these levels decreased with the catered diet. The diet also improved fecal metabolites related to protein and energy metabolism as well as markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in CD patients.

Here, we use in situ cryo-electron tomography to visualize the native structures and organization of several major mitochondrial complexes inside Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells. ATP synthases and respiratory complexes are segregated into curved and flat crista membrane domains, respectively. Respiratory complexes I, III, and IV assemble into a single type of respirasome, from which we determined a native 5 [A]-resolution structure showing the binding of electron carrier cytochrome c. Combined with single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction at 2.4 [A] resolution, we assemble a detailed model of how the respiratory complexes interact with each other inside native mitochondria.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676048

In addition, individual European countries developed their own risk classifications for severe COVID-19 to select individuals recommended for annual COVID-19 vaccination. We assessed the discordance between the European and respective national medical risk classifications in assigning children and adults to risk groups for developing severe COVID-19 in populations of the Netherlands and Norway. Methods: This multi-country, healthcare data-linkage study covered 17.4 million inhabitants of the Netherlands and 5.6 million inhabitants of Norway by 1 January 2020. Medical conditions were defined based on ICD-10 hospital discharge codes in the European and Dutch classifications, and on ICD-10 and ICPC-2 primary care codes in the Norwegian classification. Subjects were classified as high-, moderate-, or low-risk. Discordance was calculated as the proportion of the population with a different risk status in the respective national compared to the European classification. Findings: The overall discordance between European and national risk classification was 12.0% in the Dutch and 13.8% in the Norwegian population. The European classification assigns more individuals to high-risk (9.0% and 9.2% of the Dutch and Norwegian populations, respectively) than the national classifications (1.5% and 3.0%, respectively). National classifications define more individuals as moderate-risk (11.3% and 12.7%, respectively) than the European classification (1.0% and 1.3%, respectively). Classification discordances most frequently involved subjects with cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and diabetes mellitus. Interpretation: The European classification defines a substantially larger percentage of the population as high-risk for severe COVID-19 than the national classifications. This may have implications for post-pandemic vaccination programs. Further research should assess to what extent the medical conditions responsible for the classification discordances determine the risk of developing severe COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1725919676048

Predictive processing has been repeatedly demonstrated and seemingly explains expectation suppression (ES), or the attenuation of neural activity in response to expected stimuli. However, the mechanisms behind ES are unclear and various models of the mechanisms supporting ES have been suggested with conflicting evidence. Sharpening models propose that expectations suppress neurons that are not tuned to the expected stimulus, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio for expected stimuli. In contrast, dampening models posit that expectations suppress neurons that are tuned to the expected stimuli, increasing the relative response amplitude for unexpected stimuli. Previous studies have used decoding analyses to examine these effects, with increases in decoding accuracy interpreted in terms of sharpening and decreases related to dampening. The opposing process theory (OPT) has suggested that both processes may occur at different time points, namely that initial sharpening is followed by later dampening of the neural representations of the expected stimulus as learning progresses. In this study we aim to test this theory and shed light on the dynamics of expectation effects, both at single trial level and over time. Thirty-one participants completed a statistical learning task consisting of paired scene categories whereby a ""leading"" image from one category is quickly followed by a ""trailing"" image from a different category. Multivariate EEG analyses focussed on decoding stimulus information related to the trailing image category. Within-trial, decoding analyses showed that stimulus expectation increased decoding accuracy at early latencies and decreased decoding accuracy at later latencies, in line with OPT. However, across trials, stimulus expectation decreased decoding accuracy in initial trials and increased decoding accuracy in later trials. We theorise that these dissociable dynamics of expectation effects within and across trials can be explained in the context of hierarchical learning mechanisms. Our single trial results provide evidence for the OPT, while our results over time suggest that sharpening and dampening effects emerge at different stages of learning.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676048

We assessed immune responses in n=42 health-care workers (median age 47 years, interquartile range, IQR 19{middle dot}5 years, 48% male), who in August 2024 were vaccinated with 30 g of the updated mRNA omicron JN.1 vaccine (bretovameran, BioNTech/Pfizer, Mainz, Germany). Humoral immune responses were analyzed directly prior to and 13 days after vaccination.

The omicron JN.1 vaccination resulted in a significant 1{middle dot}2-fold increase of anti-S IgG and 1{middle dot}2-fold increase of omicron anti-S IgG (p<0{middle dot}0001). To assess plasma neutralisation capacity, we employed a pseudovirus particle (pp) neutralisation assay including S proteins of seven SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Baseline response rates were 100% for XBB.1.5pp, 90% for JN.1pp and KP.2pp, 82% for KP.2.3pp, 92% for KP.3pp, and 72% for LB.1pp. Before JN.1 vaccination, particles bearing KP sublineage S proteins were slightly less efficiently neutralised compared with JN.1pp (median change, 1{middle dot}2-fold to 2{middle dot}6-fold), while LB.1pp neutralisation was 3-fold reduced, indicating antibody evasion. After vaccination, the response rates increased significantly for all pseudoviruses except XBB.1.5pp and KP.3pp. Thus, we observed a significant increase in neutralisation of JN.1pp, KP.2pp, KP.2.3pp, and LB.1pp, showing a median change of 2.2-fold, 3.8-fold, 3.3-fold, and 4.9-fold, respectively.

In summary, bretovameran increased anti-S IgG and strengthened neutralising responses against circulating SARS-CoV-2-variants, except for KP.3. We wish to point out that our study population exhibited high pre-vaccination omicron-related hybrid immunity and may not be representative of other populations. Our data supports the notion that the new mRNA vaccine against omicron JN.1 most likely increases protection against hospitalization and post-COVID sequelae caused by most current variants.","NA","medrxiv",1725919676048

As a COG-UK partner, Quadram Institute Bioscience (QIB) in Norfolk sequenced over 87,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, contributing to the region becoming densely sequenced. Retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 lineage dynamics in this region may contribute to preparedness for future pandemics.

Methods29,406 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences and corresponding metadata from Norfolk were extracted from the COG-UK dataset, sampled between March 2020 and December 2022, representing 9.9% of regional COVID-19 cases. Sequences were lineage typed using Pangolin, and subsequent lineage analysis carried out in R using RStudio and related packages, including graphical analysis using ggplot2.

Results401 global lineages were identified, with 69.8% appearing more than once and 31.2% over ten times. Temporal clustering identified six lineage communities based on first lineage emergence. Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants of concern (VOC) accounted for 8.6%, 34.9% and 48.5% of sequences respectively. These formed four regional epidemic waves alongside the remaining lineages which appeared in the early pandemic prior to VOC designation and were termed  pre-VOC lineages. Regional comparison highlighted variability in VOC epidemic wave dates dependent on location.

ConclusionThis study is the first to assess SARS-CoV-2 diversity in Norfolk across a large timescale within the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 was both highly diverse and dynamic throughout the Norfolk region between March 2020 - December 2022, with a strong VOC presence within the latter two thirds of the study period. The study also displays the utility of incorporating genomic epidemiological methods into pandemic response.

Data summaryThe COG-UK collection of SARS-CoV-2 sequences and metadata are available for public download on their archive website under the  Latest sequence data heading <https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20230507102210/https://www.cogconsortium.uk/priority-areas/data-linkage-analysis/public-data-analysis/>. Sequence names for all sequences used from this dataset alongside GISAID accession numbers where present are available in Supplementary Table 1.

Impact statementWe extracted 29,406 regional Norfolk based SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the COG-UK SARS-CoV-2 dataset and revealed significant regional diversity and dynamic emergence of variant of concern (VOC) epidemic waves - spanning Alpha, Delta and Omicron lineages. We also applied statistical modelling to complement genomic methodology, with temporal clustering of significant first lineage emergences chronologically matching VOC waves and subwaves. The study highlights the importance of integration of genomic epidemiology into public health strategies for pandemic response, and the utility of using this data for retrospective research.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676048

We have generated 3D genomic datasets consisting of promoter-focused Capture-C, Hi-C, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq and integrated these data with GWAS of 16 autoimmune traits to physically map disease-associated variants to the effector genes they likely regulate in 57 human cell types. These 3D maps of gene cis-regulatory architecture are highly powered to identify the cell types most likely impacted by disease-associated genetic variation compared to 1D genomic features, and tend to implicate different effector genes than eQTL approaches in the same cell types. Most of the variants implicated by these cis-regulatory architectures are highly trait-specific, but nearly half of the target genes connected to these variants are shared across multiple autoimmune disorders in multiple cell types, suggesting a high level of genetic diversity and complexity among autoimmune diseases that nonetheless converge at the level of target gene and cell type. Substantial effector gene sharing led to the common enrichment of similar biological networks across disease and cell types. However, trait-specific pathways representing potential areas for disease-specific intervention were identified. To test this, we pharmacologically validated squalene synthase, a cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme encoded by the FDFT1 gene implicated by our approach in MS and SLE, as a novel immunomodulatory drug target controlling inflammatory cytokine production by human T cells. These data represent a comprehensive resource for basic discovery of gene cis-regulatory mechanisms, and the analyses reported reveal mechanisms by which autoimmune-associated variants act to regulate gene expression, function, and pathology across multiple, distinct tissues and cell types.","NA","medrxiv",1725919676048

We describe how a suite of forecasts for respiratory pathogens, embedded in national and regional decision-making structures, were used to mitigate the impact on hospital systems and patient care. We developed forecasting models predicting hospital admissions and bed occupancy two weeks ahead for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV in England over winter 2023/24. Bed occupancy forecasts were informed by the ensemble admissions models. Forecasts were delivered in realtime at multiple scales. The use of sample-based forecasting allowed for effective reconciliation and trend interpretation. Admission forecasts, particularly RSV and influenza, showed high skill at regional levels. Bed occupancy forecasts had well-calibrated coverage, owing to informative admissions forecasts and slower moving trends. National admissions forecasts had mean absolute percentage errors of 27.3%, 30.9% and 15.7% for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV respectively, with corresponding 90% coverages of 0.439, 0.807 and 0.779. These real-time winter infectious disease forecasts produced by the UK Health Security Agency for healthcare system managers played an informative role in mitigating seasonal pressures. The models were delivered regularly and shared widely across the system to key users. This was achieved by producing reliable, fast, and epidemiologically informed ensembles of models.

Catatonic symptoms are treatable with pharmacotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy, but the longitudinal effectiveness of these treatments has not been described.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective observational cohort study of patients with autism and co-morbid catatonia who received outpatient care in a specialized outpatient clinic from July 1st, 2021 to May 31st, 2024. Data investigating pharmacologic interventions, and clinical measures including the Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS), Kanner Catatonia Severity Scale (KCS), Kanner Catatonia Examination (KCE), and Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) were collected.

ResultsForty-five patients were identified with 39 (86.7%) meeting criteria for profound autism. All patients received pharmacotherapy. 44 (97.8%) were treated with benzodiazepines with a mean maximal daily dose of 17.4 mg (SD=15.8) lorazepam equivalents. Thirty-five patients (77.8%) required more than one medication class for treatment. Fourteen patients (31.1%) attempted to taper off benzodiazepines during the study period; of these, 5 patients (11.1%) were successfully tapered off, and the remaining 9 (17.8%) discontinued the taper due to a return of catatonic symptoms. Statistically significant improvement was observed across all clinical domains except the KCS. However, the majority remained symptomatic over the study period.

ConclusionsDespite clinical improvements while receiving the gold standard for psychopharmacologic management of catatonia, chronic symptoms remained for the majority of catatonia patients over the study period, and few were able to taper and discontinue benzodiazepine treatment.

Lay SummaryCatatonia is a condition which can significantly impact the quality of life for autistic individuals with and without profound impairment. Symptoms of catatonia such as aggression and self-injury can improve with treatment. However, over the three-year period of this study, most patients experienced residual symptoms, and few could discontinue psychotropic medication.","NA","medrxiv",1725919676048

The outer membrane protein Invasin of Yersinia is known to activate multiple integrin-{beta}1 complexes, including integrin-6{beta}1. A C-terminal integrin-binding fragment of Invasin, coated on culture plates, mediated gut epithelial cell adhesion. Addition of organoid growth factors allowed multi-passage expansion in 2D. Polarization, junction formation and generation of enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and enteroendocrine cells was stable over time. Sustained expansion of other human-, mouse-, and even snake epithelia was accomplished under comparable conditions. The 2D  organoid sheet format holds advantages over the 3D  in gel format in terms of imaging, accessibility of basal and apical domains and automation for high throughput screening. Invasin represents a fully defined, affordable, versatile, and animal-free complement to Matrigel/BME.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676048

Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges.

However, most lack a formal approach to analyse the parameters and context-specific variations of these regulatory components. This study addresses this gap by establishing formal and convenient methods for characterising regulatory circuits. We model the bacterial cell as a collection of a small number of proteome fractions. Then, we derive the proteome fraction over time and obtain a general theorem describing its change as a function of its expression fraction, which represents a specific portion of the total biosynthesis flux of the cell. Formal deduction reveals that when the proteome fraction reaches a maximum, it becomes equivalent to its expression fraction. This equation enables the reliable measurement of the expression fraction through direct protein quantification. In addition, experimental data demonstrate a linear correlation between protein production rate and specific growth rate over a significant time period. This suggests a constant expression fraction within this window. The expression fractions estimated from the slopes of these intervals and those obtained from maximum protein amount points can both be independently fitted to a Hill function. In the case of an IPTG biosensor, in five cellular contexts, expression fractions determined by the maximum method and the slope method produced similar dose-response parameters. Additionally, by analysing two more biosensors, for mercury and cumate detection, we demonstrate that the slope method can be effectively applied to various systems, generating reliable Hill function parameters.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676048

While these chemicals are often considered to have restricted activity and are labelled as such, there are concerns over a broader toxicity range. Here we report the impact of 1076 pollutants spanning diverse chemistries and indicated applications on 22 prevalent commensal gut bacteria. Our systematic investigation uncovered 588 interactions involving 168 chemicals, the majority of which were not previously reported to have antibacterial properties. Fungicides and industrial chemicals showed the largest impact with circa 30% exhibiting anti-commensal properties. We find that the sensitivity to chemical pollutants across species surprisingly correlates with that to human-targeted drugs, suggesting common susceptibility mechanisms. Using a genome-wide chemical-genetic screen, we identified membrane transport and fatty acid metabolism as major modulators of the off-target toxicity of chemicals. Mutants exhibiting chemical resistance include those defective in producing human-health-relevant metabolites like branched short-chain fatty acids, indicating that chronic exposure could lead to selection against production of beneficial metabolites. Toxicokinetic modelling suggested gut bacteria could be used as more sensitive in vitro toxicity indicators for chemicals of concern than animal models. Together, our data uncovers the off-target activity of industrial and agricultural chemicals with widespread exposure against human gut bacteria. Impact on the structure and function of the microbiota should therefore be considered in assessing chemical safety.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676048

By altering wildlife condition, density, and behavior, provisioning can influence transmission of infectious diseases and thus may impose strong selection pressure on wildlife pathogens. But surprisingly, we lack theory on the eco-evolutionary consequences of provisioning for host-pathogen dynamics. Here we develop a mathematical model of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of a wildlife pathogen under provisioning, motivated by Mycoplasma gallisepticum, a bacterial pathogen that emerged, spread, and changed its virulence in provisioned house finches. We model how provisioning influences the evolution of pathogen virulence, defined here as mortality associated with infection. Consistent with past empirical work, house finches recover from infection and acquire incomplete immunity; this incomplete immunity is stronger if their initial infection was with a more virulent pathogen strain. We find that, even though provisioning improves body condition, it should still select for higher virulence, and thus may actually lead to declines in host populations. These negative effects arise because provisioning magnifies the impact of incomplete immunity, selecting for higher virulence and driving host populations down. Our results highlight that food provisioning can select for more virulent pathogens, with potentially far-reaching implications for conservation.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676048

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1725919676048

The rapid evolution of H5 HPAIVs continues to raise concern with heightened zoonotic and pandemic risks. The immunodominant haemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA) is crucial for influenza virus receptor binding and pH-induced fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Mutations in HA are frequent due to polymerase error, immune pressure and host adaptation, resulting in antigenic modulation and/or an expansion of host tropism, respectively, ultimately hindering control strategies. We evaluated a comprehensive panel of H5 viruses representing prevalent genotypes from UK outbreaks spanning 2020 to 2022 for HA functionality. HA genes from each genotype were assessed through receptor binding, pH of fusion, thermostability and HA inhibition assays to evaluate factors contributing to zoonotic potential, stability, and antigenicity. The viruses only bound to avian receptors and exhibited fusion at a pH of 5.8, above the pH range (pH 5.0 to 5.5) associated with efficient human-to-human transmission. Therefore, these H5 viruses have low immediate zoonotic threat. Contemporary H5 viruses were more thermostable and showed antigenic drift compared to the earlier 2017-2018 clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 viruses, and N236D in HA was identified as a significant antigenic epitope. The findings of this study underscore the evolving nature of the HA of these viruses and highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance and characterisation efforts to identify factors that might contribute to zoonotic risk.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676049

Evolutionary transitions between sex-chromosome systems-- which change the chromosome pair that determines sex, the system of heterogamety, or both--are frequent in some clades. In others, however, sex chromosome systems show long-term stability. Previous explanations of this stasis rely on evolutionary dynamics peculiar to sex linkage, such as the accumulation of deleterious mutations on the sex-specific chromosome or sexually antagonistic mutations on either sex chromosome. Here, I show that the ordinary operation of stabilizing selection on quantitative traits can, as a by-product, promote stability of sex chromosome systems. The reason is that stabilizing selection on a trait permits individual chromosomes genetic contributions to the trait to drift upwards or downwards, subject only to the constraint that they all sum to the trait optimum. This chromosome-specific drift causes reduced fitness in individuals with unusual chromosomal constitutions, such as the novel sexual genotypes that sex chromosome turnovers always produce. The theory can explain a suite of patterns in the phylogenetic distribution of sex determining systems. Applied to interspecific hybrids, it can also explain two key observations concerning their reduced fitness: Haldanes rule and the large-X effect.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676049

To maintain the infection cycle, soil phages must travel from one suitable host to the next. However, traversing the soil matrix presents a dangerous journey for phages, which need to encounter the right hosts in this spatially complex habitat, but are not capable of active motion and can adsorb to soil particles. Here, we tested the hypothesis that bacterial-feeding nematodes (roundworms) present a reliable vehicle of soil transport for phages. First, we demonstrated that the bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans vectored the laboratory model phage T7 as well as the soil phage {Phi} Ppu-W11 on agar. Sorption assays carried out with paralyzed and non-paralyzed nematodes showed that phage transport can occur via both external cuticular attachment and ingestion, and that the presence of host bacteria is not required for phage vectoring. Finally, we designed a microcosm to test phage transfer in compost and sandy soil using C. elegans and its sister species, C. remanei, respectively. This experiment confirmed that nematodes also enable phage movement through complex spatial habitats. This novel mechanism of phage vectoring extends our understanding of virus transmission in soil, revealing new multitrophic interactions that may influence soil functioning.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676049

The toroidal molecular architecture of the Hfq hexamer contains three well characterised surfaces which allow it to bind sRNAs to stabilise them and engage target transcripts. Hfq-interacting sRNAs are categorised into two classes based on the surfaces they use to bind Hfq. By characterising a systematic alanine mutant library of Hfq to identify amino acid residues that impact survival of Escherichia coli experiencing nitrogen starvation, we corroborated the important role of the three RNA binding surfaces for Hfq function. Surprisingly, we uncovered two conserved residues, V22 and G34, in the hydrophobic core of Hfq, to have a profound impact on Hfqs RNA binding activity in vivo. Transcriptome-scale analysis revealed that V22A and G34A Hfq mutants cause widespread destabilisation of both sRNA classes. However, the alanine substitutions at these residues had no measurable impact on protein stability, structure or equilibrium binding to target sRNAs in vitro.

Auxin-dependent transcriptional changes are mediated by DNA-binding Auxin Response Factors (ARF), whose AuxRE DNA binding sites are well-known.

Indeed, systematic analysis showed other DNA motifs to be enriched in auxin-regulated promoters. Neither the basis for this enrichment nor the mechanisms for the activity of composite AuxREs is known. Here, we systematically mined Arabidopsis promoters for composite AuxRE elements enriched in auxin-responsive genes. We identified many and show that their presence is a reliable predictor of auxin response. Through mutating these elements and their higher-order modules, we demonstrate function in promoter activity. Lastly, we identified transcription factors (TFs) that bind AuxRE-associated motifs, showed their involvement in auxin response, and discovered that several of these TFs directly bind ARF proteins. We propose that ARF-TF complexes specifically bind compound motifs in promoters, and act as a source of diversification in auxin-dependent gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676049

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676049

Prior to moulting, epidermal tissue peels off from the old cuticle and grows non-uniformly to shape protruding appendages, which are often branching, curving, or twisting, from the planar epidermis. This non-uniform growth is possibly regulated by the distribution of morphogens on the epidermal cell sheet. Previous studies have identified molecules and signalling pathways related to such morphogenesis; however, how local regulation of cell sheet growth can transform planar epidermis globally into complex three-dimensional structures, such as beetle horns, remains unclear. To reveal the relationship between epidermal growth regulation and generated structures, this study theoretically examined how various shapes can be generated from planar epidermis under a deductive growth model that corresponds morphogen distributions to non-uniform growth on tissue. The results show that the heterochronic expression of multiple morphogens can flexibly fuse multiple simple shapes to generate various structures emulating complex appendages of beetles. These findings indicate that morphogenesis through such a mechanism may have developmental stability and modularity, providing insights into the evolution of the diverse morphology of arthropods.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676049

Here, we demonstrate that the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi is capable of reversal from mature lobate to early cydippid when fed following a period of stress. Our findings illuminate central aspects of ctenophore development, ecology, and evolution, and show the high potential of M. leidyi as a new model system to study reverse development and rejuvenation. Besides shedding light on the plasticity of developmental programs, our results raise fundamental questions about early animal development, body plans and life cycles.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676049

To enable precision health, it is essential to understand how genetic variants contribute to earlier death or prolonged survival. In this study, we tested the association of common genetic variants and the burden of rare non-synonymous variants in a survival analysis, using age-at-death (N = 35,551, median [min, max] = 72.4 [40.9, 85.2]), and last-known-age (N = 358,282, median [min, max] = 71.9 [52.6, 88.7]), in European ancestry participants of the UK Biobank. The associations we identified seemed predominantly driven by cancer, likely due to the age range of the cohort. Common variant analysis highlighted three longevity-associated loci: APOE, ZSCAN23, and MUC5B. We identified six genes whose burden of loss-of-function variants is significantly associated with reduced lifespan: TET2, ATM, BRCA2, CKMT1B, BRCA1 and ASXL1. Additionally, in eight genes, the burden of pathogenic missense variants was associated with reduced lifespan: DNMT3A, SF3B1, CHL1, TET2, PTEN, SOX21, TP53 and SRSF2. Most of these genes have previously been linked to oncogenic-related pathways and some are linked to and are known to harbor somatic variants that predispose to clonal hematopoiesis. A direction-agnostic (SKAT-O) approach additionally identified significant associations with C1orf52, TERT, IDH2, and RLIM, highlighting a link between telomerase function and longevity as well as identifying additional oncogenic genes.

Our results emphasize the importance of understanding genetic factors driving the most prevalent causes of mortality at a population level, highlighting the potential of early genetic testing to identify germline and somatic variants increasing ones susceptibility to cancer and/or early death.","NA","medrxiv",1725919676049

Thus, TRAIP promotes DNA inter-strand crosslink repair by triggering the disassembly of CDC45-MCM2-7-GINS (CMG) helicases that have converged on these lesions. However, disassembly of single CMGs that have stalled temporarily would be deleterious, suggesting that TRAIP must be carefully regulated. Here, we demonstrate that human cells lacking the de-ubiquitylating enzyme USP37 are hypersensitive to topoisomerase poisons and other replication stress-inducing agents. We further show that TRAIP loss rescues the hypersensitivity of USP37 knockout cells to topoisomerase inhibitors. In Xenopus egg extracts depleted of USP37, TRAIP promotes premature CMG ubiquitylation and disassembly when converging replisomes stall. Finally, guided by AlphaFold-Multimer, we discovered that binding to CDC45 mediates USP37s response to topological stress. In conclusion, we propose that USP37 protects genome stability by preventing TRAIP-dependent CMG unloading when replication stress impedes timely termination.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676049

While altered ER-associated processes are linked to age-onset pathogenesis, whether shifts in ER morphology underlie these functional changes is unclear. We report that ER remodeling is a conserved feature of the aging process in models ranging from yeast to C. elegans and mammals. Focusing on C. elegans as an exemplar of metazoan aging, we find that as animals age, ER mass declines in virtually all tissues and ER morphology shifts from rough sheets to tubular ER. The accompanying large-scale shifts in proteomic composition correspond to the ER turning from protein synthesis to lipid metabolism. To drive this substantial remodeling, ER-phagy is activated early in adulthood, promoting turnover of rough ER in response to rises in luminal protein-folding burden and reduced global protein synthesis. Surprisingly, ER remodeling is a pro-active and protective response during aging, as ER-phagy impairment limits lifespan in yeast and diverse lifespan-extending paradigms promote profound remodeling of ER morphology even in young animals. Altogether our results reveal ER-phagy and ER morphological dynamics as pronounced, underappreciated mechanisms of both normal aging and enhanced longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676049

Until now, the mechanism of sex determination in cephlaopods has been a mystery.

We have uncovered a sex chromosome in California two-spot octopus (Octopus bimaculoides) in which males/females have ZZ/ZO karyotypes respectively. We show that the octopus Z chromosome is an evolutionary outlier with respect to divergence and repetitive element content as compared to autosomes and that it is present in all cephalopods that we have examined including Nautilus, the outgroup to squids and octopuses. Our results suggest that the cephalopod Z chromosome system originated before the split of all extant cephalopod lineages, over 480 million years ago and has been conserved to the present, making it the among the oldest conserved animal sex chromosome systems known.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676049

This positional identity is genetically encoded by PD patterning genes that instruct blastema cells to regenerate the appropriate PD limb segment. Retinoic acid (RA) is known to specify proximal limb identity, but how RA signaling levels are established in the blastema is unknown. Here, we show that RA breakdown via CYP26B1 is essential for determining RA signaling levels within blastemas. CYP26B1 inhibition molecularly reprograms distal blastemas into a more proximal identity, phenocopying the effects of administering excess RA. We identify Shox as an RA-responsive gene that is differentially expressed between proximally and distally amputated limbs. Ablation of Shox results in shortened limbs with proximal skeletal elements that fail to initiate endochondral ossification. These results suggest that PD positional identity is determined by RA degradation and RA-responsive genes that regulate PD skeletal element formation during limb regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1725919676049

ME diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME patients low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1725919676049

However, only a limited number of clade I MPXV genomes have been characterized so far, from a limited number of regions.

MethodsWe conducted whole genome sequencing of 603 mpox-positive samples that were collected from 581 patients between 2018-2024 in 17 of the 26 provinces of the DRC.

ResultsGenome coverage was at least 70% for 429/603 (71.1%) samples and near full-length MPXV genomes (>90% coverage) were obtained for 348/603 (57.7%) samples from 337 patients. All newly generated MPXV sequences belonged to clade I, among which 17 were clade Ib strains, all from patients infected in 2024 in the South-Kivu province. The large majority (>95%) of the new strains fall within previously described clade Ia groups and potential new groups have also been observed. The low number of APOBEC3 mutations found among clade Ia suggests that most human mpox cases are probably linked to zoonotic transmissions. Genetically diverse MPXV lineages co-circulate in small geographic areas during the same outbreak suggesting multiple zoonotic introductions over a short period from one or multiple reservoir species. Recent identification of mpox cases in Kinshasa shows that multiple lineages circulate in a large urban center, indicating separate introduction events.

ConclusionThe mpox epidemic in the DRC exhibits two distinct patterns. In traditional endemic regions, the epidemic is predominated by zoonotic spill-over events involving clade Ia. Conversely, in the eastern part of the country, the clade Ib outbreak is driven by human-to-human transmission highlighting the need for a coordinated response effort at the national, regional and international levels.","NA","medrxiv",1725919676049

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1725919676049

As IP occurs only in recall immune responses, we investigated the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of unvaccinated individual to determine whether their immune response aligned with the primary or recall immune response patterns.

Analysis of the Ig isotype response trajectories to the Mpro, NP, and S structural proteins and the S RBD in this group of 191 patients and 44 controls revealed a pattern of recall response in 94.2 % of cases. The levels of antibodies correlated positively with the severity of the condition rather than a milder course. High-resolution flow cytometry of fresh PBMNCs showed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cell subsets, and cTfh, suggesting a recall response. The transcriptomic profile demonstrated that this group was directly comparable to other contemporary cohorts.
