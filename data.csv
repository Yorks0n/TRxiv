It has been hypothesized that autoantibodies play a crucial role in the development of Long COVID and other syndromes, such as fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). In this study, we tested this hypothesis by passively transferring total IgG from Long COVID patients to mice. Using Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and type-I interferon expression, we stratified patients into three Long COVID subgroups, each with unique plasma proteome signatures. Remarkably, IgG transfer from the two subgroups, which are characterized by higher plasma levels of neuronal proteins and leukocyte activation markers, induced pronounced and persistent sensory hypersensitivity with distinct kinetics. Conversely, IgG transfer from the third subgroup, which are characterized by enriched skeletal and cardiac muscle proteome profiles, reduced locomotor activity in mice without affecting their motor coordination. These findings demonstrate that transfer of IgG from Long COVID patients to mice replicates disease symptoms, underscoring IgG's causative role in Long COVID pathogenesis. This work proposes a murine model that mirrors Long COVID's pathophysiological mechanisms, which may be used as a tool for screening and developing targeted therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473614

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1717279473614

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473614

The recent development of optogenetic tools for controlling RTKs and their downstream signaling pathways suggested these responses may be amenable to engineering-based control for sculpting tissue shape and function. Here, we report that a light-controlled EGF receptor (OptoEGFR) can be deployed in epithelial cell lines for precise, programmable control of long-range tissue movements. We show that in OptoEGFR-expressing tissues, light can drive millimeter-scale cell rearrangements to densify interior regions or produce rapid outgrowth at tissue edges. Light-controlled tissue movements are driven primarily by PI 3-kinase signaling, rather than diffusible signals, tissue contractility, or ERK kinase signaling as seen in other RTK-driven migration contexts. Our study suggests that synthetic, light-controlled RTKs could serve as a powerful platform for controlling cell positions and densities for diverse applications including wound healing and tissue morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473614

The etiology of PD remains elusive, and currently available treatments do not halt disease progression.

In this study, conducted within a national health provider, we examined the impact of vaccination and medication purchase on PD occurrence and severity, using an innovative machine learning algorithm to track disease progression.

Our findings reveal a significant reduction in PD occurrence following anti-tetanus vaccination, with a time-dependent association between the elapsed time since vaccination and both the rate and progression of PD. These results are supported by evidence that antimicrobial treatments significantly alter disease severity, suggesting the actual involvement of Clostridium Tetani in PD pathology.

Thus, tetanus vaccination and C. tetani eradication could be promising strategies for preventing PD and slowing its progression, pending controlled clinical trials.","NA","medrxiv",1717279473614

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

Decades of neurophysiological experiments have shed light on how brain regions [e.g., medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), hippocampus] encode the self's position and trajectory. However, it has only recently been discovered that MEC and hippocampus are modulated by the positions and trajectories of others. To understand how encoding spatial information of multiple agents shapes neural representations, we train a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that captures properties of MEC to path integrate trajectories of two agents simultaneously navigating the same environment. We find significant differences between these RNNs and those trained to path integrate only a single agent. At the individual unit level, RNNs trained to path integrate more than one agent develop weaker grid responses, stronger border responses, and tuning for the relative position of the two agents. At the population level, they develop more distributed and robust representations, with changes in network dynamics and manifold topology. Our results provide testable predictions and open new directions with which to study the neural computations supporting spatial navigation.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Increasingly, large genome-sequenced cohorts are improving our ability to discover new diagnoses in the non-coding genome. Here, we identify the non-coding RNA RNU4-2 as a novel syndromic NDD gene. RNU4-2 encodes the U4 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), which is a critical component of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex of the major spliceosome2. We identify an 18 bp region of RNU4-2 mapping to two structural elements in the U4/U6 snRNA duplex (the T-loop and Stem III) that is severely depleted of variation in the general population, but in which we identify heterozygous variants in 119 individuals with NDD. The vast majority of individuals (77.3%) have the same highly recurrent single base-pair insertion (n.64_65insT). We estimate that variants in this region explain 0.41% of individuals with NDD. We demonstrate that RNU4-2 is highly expressed in the developing human brain, in contrast to its contiguous counterpart RNU4-1 and other U4 homologs, supporting RNU4-2s role as the primary U4 transcript in the brain. Overall, this work underscores the importance of non-coding genes in rare disorders. It will provide a diagnosis to thousands of individuals with NDD worldwide and pave the way for the development of effective treatments for these individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1717279473615

Specifically, it samples the smallest k-mer according to the order O from each window of w consecutive k-mers in S. Because consecutive windows can sample the same k-mer, the set of the sampled k-mers is typically much smaller than S. This makes the minimizer a versatile tool to reduce the memory footprint and processing time of several applications in bioinformatics, such as sequence comparison, assembly, compacted De Bruijn graph construction, and sequence indexing. More generally, we consider substring sampling algorithms that respect a window guarantee: at least one k-mer must be sampled from every window of w consecutive k-mers. As a sampled k-mer is uniquely identified by its absolute position in S, we can define the density of a sampling algorithm as the fraction of distinct sampled positions. Good methods have low density which, by respecting the window guarantee, is lower bounded by 1/w. It is however difficult to design a sequence-agnostic algorithm with provably optimal density. In practice, the order O is usually implemented using a pseudo-random hash function to obtain the so-called random minimizer. This scheme is simple to implement, very fast to compute even in streaming fashion, and easy to analyze. However, its density is almost a factor of 2 away from the lower bound for large windows. Prior work has thus focused on methods that achieve lower density than the random minimizer, both in theory and practice. Nonetheless, those methods remain difficult to analyze and intuitively understand, and are not always as versatile as random minimizers. Methods: In this work we introduce mod-sampling, a two-step sampling algorithm to obtain new minimizer schemes. Given a (small) parameter t, the mod-sampling algorithm finds the position p of the smallest t-mer in a window. It then samples the k-mer at position p mod w. The lr-minimizer uses t = k - w and the mod-minimizer uses t {equiv} k (mod w). Results: These new schemes have provably lower density than classic random minimizers and other schemes when k is large compared to w, while being as fast to compute. Importantly, the mod-minimizer achieves optimal density when k [-&gt;] {infty}. Although the mod-minimizer is not the first method to achieve optimal density for large k, its proof of optimality is simpler than previous work. We provide pseudocode for a number of other methods and compare to them. In practice, the mod-minimizer has considerably lower density than the random minimizer and other state-of-the-art methods, like closed syncmers and miniception, when k > w. We plugged the mod-minimizer into SSHash, a k-mer dictionary based on minimizers. For default parameters (w, k) = (11, 21), space usage decreases by 15% when indexing the whole human genome (GRCh38), while maintaining its fast query time.

We introduce diaTracer, a new spectrum-centric computational tool optimized for diaPASEF data. diaTracer performs three-dimensional (m/z, retention time, ion mobility) peak tracing and feature detection to generate precursor-resolved ""pseudo-MS/MS"" spectra, facilitating direct (""spectral-library free"") peptide identification and quantification from diaPASEF data. diaTracer is available as a stand-alone tool and is fully integrated into the widely used FragPipe computational platform. We demonstrate the performance of diaTracer and FragPipe using diaPASEF data from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples, data from phosphoproteomics and HLA immunopeptidomics experiments, and low-input data from a spatial proteomics study.

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

C_LI

The molecular mechanisms that drive essential developmental patterning events in the mammalian embryo remain poorly understood. To generate a conceptual framework for gene regulatory processes during germ layer specification, we analyzed transcription factor (TF) expression kinetics around gastrulation and during in vitro differentiation. This approach identified Otx2 as a candidate regulator of definitive endoderm (DE), the precursor of all gut-derived tissues. Analysis of multipurpose degron alleles in gastruloid and directed differentiation models revealed that loss of OTX2 before or after DE specification alters the expression of core components and targets of specific cellular signaling pathways, perturbs adhesion and migration programs as well as de-represses regulators of other lineages, resulting in impaired foregut specification. Key targets of OTX2 are conserved in human DE. Mechanistically, OTX2 is required to establish chromatin accessibility at candidate enhancers, which regulate genes critical to establishing an anterior cell identity in the developing gut. Our results provide a working model for the progressive establishment of spatiotemporal cell identity by developmental TFs across germ layers and species, which may facilitate the generation of gut cell types for regenerative medicine applications.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

VTA cell types are often defined through neurotransmitters (NT). However, valence function in VTA does not parse along NT-boundaries as, within each NT-class, certain neurons are excited by reward and others by stressors. Here we identify the co-activated mouse VTA neuronal ensembles for reward and stress, and determine their role in adaptive behaviors. We show that stimuli of opposite valence (opioid vs acute social stress) recruit two segregated intermingled small VTA neuronal ensembles. These two ensembles continue to be preferentially engaged by congruent valence stimuli. Stimulation of VTA stress- or reward ensembles is aversive/reinforcing, respectively. Strikingly, external valence stimuli fully require activity of these small discrete VTA ensembles for conferring approach/avoidance outcomes. Overall, our study identifies distinct small VTA ensembles for positive and negative valence coding and shows their indispensability for adaptive behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

To develop a targeted bottom-up proteomics assay, peptides must be evaluated as proxies for the measurement of a protein or proteoform in a biological matrix. Candidate peptide selection typically relies on predetermined biochemical properties, data from semi-stochastic sampling, or by empirical measurements. These strategies require extensive testing and method refinement due to the difficulties associated with prediction of peptide response in the biological matrix of interest. Gas-phase fractionated (GPF) narrow window data-independent acquisition (DIA) aids in the development of reproducible selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays by providing matrix-specific information on peptide detectability and quantification by mass spectrometry. To demonstrate the suitability of DIA data for selecting peptide targets, we reimplement a portion of an existing assay to measure 98 Alzheimer's disease proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Peptides were selected from GPF-DIA based on signal intensity and reproducibility. The resulting SRM assay exhibits similar quantitative precision to published data, despite the inclusion of different peptides between the assays. This workflow enables development of new assays without additional up-front data acquisition, demonstrated here through generation of a separate assay for an unrelated set of proteins in CSF from the same dataset.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Exacerbating the public health threat posed by K. pneumoniae, some strains also harbor additional hypervirulence determinants typically acquired via mobile genetic elements such as the well-characterised large virulence plasmid KpVP-1. The rmpADC locus is considered a key virulence feature of K. pneumoniae and is associated with upregulated capsule expression and the hypermucoid phenotype, which can enhance virulence by contributing to serum resistance. Typically such strains have been susceptible to all antimicrobials besides ampicillin, however the recent emergence of AMR hypermucoid strains is concerning. Methods: Here, we investigate the genetic diversity, evolution, mobilisation and prevalence of rmpADC, in a dataset of 14000 genomes from isolates of the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex, and describe the RmST virulence typing scheme for tracking rmpADC variants for the purposes of genomic surveillance. Additionally, we examine the functionality of representatives for variants of rmpADC introduced into a mutant strain lacking its native rmpADC locus, Results: The rmpADC locus was detected in 7% of the dataset, mostly from genomes of K. pneumoniae and a very small number of K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae. Sequence variants of rmpADC grouped into five distinct lineages (rmp1, rmp2, rmp2A, rmp3 and rmp4) that corresponded to unique mobile elements, and were differentially distributed across different populations (i.e. clonal groups) of K. pneumoniae. All variants were demonstrated to produce enhanced capsule production and hypermucoviscosity. Conclusion: These results provide an overview of the diversity and evolution of a prominent K. pneumoniae virulence factor and support the idea that screening for rmpADC in K. pneumoniae isolates and genomes is valuable to monitor the emergence and spread of hypermucoid K. pneumoniae, including AMR strains.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

This paper aimed to assess a multitude of cardiac signs, symptoms, and conditions, as well as focused on patients with and without congenital heart defects (CHDs), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the post-acute cardiovascular outcomes among children and adolescents after COVID-19.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 19 US childrens hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and September 2023. Every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry. Absolute risks of incident post-acute COVID-19 sequelae were reported. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by contrasting COVID-19-positive with COVID-19-negative groups using a Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through propensity scoring stratification.

ResultsA total of 1,213,322 individuals under 21 years old (mean[SD] age, 7.75[6.11] years; 623,806 male [51.4%]) were included. The absolute rate of any post-acute cardiovascular outcome in this study was 2.32% in COVID-19 positive and 1.38% in negative groups. Patients with CHD post-SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks of any cardiovascular outcome (RR, 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-1.80), including increased risks of 11 of 18 post-acute sequelae in hypertension, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias), myocarditis, other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest), thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain and palpitations). Those without CHDs also experienced heightened cardiovascular risks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57-1.69), covering 14 of 18 conditions in hypertension, arrhythmias (ventricular arrhythmias and premature atrial or ventricular contractions), inflammatory heart disease (pericarditis and myocarditis), other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock), thrombotic disorders (pulmonary embolism and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and syncope).

ConclusionsBoth children with and without CHDs showed increased risks for a variety of cardiovascular outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the need for targeted monitoring and management in the post-acute phase.

Clinical Perspective sectionO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIWe investigated the risks of 18 post-acute COVID-19 cardiovascular outcomes in the pediatric population without Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in over 1 million patients, stratified by congenital heart defects (CHD) status.
C_LIO_LIWe extended the follow-up period beyond previous pediatric studies, ensuring every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry.
C_LIO_LIWe included a comprehensive cross-section of the US pediatric population across various healthcare settings including primary, specialty, and emergency care, as well as testing and inpatient facilities.
C_LI

What are the clinical implications?O_LIWithin the post-acute phase, children and adolescents previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at statistically significant increased risk of incident cardiovascular outcomes, including hypertension, ventricular arrhythmias, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, thromboembolism, chest pain, and palpitations. These findings are consistent among patients with and without CHDs.
C_LIO_LIAwareness of the heightened risk of cardiovascular disorders after COVID-19 can lead to a timely referral, investigations, and management of these conditions in children and adolescents.

We and others have shown during the first SARS-CoV-2 wave that a muted nasal epithelial interferon response at the site of infection underlies severe COVID-19. We sought to further understand how upper airway cell subsets and states associate with COVID-19 phenotypes across viral variants and vaccination. Here, we integrated new single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from nasopharyngeal swabs collected from 67 adult participants during the Delta and Omicron waves with data from 45 participants collected during the original (Ancestral) wave in our prior study. By characterizing detailed cellular states during infection, we identified changes in epithelial and immune cells that are both unique and shared across variants and vaccination status. By defining SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells for each variant, we found that Delta samples had a marked increase in the abundance of viral RNA+ cells. Despite this dramatic increase in viral RNA+ cells in Delta cases, the nasal cellular compositions of Delta and Omicron exhibit greater similarity, driven partly by myeloid subsets, than the Ancestral landscapes associated with specialized epithelial subsets. We found that vaccination prior to infection was surprisingly associated with nasal macrophage recruitment and activation rather than adaptive immune cell signatures. While patients with severe disease caused by Ancestral or Delta variants had muted interferon responses, Omicron-infected patients had equivalent interferon responses regardless of disease severity. Our study defines the evolution of cellular targets and signatures of disease severity in the upper respiratory tract across SARS-CoV-2 variants, and suggests that intramuscular vaccines shape myeloid responses in the nasal mucosa upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has MCSs with a variety of organelles in the cell. MCSs are dynamic, responding to changes in cell state, and are therefore best visualized through inducible labeling methods. However, existing methods typically distort ER-MCSs, by expanding contacts or creating artificial ones. Here we describe a new method for inducible labeling of ER-MCSs using the Lamin B receptor (LBR) and a generic anchor protein on the partner organelle. Termed LaBeRling, this versatile, one-to-many approach allows labeling of different types of ER-MCSs (mitochondria, plasma membrane, lysosomes, early endosomes, lipid droplets and Golgi), on-demand, in interphase or mitotic cells. LaBeRling is non-disruptive and does not change ER-MCSs in terms of the contact number, extent or distance measured; as determined by light microscopy or a deep-learning volume electron microscopy approach. We applied this method to study the changes in ER-MCSs during mitosis and to label novel ER-Golgi contact sites at different mitotic stages in live cells.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

However, much less is known about the efficacy of nAbs in preventing the acquisition of infection, especially in the context of natural immunity and against SARS-CoV-2 immune-escape variants. In this study, we conducted mediation analysis to assess serum nAbs induced by prior SARS-CoV-2 infections as potential correlates of protection (CoPs) against Delta and Omicron BA.1/2 wave infections, in rural and urban household cohorts in South Africa. We find that, in the Delta wave, anti-D614G nAbs mediate 37% (95%CI 34% - 40%) of the total protection against infection conferred by prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and that protection decreases with immunity waning. In contrast, anti-Omicron BA.1 nAbs mediate 11% (95%CI 9 - 12%) of the total protection against Omicron BA.1/2 wave infections, due to Omicrons neutralization escape. These findings underscore that CoPs mediated through nAbs are variant-specific, and that boosting of nAbs against circulating variants might restore or confer immune protection lost due to nAb waning and/or immune escape. However, the majority of immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 conferred by natural infection cannot be fully explained by serum nAbs alone. Measuring these and other immune markers including T-cell responses, both in the serum and in other compartments such as the nasal mucosa, may be required to comprehensively understand and predict immune protection against SARS-CoV-2.","NA","medrxiv",1717279473615

Cases of chronic viral infection have been suggested as an explanation for this phenomenon, whereby an extended period of infection, with an increased rate of evolution, creates viruses with substantial genetic novelty. However, measuring a rate of evolution during chronic infection is made more difficult by the potential existence of compartmentalisation in the viral population, whereby the viruses in a host form distinct subpopulations. We here describe and apply a novel statistical method to study within-host virus evolution, identifying the minimum number of subpopulations required to explain sequence data observed from cases of chronic infection, and inferring rates for within-host viral evolution. Across nine cases of chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalised patients we find that non-trivial population structure is relatively common, with four cases showing evidence of more than one viral population evolving independently within the host. We find cases of within-host evolution proceeding significantly faster, and significantly slower, than that of the global SARS-CoV-2 population, and of cases in which viral subpopulations in the same host have statistically distinguishable rates of evolution. Non-trivial population structure was associated with high rates of within-host evolution that were systematically underestimated by a more standard inference method.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Inflorescence architecture depends on shape, longevity and determinacy of meristems that direct growth of the main rachis and lateral branches, but how individual meristem activities are determined and integrated within complex inflorescences is not yet understood. We found that activity of distinct meristems in the barley inflorescence is coordinated by a signalling pathway comprising the receptor like kinase Hordeum vulgare CLAVATA1 (HvCLV1) and the secreted CLAVATA3/ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION (CLE)-family peptide FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (HvFCP1). HvFCP1 interacts with HvCLV1 to promote spikelet formation but restricts inflorescence meristem and rachilla meristem proliferation. Hvfcp1 or Hvclv1 mutants generate branched inflorescences with additional rows of spikelets and supernumerary florets. Transcriptome analysis reveals that HvFCP1/HvCLV1 signalling controls inflorescence branching through the regulation of trehalose-6-phosphate synthesis and sugar transport. Our discoveries reveal the potential to engineer barley inflorescence architecture by manipulating regulation of distinct meristem activities.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

The most common genetic causes are mutations in the CLN3 gene encoding a lysosomal protein. There are currently no therapies targeting the progression of the disease, mostly due to the lack of knowledge about the disease mechanisms. To gain insight into the impact of CLN3 loss on cellular signaling and organelle function, we generated CLN3 knock-out cells in a human cell line (CLN3-KO), and performed RNA sequencing to obtain the cellular transcriptome. Following a multi-dimensional transcriptome analysis, we identified the transcriptional regulator YAP1 as a major driver of the transcriptional changes observed in CLN3-KO cells. We further observed that YAP1 pro-apoptotic signaling is hyperactive as a consequence of CLN3 functional loss in retinal pigment epithelia cells, and in the hippocampus and thalamus of CLN3ex{Delta}7/8 mice, an established model of Batten disease. Loss of CLN3 activates YAP1 by a cascade of events that starts with the inability of releasing glycerophosphodiesthers from CLN3-KO lysosomes, which leads to perturbations in the lipid content of the nuclear envelope and nuclear dysmorphism. This results in increased number of DNA lesions, activating the kinase c-Abl, which phosphorylates YAP1, stimulating its pro-apoptotic signaling. Altogether, our results highlight a novel organelle crosstalk paradigm in which lysosomal metabolites regulate nuclear envelope content, nuclear shape and DNA homeostasis. This novel molecular mechanism underlying the loss of CLN3 in mammalian cells and tissues may open new c-Abl-centric therapeutic strategies to target Batten disease.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Specifically, the retromer-associated protein SDCCAG3, IFT20 and polycystin-2 (PC2) were reduced in cilia of DLG1 deficient cells compared to control cells.

Upon SMO activation, GRK2 rapidly relocalizes from the ciliary base to the shaft, triggering SMO phosphorylation and PKA-C interaction. Reconstitution studies reveal that GRK2 phosphorylation enables active SMO to bind PKA-C directly. Lastly, the SMO-GRK2-PKA pathway underlies Hh signal transduction in a range of cellular and in vivo models. Thus, GRK2 phosphorylation of ciliary SMO, and the ensuing PKA-C binding and inactivation, are critical initiating events for the intracellular steps in Hh signaling. More broadly, our study suggests an expanded role for GRKs in enabling direct GPCR interactions with diverse intracellular effectors.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Both the overall rate and the spatial distribution of crossovers vary within and between species. Adjacent crossovers on the same chromosome tend to be spaced more evenly than expected at random, a phenomenon known as crossover interference. Although interference has been observed in many taxa, the factors that influence the strength of interference are not well understood. We used house mice (Mus musculus), a well-established model system for understanding recombination, to study the effects of genetics and age on recombination rate and interference in the male germline. We analyzed crossover positions in 503 progeny from reciprocal F1 hybrids between inbred strains representing the three major subspecies of house mice. Consistent with previous studies, autosomal alleles from M. m. musculus tend to increase recombination rate, while inheriting a M. m. musculus X chromosome decreases recombination rate. Old males transmit an average of $0.6$ more crossovers per meiosis (5.0%) than young males, though the effect varies across genetic backgrounds. We show that the strength of crossover interference depends on genotype, providing a rare demonstration that interference evolves over short timescales. Differences between reciprocal F1s suggest that X-linked factors modulate the strength of interference. Our findings motivate additional comparisons of interference among recently diverged species and further examination of the role of paternal age in determining the number and positioning of crossovers.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Mutations in troponin can cause cardiomyopathies; however, it is still a major challenge for the field to connect how changes in sequence affect troponin's function. Recent high-resolution structures of the thin filament revealed critical insights into the structure-function relationship of the troponin complex, but there remain large, unresolved segments of troponin, including the troponin-T linker region that is a hotspot for several cardiomyopathy mutations. This unresolved yet functionally-significant linker region has been proposed to be intrinsically disordered, with behaviors that are not well described by traditional structural approaches; however, this proposal has not been experimentally verified. Here, we used a combination of single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), molecular dynamics simulations, and functional reconstitution assays to investigate the troponin-T linker region. We experimentally and computationally show that in the context of both isolated troponin and the fully regulated troponin complex, the linker behaves as a dynamic, intrinsically disordered region. This region undergoes polyampholyte expansion in the presence of high salt and distinct conformational changes during the assembly of the troponin complex. We also examine the {Delta}E160 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutation in the linker, and we demonstrate that this mutation does not affect the conformational dynamics of the linker, rather it allosterically affects interactions with other subunits of the troponin complex, leading to increased molecular contractility. Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate the importance of disorder within the troponin-T linker and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

We found five Irx genes (Irx1, Irx2, Irx3, Irx5, and Irx6) to be confined mostly to ventral spinal domains, offering new molecular markers for specific groups of post-mitotic motor neurons (MNs). Further, we engineered Irx2, Irx5, and Irx6 mouse mutants and uncovered essential but distinct roles for Irx2 and Irx6 in MN development. Last, we found that the highly conserved regulators of MN development across species, the HOX proteins, directly control Irx gene expression both in mouse and C. elegans MNs, critically expanding the repertoire of HOX target genes in the developing nervous system. Altogether, our study provides important insights into Iro/Irx expression and function in the developing spinal cord, and uncovers an ancient gene regulatory relationship between HOX and Iro/Irx genes.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Prior work has shown that early life adversity (ELA) leads to hyperinnervation of glutamatergic basolateral amygdala (BLA) projections to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in adolescence. While hyperinnervation is associated with later-life anxiety behaviors, the physiological changes underpinning corticolimbic and behavioral impacts of ELA are not understood. We tested whether postsynaptic BLA-driven PFC activity is enhanced in ELA-exposed animals, using the maternal separation (MS) model of ELA. PFC local-field potential following BLA stimulation was facilitated in MS-exposed adolescents. Since ELA increases activity of the early-developing BLA, while the PFC exhibits protracted development, we further examined impacts of glutamatergic BLA activity during early adolescence on later-life PFC innervation and heightened anxiety. In early adolescence, MS-exposed animals exhibited decreased anxiety-like behavior, and acute adolescent BLA inhibition induced behaviors that resembled those of MS animals. To examine long-lasting impacts of adolescent BLA activity on innervation, BLA-originating axonal boutons in the PFC were quantified in late adolescence after early adolescent BLA inhibition. We further tested whether late adolescent BLA-PFC changes were associated with anxious reactivity expressed as heightened acoustic startle responses. MS rearing increased BLA-PFC innervation and threat reactivity in late adolescence, however early adolescent BLA inhibition was insufficient to prevent MS effects, suggesting that earlier BLA activity or post-synaptic receptor rearrangement in the PFC drives altered innervation. Taken together, these findings highlight both pre- and postsynaptic changes in the adolescent BLA-PFC circuit following ELA.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Two salient limitations are that <2% of the ~600 E3 ligases in the human genome have been exploited to produce proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), and the efficacy of the approach has not been demonstrated for a vital class of complex multi-subunit membrane proteins - ion channels. NEDD4-1 and NEDD4-2 are physiological regulators of myriad ion channels, and belong to the 28-member HECT (homologous to E6AP C-terminus) family of E3 ligases with widespread roles in cell/developmental biology and diverse diseases including various cancers, immunological and neurological disorders, and chronic pain. The potential efficacy of HECT E3 ligases for targeted protein degradation is unexplored, constrained by a lack of appropriate binders, and uncertain due to their complex regulation by layered intra-molecular and posttranslational mechanisms. Here, we identified a nanobody that binds with high affinity and specificity to a unique site on the N-lobe of the NEDD4-2 HECT domain at a location physically separate from sites critical for catalysis- the E2 binding site, the catalytic cysteine, and the ubiquitin exosite- as revealed by a 3.1 [A] cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction. Recruiting endogenous NEDD4-2 to diverse ion channel proteins (KCNQ1, ENaC, and CaV2.2) using a divalent (DiVa) nanobody format strongly reduced their functional expression with minimal off-target effects as assessed by global proteomics, compared to simple NEDD4-2 overexpression. The results establish utility of a HECT E3 ligase for targeted protein downregulation, validate a class of complex multi-subunit membrane proteins as susceptible to this modality, and introduce endogenous E3 ligase recruitment with DiVa nanobodies as a general method to generate novel genetically-encoded ion channel inhibitors.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Although hierarchies are largely stable across time, animals may socially ascend or descend within hierarchies depending on environmental and social challenges. Here, we develop a novel paradigm to study social ascent and descent within male CD-1 mouse social hierarchies. We show that mice of all social ranks rapidly establish new stable social hierarchies when placed in novel social groups with animals of equivalent social status. Seventy minutes following social hierarchy formation, previously socially dominant animals exhibit higher increases in plasma corticosterone and vastly greater transcriptional changes in the medial amygdala (MeA), which is central to the regulation of social behavior, compared to previously subordinate animals. Specifically, social descent is associated with reductions in MeA expression of myelination and oligodendrocyte differentiation genes. Maintaining high social status is associated with high expression of genes related to cholinergic signaling in the MeA. Conversely, social ascent is related to relatively few unique rapid changes in the MeA. We also identify novel genes associated with social transition that show common changes in expression when animals undergo either social descent or social ascent compared to maintaining their status. Two genes, Myosin binding protein C1 (Mybpc1) and -Crystallin (Crym), associated with vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and thyroid hormone pathways respectively, are highly upregulated in socially transitioning individuals. Further, increases in genes associated with synaptic plasticity, excitatory glutamatergic signaling and learning and memory pathways were observed in transitioning animals suggesting that adaptations in these processes may support rapid social status changes.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Core outcome sets for specific subsets of ICU patients exist, e.g., respiratory failure, delirium, and COVID-19, but not for ICU patients in general. Accordingly, we aimed to develop a core outcome set for adult general ICU patients.

MethodsWe developed a core outcome set in Denmark following the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Handbook. We used a modified Delphi consensus process with multiple methods design, including literature review, survey, semi-structured interviews, and discussions with initially five Danish research panels, involving adult ICU survivors, family members, clinicians, and researchers. The core outcome set was internationally validated in local panels in 14 countries and revised accordingly.

ResultsWe identified 329 published outcomes, of which 50 were included in the 264 participant Delphi survey. After 82 semi-structured survey participant interviews no additional outcomes were added. The first survey round was completed by 249 (94%) participants, and 202 (82%) contributed to the final third round. The initial core outcome set comprised six core outcomes. International validation involved 217 research panel members and resulted in the final core outcome set of survival, free of life support, free of delirium, out of hospital, health-related quality of life, and cognitive function.

ConclusionsWe developed and internationally validated a core outcome set with six core outcomes to be used in research, specifically clinical trials involving adult general ICU patients.","NA","medrxiv",1717279473615

Targeting of RISC to foreign RNA establishes amplification loops, wherein RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase 6 (RDR6) synthesizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for secondary small interfering RNA (siRNA) biogenesis, using cleavage fragments of RNA targeted by RISC programmed with a primary siRNA as template. Secondary siRNA production from endogenous RISC targets requires a particular primary small RNA size or target site multiplicity. siRNA amplification in yeast and nematodes requires terminal nucleotidyl transferases (TNTases), but their roles in plants are unclear. Here, we demonstrate two functions of TNTases in siRNA amplification in Arabidopsis thaliana. URT1 prevents initiation of microRNA-induced secondary siRNA formation through uridylation of 5'-cleavage fragments, sometimes redundantly with the exosome and the TNTase HESO1. Once initiated via RDR6 recruitment, HESO1 and other TNTases stimulate secondary siRNA formation by producing 2-nt 3'overhangs on RDR6-synthesized dsRNA to yield substrates for processing into siRNAs by DICER-LIKE4. These results define molecular mechanisms by which TNTases control siRNA amplification in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Extensive genome sequencing efforts are currently in progress across a broad spectrum of life forms, holding the potential to unravel the intricate branching patterns within the tree of life. However, estimating species trees starting from raw genome sequences is quite challenging, and the current cutting-edge methodologies require a series of error-prone steps that are neither entirely automated nor standardized. In this paper, we present ROADIES, a novel pipeline for species tree inference from raw genome assemblies that is fully automated, easy to use, scalable, free from reference bias, and provides flexibility to adjust the tradeoff between accuracy and runtime. The ROADIES pipeline eliminates the need to align whole genomes, choose a single reference species, or pre-select loci such as functional genes found using cumbersome annotation steps. Moreover, it leverages recent advances in phylogenetic inference to allow multi-copy genes, eliminating the need to detect orthology. Using the genomic datasets released from large-scale sequencing consortia across three diverse life forms (placental mammals, pomace flies, and birds), we show that ROADIES infers species trees that are comparable in quality with the state-of-the-art approaches but in a fraction of the time. By incorporating optimal approaches and automating all steps from assembled genomes to species and gene trees, ROADIES is poised to improve the accuracy, scalability, and reproducibility of phylogenomic analyses.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Benchmarking of the available methods has revealed general tradeoffs between accuracy and scalability, but performance in downstream applications has not always been easily predictable from general performance measures, suggesting that specific features of the ARG may be important for specific downstream applications of estimated ARGs. To exemplify this point, we benchmark ARG estimation methods with respect to a specific set of methods for estimating the historical time course of a population-mean polygenic score (PGS) using the marginal coalescent trees encoded by the ancestral recombination graph (ARG). Here we examine the performance in simulation of six ARG estimation methods: ARGweaver, RENT+, Relate, tsinfer+tsdate, ARG-Needle/ASMC-clust, and SINGER, using their estimated coalescent trees and examining bias, mean squared error (MSE), confidence interval coverage, and Type I and II error rates of the downstream methods. Although it does not scale to the sample sizes attainable by other new methods, SINGER produced the most accurate estimated PGS histories in many instances, even when Relate, tsinfer+tsdate, and ARG-Needle/ASMC-clust used samples ten times as large as those used by SINGER. In general, the best choice of method depends on the number of samples available and the historical time period of interest. In particular, the unprecedented sample sizes allowed by Relate, tsinfer+tsdate, and ARG-Needle/ASMC-clust are of greatest importance when the recent past is of interest--further back in time, most of the tree has coalesced, and differences in contemporary sample size are less salient.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Our understanding of how animals evolved this exquisite regulatory control remains elusive, but evidence suggests that changes in chromatin-based mechanisms may have contributed. To investigate this possibility, here we examine chromatin-based gene regulatory features in the closest relatives of animals, choanoflagellates. Using Salpingoeca rosetta as a model system, we examined chromatin accessibility and histone modifications at the genome scale and compared these features to gene expression. We first observed that accessible regions of chromatin are primarily associated with gene promoters and found no evidence of distal gene regulatory elements resembling the enhancers that animals deploy to regulate developmental gene expression. Remarkably, a histone modification deposited by polycomb repressive complex 2, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), appeared to function similarly in S. rosetta to its role in animals, because this modification decorated genes with cell type-specific expression. Additionally, H3K27me3 marked transposons, retaining what appears to be an ancestral role in regulating these elements. We further uncovered a putative new bivalent chromatin state at cell type-specific genes that consists of H3K27me3 and histone H3 lysine 4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1). Together, our discoveries support the scenario that gene-associated histone modification states that underpin development emerged before the evolution of animal multicellularity.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

The recovery of mammalian predators of conservation concern in Europe is a success story, but their impact on some prey species of conservation concern may cause conservation dilemmas. This calls for effective intervention strategies that mitigate predator impacts without compromising their recovery.

2. We evaluated diversionary feeding as a management intervention tool to reduce depredation on nests of rapidly declining Western capercaillies in Scotland. We studied the influence of diversionary feeding provision on the fates of artificial nests deployed using a replicated and representative randomised landscape-scale experiment. This comprised 30 paired control (no diversionary feeding) and treatment (diversionary feeding applied) sites, 60 in total, each containing six artificial nests distributed across 600 km2. The experiment was replicated over two years, and in the second year, the control-treatment pairs were reversed, yielding 60 treatment and 60 control sites and 720 artificial nests.

3. Diversionary feeding substantially reduced depredation of artificial nests, translating into an 83% increase in predicted nest survival over 28 days of incubation. The increase in survival was mostly accounted for by a reduction in the probability that a pine marten, the main nest predator, consumed or cached eggs. Diversionary food also significantly reduced nest predation by badgers, although the magnitude of this effect varied by year.

4. Diversionary feeding is an easily employable method shown in this study to reduce predator impact (functional) without lethal (numerical) intervention. Managers should proceed with its application for conserving capercaillie in Scotland without delay.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Although the presence of neoblast-like cells and whole-body regeneration in other animals has led to the idea that these features may represent the ancestral metazoan state, the evolutionary origin of both remains unclear. Here we show that the catenulid Stenostomum brevipharyngium, a member of the earliest-branching flatworm lineage, lacks conventional neoblasts despite being capable of whole-body regeneration and asexual reproduction. Using a combination of single-nuclei transcriptomics, in situ gene expression analysis, and functional experiments, we find that cell divisions are not restricted to a single cell type and are associated with multiple fully differentiated somatic tissues. Furthermore, the cohort of germline multipotency genes, which are considered canonical neoblast markers, are not expressed in dividing cells, but in the germline instead, and we experimentally show that they are neither necessary for proliferation nor regeneration. Overall, our results challenge the notion that canonical neoblasts are necessary for flatworm regeneration and open up the possibility that neoblast-like cells may have evolved convergently in different animals, independent of their regenerative capacity.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

However, most models have been applied in unperturbed contexts, precluding a predictive understanding of how chromatin state responds to TF perturbation. Here, we used transfer learning to train and interpret deep learning models that use DNA sequence to predict, with accuracy approaching experimental reproducibility, how the concentration of two dosage-sensitive TFs (TWIST1, SOX9) affects regulatory element (RE) chromatin accessibility in facial progenitor cells. High-affinity motifs that allow for heterotypic TF co-binding and are concentrated at the center of REs buffer against quantitative changes in TF dosage and strongly predict unperturbed accessibility. In contrast, motifs with low-affinity or homotypic binding distributed throughout REs lead to sensitive responses with minimal contributions to unperturbed accessibility. Both buffering and sensitizing features show signatures of purifying selection. We validated these predictive sequence features using reporter assays and showed that a biophysical model of TF-nucleosome competition can explain the sensitizing effect of low-affinity motifs. Our approach of combining transfer learning and quantitative measurements of the chromatin response to TF dosage therefore represents a powerful method to reveal additional layers of the cis-regulatory code.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

The Episodic Disability Framework (EDF), derived from perspectives of adults living with HIV, characterizes the multidimensional and episodic nature of health-related challenges (disability) experienced by an individual. Our aim was to determine the applicability of the Episodic Disability Framework to conceptualize the health-related challenges experienced among adults living with Long COVID.

MethodsWe conducted a community-engaged qualitative descriptive study involving online semi-structured interviews. We recruited adults who self-identified as living with Long COVID via collaborator community organizations in Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom, and United States. We purposively recruited for diversity in age, gender identity, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and time since initial COVID-19 infection. We used a semi-structured interview guide informed by the EDF to explore experiences of disability living with Long COVID, specifically health-related challenges and how challenges were experienced over time. We conducted a group-based content analysis.

ResultsOf the 40 participants, the median age was 39 years; and the majority were white 73%), women (63%), living with Long COVID for [&ge;]1 year (83%). Consistent with the Episodic Disability Framework, disability was described as multidimensional and episodic, characterized by unpredictable periods of health and illness. Experiences of disability were consistent with the three main components of the Framework: A) dimensions of disability (physical, cognitive, mental-emotional health challenges, difficulties with day-to-day activities, challenges to social inclusion, uncertainty); B) contextual factors, extrinsic (social support; accessibility of environment and health services; stigma and epistemic injustice) and intrinsic (living strategies; personal attributes) that exacerbate or alleviate dimensions of disability; and C) triggers that initiate episodes of disability.

ConclusionsThe Episodic Disability Framework provides a way to conceptualize disability the multidimensional and episodic nature of disability experienced by adults living with Long COVID. The Framework provides guidance for future measurement of disability, and health and rehabilitation approaches to enhance practice, research, and policy in Long COVID.","NA","medrxiv",1717279473615

Piezos undergo large conformational changes, induce far-reaching deformation onto the membrane, and modulate the function of two-pore potassium (K2P) channels. Taken together, this led us to hypothesize that Piezos may be able to signal their conformational state to other nearby proteins. Here, we use chemical control to acutely restrict Piezo1 conformational flexibility and show that Piezo1 conformational changes, but not ion permeation through it, are required for modulating the K2P channel TREK1. Super-resolution imaging and stochastic simulations further reveal that both channels do not co-localize, which implies that modulation is not mediated through direct binding interactions; however, at high Piezo1 densities, most TREK1 channels are within the predicted Piezo1 membrane footprint, suggesting the footprint may underlie conformational signaling. We speculate that physiological roles originally attributed to Piezo1 ionotropic function could, alternatively, involve conformational signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

The identification of high-confidence large-effect autism risk genes offers the opportunity to identify convergent, underlying biology by studying these genes in the context of the gastrointestinal system. Here we show that the expression of these genes is enriched in human prenatal gut neurons as well as their migratory progenitors, suggesting that the development and/or function of these neurons may be disrupted by autism-associated pathogenic variants, leading to gastrointestinal dysfunction. Here we document the prevalence of gastrointestinal issues in patients with large-effect variants in sixteen of these genes, highlighting dysmotility, consistent with potential enteric neuron dysfunction. Using the high-throughput diploid frog Xenopus tropicalis, we individually target five of these genes (SYNGAP1, CHD8, SCN2A, CHD2, and DYRK1A) and observe disrupted enteric neuronal progenitor migration for each. More extensive analysis of DYRK1A reveals that perturbation causes gut dysmotility in vivo, which can be ameliorated by treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (escitalopram) or a serotonin receptor 6 agonist, identified by in vivo drug screening. This work suggests that atypical development of enteric neurons contributes to the gastrointestinal distress commonly seen in individuals with autism and that increasing serotonin signaling may be a productive therapeutic avenue.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Our study explores the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, a classic model system in biology and a species adept at microscale interaction, as a biological platform for micro-robotics.

We accomplish this through two distinct approaches: harnessing the fruit flies opto-motor response and optogenetic modulation of its olfactory system. These techniques facilitate reliable and repeated guidance of flies between arbitrary spatial locations. We guide flies along predetermined trajectories, enabling them to scribe patterns resembling textual characters through their locomotion. We enhance olfactory-guided navigation through additional optogenetic activation of positive valence mushroom body output neurons. We extend this control to collective behaviors in shared spaces and navigation through constrained maze-like environments. We further use our guidance technique to enable flies to carry a load across designated points in space, establishing the upper bound on their weight carrying capabilities. Additionally, we demonstrate that visual guidance can facilitate novel interactions between flies and objects, showing that flies can consistently relocate a small spherical object over significant distances. Beyond expanding tools available for micro-robotics, these novel behavioral contexts can provide insights into the neurological basis of behavior in fruit flies.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Neural pathologies are often associated with anatomical changes in these axonal projections and synaptic connections. Notably, axonal density variations of local and long-range projections increase or decrease as a function of the strengthening or weakening, respectively, of the information flow between brain regions. Traditionally, histological quantification of axonal inputs relied on assessing the mean fluorescence intensity within a rectangle placed in the brain region-of-interest. Despite yielding valuable insights, this conventional method is notably susceptible to background fluorescence, post-acquisition adjustments, and inter-researcher variability. Additionally, it fails to account for the non-uniform innervation across brain regions, thus overlooking critical data such as innervation percentages and axonal distribution patterns. In response to these chal-lenges, we introduce AxoDen, an open-source semi-automated platform designed to increase the speed and rigor of axon quantifications for basic neuroscience discovery. AxoDen processes user-defined brain regions-of-interests incorporating dynamic thresholding of grayscales-transformed images to facilitate binarized pixel measurements. Thereby AxoDen segregates the image content into signal and non-signal categories, effectively eliminating background interference and enabling the exclusive measurement of fluorescence from axonal projections. AxoDen provides detailed and accurate representations of axonal density and spatial distribution. AxoDen's advanced yet user-friendly platform enhances the reliability and efficiency of axonal density analysis and facilitates access to unbiased high-quality data analysis with no technical background or coding experience required.

However, accurate and precise de novo assemblies of large and complex genomes remains a challenging task. Long-read sequencing data alone or in hybrid mode combined with more accurate short-read sequences facilitate the de novo assembly of genomes. A number of software exists for de novo genome assembly from long-read data although specific performance comparisons to assembly human genomes are lacking. Here we benchmarked 11 different pipelines including four long-read only assemblers and three hybrid assemblers, combined with four polishing schemes for de novo genome assembly of a human reference material sequenced with Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Illumina. In addition, the best performing choice was validated in a non-reference routine laboratory sample. Software performance was evaluated by assessing the quality of the assemblies with QUAST, BUSCO, and Merqury metrics, and the computational costs associated with each of the pipelines were also assessed. We found that Flye was superior to all other assemblers, especially when relying on Ratatosk error-corrected long-reads. Polishing improved the accuracy and continuity of the assemblies and the combination of two rounds of Racon and Pilon achieved the best results. The assembly of the non-reference sample showed comparable assembly metrics as those of the reference material. Based on the results, a complete optimal analysis pipeline for the assembly, polishing, and contig curation developed on Nextflow is provided to enable efficient parallelization and built-in dependency management to further advance in the generation of high-quality and chromosome-level human assemblies.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

A recently published computational approach, IBDGem, analyzes sequencing reads, including from low-coverage samples, in order to arrive at likelihood ratios for tests of identity. Here, we show that likelihood ratios produced by IBDGem test a null hypothesis different from the traditional one used in a forensic genetics context. In particular, rather than testing the hypothesis that the sample comes from a person unrelated to the person of interest, IBDGem tests the hypothesis that the sample comes from an individual who is included in the reference sample used to run the method. This null hypothesis is not generally of forensic interest, because the defense hypothesis is not that the evidence comes from an individual included in a reference panel. Further, it does not take into account genetic variation outside the reference panel, and as a result, the computed likelihood ratios can be much larger than likelihood ratios computed for the standard forensic null hypothesis, often by many orders of magnitude, thus potentially creating an impression of stronger evidence for identity than is warranted. We lay out this result and illustrate it with examples, giving suggestions for directions that might lead to likelihood ratios that have the traditional interpretation.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

FtsZ recruits other proteins, collectively known as the divisome, that together remodel and constrict the envelope. Constriction is driven by peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall synthesis by the glycosyltransferase FtsW and the transpeptidase FtsI (FtsWI), but these enzymes require activation to function. How recruitment of FtsZ to the division site leads to FtsWI activation and constriction remains largely unknown. Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that an FtsZ-binding protein, FzlA, is essential for activation of FtsWI in the alphaproteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Additionally, we found that FzlA also binds to a DNA translocase called FtsK, suggesting that it may link constriction activation to chromosome segregation. FzlA is conserved throughout alphaproteobacteria but has only been examined in detail in C. crescentus. Here, we explored whether FzlA function is conserved in diverse alphaproteobacteria. We assessed FzlA homologs from Rickettsia parkeri and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and found that, similar to C. crescentus FzlA, they bind directly to FtsZ and localize to midcell. The FtsZ-FzlA interaction interface is conserved, as we demonstrated that FzlA from each of the three species examined can bind to FtsZ from any of the three in vitro. Additionally, we determined that A. tumefaciens FzlA can fulfill the essential function of FzlA when produced in C. crescentus, indicating conservation of function. These results suggest that FzlA serves as an important regulator that coordinates chromosome segregation with envelope constriction across diverse alphaproteobacteria.

ImportanceCell division is essential for bacterial replication and must be highly regulated to ensure robust remodeling of the cell wall in coordination with segregation of the genome to daughter cells. In Caulobacter crescentus, FzlA plays a major role in regulating this process by activating cell wall synthesis in a manner that couples constriction to chromosome segregation. FzlA is broadly conserved in alphaproteobacteria suggesting it plays a similar function across this class of bacteria. Here we have shown that, indeed, FzlA biochemical interactions and function are conserved in diverse alphaproteobacteria. Because FzlA is conserved in alphaproteobacterial human pathogens, understanding this protein and its interactome could present therapeutic benefits by identifying potential antibiotic targets to treat infections.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Little is known about how E. faecalis responds to growth in arginine in the absence of other bacteria. To address this, we used RNAseq and additional assays to measure growth, gene expression, and biofilm formation in E. faecalis OG1RF grown in arginine. We demonstrate that arginine decreases E. faecalis biofilm production and causes widespread differential expression of genes related to metabolism, quorum sensing, and polysaccharide synthesis. Growth in arginine also increases aggregation of E. faecalis and promotes decreased susceptibility to the antibiotics ampicillin and ceftriaxone. This work provides a platform for understanding of how the presence of arginine in biological niches affects E. faecalis physiology and virulence of surrounding microbes.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms.

Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

A recent notion that most psychotropics are detrimental to the gut microbiota has arisen from consistent findings of metabolic adverse effects. However, unlike olanzapine, the metabolic effects of lurasidone are conflicting, with most reports observing weight loss rather than gain. Thus, this study investigates the contrasting effects of olanzapine and lurasidone on the gut microbiota to explore the hypothesis of ""gut neutrality"" for lurasidone exposure.

Experimental ApproachUsing a Sprague-Dawley rat model, the impact of olanzapine and lurasidone administration on the gut microbiota was explored. Faecal and blood samples were collected weekly over a 21-day period to analyse changes to the gut microbiota and related metabolic markers.

Key ResultsLurasidone triggered no significant weight gain or metabolic alterations, instead positively modulating gut microbiota through increases in mean OTUs (+50 OTUs) and alpha diversity (+0.5 increase in Shannons index). This novel finding suggests an underlying mechanism for lurasidones metabolic inertia. In contrast, olanzapine triggered a statistically significant decrease in mean OTUs (-75 OTUs) and substantial compositional variation, suggesting a decrease in microbial richness. Microbiota alterations correlated with metabolic dysfunction, evidenced through a statistically significant 30% increase in weight gain, increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and increase in blood triglycerides and glycaemic levels.

Conclusion and ImplicationsThe study challenges the notion that all antipsychotics disrupt the gut microbiota similarly and highlights the potential benefits of gut positive or neutral antipsychotics like lurasidone in managing metabolic side effects. Further research is warranted to validate these findings in humans to guide personalised pharmacological treatment regimens for schizophrenia.

The mechanisms of cognitive impairment after COVID-19 (COGVID) remain unclear, but neuroimaging studies provide evidence of brain changes, many that are associated with aging. Therefore, we calculated Brain Age Gap (BAG), which is the difference between brain age and chronological age, in a cohort of 25 mild to moderate COVID-19 survivors (did not experience breathlessness, pneumonia, or respiratory/organ failure) and 24 non-infected controls (mean age = 30 +/- 8) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). BAG was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (F = 4.22, p = 0.046) by 2.65 years. Additionally, 80% of the COVID-19 group demonstrated an accelerated BAG compared to 13% in the control group (X2 = 20.0, p < 0.001). Accelerated BAG was significantly correlated with lower cognitive function (p < 0.041). Females in the COVID-19 group demonstrated a 99% decreased risk of accelerated BAG compared to males (OR = 0.015, 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.300). There was also a small (1.4%) but significant decrease in risk for accelerated BAG associated with longer time since COVID-19 diagnosis (OR = 0.986, 95% CI: 0.977 to 0.995). Our findings provide a novel biomarker of COGVID and point to accelerated brain aging as a potential mechanism of this adverse effect.

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported.

The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time.

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1717279473615

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

FundingNational Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2701800 and 2022YFC2304700), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82202567 and 32270003), Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2022278), Shanghai Rising-Star Program (23QA1410500), and Shanghai municipal three-year action plan for strengthening the construction of the public health system (2023-2025) GWVI-2.1.2.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1717279473615

Recently, the emergence and dominance of the JN.1 lineage over XBB variants have prompted a reevaluation of current vaccine strategies.

In this study, we compared the humoral immunogenicity of XBB and JN.1 lineage infections in human subjects with diverse immune histories to understand the antigenic and immunogenic distinctions between these variants. Similar to observations in naive mice, priming with XBB and JN.1 in humans without prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure results in distinct NAb responses, exhibiting minimal cross-reactivity. Importantly, breakthrough infections (BTI) with the JN.1 lineage induce 5.9-fold higher neutralization titers against JN.1 compared to those induced by XBB BTI. We also observed notable immune evasion of recently emerged JN.1 sublineages, including JN.1+R346T+F456L, with KP.3 showing the most pronounced decrease in neutralization titers by both XBB and JN.1 BTI sera.

DesignNationwide cohort studies, using target trial emulation.

SettingDenmark, Finland, and Sweden, from 1 October 2023 to 29 February 2024.

ParticipantsIndividuals aged [&ge;]65 years who had previously received at least four covid-19 vaccine doses. Main outcome measures: Cumulative incidences of covid-19 hospital admission and death for 12 weeks after immunisation (defined as 1 week after vaccination) among recipients of an XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk differences.

ResultsDuring autumn and winter 2023-2024, a total of 1,867,448 1:1 matched pairs of XBB-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and non-recipients were included (mean age 75.4 years, standard deviation 7.4 years). The comparative vaccine effectiveness was 60.6% (95% confidence interval, 46.1% to 75.1%) against covid-19 hospital admission (930 v 2,551 events) and 77.9% (69.2% to 86.7%) against covid-19 related death (301 v 1,326 events) at 12 weeks of follow-up. This corresponded to 191.1 (95% confidence interval, 50.2 to 332.1) covid-19 hospital admissions and 109.2 (100.2 to 118.1) deaths prevented per 100,000 individuals vaccinated with an XBB.1.5-containing vaccine. The comparative vaccine effectiveness was similar across sex, age (65-74/[&ge;]75 years), number of previous covid-19 vaccine doses received, and seasonal influenza vaccination co-administration subgroups and periods of either omicron XBB- or BA.2.86-sublineage dominance. While the protection was highest during the first weeks after vaccination, it was well-preserved at end of week 12 of follow-up.

ConclusionAmong adults aged [&ge;]65 years, vaccination with a monovalent XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine reduced the rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and death during autumn and winter 2023-2024 across three Nordic countries.","NA","medrxiv",1717279473615
"Divergent views on drivers of early phase clinical trial participation among ethnically diverse potential trial participants in the United Kingdom: A Mixed Methods Study","10.1101/2024.04.04.24305355","medrxiv",128.25,0,0,0,126,"Hortelano, P.

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1717279473615

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1717279473615

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

It forms a right-handed helical barrel consisting of 22 pairs of Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 subunits, with a diameter of 32 nm its wider end and 19 nm at its narrower end. Oligomerization is stabilized by the C-terminus, which forms two helical layers linked by a {beta}-strand, and coiled-coil domains that enable strong charge-charge inter-subunit interactions. Flotillin interacts with membranes at both ends; through its SPFH1 domains at the wide end and the C-terminus at the narrow end, facilitated by hydrophobic interactions and lipidation. The inward tilting of the SPFH domain, likely triggered by phosphorylation, suggests its role in membrane curvature induction, which could be connected to its proposed role in clathrin-independent endocytosis. The structure suggests a shared architecture across the family of SPFH proteins and will promote further research into Flotillins roles in cell biology.

Significance statementIt is well known that many biochemical processes in cells must occur in localized regions. There are many different ideas about how cells keep processes localized. In this study we demonstrate that Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 co-assemble to form a large, truncated cone shaped cage whose wide end is always attached to a membrane surface and whose narrow end is sometimes attached to a separate membrane. The entire wall of the cage is without holes and is likely impervious even to small molecules, forming a diffusion barrier that can connect membrane systems. The Flotillin cage is thus well suited to isolate biochemical processes. Through membrane attachment, it also alters local membrane curvature, which could influence endocytic and mechanosensory processes.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

However, this approach can produce variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice appeared to habituate more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in withdrawal behavior. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdalar neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map pain sensation and affect.","NA","biorxiv",1717279473615

Systematic review identified thirty-nine studies that suffered from one particular and serious form of bias called miscategorisation bias, whereby study participants who have been vaccinated are categorised as unvaccinated up to and until some arbitrarily defined time after vaccination occurred. Simulation demonstrates that this miscategorisation bias artificially boosts vaccine efficacy and infection rates even when a vaccine has zero or negative efficacy. Furthermore, simulation demonstrates that repeated boosters, given every few months, are needed to maintain this misleading impression of efficacy. Given this, any claims of Covid-19 vaccine efficacy based on these studies are likely to be a statistical illusion.","NA","medrxiv",1717279473615
