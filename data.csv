Group II introns are MGEs that reduce host burden by autocatalytically splicing out of RNA before translation. While widely known in bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic organellar genomes, group II introns have been considered absent in phage. Identifying group II introns in genome sequences has previously been challenging because of their lack of primary sequence similarity. Advances in RNA structure-based homology searches using covariance models has provided the ability to identify the conserved secondary structures of group II introns. Here, we discover that group II introns are widely prevalent in phages from diverse phylogenetic backgrounds, from endosymbiont phage to jumbophage.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

Expanding this space to include noncanonical amino acids (NCAAs) offers new opportunities for probing novel interactions and engineering proteins with enhanced or entirely new functions. Some NCAAs also offer practical advantages, such as increased proteolytic stability and reduced immunogenicity, as they are rarely encountered by the human immune system. Here, we present RareFold, a deep learning model capable of accurate structure prediction for proteins containing both the 20 canonical amino acids and an additional 29 NCAAs. By treating each amino acid as a distinct token, RareFold learns residue-specific atomic interaction patterns, enabling precise modelling of chemically diverse sequences. This tokenised representation also supports sequence-structure co-optimisation, allowing efficient inverse design. We leverage this capability in EvoBindRare, a design framework for generating linear and cyclic peptide binders that incorporate NCAAs. Applying EvoBindRare, we design binders targeting a ribonuclease and experimentally validate these, obtaining M affinity in both the linear and cyclic cases. RareFold thus enables binder design with an expanded chemical vocabulary, opening the door to next-generation peptide therapeutics with improved stability, specificity, and immune evasion.

Upon activation, DCs undergo changes in their transcriptome, phenotype, and function, depending on the tissue microenvironment. The role of DC activation during human chronic inflammation has yet to be explored. To address this, we aimed to investigate activated DCs across a range of chronically inflamed human tissues, with a focus on cervical lymph nodes (LNs). We performed scRNAseq and flow cytometry on healthy, acutely, chronically inflamed, and cancer-associated human cervical (LNs) and identified a novel inflammation-associated DC (iaDC) cell state, found only within chronically inflamed LNs. iaDCs were defined by a unique cytokine expression profile (CXCL9, CXCL10, IL1B) and could be phenotypically distinguished from other activated DCs by their elevated expression of CD1C, CD206, CD319, and CD274. Functionally, we found that IFNg signaling induces DC2s to enter the iaDC cell state and that this process can be abrogated by inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling. Using spatial transcriptomics, we observed LN iaDC residing within a specific chronic inflammatory niche, which was enriched for inflammatory monocytes, NK cells, and effector memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Extrapolating our findings to other chronic inflammation-associated diseases, we similarly observed the emergence of iaDCs within the intestines of treatment-resistant Crohns Disease patients, synovial membranes and lymph nodes of rheumatoid arthritis patients and lungs of sarcoidosis patients. Similarly to the lymph node, iaDCs were found to reside in conserved chronic inflammation-associated spatial niches within the small intestine of affected individuals and displayed equivalent transcriptional characteristics and surrounding cellular neighborhoods. Collectively, these data highlight a previously unexplored role of iaDCs in human chronic inflammatory diseases and propose a conserved spatially restricted iaDC-populated chronic inflammatory niche associated with resistance to therapy. These findings highlight novel avenues to shape inflammatory trajectories by targeting iaDCs and their spatial niches, for example, by inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

Further, the drivers of such changes are uncertain, and quantitative models of the respective contribution of different African regions are lacking. Here we provide a complete reconstruction of the meta-population dynamics over the last 200,000 years by quantitatively integrating an environmental niche model based on archaeological sites within a spatially explicit population genetic framework. The inferred metapopulation dynamics not only fully explains the divergence among all available contemporary and ancient genomes of African hunter-gatherers, which were used to calibrate the model, but also accurately predicts the patterns of craniometric diversification across the continent from the Middle Pleistocene to the present. Furthermore, we show how the climate-driven changes in population sizes and connectivity predict major patterns of archaeological and phenotypic diversification over the last 200,000 years across the African continent.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

Using hybrid sequencing, we assembled 30,321 viral operational taxonomic units, including 1,338 complete genomes representing mostly novel lineages. Virome composition shifted dramatically with life stage, transitioning from low-diversity, temperate-dominated communities in calves to high-diversity, lytic-dominated communities in adults. Virome transitions paralleled but showed distinct dynamics from bacterial community development, with viral and bacterial diversity negatively correlated during drying-off. Dry cows exhibited elevated viral loads relative to their bacterial hosts. We identified 26 viral sequences targeting the methanogen Methanobrevibacter, absent in calves but present in adults. These findings reveal the dynamic nature of ruminant gut viral communities and highlight phages' potential regulatory role during critical life transitions.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

Combining spatial transcriptomics, comparative genomics, and genome editing, we show that temperature-mediated plasticity in the size of eyespot wing patterns in satyrid butterflies, a derived seasonal adaptation evolved ~80 million years ago in this subfamily, is associated with the taxon-specific evolution of a novel promoter in the Hox gene Antennapedia (Antp). The promoter activates Antp expression specifically in satyrid eyespot center cells, sensitizes these cells to environmental temperatures, and plays a critical role in regulating satyrid eyespot size plasticity. Our study demonstrates that a taxon-specific cis-regulatory innovation in an ancestral developmental gene fueled the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity across a clade of animals.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

Conjugative plasmids play a crucial role in ARG spread across hosts within their host range, yet the genetic and functional determinants shaping plasmid host range remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically analyzed the gene content of conjugative/mobilizable plasmids from public databases and found that two distinct survival strategies were enriched in different host-range groups: a ''stealth'' strategy, which minimizes host fitness costs by employing a global regulator h-ns, was particularly enriched in broad-host-range plasmids, whereas an ''aggressive'' strategy, which protects plasmids by actively inhibiting host response including SOS response by encoding the SOS inhibitor psiB, was more common in narrow-host-range plasmids. Plasmids employing either strategy constituted the majority of all conjugative plasmids analyzed, and accumulated significantly more ARGs than plasmids with neither strategy. Our data further suggested that stealth plasmids facilitate the acquisition of emerging ARGs, while aggressive plasmids amplify the copy number of established ARGs. This ''stealth-first'' model successfully recapitulated historical ARG dissemination patterns. These findings provide critical insights into the relationship between plasmid survival strategies and host range, advancing our understanding of the global patterns underlying plasmid-mediated ARG transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

The absence of visual mental imagery, called aphantasia, has recently been recognized to occur in about 1% of the general population but the cause is uncertain. By studying rare cases of acquired aphantasia we can identify regions that when injured cause loss of visual mental imagery. Methods We analyzed aphantasia lesions, identified from case reports by systematic review, and previously studied control lesions causing other neuropsychiatric symptoms (n=887). The network of brain regions connected to each lesion location was computed using resting-state functional connectivity from healthy subjects (n=1000). First, we tested the connectivity of aphantasia lesions and controls to the fusiform imagery node, a region in the ventral visual pathway which is active during visual mental imagery tasks. Then, we performed a data-driven analysis assessing whole brain lesion connectivity that was sensitive (100% overlap) and specific (family-wise error p<0.05) for aphantasia. Finally, we compared our aphantasia lesion network to activations previously associated with visual mental imagery tasks. Results We identified 12 cases of lesion-induced aphantasia which occurred in multiple different brain regions. However, 100% of these lesion locations were functionally connected to a region in the left fusiform gyrus, recently termed the fusiform imagery node. Connectivity to this region was both sensitive (100% overlap) and specific (family-wise error p<0.05) for aphantasia. The aphantasia lesion network aligned with functional connections previously associated with visual mental imagery tasks. Conclusions and Relevance Lesions causing aphantasia are located in many different brain regions but are all functionally connected to a specific location in the left fusiform gyrus. These findings support the hypothesis that the fusiform imagery node is a key brain region involved in visual mental imagery and offers clinical insight into which locations of brain injury are likely to cause aphantasia.","NA","medrxiv",1748210919797

Electrophysiologic measures of cortical excitability hold promise for monitoring disease progression and evaluating therapeutic responses. The power law exponent (aperiodic slope) reflects the balance between excitatory and inhibitory activity within neuronal networks, a critical aspect of normal brain function often disrupted in neurological conditions. Despite its potential, the significance of the aperiodic slope in glioma-infiltrated tissue and its underlying cellular processes has not been fully investigated. Here, we integrate multi-modal electrophysiological analysis with transcriptomic profiling to analyze the aperiodic slope in both normal and glioma-infiltrated cortex. We determine that glioma infiltration induces a flattening of the aperiodic slope, indicating a shift toward excitation dominance that varies according to tumor subtype and correlates with impairments in semantic naming. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that cortical regions with flat aperiodic slope exhibit transcriptional programs enriched in glutamatergic signaling, membrane depolarization, and excitatory synaptic transmission. The aperiodic slope responds to pharmacologically induced changes in cortical inhibition during propofol administration, a GABAA agonist. Our results establish the aperiodic slope as a robust biomarker of glioma-associated excitation-inhibition imbalance, with potential applications in tumor classification and treatment monitoring.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

Many details of SARS-CoV-2 infection are not fully understood, including the cell biology and host-virus interactions involved in coronavirus assembly and release, in which the Envelope (E) structural protein is instrumental. Deletion of E in other coronaviruses has been shown previously to either attenuate or abrogate infection. To determine the role of E on SARS-CoV-2 virus production and infectivity, we produced reporter SARS-CoV-2 with or without the E gene deleted using a bacterial artificial chromosome. Replication of {Delta}E SARS-CoV-2 was attenuated in Vero E6 cells expressing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and in human epithelial cell lines. Electron and immunofluorescence microscopy and virology assays showed that {Delta}E SARS-CoV-2 increased cell surface expression of Spike (S) glycoprotein, leading to reduced S incorporation into {Delta}E SARS-CoV-2 particles and promotion of increased cell-to-cell transmission that evades neutralizing antibody inhibition. Trans-complementation of E partially rescued {Delta}E SARS-CoV-2 S incorporation and restored cell-free transmission. In addition to validating the role of E in retention of S in the ER-Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC), our results showed that a lack of E led to reorganization of the ERGIC during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Minor temperature oscillations can alert the pathogen to a changing niche ecosystem, necessitating efficient sensing and rapid integration to trigger behavioral change. This is typically achieved through master regulators, which act as umbrella systems dictating pleiotropic phenotypes. Here, we uncover a pivotal role of minor temperature shifts in transition of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) from commensal to virulent lifestyles, mediated via an RNA thermosensing (RNAT) element within the untranslated region of the global regulator CiaR. By positively regulating the expression of the surface adhesin, Phosphorylcholine (PCho), in response to elevated temperature, CiaR potentiates pneumococcal infection. Engineering the RNAT structure to create translation restrictive or permissive versions allowed us to demonstrate how modulation in expression of CiaR could alter pneumococcal invasion capability, influencing infection outcomes. Moreover, intranasal administration of PCho mitigated SPN-induced bacteraemic pneumonia. Since a majority of opportunistic respiratory bacterial pathogens decorate their surface with PCho, this signaling arm could be exploited for anti-infective interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

However, even under carefully controlled conditions, stem cell-derived models exhibit substantial ""inter-individual"" heterogeneity. Focusing on gastruloids, a powerful model of the early posterior embryo, we sought to investigate the origins of this heterogeneity. To this end, we developed a scalable protocol for generating gastruloids that are monoclonal, i.e. derived from a single mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC). Single cell transcriptional profiling of monoclonal gastruloids revealed extensive inter-individual heterogeneity, with some hardly progressing, others resembling conventional gastruloids but biased towards mesodermal or neural lineages, and yet others bearing cell types rare or absent from conventional polyclonal gastruloids. To investigate this further, we leveraged DNA Typewriter to record the cell lineage relationships among the mESCs from which monoclonal gastruloids originate. Early in the expansion of ""founder"" mESCsprior to induction of the resulting aggregates to form gastruloidswe observe clear examples of fate bias or fate restriction, i.e. sister clades that exhibit markedly different cell type compositions. In a separate experiment with DNA Typewriter, we reconstructed a monophyletic ""tree of trees"", composed of ~50,000 cells derived from ~100 gastruloids, all descended from a single ""founder of founders"" stem cell. From these data, we find that founder mESCs that are more closely related are more likely to give rise to monoclonal gastruloids with similar cell type compositions. Our results suggest that fluctuations in the intrinsic states of mESCs are heritable, and shape their descendants' fates across many cell divisions. Our study also showcases how DNA Typewriter can be used to reconstruct high-resolution, monophyletic cell lineage trees in stem cell models of early development.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

The mutations nsP1:I167V, nsP2:I171V, nsP2:T224I, nsP3:A382I and nsp4: were detected in the non-structural protein, with the Sri Lankan 2025 CHIKV strains showing unique mutations within nsP3:T224I and nsP4: S90A. As some of these novel mutations have not been characterized previously, it is important to find out how they affect fitness within mosquitoes, viral replication and immune evasion.","NA","medrxiv",1748210919797

Embryoid bodies (EBs) are self-organizing multicellular structures that recapitulate aspects of early mammalian embryogenesis. We set out to perform a CRISPR screen perturbing all transcription factors (TFs) in murine EBs. Specifically, a library of TF-targeting guide RNAs (gRNAs) was used to generate mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) bearing single TF knockouts. Aggregates of these mESCs were induced to form mouse EBs, such that each resulting EB was 'mosaic' with respect to the TF perturbations represented among its constituent cells. Upon performing single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on cells derived from mosaic EBs, we found many TF perturbations exhibiting large and seemingly significant effects on the likelihood that individual cells would adopt certain fates, suggesting roles for these TFs in lineage specification. However, to our surprise, these results were not reproducible across biological replicates. Upon further investigation, we discovered cellular bottlenecks during EB differentiation that dramatically reduce clonal complexity, curtailing statistical power and confounding interpretation of mosaic screens. Towards addressing this challenge, we developed a scalable protocol in which each individual EB is monoclonally derived from a single mESC and genetically barcoded. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we show how these monoclonal EBs enable us to better quantify the consequences of TF perturbations as well as 'inter-individual' heterogeneity across EBs harboring the same genetic perturbation. Looking forward, monoclonal EBs and EB-derived organoids may be powerful tools not only for genetic screens, but also for modeling Mendelian disorders, as their underlying genetic lesions are overwhelmingly constitutional (i.e. present in all somatic cells), yet give rise to phenotypes with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

Using mathematical modeling, we elucidate that the bistability arising from the self-enhancing homing process of antigen-presenting dendritic cells plays a key role in the time-of-day-dependent adaptive immune response. Modeling analyses of circadian-controlled immune responses to three vaccine types demonstrate that vaccine-specific differences in time-of-day-dependent immunity originate from distinctions in the circadian-regulated activation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells. This divergence is amplified by bistability in the dendritic cell homing process, resulting in long-term distinctions in adaptive immunity across vaccine types. The model results reveal a dynamic mechanism by which adaptive immune responses maintain circadian variations over extended time periods, suggesting that the timing of vaccine administration within the day is a promising strategy for effective disease prevention.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

While antibodies targeting the 65 kDa isoform of GAD are of high diagnostic value, T cell mediated cytotoxicity has been identified as a key component of disease pathogenesis. The precise pathophysiological mechanisms by which the disease is triggered and maintained, however, remain incompletely understood. Methods: We performed single-cell transcriptome and immune repertoire sequencing (sc-seq) in CSF and blood of 8 anti-GAD65 AINS patients compared to 8 non-inflammatory controls. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were synthesized from B cell receptor (BCR) data to evaluate the B cellular immune response. Findings: We identified an increase and expansion of activated CD4+ stem cell-like memory T cells (TSCM) in the CSF of anti-GAD65 AINS patients. Expanded T cells showed increased expression of proinflammatory genes. The mAb analysis revealed a high frequency of GAD65-reactive BCRs in the CSF of anti-GAD65 AINS patients with increased somatic hypermutations compared to non-GAD-reactive BCRs and BCRs from controls. Conclusions: Sc-seq identified clonally expanded CD4+ TSCM in the CSF of anti-GAD65 AINS patients harboring cytotoxic properties likely contributing to disease pathogenesis. GAD-reactive B cells circulate in the CSF of anti-GAD65 AINS patients further supporting the concept of an antigen-specific intrathecal immune response. Future studies need to clarify the actual pathogenicity of these immune cells and the link between T and B cellular immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of anti-GAD65 AINS.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

While much research has focused on the spike (S) glycoproteins of zoonotic alpha- and betacoronaviruses, the S proteins of gamma- and deltacoronaviruses, which predominantly infect avian hosts, remain poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of S proteins from two distinct gammacoronaviruses (75.7% sequence identity) that atypically infect marine mammals and belong to the Gammacoronavirus delphinapteri species. The cryo-EM reconstructions reveal that the spikes exhibit a unique quaternary architecture that distinguishes them from other coronaviruses. The S protein features a previously unidentified, tripodal quaternary assembly of the S1 subunit, in which S1B domains are presented in an upright position while their putative receptor binding sites are shielded by extended loops from the S1A domain of the same protomers. Additionally, the CeCoV spike proteins have evolved an additional and unique [~]200 residue N-terminal domain (S10). S10 lacks homology to known protein sequences but displays structural similarity to members of the cupin protein superfamily. This represents a remarkable case of coronaviral exaptation of a host protein integrated into the S glycoprotein. Moreover, glycoproteomic analyses reveal that CeCoV S proteins are extensively N-glycosylated (>100 N-glycans per trimer), with a notable abundance of high-mannose glycans on S10 and O-glycosylation sites within a mucin-like loop at the trimer apex, all contributing to a dense glycan shield and potentially masking immunogenic epitopes. These findings demonstrate the structural diversity and adaptability of CoV S proteins, including alternative quaternary assemblies, additional domains, and diverse glycosylation strategies, offering new insights into the evolutionary mechanisms that enable coronaviruses to expand their host range and establish infections in novel species.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

Measurement of newly synthesized proteins has been successfully facilitated with Bio-Orthogonal Non-Canonical Amino acid Tagging (BONCAT) across a multitude of organisms. Here, we use non-canonical amino acids (NCAAs) L-azidohomoalanine (AHA) or L-homopropargylglycine (HPG) incorporation in place of methionine residues into the actively translating Arabidopsis proteome, allowing for that subset of proteins to be enriched for mass spectrometry quantification. Although this technique has seen occasional use in plants, optimization of the protocol to maximize functionality while minimizing organismal stress has not yet been established. Here, we provide evidence for successful implementation through the liquid immersion of seedlings in AHA or HPG-containing media that functions with significantly lower concentrations than the literature standard. Our approach splits acute exposure and incorporation phase of labelling to mitigate potential negative impacts of prolonged NCAA exposure without compromising effective enrichment capacity, and demonstrate that this results in an unperturbed growth phenotype for AHA-treated seedlings. Finally, we demonstrate the capacity of this modified approach to enrich newly synthesized proteins from the whole proteome under standard stress conditions. These improvements allow for a broader use of BONCAT technologies in molecular plant research, affording a deeper understanding of the newly synthesized proteome without negatively impacting plant health.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

Meloidogyne hapla, a diploid species, is a valuable model for studying root-knot nematodes due to its parasitic diversity, small genome, and a reproductive strategy that facilitates genetic analysis. Here, we present a high-quality chromosome-scale assembly of M. hapla, generated using multiple sequencing platforms including PacBio HiFi, ONT, Illumina and HiC. The 59 Mb assembly comprises 16 chromosome-length scaffolds, notably lacking canonical telomeric repeats. Instead, we identified a tandem 16-mer repeat mainly present at scaffold ends, suggesting an alternative system for chromosome-end maintenance. Genetic linkage analysis of F2 populations derived from crosses between M. hapla strains validated the assembly but also revealed anomalies indicating chromosome structure differences between parental isolates such as fissions, fusions and rearrangements. This analysis also revealed sharply delineated zones of high recombination on most chromosome arms. We also identified 1,258 genes encoding putative secreted proteins (PSP), which should be enriched in genes involved host interaction and pathogenicity. Most of the PSP genes had orthologs in other plant parasitic nematode species, and the majority were pioneers, lacking known functional domains. Notably, we found that PSPs are significantly enriched in high-recombination zones, possibly facilitating their rapid evolution. Overall, our study provides new insights into genome structure of diploid root-knot nematodes and highlights the interplay between genome architecture, recombination, and parasitism. These findings raise new questions about how genetic and genomic adaptations drive the success of root-knot nematodes as plant parasites.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

However, many studies on the genetic relationship between cannabis use and psychosis have lacked data on both phenotypes within the same individuals, creating challenges due to unmeasured confounding. We aimed to address this by using multi-modal data from the All of Us Research Program, which contains genetic data as well as information on schizophrenia diagnosis and cannabis use.

MethodsWe tested the association between cannabis use disorder (CUD) and schizophrenia polygenic scores (PGS) and schizophrenia and heavy cannabis use. We tested models where both CUD and schizophrenia PGS were included as joint predictors of heavy cannabis use and schizophrenia case status. We defined three sets of cases based on comorbidities: relaxed (assessing for only the primary condition), strict (excluding for both conditions), and dual-comorbidity (including both conditions).

ResultsCUD and schizophrenia polygenic liability were independently associated with heavy cannabis use; the schizophrenia PGS effect was very modest. In contrast, both schizophrenia and CUD PGS were independently associated with schizophrenia, with independent significant effects of CUD PGS. Polygenic liability to CUD was associated with schizophrenia in individuals without a documented history of cannabis use, suggesting widespread pleiotropy.

ConclusionsThese findings underscore the need for comprehensive models that integrate genetic risk factors for heavy cannabis use to advance our understanding of schizophrenia aetiology.","NA","medrxiv",1748210919797

Such condensates, also called membraneless organelles, are increasingly observed in cells and serve as transient hubs for spatial organization and compartmentalization of biomolecules. Along with the transiency of formation and dissolution, their ability to sequester molecules has inspired us to develop BCs as potential vehicles to transport and deliver molecular cargo. We recently reported the design of disulfide bond cross-linked phase-separating peptide (PSP) condensates that spontaneously dissolve in reducing conditions (JACS, 2024, 146, 255299). Based on the premise that the highly reducing cytoplasm could dissolve PSP condensates and release partitioned cargo, here, we demonstrate the ability of PSP condensates to deliver molecular cargo to the cytoplasm of HeLa cells efficiently. We show that PSP condensates deliver a variety of cargos that differ in their sizes and chemistries, including small molecules, peptides, GFP protein (31 kDa), DNA (1.7 kbp), and mRNA. The transfection efficiencies of PSP condensates for delivering DNA and mRNA were also significantly greater than those of a commercial transfection agent. With room to tailor the condensate properties based on cargo and cell types, these results showcase the potential of disulfide-cross-linked PSPs as effective and customizable cellular delivery vehicles, filling a critical demand gap for such delivery systems.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

Here, we introduce EYKTHYR, a computational framework that integrates gene expression and chromatin accessibility within a spatially aware model to identify TFs driving spatial gene programs.

Innate immune cells are a promising system for studying cell type evolution, as they are widespread across metazoans, have several conserved functions, and are under selective pressure from pathogens. However, molecular characterizations of invertebrate immune cells are limited, and it remains unclear whether invertebrate immune cell types are homologous to those in vertebrates. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing, in situ hybridization, and live reporters to define the identity of blood cell states from a basal chordate, Ciona robusta. We find evidence that C. robusta circulating blood contains a differentiation hierarchy that gives rise to at least eight major morphotypes, constituting approximately half of mature blood cell states. The mature cell states include phagocytes, as well as cells variously expressing vanadium-binding proteins, carbonic anhydrases, pattern recognition receptors, cytokines, and complement factors. Despite the expression of homologs to vertebrate immune components, extensive divergence between tunicate and vertebrate immune cells obscures cell state homology. Altogether, this work modernizes blood cell classifications in C. robusta and extends the known repertoire of immune cells within chordates.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

Our results reveal new categories of exceptions and nuance to the N-degron pathway observed in bulk and context-specific analyses. For example, we find cases where penultimate residues can reinforce or shift the stability expected based only on the identity of position 1 (P1).

These bacteria rapidly spread through the water-transporting xylem where they grow prolifically and produce abundant biofilm that clogs xylem vessels. To understand RSSC biofilm behavior in planta, we examined their complex fluid mechanics. Rheological analyses revealed that unlike all previously analyzed microbial biofilms, RSSC biofilms are shear-thinning, viscoelastic fluids at physiologically relevant shear forces. To determine which factors confer these unique mechanics, we analyzed biofilms of bacterial mutants with altered biofilm components. Genetic analysis demonstrated that development of the viscous-dominant biofilms required production of EPS-I, an amphiphilic exopolysaccharide that is a major virulence factor for all RSSC pathogens. We show that EPS-I confers ""biofilm mobility"", which allows wildtype RSSC colonies to passively expand when deformed. Despite its high metabolic cost, bioassays demonstrated that EPS-I production conferred a net fitness benefit where biofilm mobility allowed the pathogen to spread and access more nutrients in complex environments like xylem vessels. The RSSC are a monophyletic lineage of aggressive plant wilt pathogens, and our evolutionary hypothesis testing suggests the origin of the eps biosynthetic gene cluster coincides with the emergence of wilt pathogenesis in the RSSC ancestor. Furthermore, comparative physiological assays demonstrated that biofilm mobility is unique to the RSSC within the genus Ralstonia. In summary, EPS-I production is a key evolutionary innovation that enables RSSC dispersal and virulence by conferring unique biofilm mechanics.

Significance StatementRalstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC) pathogens threaten global food security by fatally wilting plants. A soft matter physics lens demystified the cryptic role of a major virulence factor, the EPS-I exopolysaccharide. EPS-I transforms RSSC biofilms into viscoelastic fluids, a mechanical behavior not previously described for other microbial biofilms that are almost always viscoelastic solids. We demonstrate that the development of fluid biofilms was a key evolutionary innovation that enabled pathogenic success of these aggressive pathogens that rapidly wilt plants.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

Across two biomedical domains--gene characterization and small molecule property prediction--we find that the commercially available o1-mini model does not consistently outperform non-reasoning LLMs like GPT-4o. This motivated us to explore how much we can improve o1-mini's biomedical reasoning through reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning. We show that RL finetuning of o1-mini results in large improvements in performance on gene classification, where it surprisingly outperformed domain-specific state-of-the-art models on some tasks. The results are mixed for small molecule prediction, suggesting that chemical reasoning could be more challenging for LLMs. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges and takeaways from this initial exploration of RL finetuning reasoning models for biomedical tasks.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

However, there is currently little evidence of the nature or effectiveness of adopting whole system approaches. This study evaluated whether a whole system physical activity intervention (JU:MP), was effective at improving physical activity in five- to eleven-year-olds.

MethodsA before and after controlled study with two-arms (JU:MP intervention and control), was conducted in Bradford, UK with data collected at baseline and 24-months follow-up. Habitual physical activity was measured via accelerometry. The primary outcome was difference in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) between groups at 24-months. Secondary outcomes included: sedentary time (ST), counts per minute (CPM), BMI z-score, waist circumference, social, emotional and behavioural health, and quality-of-life. An exploratory analysis compared intervention effects between sub-groups.

Results1,453 children were recruited. 330 children with valid wear-time at baseline and 24- months (JU:MP group n=175, control group n =155) were included in the final analysis of physical activity outcomes. The JU:MP group improved levels of MVPA (+4.99 minutes/day, (CI = 1.01, 8.96), standardised mean difference (SMD) = 0.29), ST ( -8.69 minutes/day, CI = -16.76, -0.61), SMD = -0.20) and CPM (+32.72, CI = 5.93, 59.53, SMD = 0.28) compared to controls. There were minor differences between groups in all secondary outcomes, favouring the JU:MP group. Exploratory sub-group analysis revealed that MVPA improved for boys (+7.34 minutes/days, CI = 0.70, 13.99, SMD = 0.36) and South Asian heritage children (+7.20 minutes/day, CI = 1.67, 12.72, SMD = 0.52) in the JU:MP group compared to the control group. Conclusion: whole system approaches hold considerable promise for addressing childrens levels of physical activity at scale, whilst also tackling inequalities.

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSThe physical activity levels of children are influenced by complex political, environmental and social systems. The World Health Organisation and the International Society of Physical Activity and Health both advocate for whole system change to support population level improvements in physical activity.

What the study addsThis study provides evidence that improving population levels of physical activity in children can be achieved by taking a whole system approach.

How this study might affect research practice or policyThis study can give confidence to policy makers and practitioners who are considering or continuing to take a whole system approach to improve physical activity for populations at greatest need.","NA","medrxiv",1748210919797

However, resolving the uncertainty between GWAS association and causality remains a significant challenge. The small subset of noncoding GWAS variants with causative effects on gene regulatory elements can only be detected through accurate methods that assess the impact of DNA sequence variation on gene regulatory activity. Deep learning models, such as those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, have gained prominence in predicting the regulatory effects of genetic variants, particularly in enhancers, by learning patterns from genomic and epigenomic data. Despite their potential, selecting the most suitable model is hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks, consistent training conditions, and performance evaluation criteria in existing reviews. Results: This study evaluates state-of-the-art deep learning models for predicting the effects of genetic variants on enhancer activity using nine datasets stemming from MPRA, raQTL, and eQTL experiments, profiling the regulatory impact of 54,859 SNPs across four human cell lines. The results reveal that CNN models, such as TREDNet and SEI, consistently outperform other architectures in predicting the regulatory impact of SNP. However, hybrid CNN-transformer models, such as Borzoi, display superior performance in identifying causal SNPs within a linkage disequilibrium block. While fine-tuning enhances the performance of transformer-based models, it remains insufficient to surpass CNN and hybrid models when evaluated under optimized conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

However, AFM-based three-dimensional single-particle reconstruction has hitherto not been possible due to the tip-sample convolution artifact that distorts AFM images of individual molecules, and the disconnect between two-dimensional AFM images of surface deposited molecules and their three-dimensional structures. Here, three-dimensional single-particle analysis was developed for rapid structure-based validation of protein structures using as few as a single AFM topology image, based on contact-point reconstruction AFM (CPR-AFM) in an integrative approach with cryo-electron microscopy maps available in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank by template matching. This approach was demonstrated on the structural validation of recombinant trimeric ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein to show its immediate utility as a rapid structure-based sample quality control method in the recombinant expression and purification of the Spike protein samples that can be used in vaccines and therapeutics research. These results show that three-dimensional single-particle reconstruction by AFM is possible, that high signal-to-noise AFM imaging offers a rapid and cost-effective way of validation or identification of three-dimensional protein structures at single particle level, and that AFM can be linked to structural data derived from methods such as cryo-electron microscopy, resulting in integrative methodologies with new capabilities for structural biology.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying eIF2A`s function remains poorly understood. Here, we exploit a TurboID-based proximity labeling combined with mass spectrometry to systematically map the interactome of eIF2A during homeostasis and stress. Combining polysome gradients with TurboID, we zoom into the interactions of eIF2A with the 40S small ribosomal subunit and map the eIF2A binding site close to the mRNA entry channel. We identify a network of interactors that link eIF2A to ribosome-associated quality control, including its strong interaction with G3BP1-USP10 complexes as well as RPS2 and RPS3. In the absence of eIF2A, RPS2 and RPS3 ubiquitination is diminished specifically upon ribosome stalling. 40S-specific footprinting in eIF2A knockout cells shows minimal changes in 5`UTR occupancy, consistent with a limited role for eIF2A in translation initiation. Using dynamic SILAC mass spectrometry, we characterize the novel function of eIF2A in ribosome-associated quality control and show that eIF2A antagonizes USP10-dependent rescue of 40S ribosomes, resulting in altered turnover of 40S subunits upon cellular stress. Collectively, our study identifies a previously unknown link between eIF2A and ribosome-associated quality control, implies that eIF2A promotes translation fidelity by tuning 40S ribosome rescue under stress and warrants further investigations into the role of ribosome-associated quality control in tumorigenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

Investigating the development process is vital for uncovering the formation of complex biological systems. However, current approaches to studying development from gene expression rely primarily on single-cell gene expression data to infer developmental trajectories, neglecting the spatial distribution of cells within tissues and their interactions. Although spatial transcriptomics provides spatial context for gene expression, existing algorithms focus mainly on identifying spatial regions without further exploring their developmental connections. In this study, we propose an algorithm for detecting spatial-temporal domains in tissue to trace developmental path (stTrace) using spatial transcriptomics. stTrace integrates the degree of cell development, gene expression, and spatial location to identify ""spatial-temporal domains"", regions where cells share similar functions and developmental stages within the tissue. Moreover, hierarchical relationships exist among these regions, reflecting developmental connections between cells in the tissue. Our experiments on mouse embryo and human breast cancer data revealed that stTrace can detect more refined regions than traditional spatial domain identification algorithms. Furthermore, the directions of developmental paths inferred from hierarchical relationships are consistent with the dynamic trajectories derived from single-cell velocity.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract.

This involves cell-surface receptors that can detect conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) or endogenous immunogenic signals, initiating signaling pathways to induce broad-spectrum disease resistance, known as pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). In Arabidopsis thaliana, the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK) MIK2 is an exceptionally versatile receptor involved in the perception of the vast family of Brassicales-specific endogenous SCOOP peptides as well as potential MAMPs derived from Fusarium and related fungi. Although only plant species belonging to the order of Brassicales encode genes for SCOOP peptides and show SCOOP-responsiveness, the Fusarium-derived elicitor fraction also induces PTI responses in plants from other lineages. In this study, we demonstrate that Fusarium elicitor-responsiveness and proteins belonging to the MIK2-clade are widely conserved among seed plants. We identified a MIK2-clade protein from tomato, which shares properties of AtMIK2 in the perception of the Fusarium elicitor but not of SCOOP peptides.

Although the components involved in T4P assembly and dynamics are largely conserved across divergent clades of bacteria, the mechanisms underlying T4P function and regulation differ significantly and remain poorly characterized outside of a select few model organisms. One understudied characteristic of T4P includes the spatial organization of T4P envelope-spanning nanomachines and how organizational patterns contribute to single cell behaviors. The bacterial species Acinetobacter baylyi localizes its T4P nanomachines in a unique pattern along the long axis of the cell, making it a robust model to study the mechanisms underlying the regulation of intracellular organization in single cell organisms. In this work, we find that the T4P regulatory protein FimX has been co-opted away from regulating T4P dynamics to instead control T4P positioning through a chemosensory Pil-Chp pathway. We show FimX directly interacts with the Pil-Chp histidine kinase ChpA which likely influences Pil-Chp signaling and the subsequent positioning of T4P machines. These data contribute to our understanding of how bacterial regulatory systems can evolve to function in diverse biological processes.

This work shows the T4P regulatory component FimX directly interacts with a chemosensory signaling protein to regulate the positioning of T4P nanomachines. These data provide insight into how signaling systems can evolve to regulate diverse processes, and they establish a direct connection between environmental signaling cascades and the regulation of bacterial cell biology.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

McdA, a member of the ParA/MinD family of ATPases, forms dynamic gradients on the nucleoid that position McdB-bound carboxysomes. McdB belongs to a widespread but poorly characterized class of ParA/MinD partner proteins, and the molecular basis of its interaction with McdA remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the N-terminal 20 residues of H. neapolitanus McdB are both necessary and sufficient for interaction with McdA. Within this region, we identify three lysine residues whose individual substitution modulates McdA binding and leads to distinct carboxysome organization phenotypes. Notably, lysine 7 (K7) is critical for McdA interaction: substitutions at this site result in the formation of a single carboxysome aggregate positioned at mid-nucleoid. This phenotype contrasts with that of an McdB deletion, in which carboxysome aggregates lose their nucleoid association and become sequestered at the cell poles. These findings suggest that weakened McdA-McdB interactions are sufficient to maintain carboxysome aggregates on the nucleoid but inadequate for partitioning individual carboxysomes across it. We propose that, within the ParA/MinD family of ATPases, cargo positioning and partitioning are mechanistically separable: weak interactions with the cognate partner can mediate positioning, whereas effective partitioning requires stronger interactions capable of overcoming cargo self-association forces.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

However, tumor induced immunosuppressive pathways contrive efficient DC infiltration. This calls for the development of DC-targeted interventions purposed to stimulate DC infiltration and local expansion. Here we deliver a proof-of-concept for a cell-based immunotherapeutic approach promoting circulating DC progenitors infiltration in the tumor together with their local expansion. We report that engraftment of autologous mesenchymal stromal cells engineered to express the membrane bound form of FLT3L (eMSC-FLT3L) uniquely induce DC infiltration, T cells activation and anti-tumor immunity, when combined with an adjuvant like the poly(I:C) double stranded RNA mimic. Mechanistic experiments demonstrate that poly(I:C)-induced CXCR3 and CCR5 ligands (CXCL9, CCL5) are required for intra-tumoral DC and T cell recruitment and for the therapeutic effect of eMSC-FLT3L + poly(I:C) immunotherapy. Stromal cell-based delivery of CXCL9 and CCL5, together with FLT3L, by-passes the requirement for poly(I:C) agonist and is sufficient to induce T cell and DC recruitment within tumors. These findings are transferrable to human settings as we show that eMSCs-FLT3L-CXCL9-CCL5 stimulate tissue infiltration by human XCR1+ DC1s in mice harboring a Human Immune System (HIS mice). Lastly, we report that engraftment of eMSC-FLT3L-CXCL9-CCL5 in the tumor induces anti-tumor immunity and partially overcomes resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. Altogether, these data support the therapeutic potential of expanding intra-tumoral DC1s using a continuous and local source of FLT3L, CXCL9 and CCL5.","NA","biorxiv",1748210919797

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1748210919797

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1748210919797

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1748210919797
