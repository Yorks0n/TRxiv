MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

ObjectiveTo assess the transportability of findings from the RCT Lung-MAP S1400I to real-world populations in the United States (US), Germany and France.

DesignThis empirical validation study used patient-level data from the RCT Lung-MAP S1400I to build a transportability model to adjust for differences in patient characteristics from real-world target patient populations. Two sets of adjustments were performed - one limited to the set of measured clinical variables, and the second additionally including external information drawn from published literature and substantive knowledge on patient subgroups excluded from the trial. The latter enabled transportability to a significantly more diverse and representative real-world patient population by relaxing the stringent exclusion criteria used in Lung-MAP S1400I. For benchmarking, we compared how well the transportability analysis approximated observed overall survival in the respective real-world cohorts.

SettingObservational study.

ParticipantsEligible individuals diagnosed with advanced or metastatic NSCLC and previously treated with systemic therapy.

Intervention/exposureNivolumab monotherapy.

Main outcome measuresOverall survival.

ResultsSample size for the nivolumab arm in Lung-MAP S1400I was 127 and ranged from 133 to 1051 for the various real-world cohorts included. Patients with ECOG scores of 2+, index cancer stage <IV, presence of ALK/EGFR mutations, presence of comorbidities and prior exposure to immunotherapy/targeted therapies were excluded from Lung-MAP S1400I, were but were eligible to receive nivolumab monotherapy in real-world care. Adjusting for measured clinical differences improved alignment of patient outcomes in the RCT and the real-world cohorts. However, only when variables related to excluded patient groups were also addressed did the results fully satisfy control conditions, yielding the closest approximation to real-world survival in the US, Germany, and France (mean discrepancy: 0.27 months over [~]30 months).

ConclusionsOverall survival in a more diverse real-world patient population could be extrapolated using data from the Lung-MAP S1400I trial when complemented with external information about excluded patient groups.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

Human Siglecs count 14 unique proteins allocated to two subsets; group 1 includes four evolutionarily conserved proteins with clear orthologues in all mammals with low sequence similarity and group 2 includes ten rapidly evolving proteins with high sequence similarity and species specificity. In all Siglecs, the recognition and binding of the sialic acid on the glycan target involves a conserved, or canonical, Arg residue. Yet, for a subset of human Siglecs, namely MAG, Siglec-6, and Siglec-11, this Arg appears not to be essential, suggesting that a different binding mechanism may be at play. In this work, we used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding assays, and mutagenesis to investigate the structural, mechanistic and energetic details of the binding of Siglec-6 to monosialylated gangliosides. Our results show that Siglec-6 relies only partially on its conserved Arg (Arg122) for recognition of membrane-bound gangliosides and that it supplements its binding free energy through interactions with the phospholipids in the membrane surrounding the target epitope. We identified residues Lys126 and Trp127 as key players in this unique membrane interaction, and we confirmed by mutagenesis assays that the loss of these residues abrogates binding. These results provide a step-change in our understanding of the diversification of human Siglecs across group 2, where different members likely evolved as molecular precision tools, to bind specific sialosides by adapting their structure to recognize not only the epitope, but also the biological environment in which it is found.","NA","biorxiv",1750630150157

However, in humans, corresponding changes in dopamine-dependent behavior, such as reward learning with increasing BMI, have not been conclusively established and dissociated from pathological eating behavior. Here, we provide a principled assessment of differences in reinforcement learning (RL) related to obesity or pathological eating, such as binge eating (BE), using a large sample of 370 participants enriched for high BMI and BE. To dissociate trait and state components of RL, participants completed up to 31 runs of a novel RL game across weeks (1,486,950 observed choices). We used hierarchical Bayesian models to estimate the mean and variability of parameters for each individual. Across runs, higher BMI was predicted by higher and more variable learning rates using elastic net models ({Delta}R2=.19; pperm<.0001) although performance did not differ (r=-0.04, pboot=.46). In contrast, BE and the dimension loss of control were characterized by lower and more variable reward sensitivity ({Delta}R2=.19, controlled for BMI; pperm<.0001) leading to fewer points (r=.10, pboot=.030). Crucially, patients with BE disorder also showed attenuated reward sensitivity in the nucleus accumbens during anticipation in an effort task that required no learning (p=.006). We conclude that obesity-related differences in reward learning are best explained by changes in learning, whereas BE and loss of control were mostly driven by reduced reward sensitivity. Notably, repeated assessments revealed that increased variability across states contribute to both obesity and BE. Our findings highlight the necessity to complement neurobiological research with behavioral precision mapping to derive mechanistic insight into multidimensional disorders such as obesity and BE disorder.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

The largest previous genetic studies of intelligence have used ~270k individuals who completed the fluid intelligence (FI) tests in UK Biobank. Here, we integrate additional FI measures in this cohort and leverage 82 correlated variables to impute FI values for unmeasured individuals, increasing the sample size to >450k. Through population-based and within-family genome-wide association studies and genetic correlation analyses, we show that this imputation produces a phenotype that genetically resembles measured FI, as well as reduces ascertainment bias within the cohort. We further show that combining measured and imputed FI scores increases the number of independent SNP associations (p<5x10-8) from 385 to 608 and increases polygenic score accuracy in external cohorts by 15% on average. Additionally, incorporating imputed FI scores increases the number of gene-level associations with rare variants from five to twenty-six (FDR<1%). These include fourteen well-established developmental disorder-associated genes, a four-fold enrichment (p=8x10-8); for several of these (e.g. ATP1A1, CACNA1E), our results suggest that the gene has a loss-of-function mechanism as well as the previously-documented altered function mechanism. We also implicate twelve genes without strong prior evidence of association developmental disorders, of which eight have not been previously linked to intelligence (ROBO2, RB1CC1, ANK3, CHD9, TLK1, PCLO, DPP8, IPO9). These twelve genes were significantly enriched for de novo loss-of-function mutations in a set of >31k patients with developmental disorders (p=6.8x10-4). We further identify three genes showing significant rare variant associations with educational attainment but not with FI in UK Biobank, including CADPS2 in which, unusually, protein-truncating variants show a positive association. Our results demonstrate the power of phenotype imputation for genetic studies and suggest that incorporating genetic association results for cognitive phenotypes in the general population could help discover new developmental disorder genes.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

Noncoding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at hundreds of loci have been linked to ND risk by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but the causal genes and pathways are largely unknown. Despite the multicellular pathology of complex traits like multiple sclerosis (MS), functional studies that aim to characterize the molecular impact of disease-associated SNPs often investigate all SNPs linked to disease in the same cellular context. Here, we combine a computational approach to predict the pathogenic cell type of individual risk loci with functional CRISPR perturbation studies in iPSC-derived microglia cells (iMGLs). ND SNP enrichment in cell type-specific enhancers is similar between primary and iPSC-derived cells, and mechanistically supported by shared enhancer-promoter interactions. We apply a novel Perturb-seq platform to interrogate MS risk SNPs in iMGL, identifying likely cis-acting causal risk genes at 5 of 9 loci, as well as downstream differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Despite being found in trans to MS risk SNPs, downstream DEGs are substantially enriched for MS heritability. Downstream DEGs from all 5 target genes show significant overlap, converging on genes related to cytokinesis, phagocytosis, and mitochondrial metabolism. We then compared downstream DEGs to gene expression patterns observed in MS patient tissue studies and observed marked similarities, demonstrating that genes dysregulated as the result of GWAS loci perturbation mirrored effects observed in microglia found in MS patient lesions. Collectively, these results demonstrate that cell type aware functional studies can be used to translate ND SNP associations into mechanistic insights and reveal novel convergent biological mechanisms underlying complex traits.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

Typhimurium (STm) is an enteric pathogen that causes almost 100 million cases of salmonellosis a year. A hallmark of STm is their ability to survive and replicate in the macrophages that phagocytose them. Inside the Salmonella-containing vesicles (SCV) STm is exposed to nutrient limitation and antimicrobial molecules, including itaconate, a dicarboxylate produced at millimolar concentrations by activated macrophages. STm has an itaconate degradation pathway that allows it to detoxify itaconate and convert it into pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. In the SCV, STm undergoes extensive metabolic reprogramming in response to the nutrient limitation and high stress environment, and strict catabolite control is employed at various stages of infection, depending on carbon source availability. The extent to which itaconate is used as a carbon source by STm is not currently well understood. Here, we explore the ability of STm to grow in media containing itaconate as the sole carbon source, identify the genes of the itaconate response operon necessary for itaconate degradation, and confirm their importance during infection of macrophages. Growth on itaconate was substantially slower than in carbon-rich or acetate media, with multiple subcultures allowing for increased growth rates. Genomic analysis suggests that mutations in the RpoS-stress response and increased expression of the DctA transporter improve growth on itaconate. Using metabolomics, it was revealed that growth on itaconate resulted in substantially reduced levels of gluconeogenesis compared to growth on acetate and increased glutathione disulfide levels, indicating a high level of oxidative stress. Overall, our results point towards the STm itaconate degradation pathway having a more important role in detoxifying itaconate, rather than using it as a carbon source inside the macrophage. Additionally, this study establishes media conditions that would enable the high throughput discovery of potential inhibitors of itaconate degradation.","NA","biorxiv",1750630150157

Findings: In this study of ~89,000 adults aged >40 years, exposure to brighter light at night predicted higher incidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors. Meaning: Avoiding exposure to night light may lower risk for cardiovascular diseases. Abstract Importance: Light at night causes circadian disruption, which is a known risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. However, it is not well understood whether personal light exposure patterns predicts and individual's risk of cardiovascular diseases. Objective: To assess whether day and night light exposure predicts incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and whether relationships of light with cardiovascular diseases differ according to genetic susceptibility, sex, and age. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: United Kingdom. Participants: N=88,905, age (M{+/-}SD) = 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 56.9% female. Exposure: Approximately 13 million hours of personal light exposure data, tracked by wrist-worn light sensors (one week each). Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, derived from UK National Health Service records, across a 9.5-year follow-up after light tracking. Results: People with the brightest nights (90-100th percentiles) had significantly higher risks of developing coronary artery disease (adjusted-HR range: 1.23-1.32), myocardial infarction (aHRs: 1.42-1.47), heart failure (aHRs: 1.45-1.56), atrial fibrillation (aHRs: 1.28-1.32), and stroke (aHRs: 1.28-1.30), compared to people with dark nights (0-50th percentiles). These relationships were robust after adjusting for established risk factors for cardiovascular health, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol, diet, sleep duration, socioeconomic status, and polygenic risk. Relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and coronary artery disease were stronger for women, and relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation were stronger for younger individuals in this cohort. Conclusions and Relevance: Night light exposure was a significant risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases in this cohort. In addition to current preventative measures, avoiding light at night may be a useful strategy for reducing risks of cardiovascular diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

All patients had undergone non-invasive and invasive presurgical assessments. Surgical outcomes were determined using the Engel classification following at least one year of postoperative follow-up. A blinded decision validation sub-study was also performed. Blinded to actual outcomes, the team made decisions regarding SEEG and surgical interventions when patients found to have a single SEEG SOZ were presented. Responses were stratified to inform the added diagnostic value of SEEG.

Of 255 SEEG cases screened, 84 patients (33%) met inclusion criteria. The cohort was 56% female, with a median seizure onset age of 12 years (IQR 6-20); 65.5% had temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). A single SOZ was identified in 14.3% of cases (TLE: 14.5%, extratemporal: 13.8%). Patients with a single SEEG SOZ were found to have shorter recording durations (mean of 11 vs 15.79 days in those with multifocal SEEG SOZs; p=0.009). Curative focal resections were performed in 12% (n=10), with long-term Engel I outcomes achieved in one patient (1.2%). Palliative resections occurred in 26% (n=22), with Engel I outcomes in 7% (n=6). In 50% of the blinded cases, the epilepsy surgery team reported that they would not have recommended SEEG based on phase I data.

These findings suggest that patients with BI/U scalp EEG SOZs may be associated with a low likelihood of identifying a single SEEG SOZ and curative outcome. Using BI/U scalp EEG ictal onset as a predictor in preoperative decision-making will assist in refining SEEG candidate selection in this large subgroup.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the prevalence of chronic pain among active-duty Service members is 1.5 to 2 times higher than the 20% of American adults who live with chronic pain. Recent report findings determined that Service members make up a large population within the Military Health Systems (MHS), and that this population is disproportionately affected by lost duty days, early retirement, loss of readiness, and increased burden to the MHS. To date, the Department of Defense (DOD) and MHS have emphasized multimodal, multidisciplinary, stepped treatment for chronic pain that prioritizes nonpharmacologic therapies and non-opioid pain medications. Though the DOD and MHS have invested in several pain treatment types, our level of understanding needs to better distinguish between acute and chronic pain and identify risk factors and mechanisms responsible for the chronification of pain, as it is the chronic pain which compromises functioning and readiness to a greater degree across the force. The novel information generated by this study will enhance our understanding of how ankle fracture elicits pathological risk factors for bone fracture associated neuropathic pain (BFNP), which ultimately impairs health-related quality of life. Due to the high prevalence of ankle fractures and the subsequent risk of developing chronic pain after ankle fracture, we will utilize this patient population to provide the preliminary evidence on whether bone fracture and subsequent BFNP phenotypes are reflected in specific genetic profiles and activated states of immune cells.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

Methods: The data on incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) owing to TC were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease 2021. We quantified differences in the burden of TC among AYA at the socio-demographic index (SDI), regional, and national levels. Decomposition analysis was used to identify the main drivers of variation in the burden. Frontier analysis demonstrated the potential for countries to reduce the burden. Results: Globally, there were 28499 new cases, 61596 prevalent cases, 5699 mortality cases, and 376564 DALYs due to TC among AYA in 2021. Between 1990 and 2021, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) increased while the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) decreased. Regionally, Southern Latin America exhibited the highest ASRs. Nationally, Monaco ranked highest in ASIR and ASPR, while Mexico had the highest ASMR and ASDR. Population growth and epidemiological changes were major drivers for the burden of DALYs in middle SDI regions, which had the greatest potential for improvement. Conclusions: The global burden of TC among AYA has risen, which is most pronounced in middle SDI regions. Among the AYA population, TC survivors have increased significantly due to the decreased ASMR and ASDR, who badly need more attention for TC treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

Many attempts have been made to substantiate and delineate the relationship between schizophrenia and the brain through unbiased exploratory investigations of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The results of numerous data-driven rs-fMRI studies have converged in support of the disconnection hypothesis framework, reporting aberrant connectivity in cortical-subcortical-cerebellar circuitry. However, this model is vague and underspecified, encompassing a vast array of findings across studies. It is necessary to further refine this model to identify consistent patterns and establish stable imaging markers of schizophrenia and psychosis. The organizational structure of the NeuroMark atlas is especially well-equipped for describing functional units derived through independent component analysis (ICA) and uniting findings across studies utilizing data-driven whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) to characterize schizophrenia and psychosis. Towards this goal, a systematic literature review was conducted on primary empirical articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals between January 2019 - February 2025 which utilized cortical-subcortical-cerebellar terminology to describe schizophrenia-control comparisons of whole-brain FC in human rs-fMRI. The electronic databases utilized included Google scholar, PubMed, and APA PsycInfo, and search terms included (""schizophrenia"" OR ""psychosis"") AND ""resting-state fMRI"" AND (""cortical-subcortical-cerebellar"" OR ""cerebello-thalamo-cortical""). 10 studies were identified and NeuroMark nomenclature was utilized to describe findings within a common reference space. The most consistent patterns included cerebellar-thalamic hypoconnectivity, cerebellar-cortical (sensorimotor & insular-temporal) hyperconnectivity, subcortical (basal ganglia & thalamic) - cortical (sensorimotor, temporoparietal, insular-temporal, occipitotemporal, & occipital) hyperconnectivity, and cortical-cortical (insular-temporal & occipitotemporal) hypoconnectivity. Patterns implicating prefrontal cortex are largely inconsistent across studies and may not be effective targets for establishing stable imaging markers based on static FC in rs-fMRI. Instead, adapting new analytical strategies, or focusing on nodes in the cerebellum, thalamus, and primary motor and sensory cortex may prove to be a more effective approach.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

This study aimed to predict the need for ECT following admission to a psychiatric hospital. Methods: This cohort study was based on electronic health record (EHR) data from routine clinical practice. Adult patients admitted to a hospital within the Psychiatric Services of the Central Denmark Region between January 2013 and November 2021 were included in the study. The outcome was initiation of ECT >7 days (to not include patients admitted for planned ECT) and [&le;]67 days after admission. The data was randomly split into an 85% training set and a 15% test set. On the 7th day of the inpatient stay, machine learning models (extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) were trained to predict initiation of ECT and subsequently tested on the test set, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) as the main performance measure. Results: The cohort consisted of 41,610 patients with 164,961 admissions eligible for prediction. In the test set the trained model predicted ECT initiation with an AUROC of 0.94, 47% sensitivity, 98% specificity, positive predictive value of 24% and negative predictive value of 99%. The top predictors were the highest suicide assessment score and the mean Broset violence checklist score in the preceding three months. Conclusions: EHR data from routine clinical practice can be used to predict need for ECT. This may lead to more timely treatment initiation.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

In particular, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) pose a threat for future pandemics and are linked to greater neurotropic potential. Moreover, neurotropic IAV strains have shown a more significant impact on the onset and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). However, despite its clinical relevance, the dynamics and cellular tropism of IAV infection in the CNS are not well understood. In this study, we analyzed the replication of HPAIV H7N7 in vitro using a primary murine triple co-culture system comprising neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. We found that microglia become highly infected early on and induce a strong pro-inflammatory response before undergoing apoptosis. Using fluorescence microscopy with automated single-cell profiling, we found that, in contrast to non-neurotropic H3N2, the H7N7 nucleoprotein accumulated in neuronal somata throughout the infection without being transported into dendrites or axons. A combination of single-cell and co-culture replication assays led us to conclude that astrocytes are the primary virus producers of HPAIV H7N7 in the CNS. Our results illuminate the acute phase of neurotropic IAV infection, highlighting its implications for the association between IAV and the development of neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1750630150157

Results Among all eligible participants, the mean age was 48.4 {+/-} 17.8 years, with males comprising 50.6% of the study population. After adjusting for confounding variables, we found a positive association between the DII and the risk of LTBI, with an odds ratio of 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01-1.13; P=0.023). Adjusted smoothed plots also suggest a straightforward linear relationship between DII and LTBI(P for non-linearity = 0.924), as the level of DII increases, the risk of LTBI shows an upward trend.Additionally, subgroup analysis within the defined gender, age, BMI, PIR, smoking, drinking, HPT, and DM groups indicated no significant interactions among the subgroups, as evidenced by all P values for interaction exceeding 0.05. Conclusions These results underscore that DII may serve as an important risk factor for LTBI, providing new insights for early screening and intervention strategies.

Although about half of smokers attempted to quit, only one-tenth succeeded in 2022. Objective: To identify key predictors of smoking cessation success to inform cessation interventions and increase quitting rates. Methods: We analyzed data from waves 5 and 6 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study (December 2018 to November 2021). Using OpenAI's GPT-4.1, we identified the top 45 variables from wave 5 that are highly predictive of 12-month smoking abstinence in wave 6, based on descriptions of survey variables. We then validated the predictive power of the GPT-4.1-selected variables by comparing the performance of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) trained on different sets of variables. Finally, we derived insights into the top 10 variables, ranked according to their SHapley Additive exPlanations values. Results: The performance of XGBoost trained with all possible wave 5 variables and the 45 selected variables was almost identical (AUC:0.749 vs AUC:0.752). The top 10 variables included past 30-day smoking frequency, minutes from waking up to smoking first cigarette, important people's views on tobacco use, prevalence of tobacco use among close associates, daily electronic nicotine product use, emotional dependence, and health harm concerns. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the ability of OpenAI's GPT-4.1 to identify the top 45 PATH wave 5 variables associated with 12-month smoking abstinence using only their descriptions.

Pregnancy intentions are shaped by interrelated factors across individual, relational and societal contexts. This study employs a Conceptual Hierarchical Model (CHM) to examine pregnancy intentions among womxn and their partners. Methods. Data were drawn from baseline measurements of the Dutch prospective BluePrInt study on unintended pregnancy. It included 911 participants (womxn and partners) who recently experienced an unexpected pregnancy, which they aborted or continued. Pregnancy intentions were assessed using the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy. Key variables included sociodemographics, social support, partner relationship, interpersonal violence, and mental health. A CHM guided multiple regression analyses, with additional analysis of sex differences. Results. Findings indicated that educational attainment and social support were indirectly associated with pregnancy intendedness, while age, religiosity, cohabitation, and life satisfaction showed direct associations, with no evidence of a moderating effect of sex. Conclusions. People who perceive their context as suitable for raising a child, who feel supported, and who have greater personal capacity to parent, perceive their initially unexpected pregnancy as more intended. Policies should promote social and relational stability universally, rather than targeting those experiencing unintended pregnancies. Reproductive counseling should address ambivalence and broader personal circumstances.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

Despite their prevalence, there is limited research synthesizing women's lived experiences and perceptions regarding the use of these apps. Understanding women's perspectives is crucial to address concerns about accuracy, privacy, and emotional well-being impacts, and to ensure that fertility apps are meeting the needs of their users. Objectives: This systematic review aims to synthesize qualitative research on women's perceptions and experiences of using fertility tracking apps. The review will explore women's attitudes, motivations, perceived benefits, and challenges related to the use of these apps. Specifically, it will identify key themes related to how these apps influence women's emotional well-being, relationships, and decision-making processes, while identifying gaps in current literature to guide future research. Methods and Analysis: This review will consider qualitative studies that include women of reproductive age who have used or are currently using fertility tracking apps. The systematic review will be conducted in accordance with JBI methodology for systematic reviews of qualitative evidence using a meta-aggregative approach. A comprehensive search strategy will be employed across multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and Scopus, from each database's inception to January 2025. Two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts using Covidence, assess full texts against inclusion criteria, and extract qualitative data using standardized tools.

Life-history theory proposes that trade-offs and pleiotropic effects across fitness components may explain the evolutionary maintenance of disease-associated alleles. We hypothesize that certain disease-risk alleles might segregate in the population because they confer reproductive advantages, even at the expense of late-life costs on health and longevity. Leveraging genome-wide association studies, we investigated genetic correlations and pleiotropic relationships between 62 complex diseases, longevity, and fertility. In our study, we estimated fertility by meta-analyzing complementary measures of offspring number and used parental lifespan as a proxy for longevity. We found that 85% of diseases showed negative genetic correlations with longevity, whereas 87% of diseases with significant correlations showed positive associations with fertility. Moreover, most disease-risk variants were associated with reduced longevity, even after accounting for socioeconomic confounders. Fertility-increasing alleles exhibited evolutionary signals consistent with adaptive selection despite having pleiotropic effects on disease-risk. Finally, we compared the number of offspring among individuals with high genetic risk of disease and found that, for most diseases, affected individuals had more offspring than disease-free individuals. However, for early-onset conditions, non-affected individuals exhibited higher fertility, highlighting the reproductive cost of early-onset diseases. These findings support the Antagonistic Pleiotropy theory, showing that alleles that enhance early-life reproductive success can persist despite late-life health costs. By uncovering these evolutionary trade-offs between reproduction, longevity, and disease risk, our study shows how Darwinian selection continues to shape contemporary patterns of human disease susceptibility. Understanding these evolutionary trade-offs can inform public health approaches and help anticipate unintended consequences of targeting disease-related genetic pathways.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

Our findings reveal previously unrecognised biological influences on foveal morphogenesis, including retinoic acid metabolism (implicating CYP26A1 for the first time in human foveal development), extracellular matrix and cytoskeletal dynamics, and retinal cell fate determination. In addition, rare-variant analysis uncovered two further gene associations, including ESYT3, a gene not previously linked to foveal structure.

The aim of this study was to investigate what these changes were before and after the implementation of the 2018 guidelines in Denmark. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Registry data on prescriptions was linked with other registries to create a descriptive overview of treatment patterns was carried out for a nationwide cohort of all individuals receiving at least two non-insulin anti-diabetic drugs (NIADs) between 2012 and 2021. RESULTS: A cohort of 66,188 individuals was identified. The treatment patterns reflected significantly higher use of SGLT2 and GLP1 over time, eclipsing all other drugs, except for insulin, at later treatment stages. First-line use of SGLT2 and GLP1 also became higher over time, as did their likelihood of prescription at later stages. Their combined use rivaled insulin usage at similar stages by 2021. First-line use for women were high in the GLP1 group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study finds that GLP1 and SGLT2 are used extensively for individuals who have tried multiple NIADs and may delay the use of insulin.

This study aimed to assess the causal effect of blood pressure during pregnancy on a range of pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. Methods: We performed two sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) to assess the effect of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) during pregnancy on 16 primary and eight secondary adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. We obtained genetic association data from large-scale metanalyses of genome-wide association studies involving predominantly European ancestry individuals for SBP/DBP (N=1,028,980), and pregnancy and perinatal outcomes (N=77,285-934,566). We used inverse-variance weighted (IVW) MR for main analyses and MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, multivariable MR, and IVW adjusted for fetal genetic effects for sensitivity analyses. Results: A 10 mmHg higher genetically predicted maternal SBP increased the odds of gestational diabetes, induction of labour, low birth weight (LBW), small-for-gestational age, preterm birth (PTB), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission [OR ranging from 1.09 (95% CI: 1.04 to 1.14) for PTB to 1.33 (1.26 to 1.41) for LBW]; while decreasing the odds of high birth weight (HBW), large-for-gestational age, and post-term birth [OR ranging from 0.76 (0.69 to 0.83) for HBW to 0.94 (0.90 to 0.99) for post-term birth]. We did not find evidence that genetically predicted higher maternal SBP was related to miscarriage or stillbirth. Results for maternal DBP were similar to results for SBP. Overall, the main results were consistent across sensitivity analyses accounting for pleiotropic instruments and fetal genetic effects. Conclusions: Higher maternal blood pressure reduces gestation duration and fetal growth, and increases the risks of induction of labour, gestational diabetes and NICU admission. This and other emerging evidence highlight the value of interventions to control maternal blood pressure during pregnancy to reduce the burden of adverse pregnancy outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

Material and Methods: The dental arches in ten human jaw specimens (five maxillae, five mandibulae) were scanned using two intraoral 3D scanners before and after exposure to controlled blunt trauma delivered via a drop tower mechanism applying approximately 3154 Newton of force. Trauma outcomes were documented through high-speed video, digital photography, and 3D scanning. Post-trauma scans were processed using the keypoint pipeline, which quantifies dental surface similarity by comparing curvature signatures. An all-vs-all comparison was conducted between pre- and post-trauma scans, including cross-scanner evaluations. Results: Despite consistent trauma application, fracture patterns varied by jaw type, with mandibular fractures typically occurring in the frontal plane in the side segments and maxillary fractures in the sagittal plane in the midline suture. The keypoint pipeline successfully scored 92.5% of the true matches to be the best matching comparison, even in the presence of significant structural damage and tooth displacement. Matching pairs yielded lower dissimilarity scores (mean: 0.55) compared to mismatches (mean: 0.78), indicating that curvature features were sufficiently preserved post-trauma. Conclusions: These findings support the integration of curvature-based 3D dental surface analysis into forensic odontology workflows, particularly in disaster victim identification scenarios involving blunt force trauma.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

Aggregation can obscure important variation across subgroups, limiting opportunities for targeted prevention. Methods: We analyzed 2014-2023 California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data (n=100,177) to estimate prevalence of 28 health indicators across racial and ethnic groups, including disaggregated Multiracial subgroups. We categorized participants based on all self-identified races and aggregated subgroups with N<50. We standardized prevalence by age and sex using 2020 California census data, calculated relative standard errors, and used survey-weighted methods to compare prevalence and subgroup differences. Results: Among 100,177 participants, Multiracial subgroups had the highest prevalence for 24 of 28 outcomes. American Indian or Alaska Native-Black and Hispanic-Black-White adults had the highest prevalence of chronic conditions, poor general health, and disability. In contrast, Asian Multiracial subgroups (e.g., Asian-Black, Asian-Pacific Islander) more often had the lowest prevalence, while Asian-White adults were not consistently the healthiest subgroup. Differences across Multiracial subgroups exceeded 20 percentage points for nearly half of all outcomes. Discussion: Wide health variation among Multiracial adults is masked by common aggregation practices. Subgroups with the highest burden may be overlooked if data are not routinely disaggregated. Public health surveillance systems should expand capacity to collect and report disaggregated race and ethnicity data to better inform prevention strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157
"Physician Workforce and Population Mortality: A Globally Validated Age-Structured Modeling Approach","10.1101/2025.06.16.25329730","medrxiv",1.25,1,1,1.25,1.25,"Oh, Y.","Youngmin Oh","Samsung Electronics","2025-06-20","2","PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","cc_by","health policy","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2025/06/20/2025.06.16.25329730.source.xml","BackgroundEvaluating long-term health workforce planning requires robust and globally valid indicators. While many existing metrics, such as patient satisfaction or healthcare utilization, are inherently uncertain over long horizons, mortality is an objective and stable metric. To analyze how physician supply impacts population health, we propose a model that links physician density to age-specific mortality rates and incorporate it to the age-sturctured dynamics.

MethodsWe developed a unified model that links physician workforce density to age-structured mortality rates. Subsequently, we applied this model within a Lotka-McKendrick framework to simulate physician supply expansion scenarios in South Korea. The system simulates future age-specific mortality outcomes under varying physician supply scenarios, including a baseline intake of 3,058 physicians per year and an expanded intake of up to 7,058 physicians per year, projected through 2065.

FindingsOur model was validated using WHO mortality data including Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Its validity of our model holds across all age groups in each country, as confirmed by statistical analysis with false discovery rate correction (maximum adjusted p < 0.05). Using the age-structured dynamics with the model in South Korea, we confirm that future physician density increases even under the baseline scenario (3,058 physicians per year), and that projected population sizes under the baseline and the aggressive expansion scenario (7,058 physicians per year) are not statistically different (p > 0.07). Moreover, under the aggressive expansion scenario, the projected reductions in age-specific mortality rates by 2065 remain marginal: less than 0.27% for those under 65, less than 0.69% for ages 65-75, less than 2.75% for ages 75-84, less than 7.31% for ages 85-94, and less than 12.6% for ages 95-99.

InterpretationIn well-resourced health systems facing aging populations and persistently low fertility rates, further expansion of physician supply alone offers limited mortality benefits. Our findings suggest a paradigm shift: from quantity-driven to efficiency-focused workforce strategies. The proposed method is readily adaptable to other contries, offering a policy-relevant and outcome-oriented tool for long-term health workforce planning.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for studies published between 2000 and 2024 using terms such as ""physician workforce,"" ""healthcare workforce planning,"" ""medical workforce density,"" and ""age-structured dynamics."" Most physician workforce planning models are either utilization-based (projected service demand) or needs-based (estimated population health requirements). These models often extrapolate current health service utilization rates or population health needs into the future, typically assuming that such values remain constant over time, despite the acknowledged difficulty of forecasting long-term demand dynamics. Additionally, methodologies differ widely across countries, which hampers direct comparisons of outcomes. Some metrics, such as patient needs or preferences, are also subjective and difficult to measure consistently. In contrast, more objective indicators like mortality rates are more readily available and comparable across settings. As far as we are aware, no published model has dynamically integrated physician density--endogenously derived from workforce supply--into an age-structured framework for projecting population mortality.

Added value of this studyTo the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to integrate a model linking physician workforce density with age-structured mortality rates into the Lotka-McKendrick framework, capturing the interaction between physicians and populations across age groups. By modeling how changes in doctor-to-population ratios affect mortality, our approach moves beyond traditional models that treat health outcomes as exogenous. This allows novel analyses of policy scenarios, such as estimating life expectancy gains from increasing physician supply. Our model provides a unified framework to project both physician workforce dynamics and population health outcomes simultaneously.

Implications of all available evidenceOur findings underscore the importance of explicitly linking age-structured population dynamics with physician density and mortality outcomes. Traditional models often overlook these interdependencies, risking inaccurate forecasts and limiting the relevance of cross-national comparisons. By capturing how physician supply influences mortality across age groups, our approach enables more precise, outcome-driven workforce planning.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

Panic disorder, diagnosed in 2- 4%3, involves recurrent attacks followed by persistent worry about further attacks, leading to functional impairment and avoidance behaviours1,2. We conducted genome-wide association meta-analyses of panic attacks and panic disorder (61,746 and 29,775 cases, respectively, and 105,814 controls), identifying the first genome-wide significant variants for both traits (16 for panic attacks; 7 for panic disorder). Geneset analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing data implicated afferent neurons from the eye, heart, and lung in panic attacks, suggesting a critical role for sensory processing and interoceptive awareness. Further analyses suggested that these associations generalize to other psychiatric disorders. These findings offer novel insights into the biological mechanisms underlying panic, the role of afferent neurons, and may inform the development of more targeted and effective interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

After longitudinal training, this representation was further refined, becoming more similar to the biological digits, which correlated with increased subjective somatosensory embodiment.

While this protective niche has been described, the molecular determinants orchestrating its formation and dictating its immune interactions are not well defined. Using Perturb-map, we determine how dozens of different gene perturbations shape the growth and cellular environments of PDAC clones through space and time. Our study reveals dynamic, gene-specific adaptations of immune neighborhoods during clonal selection. We identified Serpinb2 (PAI2) and Serpine1 (PAI1) as key cancer-derived mediators of TME remodeling and immune evasion. These factors promote the deposition of a fibrin-rich ECM that shapes immune cell composition, locally retains and polarizes immunosuppressive macrophages and excludes cytotoxic T cells. Deletion of either Serpinb2 or Serpine1 greatly enhanced tumor response to anti-PD1 immunotherapy in an aggressive PDAC model. Transcriptomic analysis further linked their expression to distinct PDAC subtypes and poor patient survival. Our findings demonstrate that Serpinb2 and Serpine1 establish a permissive niche for tumor progression and show how PDAC cells exploit components of the fibrinolysis pathway to remodel the ECM, alter macrophage composition, and protect themselves from immune editing, ultimately reinforcing the role of extracellular factors in shaping an immune-privileged tumor niche.","NA","biorxiv",1750630150157

MethodsWe conducted a national retrospective database study including children born in 2008-2020. Individual-level data-linkage allowed examination of associations of sociodemographic variables with MMR and DTaP-IPV vaccination status at 2 years of age. Coverage for each variable, stratified by birth cohort, was calculated. Multivariable Poisson regression assessed independent associations and changes in coverage over time.

ResultsMMR coverage decreased in all population subgroups (overall 95% to 89% in 2008 and 2020 cohorts), with more substantial declines in some groups. The multivariable analysis showed that Dutch children of non-Dutch origin, particularly those of Moroccan and Turkish origin showed more pronounced declines (-25% and -12% compared to children of Dutch origin in cohort 2020, respectively). Among children not attending day care and children living in larger families ([&ge;]4 children), a faster decline in coverage was observed compared to those attending day care and living in smaller families (both -12% in cohort 2020). Among children of self-employed mothers and children in the lowest income households, lower coverage was observed compared to children of mothers in employment and children in the highest income households (-8% and -7% in cohort 2020, respectively). Nearly identical trends were observed for DTaP-IPV vaccination.

ConclusionOur study reveals a significant decline in childhood vaccination coverage in the Netherlands, with increasing disparities between sociodemographic groups. This is crucial for prioritising vaccination efforts to protect public health equitably.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

Previous structural studies have advanced our understanding of hantavirus glycoprotein architecture and function, however, the lack of high-resolution in situ structures of the glycoprotein tetramer and its lattice organization has limited mechanistic insights into viral assembly, entry, and antigenicity. Here, we leveraged a virus-like particle (VLP) system to establish a cryo-electron microscopy workflow for lattice-forming viral glycoproteins. This enabled the determination of a 2.35 [A] resolution structure of the membrane-embedded Andes virus (ANDV) glycoprotein tetramer, as well as structures of dimers of tetramers and a complex with antibody ADI-65534. These structures reveal previously uncharacterized features of glycoprotein organization, stability, and pH-sensing. Immunization of mice with self-amplifying replicon RNA (repRNA) encoding ANDV-VLPs elicited high levels of glycoprotein-binding antibodies but equivalent titers of neutralizing antibodies compared to repRNA-encoded native ANDV glycoprotein complex. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of hantavirus glycoprotein assemblies and their function, laying a foundation for structure-based vaccine design efforts.","NA","biorxiv",1750630150157

For this reason, the genetic profiles of Genghis Khan and his descendants are of keen academic and public interest. His Y-chromosome has been hypothesized to belong to haplogroup C3* (C2a1a3-F1918) but this has yet to be substantiated. To explore the genetic ancestry of Genghis Khan, we analyzed four archaeological individuals from the Golden Horde, including three males and one female, who were buried in separate medieval elite mausoleums in the Ulitau region of Kazakstan. One of the males is believed to be Joshi (Juchi), the eldest son of Genghis Khan. We generated genomic data from these archaeological individuals and found that the three males were paternally related, sharing the Y-chromosome haplogroup C3*, consistent with the hypothesized signature haplotype of Genghis Khan. In addition, we confirm that the Golden Horde elites derived most of their genomes from Ancient Northeast Asians (ANA) while having an additional ancestral component from either Ancient North Eurasians (ANE) or a Berel Scythian related population. Furthermore, we were able to identify their medieval relatives in the Mongolian Plateau through constructing an Identity by Descent (IBD) network.","NA","biorxiv",1750630150157

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

In ovules of Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana), one of the two synergid cells degenerates at fertilization, while the fertilized egg cell (zygote) undergoes directional elongation followed by asymmetric division to initiate embryonic patterning. However, morphological analysis of these events has been hampered by the limitations of conventional cell wall staining, which fails to label cells lacking complete walls, and by the requirement for transgenic fluorescent reporters to visualize cell outlines. Here, we report that the membrane-specific fluorescent dye FM4-64 readily permeates ovules, allowing clear visualization of reproductive cell morphology both before and after fertilization. This staining method supports high-resolution time-lapse imaging and quantitative analysis of early embryogenesis in living tissues. Importantly, it is applicable not only to the angiosperm A. thaliana but also to the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (M. polymorpha) and the fern Ceratopteris richardii (C. richardii), enabling the visualization of live reproductive cell structures within maternal tissues and revealing fertilization-associated morphological changes. This simple and robust method thus provides a valuable tool for spatiotemporal and quantitative analyses of reproductive processes across a broad range of plant species, without the need to generate transgenic lines.","NA","biorxiv",1750630150157

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking).

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples.

YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1750630150157
