In this study, we developed language models to predict novel antiphage proteins in two ways: first via fine-tuning ESM2, a protein language model capable of detecting distant homology to known defense proteins, second via a genomic language model with ALBERT architecture which predicts defensive function based on genomic context. We demonstrate that applying these approaches to Actinomycetota - a phylum largely unexplored for antiphage defenses, can accurately predict previously unknown functional defense mechanisms, leading to the discovery and experimental validation of six defense systems with novel antiphage proteins. Analysis of over 30,000 bacterial genomes predicted more than 45,000 uncharacterized protein families potentially involved in antiphage defense, underscoring the vast, untapped diversity of these systems.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

Their elusive nature has long obscured their significance, and their impact on genome evolution remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal a surprising abundance and diversity of Starships in the phytopathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae. Remarkably, Starships dominate the plastic genomic compartments involved in host colonization, are enriched in virulence-associated genes, and exhibit genetic and epigenetic characteristics associated with adaptive genome evolution. We further uncover extensive horizontal transfer of Starships between Verticillium species and, strikingly, from distantly related Fusarium fungi. Finally, we demonstrate how Starship activity facilitated the de novo formation of a novel virulence gene. Our findings illuminate the profound influence of Starship dynamics on fungal genome evolution and the development of virulence.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

Here, we conducted a comprehensive three-year longitudinal study examining T cell and antibody responses in 78 vaccinated individuals without reported symptomatic infections. We observed distinct dynamics in Spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses across multiple vaccine doses. While antibody titers incrementally increased and stabilized with each booster, T cell responses rapidly plateaued, maintaining remarkable stability across CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Notably, approximately 30% of participants showed CD4+ T cell reactivity to non-Spike antigens, consistent with asymptomatic infections. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a diverse landscape of Spike-specific T cell phenotypes, with no evidence of increased exhaustion or significant functional impairment. However, qualitative changes were observed in individuals with evidence of asymptomatic infection, exhibiting unique immunological characteristics, including increased frequencies of Th17-like CD4+ T cells and GZMKhi/IFNR CD8+ T cell subsets. Remarkably, repeated vaccinations in this group were associated with a progressive increase in regulatory T cells, potentially indicating a balanced immune response that may mitigate immunopathology. By regularly stimulating T cell memory, boosters contribute to a stable and enhanced immune response, which may provide better protection against symptomatic infections.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

The epidemic remains uncontrolled, with spillbacks into poultry, wild birds and other mammals including humans. Here, we present molecular and virological evidence that the cattle B3.13 genotype H5N1 viruses rapidly accumulated adaptations in polymerase genes that enabled better replication in bovine cells, as well as cells of other mammalian species including humans and pigs. We find evidence of several mammalian adaptations gained early in the evolution of these viruses in cattle including PB2 M631L, which is found in all cattle sequences, and PA K497R, which is found in the majority. Structurally, PB2 M631L maps to the polymerase-ANP32 interface, an essential host factor for viral genome replication. We show this mutation adapts the virus to co-opt bovine ANP32 proteins and thereby enhances virus replication in bovine and primary human airway cells. Importantly, we show that ongoing evolution during 2024 in the PB2 gene, including a convergently arising D740N substitution, further increases polymerase activity in a range of mammalian cells. Thus, the continued circulation of H5N1 in dairy cattle allows virus adaption improving replicative ability in cattle and increasing zoonotic spillover risk.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

It occurs when people receive the intervention because they survive, rather than survive because they received the intervention. Studies in conditions with substantial early mortality, such as acute severe infections, are particularly vulnerable. The bias can be avoided by fitting the intervention as a time-varying exposure. Methods We developed IMMORTOOL, an R package accessible via a user-friendly web interface. This tool will estimate the potential for immortal time bias using empiric or assumed data on the distributions of time to intervention and time to event. Assumptions are that no other biases are present and that the intervention does not impact the outcome. The tool was benchmarked using studies presenting both naive analyses and analyses with the intervention fit as a time-varying exposure. We applied IMMORTOOL to a set of influential observational studies that used naive analyses when estimating the impact of polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) on survival in streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). Results IMMORTOOL demonstrated that published estimates suggesting a survival advantage from giving IVIG in STSS are explained, at least in part, by immortal time bias. Conclusions IMMORTOOL can quantify the potential for immortal time bias in observational analyses. This may help readers interrogate published studies. We do not advocate IMMORTOOL being used to justify naive analyses where the intervention could be fit as a time-varying exposure. To what extent giving IVIG in STSS improves survival remains uncertain.","NA","medrxiv",1736546911478

Minor injuries are repaired by hepatocyte self-duplication, while severe damage triggers cholangiocyte involvement in hepatocyte recovery. This paradigm is well-documented for adult animals but is less explored during rapid growth. We design two new partial liver injury models in zebrafish, which were investigated during growth spurts: 1) partial ablation, killing half the hepatocytes; and 2) partial hepatectomy, removing half a liver lobe. In both injuries, de novo hepatocytes emerged alongside existing ones. Single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing with Cre-driver lines generated by genome editing identified cholangiocytes as the source of de novo hepatocytes. We further identify active mTORC1 signalling in the uninjured liver of growing animal to be a regulator of the enhanced plasticity of cholangiocytes. Our study suggests cholangiocyte-to-hepatocyte transdifferentiation as the primary mechanism of liver regeneration during periods of rapid growth.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

However, the absence of structural information on how the enzyme binds inhibitors has made optimization of lead compounds challenging. We used electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of NDH-2 from Mycobacterium smegmatis, a fast-growing non-pathogenic model for respiration in M. tuberculosis, both alone and in complex with a 2-mercapto-quinazolinone inhibitor. The structure shows that active mycobacterial NDH-2 is dimeric, with the dimerization interface stabilized by an extended C-terminal  helix not found in NDH-2 from other bacterial genera.

The arrangement of monomers in the dimer differs from the arrangement described for other prokaryotic NDH-2 dimers, instead resembling dimers formed by NDH-2 in eukaryotes. Density for the 2-mercapto-quinazolinone in the menaquinone-binding site shows that the inhibitor blocks menaquinone reduction through direct interaction with the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor. These results reveal structural elements of NDH-2 that could be used to design specific inhibitors of the mycobacterial enzyme.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

However, the diversity of bat-borne coronaviruses remains poorly characterized in many geographical areas. Here, we recovered six complete coronavirus genomes by performing a metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from hundreds of individual bats captured in Spain, a country with high bat species diversity. Three of these genomes corresponded to potentially novel coronavirus species belonging to the alphacoronavirus genus. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that some of these viruses are closely related to coronaviruses previously described in bats from other countries, suggesting the existence of a shared viral reservoir worldwide. Using viral pseudotypes, we investigated the receptor usage of the identified viruses and found that one of them can use human and bat ACE2, highlighting its zoonotic potential. However, the receptor usage of the other viruses remains unknown. This study broadens our understanding of coronavirus diversity and identifies research priorities for the prevention of zoonotic viral outbreaks.

Author summaryBats carry many viruses, some of which can cross the species barrier and infect humans, a process known as zoonosis. In particular, bat-borne coronaviruses pose a significant threat to human health. To improve our pandemic preparedness, it is essential to characterize the diversity and zoonotic potential of bat coronaviruses. However, such research efforts have historically suffered from a strong geographical bias. For example, despite the rich bat diversity in Spain, few studies have searched for coronaviruses in Iberian bats. Here, we used viral metagenomics to test for the presence of coronaviruses in more than 200 bat samples collected across Spain. We detected six complete coronaviruses, three of which were proposed to be new viral species. We characterized their relationship to previously identified viruses and their ability to use known coronavirus receptors to enter cells, demonstrating that one virus could use human ACE2 as a receptor. Our results highlight the diversity of bat-borne coronaviruses in Spain, their zoonotic potential, and the need to better characterize coronavirus diversity worldwide.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

Despite this close interdependency between proteasome subunits, we demonstrate that knockouts from different proteasome subcomplexes result in distinct highly cellular phenotypes. In particular, depletion of 19S PSMD lid proteins, but not that of other proteasome subunits, prevents bipolar spindle assembly during mitosis, resulting in a mitotic arrest. We find that the monopolar spindle phenotype is caused by ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of the motor protein KIF11 upon loss of 19S proteins. Thus, negative regulation of 20S-mediated proteasome degradation is essential for mitotic progression and 19S and 20S proteasome components can function independently outside of the canonical 26S structure. This work reveals a role for the proteasome in spindle formation and identifies the effects of ubiquitin-independent degradation on cell cycle control.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

We report a virtual spatial navigation task designed to test the impact of different levels and types of uncertainty about reward on place cell populations. When the reward location changed on a trial-by-trial basis, inducing expected uncertainty, a greater proportion of place cells followed along, and the reward and the track end became anchors of a warped spatial metric. When the reward location then unexpectedly moved, the fraction of reward place cells that followed was greater when starting from a state of expected, compared to low, uncertainty.

Computational workflows for discovering condition-specific differences in tissue organization typically rely on pairwise comparisons or unsupervised clustering. In many cases, these approaches are computationally expensive, lack statistical rigor, and are insensitive to low-prevalence cellular niches that are nevertheless highly discriminative and predictive of patient outcomes. Here, we present QUICHE - an automated, scalable, and statistically robust method that can be used to discover cellular niches differentially enriched in spatial regions, longitudinal samples, or clinical patient groups. In contrast to existing methods, QUICHE combines local niche detection with interpretable statistical modeling using graph neighborhoods to detect differentially enriched cellular niches, even at low prevalence. Using in silico models and spatial proteomic imaging of human tissues, we demonstrate that QUICHE can accurately detect condition-specific cellular niches occurring at a frequency of 0.5% in fewer than 20% of patient samples, outperforming the next best method which required a patient prevalence of 60% for detection. To validate our approach and understand how tumor structure influences recurrence risk in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), we used QUICHE to comprehensively profile the tumor microenvironment in a multi-center, spatial proteomics cohort consisting of primary surgical resections, analyzing over 2 million cells from 314 patients across 5 medical centers. We discovered cellular niches that were consistently enriched in key regions of the tumor microenvironment, including the tumor-immune border and extracellular matrix remodeling regions, as well as niches statistically-associated with patient outcomes, including recurrence status and recurrence-free survival. The majority of differential niches (74.2%) were specific to patients that did not relapse and formed a robust interconnected network enriched in monocytes, macrophages, APCs, and CD8T cells with tumor and stroma cells. In contrast, the interaction network for patients that relapsed was notably sparse and enriched in B cells, CD68 macrophages and neutrophils. We validated these findings using two independent cohorts, observing similar cellular interactions and predictive power. Collectively, these results suggest that salient, generalized profiles of productive anti-tumor immune responses are defined by a network of structural engagement between innate and adaptive immunity with tumor and stromal cells, rather than by any single specific cell population.

Changes in gene expression play a critical role in the cellular response to hypoxia, enabling cells to adapt to reduced oxygen availability by regulating metabolism, angiogenesis, and survival pathways. These changes are primarily mediated by the HIF family of transcription factors, however other transcription factors such as NF-kappaB, are also activated in the hypoxic response. Although NF-kappaB is known to be activated under hypoxic conditions the extent of NF-kappaB contributions to the hypoxic response remains poorly understood. In this study we analyse hypoxia-induced NF-kappaB dependent gene expression, to define the NF-kappaB-dependent hypoxic signature. Our analysis reveals that a significant proportion of hypoxia-induced gene expression changes are NF-kappaB dependent, with majority of the hypoxia downregulated genes requiring NF-kappaB for their repression. We show that, while the NF-kappaB-mediated hypoxic response may vary between cell types, there are a core subset of hypoxia inducible genes that require NF-kappaB across multiple cell backgrounds. We demonstrate that NF-kappaB is critical for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and regulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation under hypoxic conditions. This work highlights that NF-kappaB has a central role in hypoxia response, regulating a broader set of genes than previously thought, providing new understanding into the gene expression regulation by hypoxia and NF-kappaB.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

This was echoed in Prof. Rita Contis September 17, 2024, Senate Finance Committee testimony.

MethodsTo test the IRAs impacts on early-stage investments targeting therapeutics for the Medicare-aged population, a longitudinal dataset of commercially sponsored clinical trials by companies with a market valuation < $2 billion was obtained from the BioMedTracker database from January 1, 2018, to May 6, 2024. These trials were filtered to match early-stage investments to lead assets undergoing clinical development.

ResultsFrom 161 lead assets with 897 investments, we find the aggregated total into large molecules in 2024 was 10 times larger than that for small molecules, which underwent a 70% decline after passage of the IRA. Individual investments made into small molecules decline by minus one-half as exposure to the Medicare-aged population increases after the passage of the IRA (p < 0.0018). Testing large molecule investments by their exposure to Medicare post IRAs passage is statistically inconclusive.

Research ConclusionsThis study presents evidence of a decline in the development of new therapies targeting the Medicare-aged population since the passage of the IRA. If these impacts were due to the economic downturn post-pandemic, we would observe statistically similar results in both large and small molecules. However, the results by molecule type diverge. Investors perceive large molecules to be of a lower investment risk relative to small molecules after IRAs passage.","NA","medrxiv",1736546911478

Here, we employ the Drosophila hematopoietic organ, the larval lymph gland (LG) to investigate the impact of modulating cellular ageing on organ homeostasis. LG consists of a Posterior Signalling Center (PSC) that acts as a stem cell niche and maintains the prohemocytes housed in the Medullary Zone (MZ). Cortical Zone (CZ) consists of differentiated hemocytes namely plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes. Intricate signalling networks active in the PSC and MZ orchestrate and regulate homeostasis. In this study, we characterize the effect of genetic perturbation of the molecular circuitry of ageing locally and systemically to investigate its effect on LG blood cell homeostasis. Genetic modulation of cellular ageing displays traditional hallmarks of ageing validating our model in the LG. Our results indicate that induction of accelerated ageing both locally and systemically leads to a reduction in stem cell niche size, DNA damage accumulation and increased progenitor differentiation whereas decelerated ageing shows an opposite trend. We show that the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) pathway is activated upon inducing accelerated ageing in the LG hemocytes possibly to recoup back to homeostatic conditions. Furthermore, lymph glands of ISR pathway mutants or upon perturbation of ISR pathway components in prohemocytes show increased blood cell differentiation indicating disruption of homeostasis. Genetic epistasis analysis shows that ectopic over-expression of ISR pathway genes in an accelerated ageing scenario over and above the existing levels can rescue the defects in blood cell homeostasis. Overall, our study explores how modulation of cellular aging locally or systemically can impact tissue homeostasis. Our research paves way to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying an aged versus young stem cell-niche micro-environment and how its abrogation may lead to onset of disease.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

However, systematic understanding remains limited due to the rarity, genetic heterogeneity, and complex genotype-phenotype relationships of these diseases. Primary ciliopathies are a diverse group of rare disorders caused by variants in genes associated with the cilium, a cellular organelle involved in signaling during development and cell homeostasis. These genetic variants result in a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes involving the brain, eye, kidney and skeleton. It remains unclear to what extent this phenotypic diversity can be attributed to the disease-causing genes and their specific roles in ciliary function. Here, we systematically compared human primary ciliopathies with each other and with mouse phenotypes by propagating known disease genes through a network of protein interactions. Network propagation improved the clustering of primary ciliopathies with shared clinical phenotypes and facilitated the identification of mouse phenotypes closely related to primary ciliopathies due to shared groups of proteins in the interaction network. By leveraging this phenotype-specific approach, we prioritized candidate genes for ciliopathies and identified likely pathogenic variants in CEP43, a novel candidate gene for human primary ciliopathies in three previously unsolved cases. This study demonstrates that network propagation enhances the genetic and phenotypic understanding of primary ciliopathies, aiding in the prioritization of candidate genes and identification of relevant mouse models for these rare disorders, and providing a framework for unraveling shared underlying mechanisms for other rare genetic diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

In Escherichia coli, the TonB-ExbBD motor complex energizes the TonB-dependent transporter FecA, facilitating ferric citrate import. FecA also functions as a sensor, transmitting signals to the cytoplasmic membrane protein FecR. We previously demonstrated that FecR undergoes a three-step cleavage process, culminating in the activation of the cytoplasmic sigma factor FecI, which drives fec gene transcription. Here, we describe the complete mechanism of FecR cleavage-mediated ferric citrate signaling involving FecA and TonB. The cleavage cascade begins with FecR autoproteolysis prior to membrane integration. The soluble C-terminal domain (CTD) fragment of FecR is co-translocated with the N-terminal domain (NTD) fragment through a Tat system-mediated process. In the periplasm, the interaction between the CTD and NTD fragments prevents further cleavage. This inhibition is lifted by TonB-mediated motor function, which releases the CTD, allowing the cleavage cascade to proceed. This process is essential for ferric citrate signal-induced activation of fec gene expression. Our findings reveal that the regulation of FecR cleavage, relying on the TonB-FecA axis, plays a central role in bacterial response to ferric citrate signals.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

Genetic and optogenetic manipulations identified calcium transients as necessary and sufficient for ROS bursts via activation of NADPH oxidases RBOHC and RBOHF. Apoplastic ROS bursts are not required but rather limit the gravity-induced root bending. Root bending is sensed by stretch-activated calcium channel MCA1 leading to NADPH oxidase activation at the stretched side. The resulting ROS production stiffens cell wall for better soil penetration. Apoplastic ROS thus provides a means to balance tissue flexibility and stiffness to efficiently navigate soil.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

Here, using live imaging of second trimester human fetal tissue and cortical organoids, we identify a two-step mode of translocation for bRG cell colonization of the human neocortex. bRG cells undergo a microtubule-dependent movement during interphase, called interphasic somal translocation (IST), and an acto-myosin dependent movement prior to cytokinesis, called mitotic somal translocation (MST). IST is controlled by the LINC complex that recruits the dynein motor and its activator LIS1 to the nuclear envelope for transport, and is altered in LIS1 patient organoids. MST occurs during prometaphase and is a mitotic spindle translocation event. It is controlled by the mitotic cell rounding molecular pathway, via ERMs and Vimentin, driving translocation. 85% of bRG cell translocation is due to IST, for a total movement of 0,67 mm per month of human fetal gestation. Our work identifies how bRG cells colonize the human fetal cortex, and further shows how these mechanisms are conserved in migrating glioblastoma cells.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is important early in metastasis to enable cancer cells to detach from neighboring cells, become migratory, and escape the primary tumor. While different phases of metastasis expose cells to variable nutrient environments and demands, the metabolic requirements and plasticity of each step are uncertain. Here we show that EMT and primary tumor escape are stimulated by disrupted oxidative metabolism. Using Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) patient samples, we identified the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor NDUFA4L2 as upregulated in cells undergoing EMT. Deletion of NDUFA4L2 enhanced oxidative metabolism and prevented EMT and metastasis while NDUFA4L2 overexpression enhanced these processes. Mechanistically, NDUFA4L2 suppressed oxidative phosphorylation and caused citric acid cycle intermediates to accumulate, which modified chromatin accessibility of EMT-related loci to drive primary tumor escape. The effect of impaired mitochondrial metabolism to drive EMT appeared general, as renal cell carcinoma patient tumors driven by fumarate hydratase mutations with disrupted oxidative phosphorylation were highly metastatic and also had robust EMT. These findings highlight the importance of dynamic shifts in metabolism for cell migration and metastasis, with mitochondrial impairment driving early phases of this process. Understanding mitochondrial dynamics may have important implications in both basic and translational efforts to prevent cancer deaths.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

Literature evidence highlights a potential mutual regulation between them: patients harboring loss-of-function variants in ANGPTL3 show reduced levels of circulating PCSK9. After predicting their interaction using an in-silico model, we verified the direct interaction between ANGPTL3 and PCSK9 through co-immunoprecipitation. The ANGPTL3-PCSK9 complex persisted under fasting conditions and dissociated under feeding conditions. Treatment with human LDLs was sufficient to simulate the feeding response. Then, we observed that the overexpression of PCSK9 enhances the uptake of LDLs that are not further metabolized, while the overexpression of ANGPTL3 enhances LDL turnover. The overexpression of both proteins restored LDL uptake and degradation, which became comparable to those of control cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate the existence of an ANGPTL3-PCSK9 complex, which coordinately contributes to the regulation of intracellular lipid homeostasis, aiming to prevent cellular metabolic overload.

Increased uptake of extracellular nutrients determines the separation of the ANGPTL3-PCSK9 complex. The two free proteins have different functions (1). Increased levels of PCSK9 determine an increased intracellular entrapment of circulating LDLs (2) that are not catabolized unless there is a presence of high intracellular levels of ANGPTL3. Increased ANGPTL3 levels also favor ApoB lipidation and secretion (3), whereas an increase in intracellular PCSK9 increases intracellular ApoB degradation. The increase in intracellular PCSK9 also determines a block in lipogenesis and favors beta-oxidation, thus decreasing the intracellular lipid content (4).

We show that this cell-type specificity does not align with 5-HT2A receptor expression but is consistent with the integrated signaling via cell-type specific 5-HT receptor co-expression patterns. Cell-cell communication reveals that psilocybin also broadly suppresses GABAergic inhibition. Ultimately, psilocybin induces plasticity-related genes in subsets of excitatory neurons suggesting that psilocybin induces sustained increases in neuroplasticity in the mouse mPFC. Our findings point to L5/6NP neurons as a key mediator of psilocybin neuroplastic effects.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

However, the mechanisms linking mechanical cues to ECM remodelling and invasion remain incompletely understood. Here, using an in-situ stiffening model that allows for modulation of ECM stiffness around fully formed normal mammary acini embedded in their native ECM microenvironment, we identify critical steps in basement membrane (BM) and stromal ECM remodelling during invasion and discover the molecular mechanisms driving this process. We find that stiffening of the ECM around normal mammary acini results in rapid loss and degradation of laminin (LN) and upregulation of the fibronectin (FN) secretion around the acini. This priming phase is followed by the onset of invasion which requires localized upregulation of LN production and ECM remodelling. Mechanistically, ECM production and remodelling as well as invasion is mediated by {beta}1 integrin-FAK signalling, which activates mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs). Further, we identify Piezo1 as the MSC downstream of {beta}1 integrin-FAK that drives BM disruption and stromal ECM remodelling. Taken together, our results identify the mechanisms by which stiffness can trigger invasive phenotypes from normal tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

In the post-synthetic steps specific to ergosterol biosynthesis, we find that successive modifications act to oscillate ordering capacity, settling on a level that supports phase separation while retaining fluidity of the resulting domains. Simulations carried out with each intermediate showed how conformers in the sterols alkyl tail are capable of modulating long-range ordering of phospholipids, which could underlie changes in phase behavior.

This niche diversity is mediated by bacterial effectors injected via the two type 3 secretion systems (T3SS). Salmonella resides either within membrane-bound Salmonella-containing vacuoles (SCV) or they grow rapidly within the cytosol upon SCV rupture. Recently, we identified a third intracellular subpopulation, dormant Salmonella within modified vacuoles in epithelial cells, which can survive for up to 7 days in vitro. To explore how bacterial effectors influence the balance of these three subpopulations, we constructed a panel of mutants lacking genes encoding key effectors and examined their intracellular behaviors at 6 and 24 hours post-infection (hpi). Deletion of the T3SS-2 effector SifA significantly increased the dormant subpopulation at later infection time points, identifying SifA as the first known effector regulating bacterial dormancy in epithelial cells. SifA-induced Salmonella-induced filaments (SIFs) characterize the mature Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV), and we observed that SIFs were needed for intravacuolar growth of Salmonella. We could show that SIF formation was critical for nutrient acquisition within the SCV; inhibition of SIF formation resulted in a higher proportion of dormant bacteria, akin to the effect of reduced glucose availability during infection. Both bacterial and host glycolysis pathways were required to prevent dormancy, as proper nutrient scavenging through SIF-mediated modification of the SCV is essential for maintaining a replicative, non-dormant state. These results underscore the importance of nutrient access, facilitated by reprogramming host endomembrane trafficking, for Salmonella to avoid dormancy and sustain active replication within its intracellular niche.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

However, certain pathogens remain underexplored as targets for phage therapy, including the zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis which causes infections in pigs and humans. Despite global efforts, the genome of only one infective S. suis phage has been described. Here, we report the isolation of two phages that infect S. suis: Bonnie and Clyde. The phages infect 58% of 100 S. suis strains tested, including representatives of seven different serotypes and thirteen known sequence types from diverse geographical origins. Clyde suppressed bacterial growth in vitro within two multi-strain mixes designed to simulate a polyclonal S. suis infection. Both phages demonstrated stability across various temperatures and pH levels, highlighting their potential to withstand storage conditions and maintain viability in delivery formulations. Genome comparisons revealed that neither phage shares significant nucleotide identity with any cultivated phages in the NCBI database and thereby represent novel species belonging to two distinct novel genera. This study is the first to investigate the adhesion devices of S. suis infecting phages. Structure prediction and analysis of adhesion devices with AlphaFold2 revealed two distinct lineages of S. suis phages: Streptococcus thermophilus-like (Bonnie) and S. suis-like (Clyde). The structural similarities between the adhesion devices of Bonnie and S. thermophilus phages, despite the lack of nucleotide similarity and differing ecological niches, suggest a common ancestor or convergent evolution, highlighting evolutionary links between pathogenic and non-pathogenic streptococcal species. These findings provide valuable insights into the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of phages that can infect S. suis, providing new data for the therapeutic application of phages in a One Health context.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

Here we introduce a comprehensive database of 3.6 billion tandem repeat allele sequences from over one thousand individuals using HiFi long-read sequencing. We show that the previously identified pathogenic loci are among the most variable tandem repeat loci in the genome, when incorporating nucleotide resolution sequence content to measure the longest pure motif segment. More broadly, we introduce a novel measure,  tandem repeat constraint, that assists in distinguishing potentially pathogenic from benign loci. Our approach of measuring variation as  the length of the longest pure segment successfully prioritizes pathogenic repeats within their previously published linkage regions. We also present evidence for two novel pathogenic repeat expansion candidates. In summary, this analysis significantly clarifies the potential for short tandem repeat pathogenicity at over 1.7 million tandem repeat loci and will aid the identification of disease-causing repeat expansions.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

While mechanisms preventing oxidative damage to membrane phospholipids are established, the vulnerability of LD neutral lipids to peroxidation and protective mechanisms are unknown. Here, we identify LD-localized Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1 (FSP1) as a critical regulator that prevents neutral lipid peroxidation by recycling coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) to its lipophilic antioxidant form. Lipidomics reveal that FSP1 loss leads to the accumulation of oxidized triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters, and biochemical reconstitution of FSP1 with CoQ10 and NADH suppresses triacylglycerol peroxidation in vitro. Notably, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich triacylglycerols enhance cancer cell sensitivity to FSP1 loss and inducing PUFA-rich LDs triggers triacylglycerol peroxidation and LD-initiated ferroptosis when FSP1 activity is impaired. These findings uncover the first LD lipid quality control pathway, wherein LD-localized FSP1 maintains neutral lipid integrity to prevent the buildup of oxidized lipids and induction of ferroptosis.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

Yet, only a handful of CRISPR-Cas9 based allele editing tools have been optimized to study this unique pathogen. In this work, we compare four systems to introduce the genetic elements necessary for the production of Cas9 and the guide RNA molecule in the genome of C. auris, replacing the ENO1, LEU2 and HIS1 loci respectively, while the fourth system makes use of an episomal plasmid. We observed that the editing efficiency of all four systems was significantly different and strain dependent. Alarmingly, we did not detect correct integration of linear CRISPR cassette constructs in integration-based systems, in over 4,900 screened transformants. Still, all transformants, whether correctly edited or not, grew on selective nourseothricin media, suggesting common random ectopic integration of the CRISPR cassette. Although the plasmid-based system showed a low transformation success compared to the other systems, it has the highest editing efficiency with 41.9% correct transformants on average. In an attempt to improve editing efficiencies of integration-based systems by silencing the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway, we deleted two main NHEJ factors, KU70 and LIG4. However, no improved editing or targeting efficiencies were detected in ku70D, lig4D, or ku70D/lig4D backgrounds.

Because they can separate metabolic tasks among different strains, synthetic microbial consortia have myriad applications in developing biomaterials, biomanufacturing, and biotherapeutics. However, synthetic consortia often require burdensome control mechanisms to ensure that the members of the community remain at the correct proportions. This is especially true in continuous culture systems in which slight differences in growth rates can lead to extinctions. Here, we present a simple method for controlling consortia proportions using cross-feeding in continuous auxotrophic co-culture. We use mutually auxotrophic \emph{E.\ coli} with different essential gene deletions and regulate the growth rates of members of the consortium via cross-feeding of the missing nutrients in each strain. We demonstrate precise regulation of the co-culture steady-state ratio by exogenous addition of the missing nutrients. We also model the co-culture's behavior using a system of ordinary differential equations that enable us to predict its response to changes in nutrient concentrations. Our work provides a powerful tool for consortia proportion control with minimal metabolic costs to the constituent strains.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

A critical aspect of this defence relies on regulatory mechanisms that control the activation of immune responses, ensuring these are efficient yet do not compromise overall plant performance. Many pathogens secrete proteins called effectors to manipulate plant cellular functions, suppressing plant immunity and promoting infection. Here, we show that the bacterial effector RipAV, secreted by the soil-borne bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, hijacks a major immune signalling hub to suppress immune responses. RipAV targets members of the plant-specific ubiquitin ligase (PUB) family and calcium-dependent protein kinase 28 (CPK28), which has been shown to phosphorylate a set of PUBs to enhance their activity and regulate the stability of the key immune regulator BIK1. RipAV association enhances the CPK28-mediated phosphorylation of PUBs, inducing the proteasome-mediated degradation of BIK1 and the suppression of immunity. Importantly, we found that RipAV is required for maintaining a low accumulation of BIK1 during a R. solanacearum infection. These findings provide new insights into the sophisticated strategies employed by pathogens to subvert plant immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

These cognitive impairments, however, are transient when they first appear and can fluctuate across disease progression. Here, we investigate the neural mechanisms underlying fluctuations of performance in amnestic mice. We trained APP/PS1+ mice on an auditory go/no-go task that dissociated learning of task contingencies (knowledge) from its more variable expression under reinforcement (performance). APP/PS1+ exhibited significant performance deficits compared to control mice. Using large-scale two-photon imaging of 6,216 excitatory neurons in 8 mice, we found that auditory cortical networks were more suppressed, less selective to the sensory cues, and exhibited aberrant higher-order encoding of reward prediction compared to control mice. A small sub-population of neurons, however, displayed the opposite phenotype, reflecting a potential compensatory mechanism. Volumetric analysis demonstrated that deficits were concentrated near A{beta} plaques. Strikingly, we found that these cortical deficits were reversed almost instantaneously on probe (non-reinforced) trials when APP/PS1+ performed as well as control mice, providing neural evidence for intact stimulus-action knowledge despite variable ongoing performance. A biologically-plausible reinforcement learning model recapitulated these results and showed that synaptic weights from sensory-to-decision neurons were preserved (i.e. intact stimulus-action knowledge) despite poor performance that was due to inadequate contextual scaling (i.e. impaired performance). Our results suggest that the amnestic phenotype is transient, contextual, and endogenously reversible, with the underlying neural circuits retaining the underlying stimulus-action associations. Thus, memory deficits commonly observed in amnestic mouse models, and potentially at early stages of dementia in humans, relate more to contextual drivers of performance rather than degeneration of the underlying memory traces.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

To address this, we tagged engram cells in the auditory cortex during tone fear conditioning and compared their dendritic and somatic properties with neighbouring non-engram cells. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we show that tuft dendrites of engram cells had dampened, but synchronous, activity during recall. Ex vivo patch-clamp recordings illustrated that engram cells were preferentially connected with neighbouring engram cells and had decreased excitability due to a transient increase in Ih current.

Together with slow oscillations (SOs), they are thought to play a mechanistic role in the consolidation of learned information. The quantity and spatial distribution of spindles has been linked to brain activity during learning before sleep and to memory performance after sleep. If spindles are drawn to cortical areas excited through pre-sleep learning tasks, this begs the question whether the spatial distribution of spindles is flexible, and whether their regional expression can also be manipulated with experimental brain stimulation. We used excitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to stimulate the left and right motor cortex in a repeated-measures experimental design. After stimulation, we recorded high-density electroencephalography (EEG) during sleep to test how local stimulation modulated the regional expression of sleep spindles. Indeed, we show that excitatory tDCS of local cortical sites before sleep biases the expression of spindles to the excited locations during subsequent sleep. No effects of localised tDCS excitation were seen for SOs. These results demonstrate that the spatial topography of sleep spindles is neither hard-wired nor random, with spindles being flexibly directed to exogenously excited cortical circuits.

Recent work shows the spatial distribution of spindles mirrors cortical activation patterns during learning. If spindles are preferentially expressed at cortical sites engaged during prior waking, the question arises whether spindles can be directed by inducing excitation exogenously with non-invasive brain stimulation. Here, we applied anodal-tDCS to either left or right motor areas before a nap. Indeed, we found that spindle (and not SO) rates are greater at cortical sites excited by tDCS. This result suggests the spatial distribution of spindles is flexible and is sensitive to experimental excitatory stimulation. This has implications for targeted rehabilitation of specific cortical areas and for developing sleep-based brain- computer interfaces.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

Synthetic promoters (SPs) designed to respond to the desired TFs can provide this regulation with compactness, specificity, and orthogonality. T cells display differentially expressed TFs according to the functional state. In solid tumors, the highly immunosuppressive TME and the chronic exposure to antigens lead to a progression of T cells from a functional to a dysfunctional state known as exhaustion (Tex), in which their power against cancer cells is strongly compromised. Importantly, this transition is accompanied by a marked increase of several TFs, among other factors, that drive targeted genetic programs. Strategies to detect and mitigate Tex are extremely needed. Here, we design SPs that respond to TFs differentially expressed in activated and exhausted T cells to enable new classifiers of the functional/dysfunctional states. We developed a library of over 80 SPs responsive to 7 TFs. The SPs showed broad strength of activation of reporter genes or immunomodulatory molecules in HEK293 and Jurkat T cell lines. Moreover, using a transfer learning strategy we show SPs strength predictability. By combining SPs responding to different TFs, we created Boolean logic gates and implemented a feed-forward design that was previously shown to reduce noise in the OFF-state. Finally, as proof of principle, we demonstrate the dynamic activation of the NR4A2-responsive SP according to the T cell state in primary human CD8+ T cells. Collectively we present a sensing platform that provides a versatile tool to study and monitor the dynamic changes occurring in T cells. In perspective the biosensors coupled to therapeutic genes can be used to reprogram the TME and reinvigorate the T cell anti-tumoral functionality, preventing or reverting the exhausted phenotype.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

This process is known as higher-order conditioning and can be measured using sensory preconditioning tasks in rodents. This behavioral paradigm requires the repeated and simultaneous presentation of two low-salience stimuli, such as a light and a tone, followed by a devaluation phase where one stimulus is paired with an unconditioned stimulus, such as a mild footshock. The outcome is a conditioned response (i.e. freezing response) to both the conditioned stimulus (direct learning) and the non-conditioned stimulus (mediated learning). In our study, we set up a successful light-tone sensory preconditioning task in male and female mice. Sex differences were seen on the number of conditioning sessions required to acquire mediated learning and in the behavioral responses observed in certain control experimental groups. We used in vivo calcium imaging to characterize the activity of hippocampal neurons in the dorsal and ventral subregions of the hippocampus when associations between low-salience stimuli and reinforcers occur. Finally, we combined our sensory preconditioning task with chemogenetic approaches to assess the role of these two hippocampal subregions in mediated learning. Our results indicate that dorsal, but not ventral, CaMKII-positive cells mediate the encoding of low-salience stimuli during the preconditioning phase. Overall, we implemented a novel light-tone sensory preconditioning protocol in mice that allowed us to detect sex differences and to further elucidate the role of particular hippocampal subregions and cell types in regulating these complex cognitive processes.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

Furthermore, it is unclear whether this learned activity pattern causally drives the learned movement. We addressed these issues using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging combined with holographic optogenetic stimulation of specific ensembles of M1 L2/3 neurons in mice engaged in a skilled lever-press task. We briefly and synchronously stimulated [~]20 neurons whose activity onset in voluntary trials precedes movement onsets. This stimulation, despite lacking temporal patterns, induced movements that resembled the learned movement, while producing spatiotemporal activity patterns in other M1 neurons not directly stimulated that resembled the activity during the voluntary learned movement. Trial-by-trial variability of optogenetically triggered population activity in the non-target neurons correlated with the variability in the induced movements. These trial-by-trial variabilities were predicted by the initial state of M1 population activity immediately preceding the optogenetic stimulation. Stimulation of the neurons whose activity followed voluntary movement onsets failed to induce the learned movement. Thus, the learned activity pattern in M1 L2/3 can be generated when the M1 network is prepared at the optimal initial state and receives precise triggering inputs, supporting the active role of M1 in learned activity generation. The resulting activity pattern then causally drives the learned movement.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

Here, we extend a new class of biosensors for receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity, the pYtag system, to visualize endogenous RTK activity in Drosophila. We build biosensors for three Drosophila RTKs that function across developmental stages and tissues. By characterizing Torso::pYtag during terminal patterning in the early embryo, we find that Torso activity differs from downstream ERK activity in two surprising ways: Torso activity is narrowly restricted to the poles but produces a broader gradient of ERK, and Torso activity decreases over developmental time while ERK activity is sustained. This decrease in Torso activity is driven by ERK pathway-dependent negative feedback. Our results suggest an updated model of terminal patterning where a narrow domain of Torso activity, tuned in amplitude by negative feedback, locally activates signaling effectors which diffuse through the syncytial embryo to form the ERK gradient. Altogether, this work highlights the usefulness of pYtags for investigating receptor-level regulation of developmental patterning.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) are a major class of plant Ca2+ channels, with 20 homologs in Arabidopsis. These tetrameric plasma membrane (PM) proteins are activated by diverse stimuli, such as phytohormones, extracellular damage and cell wall integrity signals. Here, we identify a novel class of plant-specific proteins, Armadillo Repeat Only (ARO), as essential regulators of possibly all plant CNGC channels. Abrogation of functional sporophytic AROs results in a phenotypic pattern reminiscent of CNGC dysfunction, including defects in root gravitropism, root hair growth and morphology, stomatal movement, and responses to extracellular ATP and the phytohormone auxin. aro2/3/4 mutants are fully resistant to the toxic effects caused by overexpression of CNGCs. AROs colocalize and physically interact with multiple CNGCs and modulate CNGC-dependent currents in Xenopus oocytes.

Current methods for quantifying bacterial biomass in stool, such as flow cytometry, qPCR, or spike-ins (i.e., adding cells or DNA from an organism not normally found in a sample), can be labor-intensive, costly, and confounded by factors like water content, DNA extraction efficiency, PCR inhibitors, and other technical challenges that add bias and noise. We propose a simple, cost-effective approach that circumvents some of these technical challenges: directly estimating bacterial biomass from metagenomes using bacterial-to-host (B:H) read ratios. We compare B:H ratios to the standard methods outlined above, demonstrating that B:H ratios are useful proxies for bacterial biomass in stool and possibly in other host-associated substrates. We show how B:H ratios can be used to track antibiotic treatment response and recovery in both mice and humans, which showed 403-fold and 45-fold reductions in bacterial biomass during antibiotic treatment, respectively. Our results indicate that host and bacterial metagenomic DNA fractions in human stool fluctuate longitudinally around a stable mean in healthy individuals, and the average host read fraction varies across healthy individuals by < 8-9 fold. B:H ratios offer a convenient alternative to other absolute biomass quantification methods, without the need for additional measurements, experimental design considerations, or machine learning algorithms, enabling retrospective absolute biomass estimates from existing stool metagenomic data.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

Differential diagnosis is complicated in children and adolescents by their overlapping clinical features (signs, symptoms, and complete blood count results). Few studies have directly compared the three diseases. We assessed clinical features of cases aged 2-17 years experiencing these diseases.

MethodsWe characterized 1,405 dengue, 517 chikungunya, and 522 Zika pediatric cases occurring from January 2006 through December 2023 in a Nicaraguan cohort study. Clinical records and laboratory results across the first 10 days of illness were examined from a primary care health center. All cases were laboratory-confirmed. Data were analyzed with generalized additive models, generalized mixed models, and machine learning models.

FindingsThe prevalence of many clinical features exhibited by dengue, chikungunya, and Zika cases differed substantially overall, by age, and by day of illness. Dengue cases were differentiated most by abdominal pain, leukopenia, nausea/vomiting, and basophilia; chikungunya cases were differentiated most by arthralgia and the absence of leukopenia and papular rash; and Zika cases were differentiated most by rash and lack of fever and lymphocytopenia. Dengue and chikungunya cases exhibited similar temperature dynamics during acute illness, and their temperatures were higher than Zika cases. Sixty-two laboratory-confirmed afebrile dengue cases, which would not be captured by any widely used international case definition, presented very similarly to afebrile Zika cases, though some exhibited warning signs of disease severity. The presence of arthralgia, the presence of basophilia, and the absence of fever were the most important model-based predictors of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika, respectively.

InterpretationsThese findings substantially update our understanding of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in children while identifying various clinical features that could improve differential diagnoses. The occurrence of afebrile dengue warrants reconsideration of current case definitions.

Research in contextEvidence before this study: Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are mosquito-borne diseases that co-occur in tropical and subtropical settings and give rise to fever, rash, and a variety of other clinical features. We reviewed the most widely used international case definitions for the three diseases - established by either the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO); PAHOs 2022 report on differential diagnosis and treatment options for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika; and the 80 studies underlying PAHOs diagnostic recommendations. The available evidence suggests that dengue, chikungunya, and Zika have a broad and overlapping set of clinical manifestations that hamper differential diagnosis, and hence case management, in the absence of definitive laboratory testing. This similarity in disease presentation is believed to be especially characteristic of the first few days of illness. Most of the studies on the diseases clinical manifestations are in adult populations, and these studies constitute the main evidence base for the existing case definitions. For example, only one of the 80 studies summarized in PAHOs recent report provided direct comparisons of the clinical features across cases experiencing dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, and that study mainly focused on adults. Disease presentation is more non-specific in children and adolescents than in adults, further impeding differential diagnoses in pediatric populations. Current guidelines suggest that the presence of thrombocytopenia, progressive increases in hematocrit, and leukopenia tend to distinguish dengue from chikungunya and Zika; that arthralgia is more common in chikungunya; and that pruritis is more common in Zika. Fever is considered a defining feature of dengue, such that all case definitions in widespread use for the disease require that patients exhibit fever. However, existing but limited evidence suggests that dengue cases can very rarely present without fever.

Added value of this study: This study follows a cohort of Nicaraguan children through multiple dengue epidemics, two large chikungunya epidemics, and one explosive Zika epidemic. By synthesizing 18 years worth of primary care medical records, we find clinically meaningful differences in the prevalence of many clinical features, including by day of illness and across age, but not by sex. In addition to verifying the clinical features PAHO identified as key distinguishing features, we also identified others, including papular rash, nausea, hemorrhagic manifestations, abdominal pain, and basophilia, that could aid differential diagnoses. As the PAHO report is based on a multitude of studies with varied age ranges, health care accessibility, overall research quality, and patient populations, this study is a complementary and important counterpart that draws from a single, well-characterized source population.

Further, we identified 62 laboratory-confirmed cases of afebrile dengue (7{middle dot}2% of all dengue cases since we started testing any suspected case exhibiting afebrile rash). The disease manifestations of afebrile dengue cases were generally clinically indistinguishable from afebrile Zika, although several displayed warning signs of severity. We found that cases of the three diseases exhibited different temperature dynamics across the acute period of illness. Machine learning models were best able to distinguish chikungunya (an alphaviral disease) from dengue and Zika (flaviviral diseases) based on clinical features alone. Our dengue model performed well, especially in classifying febrile dengue cases. However, our Zika model struggled to properly distinguish afebrile dengue cases from afebrile Zika cases, likely due to their very similar and minimal disease presentation.

Implications of all the available evidence: Despite clinical overlap in the pediatric manifestations of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, we identify meaningful differences in their presentation and in laboratory markers that can be leveraged to improve diagnoses in the absence of definitive laboratory-based diagnostic testing. Afebrile dengue should be studied more and incorporated into future case definitions, as not accounting for its existence can impede surveillance, laboratory testing strategies, clinical management, and research efforts.","NA","medrxiv",1736546911478

Recent work has implicated three brain areas in posterior cerebral cortex -- the place memory areas (PMAs) that are anterior to the three visual scene perception areas (SPAs) - in this function. However, PMAs relationship to the broader cortical hierarchy remains unclear due to limited group-level characterization. Here, we examined the PMA and SPA locations across three fMRI datasets (44 participants, 29 female). SPAs were identified using a standard visual localizer where participants viewed scenes versus faces. PMAs were identified by contrasting activity when participants recalled personally familiar places versus familiar faces (Datasets 1-2) or places versus multiple categories (familiar faces, bodies, and objects, and famous faces; Dataset 3). Across datasets, the PMAs were located anterior to the SPAs on the ventral and lateral cortical surfaces. The anterior displacement between PMAs and SPAs was highly reproducible. Compared to public atlases, the PMAs fell at the boundary between externally-oriented networks (dorsal attention) and internally-oriented networks (default mode). Additionally, while SPAs overlapped with retinotopic maps, the PMAs were consistently located anterior to mapped visual cortex. These results establish the anatomical position of the PMAs at inflection points along the cortical hierarchy between unimodal sensory and transmodal, apical regions, which informs broader theories of how the brain integrates perception and memory for scenes. We have released probabilistic parcels of these regions to facilitate future research into their roles in spatial cognition.

Significance statementComplex behavior requires the dynamic interplay between mnemonic and perceptual information. For example, navigation requires representation of the current visual scene and its relationship to the surrounding visuospatial context. We have suggested that the place memory areas, three brain areas located anterior to the scene perception areas in visual cortex, are well-positioned to serve this role. Here, in a large group of participants, we show that the place memory areas are robustly localizable, and that their position at the interface of multiple distributed brain networks is uniquely suited to mnemonic-perceptual integration. We have released probabilistic regions-of-interest and localization procedure so that others can identify these areas in their own participants.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

We explored the non-linear cooperation dynamics among the three main populations of ipsilaterally projecting spinal CPG neurons - V1, V2a, V2b neurons - in scratch reflex rhythmogenesis. Ablation of all three neuronal subtypes reduced the oscillation frequency. Activation of excitatory V2a neurons enhanced the oscillation frequency, while activating inhibitory V1 neurons caused atonia. These findings required the development of a novel neuromechanical model that consists of flexor and extensor modules coupled via inhibition, in which rhythm in each module is generated by self-bursting excitatory populations and accelerated by intra-module inhibition. Inter-module inhibition coordinates the phases of flexor and extensor activity and slows the oscillations, while facilitation mechanisms in excitatory neurons explain the V2a activation-driven increase in frequency.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

Methodological uncertainties currently limit the interpretability of non-invasive, extracranial traveling wave data, sparking debates about their cortical origin. Studies using EEG or MEG typically report waves that cover large portions of the sensor array which are often interpreted as reflecting long range cortical waves. Meanwhile, invasive, intracranial recordings in humans and animals routinely find both local, mesoscopic waves and large scale, macroscopic waves in cortex. Whether the global sensor-array waves found with EEG/MEG necessarily correspond to macroscopic cortical waves or whether they are merely projections of local dynamics remains unclear. In this study, we made use of the well-established retinotopic organization of early visual cortex to generate traveling waves with known properties in human participants (N=19, m/f) via targeted visual stimulation, while simultaneously recording MEG and EEG. The inducer stimuli were designed to elicit waves whose traveling direction in mesoscopic retinotopic visual areas depends on stimulus direction, while leaving macroscopic activation patterns along the visual hierarchy largely unchanged. We observed that the preferred direction of traveling waves across the sensor array was influenced by that of the visual stimulus, but only at the stimulation frequency. Comparison between single-trial and trial-averaged responses further showed considerable temporal variation in traveling wave patterns across trials. Our results highlight that under tight experimental control, non-invasive, extracranial recordings can recover mesoscopic traveling wave activity, thus making them viable tools for the investigation of spatially constrained wave dynamics.

Significant statementNon-invasively obtained time-resolved neuroimaging data is often thought to primarily reflect neural dynamics on the largest spatial scales. In the context of cortical traveling waves, this assumption can lead to a misinterpretation of spatio-temporal patterns observed in the sensor array. We here show that it is in principle possible that the global sensor array data is dominated by spatially constrained, local cortical traveling wave activity. Our findings crucially inform the ongoing discussion about the origin of traveling waves observed in surface recordings.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

Phylogenomic investigation supported the division of SAR116 into three distinct subclades, each with additional structure totalling 15 monophyletic groups. Our SAR116 isolates belonged to three groups within subclade I representing distinct genera with different morphologies and varied phenotypic responses to salinity and temperature. Overall, SAR116 genomes encoded differences in vitamin and amino acid synthesis, trace metal transport, and osmolyte synthesis and transport. They also had genetic potential for diverse sulfur oxidation metabolisms, placing SAR116 at the confluence of the organic and inorganic sulfur pools.

Bioinformatic algorithms are widely used to analyze next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, but they face two major challenges. First, these pipelines are highly complex, involving multiple steps and the integration of various tools. Second, they generate features that are human-interpretable but often result in information loss by focusing only on predefined genetic properties. This limitation restricts the full potential of NGS data in biomarker extraction and slows the discovery of new biomarkers in precision oncology. Methods: We propose an end-to-end deep learning (DL) approach for analyzing NGS data. Specifically, we developed a multiple instance learning DL framework that integrates somatic mutation sequences to predict two compound biomarkers: microsatellite instability (MSI) and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). To achieve this, we utilized data from 3,184 cancer patients obtained from two public databases: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Clinical Proteome Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). Results: Our proposed deep learning method demonstrated high accuracy in identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. For predicting MSI status, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.98, a sensitivity of 0.95, and a specificity of 1.00 on an external validation cohort. For predicting HRD status, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.80, a sensitivity of 0.75, and a specificity of 0.86. Furthermore, the deep learning approach significantly outperformed traditional machine learning methods in both tasks (MSI accuracy, p-value = 5.11x10-18; HRD accuracy, p-value = 1.07x10-10). Using explainability techniques, we demonstrated that the model's predictions are based on biologically meaningful features, aligning with key DNA damage repair mutation signatures. Conclusion: We demonstrate that deep learning can identify patterns in unfiltered somatic mutations without the need for manual feature extraction. This approach enhances the detection of actionable targets and paves the way for developing NGS-based biomarkers using minimally processed data.

We evaluated the performance of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) guided by prompt instructions and chain of thought (CoT) for this task.

MethodsFrom consecutive transthoracic echocardiographies performed in our center, we utilized 200 random reports from 2019 for prompt optimization and 1000 from 2023 for evaluation. Five instruction-tuned LLMs (Qwen2.0-72B, Llama3.0-70B, Mixtral8-46.7B, Llama3.0-8B, and Phi3.0-3.8B) were guided by prompt instructions with and without CoT to classify prosthetic valve presence and VHD severity. Performance was evaluated using classification metrics against expert-labeled ground truth. Mean Squared Error (MSE) was also calculated for predicted severitys deviation from actual severity.

ResultsWith CoT prompting, Llama3.0-70B and Qwen2.0 achieved the highest performance (accuracy: 99.1% and 98.9% for VHD severity; 100% and 99.9% for prosthetic valve; MSE: 0.02 and 0.05, respectively). Smaller models showed lower accuracy for VHD severity (54.1-85.9%) but maintained high accuracy for prosthetic valve detection (>96%). CoT reasoning yielded higher accuracy for larger models while increasing processing time from 2-25 to 67-154 seconds per report. Based of CoT reasonings, the wrong predictions were mainly due to model outputs being influenced by irrelevant information in the text or failure to follow the prompt instructions.

ConclusionsOur study demonstrates the near-perfect performance of open-source LLMs for automated echocardiography report interpretation with purpose of registry formation and disease surveillance. While larger models achieved exceptional accuracy through prompt optimization, practical implementation requires balancing performance with computational efficiency.","NA","medrxiv",1736546911478

However, due to the non-linear relationship between disease liability and disease prevalence, risk variants have more severe phenotypic consequences in high-risk polygenic backgrounds. Consequently, selecting individuals with appropriate polygenic backgrounds may improve variant characterization experiments, as disease-relevant phenotypes may be masked or revealed in different genomic contexts. Simultaneously, selection has limited power to eliminate risk variants because they have minimal impact in low polygenic risk backgrounds, yet is more powerful with higher polygenicity because more individuals achieve genetic and phenotypic extremes. This dependence on polygenic background means that selection acting on an allele should be modeled as a distribution that differs across populations, time, environments, and individuals rather than as a single value.

Here, we performed high-coverage exome sequencing on 265 samples from 14 GTEx donors sampled for a median of 17.5 tissues per donor (spanning 46 total tissues). Using a novel probabilistic method tailored to the unique structure of our data, we identified 8,470 somatic variants. We leverage our compendium of somatic mutations to quantify the burden of deleterious somatic variants among tissues and individuals, identify molecular features such as chromatin accessibility that exhibit significantly elevated somatic mutation rates, provide novel biological insights into mutational mechanisms, and infer developmental trajectories based on patterns of multi-tissue somatic mosaicism. Our data provides a high-resolution portrait of somatic mutations across genes, tissues, and individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

Two narrow host range plasmids, pbla and pConj, have contributed to ending penicillin and tetracycline therapy, respectively, and undermine current prevention strategies including Doxy-PEP. Here, we investigated the origin and evolution of the beta-lactamase plasmid, pbla. We show that the interplay between pbla and pConj influences their co-occurrence and the spread of pbla in the gonococcal population. We demonstrate that pbla was acquired by the gonococcus on at least two occasions from Haemophilus ducreyi, and describe the subsequent evolutionary pathways taken by the three major pbla variants. Changes that mitigate fitness costs of pbla and the emergence of TEM beta-lactamases which confer increased resistance have contributed to the success of pbla. In particular, TEM-135, which has arisen in certain pbla variants, increases resistance to beta-lactams and only requires one amino acid change to become an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). The evolution of pbla underscores the threat of plasmid-mediated resistance to current therapeutic and preventive strategies against gonococcal infection. Given the close relationship between pbla and pConj, widespread use of Doxy-PEP is likely to promote spread of pConj and pbla, and emergence of plasmid-mediated ESBL in the gonococcus, with dire public health consequences.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

TFs and Mediator contain intrinsically-disordered regions (IDRs) and form phase-separated condensates, but how IDRs control RNAPII function remains poorly understood. Using purified PIC factors, we developed a Real-time In-vitro Fluorescence Transcription assay (RIFT) for second-by-second visualization of RNAPII transcription at hundreds of promoters simultaneously. We show rapid RNAPII activation is IDR-dependent, without condensate formation. For example, the MED1-IDR can functionally replace a native TF, activating RNAPII with similar (not identical) kinetics; however, MED1-IDR squelches transcription as a condensate, but activates as a single-protein. TFs and Mediator cooperatively activate RNAPII bursting and re-initiation and surprisingly, Mediator can drive TF-promoter recruitment, without TF-DNA binding. Collectively, RIFT addressed questions largely intractable with cell-based methods, yielding mechanistic insights about IDRs, condensates, enhancer-promoter communication, and RNAPII bursting that complement live-cell imaging data.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

In this study, we generated monoclonal antibodies from immunised cattle, primarily because of their ability to produce antibodies with ultra-long heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDRH3) domains. Such antibodies have been shown to have potent and cross-reactive neutralisation phenotypes in other virus infections. Following extended immunisation with different forms of spike protein and using single B-cell sorting and phage display techniques, we isolated 33 mAbs, including 10 with ultra-long CDRH3s (>50 amino acids). Of these, mAbs P7 and 99 exhibited remarkable neutralisation breadth and potency. Notably, mAb P7, which possessed an ultra-long CDRH3, neutralised all tested variants, including SARS-CoV-1, with IC50 values ranging from 0.01 {micro}g/mL to 1.06 {micro}g/mL. This antibody was also cross-reactive against a panel of RBDs from diverse sarbecovirus species. Structural studies revealed that mAb 99 targets a region of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein that overlaps with the ACE2 binding site. Although the structure of the P7 Fab-RBD complex was not resolvable, data suggest P7 induces trimer dissociation by binding to an occluded RBD epitope, likely mediated by the extended CDRH3 structure. Syrian hamster challenge experiments, using several VOCs, showed that mAbs P7 and 99 significantly reduced lung viral load. These findings highlight the potential of bovine-derived, especially those possessing ultra-long CDRH3s, as effective therapeutics against current and future sarbecovirus threats.

While we have substantial knowledge of the molecular parts and rules of cytoskeletal assembly, we know less about how structures are remodeled, for example to interconvert centrioles from the ciliary base to the centrosome. To study this in an evolutionary context we use the chytrid fungus, Rhizoclosmatium globosum, a member of the zoosporic fungi which have centrioles and cilia, lost in other fungal lineages. Chytrids undergo reorganization of their microtubule cytoskeleton as they cycle from zoospore to multinucleated coenocyte. We use comparative bioinformatics, RNA sequencing, and expansion microscopy to map the microtubule cytoskeleton over the chytrid lifecycle. We find that when zoospores encyst, cilia are retracted into the cytoplasm and degraded, and centrioles detach but are protected from degradation. A shortened proximal centriole then forms the mitotic centrosome and ultimately elongates to form cilia at the end of the mitotic cycles, driven by a conserved transcriptional program. Thus, structural remodeling of the chytrid centriole is coupled temporally to ciliated stages rather than mitotic cycles, which may serve as a mechanism to tune microtubule organization to meet the needs of different lifecycle stages.","NA","biorxiv",1736546911478

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1736546911478
