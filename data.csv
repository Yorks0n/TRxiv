We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

Central to their energy metabolism is a membrane [ndash]bound, sodium-translocating methyltransferase complex: the Na+ tetrahydromethanopterin:CoM-S [ndash]methyltransferase (Mtr complex), which catalyzes the methyl transfer between two methanogen specific cofactors. This exergonic methyl transfer step is coupled with a vectorial sodium ion transport from the cytoplasm to the cell exterior and is the only energy conserving step in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Here, we present a 2.1 [A] single-particle cryo-EM structure of the full Mtr complex from Methanosarcina mazei. Our structural model encompasses the entire complex, reveals the arrangement of archaea phospholipids, the architecture of the sodium ion binding site, and the structure and interactions of all catalytic subunits. Most strikingly, we discover and characterize MtrI, a previously unannotated small open reading frame (small ORF), encoded protein (<100 aa) conserved across the order of Methanosarcinales. MtrI binds to the cytoplasmic domain of MtrA in response to oxygen exposure, suggesting a role in oxygen stress response and protection. By binding on top of the sodium channel and anchoring to the cobalamid cofactor in MtrA's cytoplasmic domain, MtrI might prevent sodium leakage and inhibit MtrA-CoM turnover. These findings offer new insights into methanogen energy conservation and uncover a potential adaptive response to oxygen exposure, expanding our understanding of methanogen survival strategies under oxidative stress.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312341

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1749161312341

Many centromeres comprise highly variable, megabase-scale satellite DNA arrays, yet the mutation spectrum driving this variability remains poorly understood. Using replicated genome assemblies of six Arabidopsis mutation accumulation lines, we identified centromeric mutations consisting almost exclusively of point mutations and structure-preserving, in-frame indels spanning a few kilobases. Centromeric point mutations occurred at a ninefold higher rate (6.1x10^-8/bp/gen) than in chromosome arms, frequently introduced by non-allelic gene conversions from closely linked repeat units. Forward-in-time simulations based on the observed mutation spectrum recapitulated the emergence of megabase-scale higher-order repeat (HOR) structures, including long-range sequence similarities, without requiring large-scale rearrangements, closely mirroring centromeric divergence among natural genomes. Our results show that centromere evolution is driven by a unique mutational spectrum, providing a quantitative framework to understand how small-scale mutations shape and maintain the large-scale architecture of centromeric DNA.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312341

We devised an experimental evolution model in which we ""replay"" over one hundred instances of a clonally homogenous GC reaction and follow the selective process by assigning affinities to all cells using deep mutational scanning. Our data reveal how GCs achieve predictable evolutionary outcomes through the cumulative effects of many rounds of imperfect selection, acting on a landscape shaped heavily by somatic hypermutation (SHM) targeting biases. Using time-calibrated models, we show that proposed features of GC evolution such as permissiveness to low-affinity lineages and early plateauing of affinity are best explained by survivorship biases that distort our view of how affinity progresses over time.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312341

Here, we report the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein persistence in the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 replication in otherwise healthy individuals, a set of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and a case of a 60-year-old man who developed a new onset of lupus nephritis seven months following mild COVID-19 disease. We have identified that N protein persistence in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) did not correlate with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood but is associated with significantly increased secretion of type I interferons (IFN) and presence of tubuloreticular structures in peripheral leukocytes. We further demonstrate that the N protein colocalizes in the mitochondrial fraction of PBMCs from individuals positive for N protein alongside mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). In vitro expression of the N protein in a monocytic cell line showed that the N protein itself was directly capable of interacting with MAVS in the absence of viral RNA, and this interaction was enhanced if the cell was exposed to oxidative stress. We show that the type I IFN signature in the presence of N protein expression was MAVS, but not STING signaling pathway-dependent. Our findings suggest a mechanism for the onset and promotion of type I IFN signature after COVID-19; in our model, the SARS-CoV-2 N protein can independently trigger sustained type I IFN production via direct activation of MAVS and its spontaneous oligomerization. This long-lasting type I IFN generation may create a chronic inflammatory milieu, favoring autoimmunity with SLE-like symptoms in susceptible individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312341

However, targeting specific cellular features within large, complex organs remains challenging. Here we present a series of technical improvements significantly enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of the Serial Lift-Out and SOLIST (Serialized On-grid Lift-In Sectioning for Tomography) procedures that are revolutionizing the field. We were able to extend the cryo-FIBSEM session from 24 hours to 5 days without interruptions. In addition, we describe a modified silver-plated EasyLiftTM needle that eliminates the need of the copper or gold block between the original tungsten needle and the sample. Moreover, we describe a strategy that significantly reduces curtaining effects. Finally, we report a precise routine to target a lamella with a precision of approximately 1 {micro}m in X,Y and Z. Together, these modifications considerably reduce contamination risk and preparation time, making cryo-lift-out techniques more accessible for routine structural biology applications on any type of tissue. Here, we demonstrate the power of our technique by targeting several specific wall structures that are of crucial importance for root function in plants and that were previously inaccessible to cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). High-pressure freezing (HPF) of plant tissues presents unique challenges for cryo-electron microscopy sample preparation due to the overall sample size, the individual cells size, their rigid cell wall and finally, their large vacuoles, which contain large amounts of rather diluted water solutions compared to cytosol. The internal root structures targeted are the Casparian strip (CS), suberin lamellae (SL), as well as secondary wall of xylem vessels, requiring reaching a targeting precision of 5 m in a 3 mm long and 80-120 m thick root tip. Our technological improvements for the cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM) workflow enabled successful, targeted cryo-ET in plant roots. We noticed that, despite ice formation in vacuoles and to some degree in the cytosol, the plasma membranes and cell walls are remarkably well preserved, providing stunning insights into the native, hydrated nano-structure of plant cell walls, previously only observable with contrasting agents and in a dehydrated state.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312341

Here, we introduce Biomni, a general-purpose biomedical AI agent designed to autonomously execute a wide spectrum of research tasks across diverse biomedical subfields. To systematically map the biomedical action space, Biomni first employs an action discovery agent to create the first unified agentic environment -- mining essential tools, databases, and protocols from tens of thousands of publications across 25 biomedical domains. Built on this foundation, Biomni features a generalist agentic architecture that integrates large language model (LLM) reasoning with retrieval-augmented planning and code-based execution, enabling it to dynamically compose and carry out complex biomedical workflows -- entirely without relying on predefined templates or rigid task flows. Systematic benchmarking demonstrates that Biomni achieves strong generalization across heterogeneous biomedical tasks -- including causal gene prioritization, drug repurposing, rare disease diagnosis, microbiome analysis, and molecular cloning -- without any task-specific prompt tuning. Real-world case studies further showcase Biomni's ability to interpret complex, multi-modal biomedical datasets and autonomously generate experimentally testable protocols. Biomni envisions a future where virtual AI biologists operate alongside and augment human scientists to dramatically enhance research productivity, clinical insight, and healthcare. Biomni is ready to use at https://biomni.stanford.edu, and we invite scientists to explore its capabilities, stress-test its limits, and co-create the next era of biomedical discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312341

However, the richness of such data means that conventional analyses may only scratch its surface. Extracting meaningful insights from these datasets often requires advanced computational methods and domain expertise. Current AI agents for biology are primarily focused on executing user-specified commands and are therefore limited by the user's creativity and familiarity with which kinds of analyses are useful. Furthermore, these agents do not account for prior analyses already attempted by researchers, reducing their ability to build upon existing work. To address these limitations, we introduce CellVoyager, an AI agent that autonomously explores scRNA-seq datasets in novel directions conditioned on prior user-ran analyses. Built on large language models, CellVoyager ingests both the dataset and a record of prior analyses to generate and test new hypotheses within a Jupyter notebook environment. We evaluate CellVoyager on CellBench, a new benchmark based on 50 published scRNA-seq studies encompassing 483 analyses. Given only the background sections of these papers, CellVoyager outperformed GPT-4o and o3-mini by up to 20% in predicting which analyses the authors eventually conducted. We then carried out three in-depth case studies where CellVoyager is given previously published papers with their scRNA-seq datasets and conducts analyses to generate new findings. The original authors of each study evaluated these findings and consistently rated them as creative and sound; 80% of the agent's hypotheses were deemed scientifically interesting. For example, in one case study, the agent found that CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 infection are more primed for pyroptosis, which was not explored by the original researchers. CellVoyager also reanalyzed a brain aging dataset to discover a previously unreported association between increased transcriptional noise and aging in the subventricular zone of the brain. These results demonstrate that CellVoyager can act both autonomously and collaboratively to accelerate hypothesis generation and computational biology. It also highlights the potential of agents like CellVoyager to unlock new biological insights by reanalyzing the vast existing biological data at scale.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312341

Here, we investigated whether virus-induced lipid remodeling is conserved across variants and whether changes in lipid abundance correlate with alterations in lipid biosynthetic enzymes. Using global untargeted lipidomics and quantitative proteomics, we analyzed A549-ACE2 cells infected with the Delta (B.1.617.2) or Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants and compared them to cells infected with the ancestral WA1 strain.

While the majority of paralogous TFs are dispersed across different chromosomes, some remain clustered raising the question of whether genomic proximity confers any evolutionary advantage for TF clusters. To address this, we investigated a [~]1 Mbp locus containing two ETS family paralogs, Ets1 and Fli1. Using a sub-diffraction sequential imaging technique called Optical Reconstruction of Chromatin Architecture (ORCA), we traced the 3D organization of this region in single alleles of T cells from genetically engineered mice with targeted deletions of key regulatory elements. In wild-type T cells, the predominant chromatin conformation spatially links Ets1 to its proximal super-enhancer, segregating Ets1 from Fli1. This topology correlates with high Ets1 and low Fli1 expression. Deletion of the Ets1 super-enhancer abolishes this configuration, triggering locus-wide architectural rewiring that increases Ets1-Fli1 promoter-promoter interactions and subsequently the co-expression of two genes within individual cells. Remarkably, this compensatory interaction bypasses insulated chromatin domains, sustaining Ets1 levels necessary for T cell development despite enhancer loss. Our results reveal that genomic clustering of TF paralogs enables dynamic architectural plasticity: while a super-enhancer fine-tunes paralog expression balance in wild-type contexts, its deletion unmasks latent promoter-driven coordination, suggesting that proximity safeguards functional redundancy and transcriptional resilience critical for cellular fitness.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312341

Transcriptomic aging clocks (TACs) hold great promise for this endeavor, yet most are hampered by platform or tissue specificity and limited accessibility. Here, we introduce Pasta, a robust and broadly applicable TAC based on a novel age-shift learning strategy. Pasta accurately predicts relative age from bulk, single-cell, and microarray data, capturing senescent and stem-like cellular states through signatures enriched in p53 and DNA damage response pathways. Its predictions correlate with tumor grade and patient survival, underscoring clinical relevance. Applied to the CMAP L1000 dataset, Pasta identified known and novel age-modulatory compounds and genetic perturbations, and highlighted mitochondrial translation and mRNA splicing as key determinants of the cellular propensity for aging and rejuvenation, respectively. Supporting Pasta's predictive power, we validated pralatrexate as a potent senescence inducer and piperlongumine as a rejuvenating agent. Strikingly, chemotherapy drugs were highly enriched among pro-aging hits. Taken together, Pasta represents a powerful and generalizable tool for aging research and therapeutic discovery, distributed as an easy-to-use R package on GitHub.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312341

A limitation of existing fly connectome datasets is that most sensory neurons are excised during sample preparation, creating a gap between the central and peripheral nervous systems. Here, we bridge this gap by reconstructing wing sensory axons from the Female Adult Nerve Cord (FANC) EM dataset and mapping them to peripheral sensory structures using genetic tools and light microscopy. We confirm the location and identity of known wing mechanosensory neurons and identify previously uncharacterized axons, including a novel population of putative proprioceptors that make monosynaptic connections onto wing steering motor neurons. We also find that proprioceptors of adjacent campaniform sensilla on the wing have distinct axon morphologies and postsynaptic partners, suggesting a high degree of specialization in axon pathfinding and synaptic partner matching. The peripheral location and central projections of wing sensory neurons are stereotyped across flies, allowing this wing proprioceptor atlas and genetic toolkit to guide analysis of other fly connectome datasets.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312341

This is partly due to a historical view of females occupying a passive role compared with males, which led to ignoring female song even in some well-studied species. We report one such case in yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia), as no other study investigated female song in 35 years after the first documentation of solo female songs. We interrogate the seasonal patterns and functions of female song in Galapagos yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia aureola), in which females perform solo song and produce duets with their male social partners. We carried out simulated territory intrusions by broadcasting male, female, or duet songs during breeding and non-breeding seasons, and conducted a territory retention survey for over a year. We measured the association between aggressive response and singing behaviour, sex-specific patterns of response, and territory retention across years. Females sang mostly during the non-breeding season and predominantly in male-led duets. Although females were strongly aggressive towards female song playback, they gave the weakest singing response towards them. There was no association between female aggressive behaviour and song output in response to a simulated intruder. Moreover, the probability of territory retention across years was not explained by song output or aggression in response to intruders, though evidence for this was weak due to the small sample size. We suggest that female song in this year-round resident island system does not function for territory defense or intrasexual competition, but may have other functions.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312341

We here demonstrate that transfer learning can successfully overcome these limitations by leveraging pre-trained model parameters. Remarkably, this approach can even fit highly performant models to substantially different peptide modifications and LC conditions than those on which the model was originally trained. This impressive adaptability of transfer learning makes it a highly robust solution for accurate peptide retention time prediction across a very wide variety of imaginable proteomics workflows.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312341

In this study, we propose that regions of the language network are coupled to one another through subspaces of shared linguistic features. To test this idea, we developed a model-based connectivity framework to quantify stimulus-driven, feature-specific functional connectivity between language areas during natural language comprehension. Using fMRI data acquired while subjects listened to spoken narratives, we tested three types of features extracted from a unified neural network model for speech and language: low-level acoustic embeddings, mid-level speech embeddings, and high-level language embeddings. Our modeling framework enabled us to quantify the stimulus features that drive connectivity between regions: early auditory areas were coupled to intermediate language areas via lower-level acoustic and speech features; in contrast, higher-order language and default-mode regions were predominantly coupled through more abstract language features. We observed a clear progression of feature-specific connectivity from early auditory to lateral temporal areas, advancing from acoustic connectivity to speech- and finally to language-driven connectivity. These findings suggest that regions of the language network are coupled through feature-specific communication channels to facilitate efficient and context-sensitive language processing.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312341

Surprisingly, the developmental processes underlying gill formation in zebrafish remain poorly understood. Here, we present for the first time a comprehensive analysis of the morphogenesis of gill arteries, filaments and lamellae during lifelong development. Our results provide important insights into the temporal and spatial pattern of gill angiogenesis, revealing fundamental differences in the formation of lateral versus medial filaments along the dorso-ventral axis. These early asymmetries correlate with, and likely underlie, the structural asymmetries observed in adult gills, which we quantitatively characterize. This indicates that a region-specific developmental programme establishes a blueprint for gill architecture maintained throughout life. We further show that lamellae develop through a complex interplay between endothelial and cranial neural crest-derived pillar cells. Notably, lamellar size, which strongly influences respiratory efficiency, depends on the position of the filament in the arch. Together, our work identifies key cellular and temporal mechanisms driving gill development and provides a framework to investigate broader principles of branching morphogenesis and angiogenesis in vertebrates.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312341

A promising set of newer approaches are based on genetic data, which can be cheaper to obtain and less invasive than information from more direct observation. One of these approaches is close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR), a type of method that uses genetic data to identify kin pairs and estimates population size from these pairs. Although CKMR methods are promising, a major limitation to using them more broadly is a lack of CKMR models that can deal with spatial heterogeneity both in population density and sample effort. We introduce a simulation-based approach to CKMR that uses spatially explicit individual-based simulation in concert with a deep convolutional neural network to estimate population sizes. Using extensive simulation, we show that our method, CKMRnn, is highly accurate, even in the face of spatial heterogeneity, and demonstrate that it can account for potential confounders such as unknown population histories. Finally, to demonstrate the accuracy of our method in an empirical system, we apply CKMRnn to data from a Ugandan elephant population, and show that point estimates from our method recapitulate those from traditional estimators but that the confidence interval on our estimator is reduced by approximately 30%.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312341

Critically, Electras demonstrate over 6-fold improved photostability compared to state-of-the-art eFRET GEVIs, pAce, and Ace-mNeon2, under one-photon illumination, while characterized by bright green fluorescence, millisecond kinetics, and good membrane localization. This enhanced stability translates to a 3-to >10-fold extension in functional recording duration, maintaining reliable spike detection in both cultured neurons in vitro and sparsely labeled neurons in the awake mouse cortex in vivo. We demonstrated sustained in vivo recordings exceeding 30 minutes, with instances surpassing one hour. Furthermore, Electras show functionality under scanless two-photon excitation in cultured cells.

Magnetoencephalog- raphy (MEG) is a neuroimaging technique that captures brain activity at high tem- poral resolution. However, its spatial resolution is insufficient to accurately localize neural activation, and thus cannot capture the interactive nature of human brain ac- tivity. To resolve this issue, various MEG source estimation models have been pro- posed. In particular, models incorporating prior information from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which offers superior spatial resolution, have improved source estimation accuracy. However, these models typically ignore the similarity of activity across different brain areas, and still fall short in tracking dynamic brain activity pattern at a sufficient spatial scale. In this study, we developed a block-structured model that integrates information about functional areas and the interareal relationships of the human brain into MEG source estimation based on a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We evaluated our model performance using simulation data with sequential activation across multiple brain areas. Results showed that our model outperformed conventional approaches in source estimation accuracy, suggesting that incorporating the functional areal information and inter-areal relationships may enhance MEG source estimation, enabling human neuroimaging at high spatiotemporal resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312342

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1749161312342

Maximum Likelihood (ML) based phylogenetic inference tools search for the tree and evolutionary model that best explain the observed genomic data. Given the independence of likelihood score calculations between different genomic sites, parallel computation is commonly deployed. This is followed by a parallel summation over the per-site scores to obtain the overall likelihood score of the tree. However, basic arithmetic operations on IEEE 754 floating-point numbers, such as addition and multiplication, inherently introduce rounding errors. Consequently, the order by which floating-point operations are executed affects the exact resulting likelihood value since these operations are not associative. Moreover, parallel reduction algorithms in numerical codes re-associate operations as a function of the core count and cluster network topology, inducing different round-off errors. These low-level deviations can cause heuristic searches to diverge and induce high-level result discrepancies (e.g., yield topologically distinct phylogenies). This effect has also been observed in multiple scientific fields, beyond phylogenetics. Results: We observe that varying the degree of parallelism results in diverging phylogenetic tree searches (high level results) for over 31 % out of 10 130 empirical datasets. More importantly, 8 % of these diverging datasets yield trees that are statistically significantly worse than the best known ML tree for the dataset (AU-test, p < 0.05). To alleviate this, we develop a variant of the widely used phylogenetic inference tool RAxML-NG, which does yield bit-reproducible results under varying core-counts, with a slowdown of only 0 to 12.7 % (median 0.8 %) on up to 768 cores. We further introduce the ReproRed reduction algorithm, which yields bit-identical results under varying core-counts, by maintaining a fixed operation order that is independent of the communication pattern. ReproRed is thus applicable to all associative reduction operations - in contrast to competitors, which are confined to summation. Our ReproRed reduction algorithm only exchanges the theoretical minimum number of messages, overlaps communication with computation, and utilizes fast base-cases for local reductions. ReproRed is able to all-reduce (via a subsequent broadcast) 4.1 {middle dot} 106 operands across 48 to 768 cores in 19.7 to 48.61 {micro}s, thereby exhibiting a slowdown of 13 to 93 % over a non-reproducible all-reduce algorithm. ReproRed outperforms the state-of-the-art reproducible all-reduction algorithm ReproBLAS (offers summation only) beyond 10 000 elements per core. In summary, we re-assess non-reproducibility in parallel phylogenetic inference, present the first bit-reproducible parallel phylogenetic inference tool, as well as introduce a general algorithm and open-source code for conducting reproducible associative parallel reduction operations.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312342

The NLR RPS2 recognizes AvrRpt2, a Pseudomonas effector that promotes virulence by proteolytically cleaving a membrane-tethered host protein, RIN4. RIN4 cleavage by AvrRpt2 generates fragments that activate RPS2. A model for RPS2 activation by RIN4 destruction is consistent with the ectopic activity of RPS2 in plants lacking RIN4 but does not explain the link between the virulence activity of AvrRpt2 and RPS2 activation. We found that non-membrane-tethered RIN4 derivatives are potent cytosolic activators of RPS2. Activation of RPS2 by these RIN4 derivatives, like AvrRpt2-induced activation, and unlike ectopic activation in the absence of RIN4, requires the defense signaling protein NDR1. Cleavage products of RIN4 produced by AvrRpt2 play contrasting roles in the activation of RPS2, with the membrane-tethered C-terminal fragment suppressing RPS2 and the non-membrane-tethered internal fragment, dependent on compatibility with the C-terminal fragment, overcoming its suppression of RPS2.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312342

Substantial variability in gene selection across programs exists, highlighting the need for a systematic approach to prioritize genes.

MethodsWe assembled a dataset comprising 25 characteristics about each of the 4,390 genes included in 27 NBSeq programs. We used regression analysis to identify several predictors of inclusion, and developed a machine learning model to rank genes for public health consideration.

ResultsAmong 27 NBSeq programs, the number of genes analyzed ranged from 134 to 4,299, with only 74 (1.7%) genes included by over 80% of programs. The most significant associations with gene inclusion across programs were presence on the US Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (inclusion increase of 74.7%, CI: 71.0%-78.4%), robust evidence on the natural history (29.5%, CI: 24.6%-34.4%) and treatment efficacy (17.0%, CI: 12.3%- 21.7%) of the associated genetic disease. A boosted trees machine learning model using 13 predictors achieved high accuracy in predicting gene inclusion across programs (AUC = 0.915, R{superscript 2} = 84%).

ConclusionThe machine learning model developed here provides a ranked list of genes that can adapt to emerging evidence and regional needs, enabling more consistent and informed gene selection in NBSeq initiatives.","10.1016/j.gim.2025.101443","medrxiv",1749161312342

However recent findings indicate that approaches to identify enhancers may not capture the full repertoire of active enhancers in mammalian genomes. Here, we combine massively parallel enhancer assays with chromatin structure and transcriptome profiling to functionally annotate enhancers genome-wide in human induced pluripotent stem cells. We find that a substantial fraction ([~]40%) of accessible chromatin regions with enhancer function lack key features associated with active enhancers, including the active enhancer mark histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation and enhancer-associated RNAs. Perturbation of this class of non-canonical enhancers by CRISPR-mediated epigenome editing results in decreased levels of target gene expression and, in one instance, loss of pluripotent stem cell characteristics. Collectively, our data demonstrate enhancer activity for a class of gene regulatory elements that had until now only been associated with a neutral or inactive status, challenging current models of enhancer function.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312342

We identified a unique mechanism employed by insect odorant receptors to discriminate amongst pheromones, chemical communication signals that orchestrate courtship and mating behavior. By coupling cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and functional mutagenesis, we find that males of the silkmoth Bombyx mori distinguish between two quasi-identical compounds -bombykol, an alcohol, and bombykal, an aldehyde- by establishing a reversible covalent bond between the pheromone receptor and bombykal. Bombykol, instead, binds to the same receptor through hydrogen bonds, with significantly lower potency. The unique ability of aldehydes to establish a reversible covalent bond allows moths to unequivocally distinguish between compounds that differ only in the presence of a single hydrogen atom. Further, as many important odorants are aldehydes, this work illuminates a new binding mode available to the olfactory system to achieve high selectivity for these compounds.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312342

Schizophrenia has been associated with impaired nervous system development and an excitation/inhibition imbalance in the prefrontal cortex. On a molecular level, schizophrenia is moderately heritable and genetically complex. Hundreds of risk genes have been identified, spanning a heterogeneous landscape dominated by loci that confer relatively small risk. Bioinformatic analyses of genetic associations point to a limited set of neurons, mainly excitatory cortical neurons, but other analyses suggest the importance of astrocytes and microglia. To understand different cell type roles in schizophrenia and reveal novel cell-type specific aetiologically relevant perturbations in schizophrenia, our study integrated genetic analysis with single nucleus RNA-seq of 536,618 nuclei from postmortem samples of dorsal prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 8/9) of 43 cases with schizophrenia and 42 neurotypical controls. We found no significant difference in cell type abundance. Gene expression in excitatory layer 2-3 intra-telencephalic neurons had the greatest number of differentially expressed transcripts and, together with excitatory deep layer intra-telencephalic neurons, conferred most of the genetic risk for schizophrenia. Most differential expression of genes was found in specific cell types and was dominated by down-regulated transcripts. Down-regulated transcripts were enriched in gene sets including transmembrane transport, mitochondrial function, protein folding, and cell-cell signaling whereas up-regulated transcripts were enriched in gene sets related to RNA processing, including RNA splicing in neurons. Co-regulation network analysis identified 40 schizophrenia-relevant programs across 13 cell types. A gene program largely shared between neuronal subtypes, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes was significantly enriched for schizophrenia risk, supporting an aetiological role for perturbed protein modification, ion transport, and mitochondrial function. These results were largely consistent with cell-type expression quantitative trait locus and transcriptome-wide association analyses. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing results, most prominently mitochondrial dysfunction, had multiple points of convergence with proteomic and long-read RNA sequencing results from samples from the same donors. Our study integrates genetic analysis with transcriptomics to reveal novel cell-type specific aetiologically relevant perturbations in schizophrenia.","NA","medrxiv",1749161312342

We used mouse mating behavior to model how the brain orchestrates slow-timescale changes in motivation. Male mice become sexually satiated after successful matings, and their motivation to mate gradually recovers over a week. Using deep-brain fluorescence-lifetime imaging in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), we found that tonic dopamine transmission--which regulates mating drive--also declined after mating and re-emerged over a week. Two mechanisms regulated dopamine transmission. First, successful mating transiently reduced tonic firing of hypothalamic dopamine-releasing neurons, thereby inhibiting dopamine release and mating behavior. Second, mating reduced the ability of these neurons to produce and release dopamine, and this ability gradually returned over the week-long recovery time course. Therefore, fast and slow mechanisms of neuronal plasticity cooperate to control the early and late phases of motivational dynamics, respectively.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312342

Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) already supplies nitrogen to legume crops and several avenues of research are underway to extend it to non-legume crops. In maize (Zea mays), aerial roots have been shown to contribute to BNF in some varieties, and both having many aerial roots and large aerial roots contributes to the fixation trait. However, much of the genetics controlling aerial root number and size is still unknown. Here we validate and quantify BNF in maize varieties from Southern Mexico under controlled conditions and evaluate a population of double haploids derived from the elite inbred PHZ51 crossed with these varieties. We find that most aerial root traits (root number, nodes with roots, root size) are reasonably heritable (h2 0.5-0.75) and generally uncorrelated with each other. QTL mapping identifies 5 QTL each affecting nodes with aerial roots and aerial root number per node; in both cases all but 1 QTL show an increase from the landrace allele. We also identify 11 QTL for aerial root diameter, with most positive QTL coming from PHZ51. Between the two populations, only a few QTL overlap, indicating a presumably high diversity of genes affecting aerial root morphology in landrace populations. Combining the best QTL into elite material may provide a path toward meaningful levels of BNF for maize, and additional work is needed to determine how viable this approach will be in field settings.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312342

We hypothesize that semantic memories are altered in a similar way when retrieval draws on a core dimension of conceptual knowledge: semantic granularity. Each level--from accessing a concept via unique perceptual features to its thematic context--shapes the retrieval route used to access semantic memories. This study tests whether semantic granularities used to retrieve a concept influences its reactivation during later recognition. Human participants learned and retrieved novel word-image pairs while undergoing fMRI. Following encoding, items were retrieved via one of three semantic levels: item, category, or theme. Later, participants accessed the memories in recognition and cued recall tests. Although behavioral memory performance was matched across conditions, neural activity during recognition varied based on prior retrieval history. Recognition patterns could be classified according to prior retrieval granularity in ventral temporal cortex for both remembered and non-remembered concepts, and in the hippocampus for remembered concepts only. A whole-brain searchlight analysis revealed bilateral clusters along the ventral visual stream, from early visual cortex to fusiform gyrus, where retrieval history was decodable. Representational similarity analyses showed that category-level retrieval increased pattern consistency in early visual cortex and pattern reactivation in ventral temporal cortex, while item-level retrieval enhanced memory trace distinctiveness in visual word form area. Theme-level retrieval increased activity in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings show that how we access a concept leaves a detectable trace on subsequent neural reactivation, subtly shaping how conceptual knowledge is organized in the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1749161312342

We aimed to compare Germany-wide characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized adults with diabetes in diabetes certified vs. non-diabetes certified hospitals.

MethodsWe analyzed in the German Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) statistics for 2021-2023 all inpatient cases aged [&ge;] 20 years with and without diabetes (all types) as a main or secondary diagnosis based on ICD-10 codes. Using Wilcoxon and Chi2-tests, characteristics of inpatient cases with diabetes were compared between diabetes certified hospitals (n=300) and non-diabetes certified hospitals (n=1,103).

ResultsOf 43.4 million total inpatient cases in the period from 2021 to 2023, 8.1 million (18.5%) had a documented diabetes diagnosis (94% of the cases as secondary diagnosis). In certified hospitals, 19.0% of inpatient cases had diabetes compared to 18.3% in non-certified hospitals. Although inpatient cases with diabetes had more hospital-acquired and procedure-related complications (17.2% vs. 16.7%, p<0.001), as well as higher rates of hypoglycemia (3.2% vs. 2.1%, p<0.001) and metabolic disorder (diabetic ketoacidosis: 0,5% vs. 0,4%; acute metabolic disorder with multiple complications: 2.3% vs. 1.0%, p<0.001) in certified hospitals vs. non-certified hospitals, in-hospital mortality for all diabetes cases was similar (4.5% in both). However, among those with diabetes as the main diagnosis, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in diabetes certified hospitals (type 1 diabetes: 0.6% vs. 1.1% and type 2 diabetes: 2.3% vs. 2.9%, both p<0.001), despite a higher complication burden.

ConclusionsHospitalized people with diabetes as the main diagnosis had lower in-hospital mortality in diabetes-certified hospitals, even though they had a higher disease burden. These findings suggest that expanded use of DDG-certified departments, including consultation services for patients whose diabetes is a secondary diagnosis, may further improve clinical outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1749161312342

We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo-Dropout CNN (MCD-CNN), as well as a few-shot learning approach to address dataset size limitations. Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1749161312342

We demonstrate the real world implications of the use of testing and evaluate adverse events and outcomes in individuals who did not receive pharmacogenomic testing for clopidogrel.

MethodsWe analyzed ~100K individuals with paired EHR and exome sequencing data from population health studies administered at multiple medical centers using the Helix Exome+(R) assay. We inferred clopidogrel dosage by processing the prescription with an LLM. We identified all instances of individuals with at least one prescription that is not in concordance with their CYP2C19 genotype. Lastly, we identify instances of thrombosis using a comprehensive codeset based on ICD9, ICD10, and SNOMED terms.

ResultsWe identified 16,140 prescriptions of clopidogrel given to 3,853 participants. We found that 29% of these individuals have a mismatch between the recommended clopidogrel dosage guideline based on their CYP2C19 genotype and their actual prescribed daily dosage. 25% of poor metabolizers experienced thrombosis, with 40% occurring within 2 months of treatment. Poor and intermediate metabolizers receiving clopidogrel are much more likely to experience thrombosis and myocardial infarction (binomial p-value = 0.001).

ConclusionsWe estimate a 38% excess of adverse events occur in poor and intermediate metabolizers relative to normal and rapid metabolizers. The lack of testing may be responsible for 1 thrombosis event per every ~30 people prescribed clopidogrel.","NA","medrxiv",1749161312342

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.

The pathogenesis of LC is incompletely understood. In this study, we performed comprehensive cellular and transcriptional immunometabolic profiling within a cohort that included SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (NC, N=30) and individuals with prior COVID-19 ([~]4-months) who fully recovered (RC, N=38) or went on to experience Long COVID symptoms (N=58). Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing. Our findings support a profound and persistent immunometabolic dysfunction that follows SARS-CoV-2 which may form the pathophysiologic substrate for LC. Our findings suggest that trials of therapeutics that help restore immune and metabolic homeostasis may be warranted to prevent, reduce, or resolve LC symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1749161312342
