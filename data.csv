To date, the only species with complete connectomes are worms1-3 and squirts4 (103-104 synapses). By contrast, the fruit fly is more complex (108 synaptic connections), with a brain that supports learning and spatial memory5,6 and an intricate ventral nerve cord analogous to the vertebrate spinal cord7-11. Here we report the first adult fly connectome that unites the brain and ventral nerve cord, and we leverage this resource to investigate principles of neural control. We show that effector cells (motor neurons, endocrine cells and efferent neurons targeting the viscera) are primarily influenced by local sensory cells in the same body part, forming local feedback loops. These local loops are linked by long-range circuits involving ascending and descending neurons organized into behavior-centric modules. Single ascending and descending neurons are often positioned to influence the voluntary movements of multiple body parts, together with endocrine cells or visceral organs that support those movements. Brain regions involved in learning and navigation supervise these circuits. These results reveal an architecture that is distributed, parallelized and embodied (tightly connected to effectors), reminiscent of distributed control architectures in engineered systems12,13.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01NS121874;RF1MH117808;U24NS126935;RF1MH117815;U19NS118246;K99NS129759;R00NS117657;R01NS102333;RF1NS128785;UM1NS132253;U24NS139927;RF1MH128840;R01NS121911;U01NS131438;T32GM144273;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""222782/Z/21/Z;""},{""name"":""Richard and Susan Smith Family Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05j95n956"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Smith Family Odyssey Award;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PJ100000343;GT15790;HHMI Investigator;""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Robertson Neuroscience Investigator Award;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ZA1296/1-1;EXC2151-390873048;PA787/7-3;PA787/9-3;""},{""name"":""NV INBRE"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GM103440;""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2127379;2014862;""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""KAKENHI 25K00370;""},{""name"":""Japan Science and Technology Agency"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00097mb19"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ASPIRE JPMJAP2302;CRONOS JPMJCS24K2;""},{""name"":""Max Planck Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01hhn8329"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Shanahan Family Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Alice and Joseph Brooks Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754345412035

To inform new global conservation policy, Shaw et al.1 conducted a meta-analysis of temporal genetic diversity data for over 600 wild species spanning a median of 7 years, reporting significant overall diversity loss of effect size g = -0.1. My re-analysis translating this effect to percentage change finds no robust statistical support for consistent decline, with overall changes near zero: from -1% to +1% diversity change depending on the averaging method. When testing each species individually, roughly half increased and half decreased in diversity. While genetic diversity is expected to decline following population losses, evolutionary theory predicts such declines substantially lag behind population reductions, and thus should not be measurable on average at the timescales in Shaw's data, except in dramatically collapsing species. However, conservation policy should not wait for consistently measurable genetic diversity loss--to avoid future lagging losses, we must protect populations now.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754345412035

Hypotheses for such computations include predictive coding, predictive routing, efficient coding, and others. However, single-neuron recordings capture only the individual elements of the hypothesized laminar microcircuit, while local field potentials (LFPs) from a laminar probe offer insight into the broader population activity. Through the Allen Institutes OpenScope Brain Observatory, data in mice performing a visual oddball task during multi-area laminar recording was used to test predictive processing hypotheses in the spectral domain. Histological labeling of the cortical laminae enabled a fine-grained examination of their roles in the task, and frequency bands capturing both feedforward and feedback effects were analyzed. {gamma}-band local-field potential (LFP) oscillations conveyed feedforward prediction errors in lower sensory areas of cortex; /{beta}-band oscillations weakened in unpredictable conditions compared to predictable ones; and {theta}-band oscillations additionally signalled slower, longer-scale temporal prediction errors. In combination with the previous findings, predictive routing explains these experiments where neither ubiquitous predictive coding nor feedforward adaptation can.

SignificanceCortical columns robustly signal perceptual features through the firing rates of spiking neurons. In accordance with this rate coding, predictive processing theories hypothesized that neuronal firing rates ubiquitously signal surprise. However, a recent large-scale study of spike rates did not support this conjecture. An alternate model, predictive routing, suggests that neuronal oscillations rather than spike rates could encode surprise. These neuronal oscillations, which can affect the timing but not rate of spiking, formed coherent {gamma} rhythms which consistently signaled both simpler and more complex forms of surprise in mouse visual cortex. Together with the findings on spike-rates in the same experiment, our findings suggest that cortical circuits encode surprise in the rhythmic timing of spikes rather than in their rate.","[{""name"":""NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH (NIMH)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2339210;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization (HFSPO)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0001/2023-L;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04jsz6e67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Veni.232.110;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754345412035

Early genetic studies confirmed hybrids beyond F1, but details remained unclear due to low-resolution methods. Both species were hunted for centuries, but anthropogenic pressures during the 20th-century caused severe bottlenecks in the sable followed by hunting bans and large-scale reintroduction programs across much of its range, including the sympatric zone, potentially affecting hybridization. We resequenced 30 individuals from most of the sables range and Eastern part of pine martens. Among samples, we found a broad spectrum of hybrid types with mosaic recombinant chromosomes that confirm hybrid fertility and indicate crossover is not suppressed in kidases. This necessitates re-evaluation of previous research, as we detected notable discrepancies between STR-based ancestry and whole-genome analysis. In pine martens, we revealed mitochondrial DNA introgression from sables, indicating displacement of native pine marten mitochondrial sequences. Pine marten heterozygosity is relatively low (~0.5-0.6 hetSNPs/kbp) while sable diversity (~1.5-1.8 hetSNPs/kbp) is unexpectedly high for a species with its demographic history, likely reflecting successful reintroduction programs. We dated species divergence at 1.52 (CI: 1.05-2.06) Mya and identified candidate genes associated with ecological, morphological, and dietary differences, as well as hybrid fertility issues. This study is the first to elucidate marten hybridization at the whole-genome level, opening new research directions for understanding hybridization among Holarctic martens, the genetic consequences of reintroduction programs, and comparative adaptomics.","[{""name"":""Sierra Pacific Industries"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Carlsbergfondet Research Infrastructure Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CF22-0680;""},{""name"":""Danish National Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00znyv691"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DNRF143;""},{""name"":""The Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""125012800908-0;""},{""name"":""St. Petersburg State University"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""125021902561-6;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754345412035

Here, we conclude that it does not require much at all. It does not require knowing secondary structures; it does not require aligning the sequences; and it does not require many parameters. We selected a probabilistic model of palindromes (a stochastic context-free grammar or SCFG) with a total of just 21 parameters. Using standard deep learning techniques, we estimate its parameters by implementing the generative process in an automatic differentiation (autodiff) framework and applying stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We define and minimize a loss function that does not use any structural or alignment information. Trained on as few as fifty RNA sequences, the rules of RNA base pairing emerge after only a few iterations of SGD. Crucially, the sole inputs are RNA sequences. When optimizing for sequences corresponding to structured RNAs, SGD also yields the rules of RNA base-pair aggregation into helices. Trained on shuffled sequences, the system optimizes by avoiding base pairing altogether. Trained on messenger RNAs, it reveals interactions that are different from those of structural RNAs, and specific to each mRNA. Our results show that the emergence of canonical base-pairing can be attributed to sequence-level signals that are robust and detectable even without labeled structures or alignments, and with very few parameters. Autodiff algorithms for probabilistic models, such as, but not restricted to SCFGs, have significant potential as they allow these models to be incorporated into end- to-end RNA deep learning methods for discerning transcripts of different functionalities.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01-GM144423;""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UWSC13223;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754345412035

Analysis of spatial features of the tumor microenvironment revealed that TIME_ACT-high regions exhibit dense lymphocyte infiltration near tumor cells, indicating localized immune activation. Second, in 15 anti-PD1 transcriptomic cohorts spanning six cancer types, TIME_ACT outperforms 22 established signatures and methods, achieving a mean AUC of 0.76 and a clinically meaningful mean odds ratio of 6.11.

We introduce a previously undescribed communication display in two cuttlefish species: Sepia officinalis and Sepia bandensis. The four ""arm wave signs"" are stereotyped arm movements consisting of long-lasting, expressive, and repeated sequences of undulations of the arms, which can be combined and expressed following specific patterns. Using non-invasive behavioral experiments, we tested the hypothesis that they represent multimodal communication displays. To assess the role of visual cues, we recorded videos of animals signing and played them back to individual cuttlefish participants. When seeing the movies, cuttlefish waved back at the display. Most importantly, they were more likely to wave back when the movie was in upright (original) configuration as opposed to flipped upside-down, similar to the manner in which humans perceive faces and other socially relevant displays. In addition to their visually striking display, arm wave signs produce mechanical waves in the water, prompting us to explore the possibility that they may also be perceived via mechanoreception. Using playback experiments similar to those adopted in vision, we obtained preliminary evidence to support this hypothesis, indicating that arm wave signs may represent multimodal signals involving vision and mechanoreception. Our new result on communication with arm wave signs opens up novel possibilities for understanding vibration-mediated communication through the lateral line and/or the statocysts in a cephalopod species as an example of convergent evolution with vertebrates.","[{""name"":""PSL Research University"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013cjyk83"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""L'Oréal (France)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754345412035

Multipass transmembrane proteins have increased propensity to be targeted by the RQC, raising the question of whether problems in transmembrane domain insertion and assembly can also cause RQC-eliciting translational arrests. Here, we investigate RQC-mediated quality control of CFTR, a large transmembrane protein mutated in cystic fibrosis. Reporter assays show that although a sizeable fraction of nascent CFTR expressed in HEK293 cells arrests during translation and activates the RQC, multiple interventions compromising CFTR folding and membrane insertion do not exacerbate this response. CFTR translation abortion was also largely unaffected by regulators of translation kinetics such as codon usage, the ribosome collision sensor GCN1, and the SRP ER targeting complex. We propose that the RQC can be triggered by the inherent difficulties in synthesizing transmembrane segments, resulting from their inappropriate interaction with the protein synthesis machinery. Our study uncovers a novel physiological role for the RQC and points to new therapeutic targets for cystic fibrosis.","[{""name"":""Fritz Thyssen Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00f3sc705"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""10.22.2.029MN;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""540625656;CRC1678 project number 520471345;""},{""name"":""Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JRG-05 and CAP-33;""},{""name"":""Köln Fortune Program, Faculty of Medicine, University of Cologne"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""376/2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754345412035

High genomic instability of these cancers leads to chromosomal breaks (breakpoints), which disrupt the physical connection between genes and adjacent regulatory elements. Standard molQTL methods are unable to accommodate breakpoint information and would therefore indiscriminately test associations across breakpoints, leading to spurious signals and reduced biological relevance. To address these challenges, we developed SegmentQTL, a segmentation-aware molQTL analysis tool, designed to improve the accuracy of association testing in unstable cancer genomes by incorporating sample-specific break-point information.

ResultsSegmentQTL applies an integrated purifying filtering step that removes associations spanning breakpoints, ensuring that only variants within the same segment as the phenotype are tested. This prevents false discoveries and reduces background noise. We evaluated SegmentQTL on selected genes from stable and unstable genomic regions and compared its results with a previously published state-of-the-art tool. In stable regions, SegmentQTL produced similar results, validating its approach. In unstable regions, however, the filtering step refined detected associations by shifting peak locations and removing artefactual signals that would arise if genomic instability were not properly accounted for.

With the advancements of large-scale recordings, efficient and precise automated spike sorting methods have become essential. Existing approaches face challenges with channel quality variability, neuron-specific waveform drifts, and nonlinear changes in spike shapes that depend on neuronal morphology and electrode proximity. We introduce KIASORT (Knowledge-Integrated Automated Spike Sorting), which integrates knowledge from channel-specific classifiers trained on clustered spike waveforms to sort the data. KIASORT evaluates channel quality, automatically excludes noisy recordings, and identifies spike classes using a hybrid dimensionality reduction approach combining linear with nonlinear embeddings. To validate our approach against existing methods, we developed biophysical simulations demonstrating that conventional one-dimensional drift correction methods cannot address heterogeneous neuron-specific drift and nonlinear waveform changes.

Horizontal transfer of transposons (HTT) is important for their long-term persistence, but has only been systematically studied in animals, and thus the abundance, impact, and factors that shape HTTs in lineages outside animals is unknown. Fungi are at least as ancient and diverse as animals and are characterized by extensive genome size variation caused by transposons. Here, we screened 1,348 genomes across fungal biodiversity, genome sizes, and lifestyles to detect extensive HTTs, that generated on average 7% but up to 70% of the transposon content in some taxa. We in total identified at least 5,518 independent HTTs, mostly involving Tc1/Mariner DNA transposons. While the majority of HTTs occur between closely related taxa, irrespective of their lifestyles, HTTs were particularly common in Mucoromycotina, Sordariomycetes, Dothideomycetes, and Leotiomycetes. Importantly, species lacking fungal-specific defense mechanisms against transposons and those with gene-sparse and repeat-rich genomic compartments are involved in significantly higher number of HTTs, unveiling ecological and genomic factors shaping HTTs. Our findings thus illuminate the dynamic landscape of HTTs in fungi, providing the framework to further study the impact of HTTs on genome evolution and the processes that mediate transposon transfers within and between eukaryotic lineages.","[{""name"":""Utrecht University, Incentive Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754345412035

However, achieving precise control over tissue mechanics to direct specific morphogenetic outcomes remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a strategy to program tissue shape transformations through the nematic organization of cellular forces. By precisely controlling nematic order and topological defects, we generate millimeter-scale tissues programmed with specific multicellular tension fields. Using a theoretical framework that integrates contractile nematics with thin sheet mechanics, we explore the role of nematically guided tensions in shape morphogenesis. Experimentally, upon tissue detachment, nematically guided tension fields drive out-of-plane deformations, generating reproducible 3D shapes.

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B “Meiosis”;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754345412035

The mechanism by which ectopic gene activation occurs through these gain-of-function enhancer mutations remains poorly understood. Using the ZRS, a benchmark disease-associated enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), as a model, we demonstrate that poised (i.e., accessible but inactive) chromatin sensitizes Shh to aberrant activation in anterior limb bud, leading to polydactyly. In the anterior limb cells of wild-type mice, Shh is inactive, but the ZRS is accessible and marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. We demonstrate that this poising signature explains how over 20 independent rare variants within the ZRS cause Shh misexpression in the same anterior limb bud cell population, resulting in similar limb malformations, despite affecting binding sites for different activators and repressors. Disabling pioneer transcription factor binding to the ZRS suppresses its poised state in anterior cells, prevents aberrant activation of the ZRS by rare variants, and fully rescues limb malformations in variant knock-in mice. A thorough examination of other disease-associated enhancers with pathogenic gain-of-function variants revealed that they are all poised in tissues with ectopic activity. We use this poising signature to predict and validate in vivo ectopic forebrain activity of previously uncharacterized autism-associated non-coding variants. Our findings suggest that spatial enhancer poising, likely a byproduct of development, creates a susceptibility to non-coding mutations and offers a potential mechanistic explanation for the burden of disease-associated non-coding variants.","[{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD115268;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754345412035

We find that the two primates and mouse share similar X chromosome expression dynamics, including X chromosome reactivation (XCR), and that in Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) testes, germ cells undergo female-like XCR and escape of X inactivation. New male-specific regulatory regions have emerged progressively during mammalian evolution, especially on the X following sex chromosome origination. Further analyses revealed that male-specific regulatory regions evolved faster than female-specific ones in both supporting and pre-meiotic germ cells. However, female meiotic germ cells show even higher rates of molecular evolution and exhibit a permissive chromatin state that facilitates the birth of new genes, thus resembling their adult spermatogenic counterparts. Finally, we traced both conserved and species-specific gene expression trajectories across the three mammals, uncovering candidate genes for disorders of sex development that are typically central to cell-type-specific regulatory networks.

Prioritizing causal variants within these loci is critical for characterizing trait biology. Statistical fine mapping identifies causal variants at trait-associated loci, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited GWAS sample sizes prevent the resolution of many associations. Functionally informed approaches augment fine mapping by estimating variant prior causal probabilities based on overlap with trait-relevant functional annotations. However, functional enrichment provides only an indirect proxy for variant functional impact. Sequence-to-function models directly estimate variant effects on molecular phenotypes from underlying sequence context. Borzoi is a long-context model that predicts sequence determinants of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation across diverse tissues and cell types. Here we present Sniff, a Borzoi-informed fine-mapping approach that integrates broad genomic functional annotations with Borzoi-predicted variant effects via PolyFun to estimate variant prior causal probabilities. Applied to 15 UK Biobank traits, Sniff identifies 9.45% additional fine-mapped variants compared to PolyFun-Baseline at posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 0.8. Sniff-prioritized variants exhibit allele-specific activity in reporter assays and are predicted to have tissue-specific activity in trait-relevant tissues. For most traits, genes nominated by Sniff receive higher scores from the orthogonal gene prioritization method PoPS compared to genes nominated using functional annotations alone. Because differentially prioritized variants are driven by Borzoi predictions, we leverage attribution techniques to characterize sequence features underlying fine mapping and generate mechanistic hypotheses for GWAS associations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754345412035

Here we present the first direct evidence that H3K4me3 is not a cause but a consequence of transcriptional activation, functioning as a downstream epigenetic response. Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation.

Despite their critical role, the structural organization of kinetochores assembled on centromeres with vastly distinct architectures across diverse species remains poorly understood2,3. To address this question, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the inner kinetochore (CCAN) from the silkmoth Bombyx mori, an insect that lacks the canonical centromere-specifying histone variant CENP-A and exhibits chromosome-wide centromeric activity (holocentric). Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour l’Education et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754345412035

In unicellular bacteria, the ParMRC DNA partitioning apparatus is well known for forming actin-like filaments that push low copy number plasmids to opposite cell poles. In multicellular cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the presence of a chromosomally encoded ParMR system suggests it may play an analogous role in chromosome segregation. However, we show here that it instead constitutes a novel cytoskeletal system - termed CorMR - whose loss does not impair DNA segregation but leads to severe morphological defects, revealing a role in maintaining cell shape. Using live-cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that CorM forms dynamically instable filaments. These filaments are recruited to the membrane by CorR, which has acquired a conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that CorM forms antiparallel double-stranded filaments, in contrast to the polar, parallel filament pair seen in ParM. Furthermore, CorMR filaments are excluded from the cell poles and division plane by MinC, via a long N-terminal extension also specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Comparative genomics suggests that cyanobacterial multicellularity co-evolved with the chromosomal relocation of ParMR genes, acquisition of the amphipathic helix in CorR, and functional extension of MinC, supporting an evolutionary link among these features. Our findings uncover a striking repurposing of ancestral biochemical systems, expanding the known roles of ParMR and Min systems beyond plasmid segregation and division site selection to include regulation of cell shape.

ImportanceThe ParMRC system is a well-characterized machinery for the segregation of low-copy-number plasmids to the cell poles and, until now, was primarily described to be encoded on plasmids. We found that during the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, a chromosome-encoded ParMR system has undergone extensive evolutionary and functional repurposing, resulting in a previously undescribed bacterial cytoskeletal system that controls cell shape. We also found that this new cytoskeleton, called CorMR, is under the control of the MinCDE system, which has evolved to not only antagonize Z-ring formation, but also to regulate CorM polymerization. Such interplay between different cytoskeletal systems highlights an intricate regulatory mechanism linking cell division and morphology. As this repurposing of existing cytoskeletal system coincided with the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, it may have played a key role for the evolution of cyanobacteria with distinct cell shapes. Overall, our discovery highlights the plasticity of bacterial polymeric systems and gives insight into the evolution of cellular and multicellular complexity.","[{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Grant Agreement No.101034413;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ActinID, 101076260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754345412035

How these cancer-specific methylation changes are established in the decades before cancer, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we use a unique collection of longitudinal blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia to sensitively track the dynamics of DNA methylation changes at high temporal resolution. We identify thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that exhibit altered patterns of methylation up to 10 years before acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) diagnosis. Most of these DMRs are strongly associated with expanding clones carrying somatic driver mutations. We identify a subset of  epigenetic driver DMRs characterised by recurrent CpG alterations that are highly shared across pre-AML cases. These are likely to reflect early epigenetic reprogramming associated with AML development. We also reveal large numbers of stochastic  passenger CpGs whose differential methylation results from hitch-hiking with clonal expansions driven by somatically acquired genetic events. These passenger CpGs can be exploited for lineage tracing to discover clonal expansions driven by missing driver mutations. Our findings show widespread changes in methylation patterns during the early stages of cancer development which could be utilised for risk prediction and therapeutic intervention.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754345412035

Here we analyzed evolutionarily unrelated signal-sequestering viral proteins, finding that they share structural and biophysical traits in their genetic organization, ternary structures and binding pocket properties. Based on these traits we developed a structure-guided computational pipeline that can sift through large phage genome databases to unbiasedly predict phage proteins that manipulate bacterial immune signaling. Numerous previously uncharacterized proteins, grouped into three families, were verified to inhibit the bacterial Thoeris and CBASS signaling systems. Proteins of the Sequestin and Lockin families bind and sequester the TIR-produced signaling molecules 3'cADPR and His-ADPR, while proteins of the Acb5 family cleave and inactivate 3'3'-cGAMP and related molecules. X-ray crystallography and structural modeling, combined with mutational analyses, explain the structural basis for sequestration or cleavage of the immune signals. Thousands of these signal-manipulating proteins were detected in phage protein databases, with some instances present in well-studied model phages such as T2, T4 and T6.

However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function.

MethodsPlacental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD091218-04S1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754345412035

To decode the underlying regulatory grammar, we trained sequence-based models predicting CRE accessibility and used these models to infer ontogenetic relationships among cell types. By integrating sequence motifs, transcription factor expression, and CRE accessibility, we systematically reconstructed the gene regulatory networks that define cnidarian cell types. Our results reveal the regulatory complexity underlying cell differentiation in a morphologically simple animal and highlight conserved principles in animal gene regulation. This work provides a foundation for comparative regulatory genomics to understand the evolutionary emergence of animal cell type diversity.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ERC-StG 851647;""},{""name"":""Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PID2021-124757NB-I00;FPI Severo Ochoa PhD fellowship;""},{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie INTREPiD co-fund agreement 75442;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie grant agreement 101031767;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754345412035
