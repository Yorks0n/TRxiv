'synthetic proteins') has unlocked new frontiers of protein design. Deep learning models trained on protein sequences and experimental structures can generate novel protein designs that explore structural landscapes unseen by evolution. This approach enables the development of bespoke binders that target specific proteins and domains through new protein-protein interactions. However, successful binder generation can suffer from low in silico success rates, often requiring thousands of designs and hundreds of GPU hours to obtain enough hits for experimental testing. While commercial web-apps and workstation implementations are available for binder design, these are limited in both scalability and throughput. There is a lack of efficient open-source protein design pipelines for high-performance computing (HPC) systems that can maximise hardware resources and parallelise the workflow efficiently to generate successful binders. Here, we present 'ProteinDJ' - an implementation of a synthetic protein design workflow that is deployable on HPC systems using the Nextflow portable workflow management system and Apptainer containerisation. It automatically batches and parallelises the workload across both GPUs and CPUs, facilitating generation and testing of hundreds of designs per hour, dramatically accelerating the discovery process. Importantly, it allows central deployment of the workflow on shared HPC resources, rather than workstations restricted to individual research groups. ProteinDJ is designed to be modular and currently includes RoseTTAFold Diffusion (RFdiffusion) for fold generation, ProteinMPNN or Full-Atom MPNN (FAMPNN) for sequence design, and AlphaFold2 or Boltz-2 for prediction and validation of designs and binder-target interfaces, with supporting packages for structural evaluation of designs. We have included structure-based filters to reject problematic designs mid-stream to minimise manual inspection of designs by the user. ProteinDJ democratises protein binder design through its robust and user-friendly implementation and provides a framework for future protein design software pipelines.","[{""name"":""Australian National Health and Medical Research Council"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2008096;2026643;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

XPro1595 selectively neutralizes pathological soluble TNF while preserving neuroprotective transmembrane TNF signaling, offering a mechanistically distinct approach from current amyloid-targeting therapies. Methods: The MINDFuL trial was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted across 35 centers in eight countries. Participants aged 50-85 years with Early AD (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia) and elevated inflammatory biomarkers received weekly subcutaneous injections of XPro1595 (1.0 mg/kg) or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the Early Mild Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (EMACC). A prospectively defined biomarker-enriched population included amyloid-positive participants with a high inflammatory burden (ADi), defined by the presence of [&ge;]2 inflammatory markers. Results: Of 206 randomized participants, 200 comprised the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population and 100 comprised the ADi population. In the mITT analysis, no significant difference was observed in the EMACC (p=0.672). However, the ADi population showed promising signals across multiple clinical endpoints favoring XPro1595, including the EMACC (Cohen's d = 0.27), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI, d = 0.23), particularly the subfactor agitation/hyperactivity (d = 0.37), and a patient-reported outcome: Goal Attainment Scale (GAS, d = 0.18). These results were consistent with biomarker changes that favored XPro1595, as plasma pTau217 (d = -0.18) and GFAP (d = -0.19) were attenuated in the ADi population. In addition, many effect sizes were larger when assessing participants with higher drug exposure. Notably, no amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) were observed, even though ~70% of the participants were APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers, and one-third had baseline microbleeds. Conclusions: While XPro1595 did not meet the primary endpoint in the overall population, participants with biologically-defined AD and high inflammatory burden demonstrated consistent trends toward cognitive benefit and neuropsychiatric improvement. The complete absence of ARIA distinguishes XPro1595 from amyloid-targeting therapies and supports its potential for use in combination strategies and potentially for those at a higher risk of ARIA. These findings support selective TNF inhibition as a promising therapeutic approach for persons with AD and elevated inflammatory burden.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759183739548

However, limited genomic data from individuals dating between 45,000 and 20,000 years ago still restricts our understanding of population dynamics and admixture during the Upper Palaeolithic. Before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 26.5 to 19 cal kya), Gravettian culture-associated populations were widespread and genetically diverse, comprising at least two distinct genetic groups, referred to as the Fournol and Vestonice clusters. We present genome-wide data from three Gravettian-associated individuals: two from cave sites in the Franco-Cantabrian region (Chufin and Isturitz) and one from Italy (Ostuni1b). These data reveal previously undetected gene flow linking the ancestry of 34,000-year-old individuals from Sungir (Russia) to Gravettian individuals from Western Europe, challenging the prevailing model of population continuity from the Aurignacian to the Solutrean. As osseous remains are scarce for this time period, DNA from sediments deposited by ancient humans opens a new possibility to obtain genomic data. We thus examine sedimentary DNA from Solutrean Layer 122 at El Miron Cave (Cantabria, ~22,000 cal BP), recovering approximately 16,000 human SNPs, among the highest yields reported from a Palaeolithic context. Generating these data required over 1.15 billion sequencing reads, illustrating both the potential of sediment DNA for autosomal analysis and the technical challenges of the approach.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

While many tools have been developed to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from whole-genome sequencing, they often suffer from high false positive rates due to the complexity of bacterial genomes and the need for different filtering cutoffs across sample types and sequencing depths. As datasets increase in size, the manual filtering required for high accuracy presents a significant obstacle. Here, we present AccuSNV, a novel deep learning-based tool for high-precision and automated bacterial SNV calling. Unlike traditional methods that process one sample at a time, AccuSNV leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates alignment information across multiple samples, enhancing precision through learned across-sample patterns. We evaluated AccuSNV against seven popular SNV calling tools using simulated data from six bacterial species with varied sequencing depths, numbers of isolates, mutations, and divergence levels. To further validate its real-world utility, we tested AccuSNV on multiple curated bacterial datasets containing reported SNVs. In both simulated and real-world scenarios, AccuSNV consistently achieved the best performance. Moreover, AccuSNV provides comprehensive user-friendly downstream analysis modules and outputs, including mutation annotation information, phylogenetic inference, dN/dS calculations, and optional manual filtering. Together with the automated deep learning-based calling, these features make AccuSNV broadly accessible to users with different levels of computational expertise.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

However, due to the challenges of differentiating goat remains from that of sheep using traditional archaeozoological approaches, there are few specimens specifically identified as goat. To address this we employed genetic, proteomics, and archaeozoological techniques to assess faunal remains from the Late Bronze assemblage of Haughey's Fort (Armagh) and medieval assemblage of Carrickfergus (Antrim). We identify these specimens as goats using proteomics and genetics, and additionally determine their molecular sex. Genomic data recovered from a Haughey's Fort goat reveals a three-millenia genetic connection between herds in the Late Bronze Age, medieval period, and the indigenous Irish breed extant today, the Old Irish Goat. We additionally find varying levels of inbreeding within goats from the settlement of Carrickfergus, suggesting possible mixed use of herds within medieval Irish society. Our results demonstrate the continuing potential of combining archaeological and biomolecular techniques to clarify existing ambiguities and at the same time reveal new facets of the past.","[{""name"":""EPSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/K039660/1; EP/M028127/1;""},{""name"":""Northern Way Initiative"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""885729-AncestralWeave;101055195-ANSOC;""},{""name"":""Taighde Éireann – Research Ireland"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""21/PATH-S/9515(T);GOIPG/2023/4390;""},{""name"":""AHRC Northern Bridge Doctoral Training Partnership"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

We develop a force-dependent model of chromatin loop extrusion and investigate its mechanical consequences on chromosome organization using simulations and analytical theory. We show that loop extrusion alters the force-extension behavior of DNA in a non-monotonic manner: extrusion stiffens the chain at low forces but softens it at intermediate and high forces. Our model predicts hysteresis in pulling-recoiling cycles and out-of-equilibrium responses, consistent with recent single-chromosome stretching experiments. We further find that loop extrusion provides mechanical robustness to chromatin by promoting compaction while enabling rapid structural recovery after stress. These results establish loop extrusion as a key regulator of chromatin mechanics.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-21-CE45-0011;ANR- 22-CE12-0035;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

Using mBER, we designed two libraries comprising over 1 million VHH binders against 436 diverse targets. We experimentally screened the two libraries against 145 of these targets, resulting in a dataset of over 100 million binding interactions. We achieved specific and significant design success against 45% of targets. In a filtered set of designs, we detect binding rates to specific epitopes as high as 38%. Through mBER, we demonstrate that format-specific binder design is possible with no additional training of underlying folding and language models.

Here, we employ a suite of tools for rapid lysosomal isolation to construct a multi-tissue atlas of the metabolite changes that murine lysosomes undergo during aging. Aged lysosomes in brain, heart, muscle and adipose accumulate glycerophosphodiesters and cystine, metabolites that are causally linked to juvenile lysosomal storage disorders like Batten disease. Levels of these metabolites increase linearly with age, preceding organismal decline. Caloric restriction, a lifespan-extending intervention, mitigates these changes in the heart but not the brain. Our findings link lysosomal storage disorders to aging-related dysfunction, uncover a metabolic lysosomal ""aging clock,"" and open avenues for the mechanistic investigation of how lysosomal functions deteriorate during aging and in age-associated diseases.

We found that information from multiple innately aversive and attractive sensory modalities converges onto a common output neuron of the learning circuit, specifically the Mushroom Body output neuron, MBON-m1. We discovered that this neuron is required for navigating both attractive odor and aversive temperature cues and is activated by attractive cues, such as food odour and sugar, and inhibited by different aversive cues, such as cooling, salt, or non-food odors.

Carnosine dipeptidase II (CNDP2) is a cytoplasmic enzyme that hydrolyzes Cys-Gly and plays an important role in maintaining intracellular cysteine (Cys) homeostasis. CNDP2-mediated hydrolysis of Cys-Gly promotes Cys mobilization and contributes to the replenishment of intracellular GSH levels. CNDP2 is frequently overexpressed in various cancers and has been implicated in tumor cell proliferation and progression. This mechanism may enhance cancer cell survival by causing resistance to oxidative stress, which indicates that CNDP2 is a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Although bestatin (BES) has been identified as a CNDP2 inhibitor, its limited specificity and suboptimal drug-like properties have limited its therapeutic potential. In this study, we performed an in silico screen of a small-molecule compound library and identified KKL-35 as a novel CNDP2-binding molecule. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggested that KKL-35 interacts within the catalytic pocket. Biochemical assays confirmed that it inhibits CNDP2 enzymatic activity, albeit with lower potency compared with BES. Despite its modest intrinsic activity, KKL-35 exhibits favorable physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, which are characterized by a low topological polar surface area (TPSA), reduced molecular flexibility, and well-balanced lipophilicity. This positions it as an attractive and tractable starting point for lead optimization. Taken together, these findings establish KKL-35 as a validated CNDP2 inhibitor and a promising lead compound for the development of more selective therapeutics targeting CNDP2-mediated cancer cell metabolism.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

How its chromosome is dynamically reorganized across these contrasting states remains unclear. Here, we used synchronized predatory infections combined with time-resolved RNA-seq, Hi-C, ChIP-seq, and quantitative microscopy to map transcriptional activity and chromosome architecture across seven key stages of the predatory lifecycle. We uncover a dramatic shift in nucleoid organization - from an ultra-compact, transcriptionally restricted state in attack-phase cells to a progressively decompacted, ori-centered conformation during intracellular replication. Notably, distinct transcriptional and chromosome folding states not only mark the canonical attack and growth phases, but also critical transitions such as prey invasion, replication onset, and predator division.

Here, we present a spatially resolved, multi-omics framework that integrates whole-organ 3D imaging at cellular resolution with targeted proteomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic profiling to detect and characterize microscopic tubal lesions. Using this platform, we identified a total of 99 STICs and their presumed precursors that harbor TP53 mutations in morphologically unremarkable tubal epithelium in all five specimens obtained from cancer-free organ donors with average-risk of developing ovarian cancer. Although these lesions comprised only 0.2% of the epithelial compartment, they displayed geographic diversity, immune exclusion, metabolic rewiring, and DNA copy number changes among lesions and normal fallopian tube epithelium discovered alterations in STIC-associated genes and the pathways they control.

The repressed var genes have a distinct genome organization where they localize as a cluster near the nuclear periphery and are bound by PfHP1 (P. falciparum Heterochromatin Protein 1). However, the mode of regulation of var genes by PfHP1 remains unclear. In this study, we show that PfHP1 undergoes phase separation in vitro in an RNA and DNA-dependent manner. Single-molecule DNA tethering experiments further revealed that AT-rich DNA sequences act as nucleation sites for the assembly and compaction of PfHP1-mediated heterochromatinization. We have also identified point mutations in the IDRs (intrinsically disordered regions) of PfHP1 that disrupt its phase separation as well as DNA compaction in vitro. To assess the dynamic properties of PfHP1 condensates in vivo, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in GFP tagged PfHP1 parasites, which revealed rapid fluorescence recovery, supporting their fluidity and phase separation behaviour. Ectopic expression of PfHP1 phase separation and DNA compaction mutants led to dispersed nuclear localization of PfHP1, in contrast to the punctate appearance of the wild-type protein and altered chromatin binding at var genes. These results were corroborated with DiCre/loxP-based conditional expression of the same PfHP1 mutants, which also led to the de-repression of multiple var genes (as many as 54 out of 60 var genes), mimicking the phenotype of PfHP1 depletion mutants. Hi-C sequencing of PfHP1 mutants revealed loss of interactions in the heterochromatic regions, indicating that PfHP1 phase separation is an essential mechanism for repressive cluster formation. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the role of PfHP1-mediated phase separation in heterochromatin formation and var gene silencing; unveiling a fundamental mechanism that drives antigenic variation in P. falciparum.","[{""name"":""Minitsry of Education india (MoE)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MoE-STARS-2/2023-0249;""},{""name"":""SERB, India"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRG/2023/001838;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

Better understanding of how this immunosurveillance operates could improve the treatment of neurological diseases. Here, using a novel genetically engineered mouse model of ZFTA-RELA ependymoma (4) - a childhood brain tumour-we characterised an immune circuit between the tumour and antigen presenting, haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the skull bone marrow. The presentation of antigens in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by HSPCs to CD4+ T cells, biased HSPC lineages toward myelopoiesis and polarised CD4+ T-cells to regulatory T cells (T-regs), culminating in tumour immunotolerance. Remarkably, a single infusion of antibodies directed against cytokines enriched in the CSF of mice bearing ZFTA-RELA ependymomas, choroid plexus carcinomas or Group-3 medulloblastoma-all aggressive childhood brain tumours-disrupted this process and caused profound tumour regression. These data unmask a mechanism by which skull bone marrow-derived HSPCs and CD4+ T cells cooperate to promote the immunotolerance of childhood brain tumours.

Our findings reveal that clumped overnight roosting led to an increased propensity for coordinated marching the following day, a key precursor of swarm formation. These patterns became clearer during larval development, driving divergence in social affinity and group dynamics between habitat groups.

Their activation by fasting is key for survival and is thought to be triggered by feedback when energy stores are low. However, we know that environmental cues can also regulate AgRP neurons, since cues that predict future food intake rapidly inhibit AgRP neurons. But is the converse true: can the prediction of future fasting rapidly activate AgRP neurons? Here we show that such rapid fasting activation of AgRP neurons does occur. This fasting response is driven by excitatory input from paraventricular hypothalamic neurons expressing Sim2, which are bidirectionally sensitive to predictions of future energy state. In this way, cognitively-processed contextual information conveyed by PVH-Sim2 neurons strongly activates AgRP neurons. Lastly, chronic silencing of PVH-Sim2 neurons causes persistent hypophagia. This PVH-Sim2 to AgRP neuron circuit, by anticipating and preventing negative energy balance, provides an important new dimension of hunger regulation.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

We improved gene calling of 12% of giant virus genomes by accounting for alternative and custom genetic codes, enabling more accurate identification of protein-coding genes. Database mining uncovered endogenous viral elements in a broad spectrum of eukaryotes, spanning algae, fungi, and parasitic protists highlighting that giant virus integration is both widespread and evolutionarily persistent. Orthologous clustering of 2.5 million proteins identified 135,998 orthogroups representing comprehensive metabolic capabilities, such as enrichment of genes involved in aromatic compound degradation (commonly associated with bioremediation) in Algavirales genomes. Furthermore, we detected widespread biosynthetic gene clusters underpinning antimicrobial activity and antibiotic resistance, suggesting roles of giant viruses in host defense and in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes. Conversely, 67% of orthogroups have unknown functions, underscoring a substantial unexplored potential.

Computational models suggest that insects remember panoramic snapshots to return to goal locations. To what extent these snapshots represent retinotopic images or whether salient landmarks are stored isolated from the panorama remains unclear. With a newly designed spatial-memory task, we show that honeybees employ two different strategies for learning visual cues. In essence, they learn visual patterns as panoramic snapshots and three-dimensional objects as single entities. Freely walking honeybees were challenged to locate a rewarded feeder in the presence of visual patterns or objects. Selectively perturbing the panorama degraded the orientation behaviour only when visual patterns were present but not when objects were available. Presenting visual patterns and objects simultaneously and setting these cues in conflict revealed that honeybees primarily rely on a landmark-based navigation strategy. Making the spatial information of the objects ambiguous did not induce disorientation because the honeybees then relied on the visual patterns for finding the feeder. Altogether, our results suggest two independent visual memories operating in parallel, one dedicated to local landmarks and a second one for visual patterns that could be interpreted as distal cues. Notably, in rats, the spatial tuning of some hippocampal cells has been shown to be either anchored to local or distal cues. Our results provide the first hints that a distinction between local and distal cues may also be present in the insect brain.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BE 8388/1-1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

We systematically examine synthetic architectures inspired by mammalian cortical connectivity and find that sparse, modular, and hierarchical networks achieve superior performance, relative to random, small-world, or core-periphery graphs, but only when reciprocity is constrained.

Understanding the mechanism behind OMV biogenesis in Bacteroides spp. is necessary to determine their role in the gut. Recent studies showed that mutation of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factor 1 increased OMV production in Bacteroides thetaeotaomicron (Bt) by regulating members of its downstream regulon. Additional members of the Dma family have been identified, but very little is known regarding their roles in Bt. Here, we investigate the role of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factor 2 (Dma2) in controlling OMV biogenesis in Bt. We employ biochemical and proteomic analyses to show that mutation of dma2 increases OMV production in a manner that is dependent on the expression of its cognate sigma factor, das2. The precise mechanism by which dma2 increases OMV biogenesis remains elusive. However, transcriptome analyses revealed that {Delta}dma2 has decreased expression of select polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) that primarily target host-associated glycans. Follow-up comparative proteomics showed that the PUL repertoire was most impacted in the OMV fraction. In vitro growth assessments showed that {Delta}dma2 exhibits delayed growth in the presence of select host-associated glycans.

We conducted an exome-wide association study (ExWAS) in 13,674 T2D cases and 41,024 controls of British-Bangladeshi and -Pakistani ancestry from the Genes & Health study, focusing on damaging coding variants in single-variant and gene-level analyses. This represents the largest ExWAS of T2D to date. We tested the association of novel genes and variants with metabolic traits in Genes & Health, UK, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation Biobank, India (MDRF), and the UK Biobank. Gene-level analyses revealed novel associations with RNF19A (p = 1.8x10e-14) and HNF4A (p = 2.4x10e-13), a known monogenic diabetes gene. The HNF4A signal was driven by a South Asian-specific gain-of-function variant (rs150776703, Pro437Ser) protective against T2D (OR = 0.48, p = 2.8x10e-14), diabetic eye disease, and gestational diabetes but associated with elevated LDL-cholesterol, plasma PCSK9 upregulation, and increased myocardial infarction risk (HR = 1.62, p = 0.01). In Huh7 cells, Pro437Ser demonstrated similar transactivation of HNF4A target, G6PC, compared to wild-type, partially explaining the protective effect for T2D. Single-variant analyses highlighted a missense variant in CDKAL1 and a T2D risk-increasing South Asian-specific variant, rs78193826 (GP2: Val429Met), linked to CKD risk and beta-cell dysfunction (via stimulated C-peptides). Meta-analysis with UK Biobank highlights a role for plasma GP2 levels as a biomarker for high genetic risk of beta-cell deficiency and low risk for obesity-mediated T2D. These novel findings provide a foundation for drug target development, precision medicine and deeper exploration of metabolic and cardiovascular disease mechanisms in global populations disproportionately affected by T2D.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759183739548

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting  spacetime attractor excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219525/Z/19/Z;225926/Z/22/Z;219627/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GAT3955;GAT3755;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0040/2024-L;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 651-2023;""},{""name"":""Fondation Fyssen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

The thermodynamic details of the underlying process have been previously examined, but the mechanistic details remain largely underexplored owing in part, to a lack of suitable technologies capable of assessing nanoscopic membrane disruption events. Key open questions include: how do detergents remodel the membrane structure at sub-solubilizing concentrations? And what is the sequence of morphological transitions that lead up to solubilization? Here, we introduce a single-colour assay based on the fluorescence de-quenching of membrane-integrated fluorophores as a sensitive and generalizable tool to probe nanoscale membrane remodelling events induced by detergents. We demonstrate, using fluorescence spectroscopy and time-correlated single photon counting, that the widely used detergent Triton X-100 triggers substantial morphological changes at concentrations below its critical micellar concentration. Moreover, by taking advantage of single vesicle fluorescence lifetime imaging and scanning electron microscopy, we reveal that the swelling step involves a morphological transition from spherical vesicles to toroidal structures, providing direct evidence for detergent-driven membrane reorganization prior to solubilization. Our findings support and refine a multistep model of detergent-induced membrane solubilization, positioning fluorescence de-quenching as a tool for detecting conformational intermediates. We show that the fluorescence de-quenching approach performs robustly across multiple cyanine-based probes and experimental conditions and its nanoscale sensitivity provides a platform from which to interrogate membrane perturbations induced by a wide variety of molecular disruptors, including those with important biomedical significance.","[{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0439y7842"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/V034030/1;EP/V047663/1;""},{""name"":""Alzheimer’s Research UK"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RF2019-A-001;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

Using bispecific antibodies to target anti-PD-1 to individual T cell subsets, we demonstrate that intratumoral CD8+ and CD4+ T cells can independently drive immune remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. The CD8+ and CD4+ T cells that respond to anti-PD-1 exhibit a shared dysfunctional gene program, characterized by tumor-reactivity, terminal exhaustion, effector capacity, and reduced translational activity. Notably, rather than acting through transcriptional rewiring, anti-PD-1 reinvigorates dysfunctional T cells by overcoming this translational barrier, resulting in restored effector function. Altogether, these results reveal dysfunctional T cells as initiators of early tissue responses to PD-1 blockade and identify a novel mode of their therapeutic reinvigoration through restoration of translational control.","[{""name"":""Melanoma Research Alliance"",""id"":""https://ror.org/025ck6r46"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Oncode Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01n92vv28"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Asher Biotherapeutics"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Stevin Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

We recorded EEG while six observers (6,020 trials each) detected near-threshold Gabor targets embedded in noise. Using signal detection theory (SDT) and reverse correlation, we observed an effect of occipital and frontal pre-stimulus alpha phase on sensitivity (d'), not criterion. Hit and false alarm rates were counterphased, consistent with a reduction in internal noise during optimal alpha phases. Perceptual reports were also more consistent when two identical stimuli were presented during the optimal phase, suggesting a decrease in internal noise rather than signal amplification. Classification images revealed sharper spatial frequency and orientation tuning during the optimal alpha phase, implying that alpha phase shapes sensitivity by modulating sensory tuning towards relevant stimulus features.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

Animal model studies have been invaluable for demonstrating the importance of the DRG nociceptor in pain sensation and the development of related analgesic targets. However, there are functional biological differences between human and animal model nociceptors. Therefore, a complementary in vitro model of human nociception is critical to confirming the relevance of preclinical findings for therapeutic drug development. We characterized the nociceptive properties of differentiated cells from the human DRG-derived immortalized cell line HD10.6. Within differentiated HD10.6 cells, we documented the abundance and localization of nociceptive machinery central to regulating excitability and linked with pain sensation including ion channels TRPV1 and NaV1.7 and afferent peptides CGRP and Substance P. Using calcium influx imaging assays, we confirmed the electrical functionality of TRPV1 and NaV1.7 in HD10.6 cells, and through whole-cell patch clamp, we found similar baseline electrophysiological parameters of HD10.6 cells to those previously observed in human patient DRGs. Further, we found that differentiated HD10.6 cells express the mu opioid receptor 1 protein, and DAMGO, a mu agonist, blocks depolarization-evoked calcium influx in a naloxone-reversible fashion. Importantly, using an inflammatory cocktail, excitation and peripheral sensitization are induced within HD10.6 cells, mirroring nociceptors in a pain state during or after tissue damage or inflammation. Finally, HD10.6 cells were also cultured into dual-chambered microfluidic devices to mirror the biological anatomy of the nociceptor. Within this system, we demonstrated the uptake of adeno-associated-virus (AAV) by the peripheral terminals and AAV transport to the soma. Altogether, we have developed the use of HD10.6 cells to create a system of human nociceptive signaling on a chip to study human nociceptor physiology and intervention.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NS132483;AG081037;HL171505;R21AI185862;R01NS131560;R01HG012351;5T32DK007044-44;NS047101;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Defense"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0447fe631"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""W81XWH-22-1-0401;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

Here, we introduce a vertically integrated platform for simultaneously tracking single-cell migration and assessing CC under confinement. Our system integrates cell engineering via multiplexed sensors for cell-cycle, actin, and tubulin, as well as photopatterned engineered extracellular matrix (ECM) islands of defined sizes. It also features an automated, high-throughput pattern-aware imaging pipeline (Fab2Mic) that enables on-pattern, joint migration-CC assessment in the same live cells. Since the local microenvironment plays a critical role in metastasis by constraining cell behaviors within spatial boundaries, we used an HT1080 fibrosarcoma model as an illustrative case. Where static phenotyping yielded 40% G1 and 60% S/G2/M, with larger cell areas and tubulin spread in the S/G2/M phase, dynamic phenotyping via live-cell imaging confirmed CC-linked motility, with faster instantaneous velocities in G1, exemplifying the CC-migration correlations. These phenotypes were modulated by the spatial confinement imposed by the engineered ECM islands. Stronger confinement reduced cell area and tubulin spread and increased the frequency of abnormal CC events, particularly Long G1 states on smaller engineered ECM islands. It also induced a confinement-specific S/G2/M-G1 mitotic slippage, observed only under our confined conditions. Together, this vertically integrated system suggests that confinement may continuously tune migration-CC coupling and provides a deployable pipeline for CC-aware mechanobiology and screening. Moreover, we stress how dynamic imaging provides access to variables that are difficult or impossible to infer from static snapshots, including velocity and CC timing.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""852560;""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education, Universities and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0166hxq48"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R20ZE54CTK;""},{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101153603;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

These trends are then used to address fundamental questions in the field, including the discovery of potential novel anti-cancer therapies, improvements to species conservation efforts, and understanding how cancer has influenced the evolution of multicellularity. They thus must be robust. This study demonstrates that when estimated on captive species those trends are heavily influenced by their scientific and public popularity, and that accounting for this bias can substantially alter their direction and magnitude. Hence, we reanalysed published captive vertebrate datasets examining the associations between neoplasia, malignancy, and lethal tumour prevalences with body mass, longevity, life history traits, and germinal cells mutation rates. When we included proxies of species popularity in our analyses, the previously reported weak effect of body mass on tumour and malignancy prevalences disappeared entirely. Similarly, the previously reported positive relationship between germline mutation rate and cancer mortality was eliminated after controlling for popularity bias. For life history traits, the effect of clutch size on cancer neoplasia and malignancy prevalences in birds doubled in magnitude, and while the negative trend between gestation length and tumour prevalence in mammals was not greatly affected, our analyses revealed that baseline tumour prevalences were underestimated for popular animals. Finally, the previously observed association between hemochorial placentation and cancer mortality in mammals was eliminated when confounding variables were included. Collectively, these results demonstrate that current comparative analyses based on tumour prevalence in captive animals are heavily influenced by species' scientific and public popularities. Future studies utilising such datasets should incorporate measures of species popularity as confounding variables to ensure more robust conclusions and misleading research directions.","[{""name"":""The Hoffmann Family"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""ANR EVOSEXCAN"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-23-CE13-0007;""},{""name"":""CNRS (IRP CANECEV)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

Mechanotransduction feedback loops convert mechanical forces into gene-expression changes that, in turn, regulate cell behaviors such as growth and extracellular matrix (ECM) production. How these loops are coupled to developmental programs to ensure robust morphogenetic outcomes remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Yap-dependent mechanotransduction establishes a self-limiting positive feedback loop that drives the successful formation of semicircular canals in zebrafish. These canals form through reproducible steps of bud initiation, extension, and fusion within the otic epithelium. Local swelling of a hyaluronan-rich ECM initiates bud formation. We demonstrate that this ECM expansion activates Yap in a spatially patterned manner within the bud. Activated Yap induces its target, ccn1l1, which drives further ECM production, establishing a positive feedback loop. The ensuing rapid ECM expansion sustains bud extension. Graded perturbations to the mechanotransduction loop reduced extension, with bud fusion remaining robust at lower levels of disruption but blocked at the highest dose. Critically, the loop contains its own termination mechanism: when buds fuse, the PKA-CREB signaling is activated by the adhesion GPCR Gpr126 to suppress ccn1l1, preventing overgrowth. These findings reveal how mechanotransduction-driven positive feedback loops can be coupled to their own termination, providing developmental control through the integration of mechanical forces with transcriptional responses and morphogenetic outcomes.","[{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R00HD098918;DP2115157;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006zn3t30"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AR083346;""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Uehara Memorial Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00gc20a07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

The mechanisms that facilitate immunostimulatory ligand release from microbes during infection are largely undefined. Using the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, we describe wall teichoic acid (WTA) as a critical mediator of DNA release from bacterial cells during infection. Mechanistically, we found that the -glycosylated form of WTA, generated by the enzyme TarM, is the primary mediator of bacterial DNA release within macrophages. This process is antagonized by the enzyme O-acetyltransferase, which prevents WTA attachment to peptidoglycan. This competition among peptidoglycan modifying enzymes determines activation of cytosolic DNA receptors AIM2 and cGAS. WTA therefore operates as a meta-regulator of inflammation, by controlling the availability of microbial ligands that stimulate innate immunity.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/043z4tv69"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AI167993;R37AI116550;T32AI7061;K08AI193234;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-123-24;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00adh9b73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DK34854;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739548

However, designing DNA constructs correctly is currently limited by our incomplete quantitative understanding of how sequences are transcribed and translated, especially non-native sequences. Here, we present Yorzoi, a sequence-to-expression model for bakers yeast that predicts RNA-seq coverage for a 5 kilobase, multi-gene window of DNA at 10 base pair (bp) resolution. To extend its predictive ability beyond native DNA, Yorzoi has been pretrained on a comprehensive dataset not only including native yeast sequences but also human sequences expressed in yeast and structurally rearranged synthetic yeast chromosomes. We demonstrate that our model has learned general rules of yeast transcription by achieving high predictive performance on various downstream tasks. Yorzoi is a powerful tool for in-silico testing of DNA sequences and directly applicable for sequence design.

While infection is known to impair mitochondrial function and enhance glycolysis, the role of viral accessory proteins in these alterations remains unclear. Here, we investigate the metabolic impact of the accessory protein ORF7a. Lentiviral expression of ORF7a in human lung epithelial (A549) and monocytic (THP1) cells, coupled with integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, revealed profound dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. ORF7a impaired oxidative phosphorylation, reducing basal and maximal respiration, inducing mitochondrial depolarization, and increasing reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, ORF7a upregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), promoting pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex phosphorylation and suppressing pyruvate oxidation. However, pharmacological PDK4 inhibition did not restore respiration. High-resolution respirometry in frozen samples revealed impaired complex I function, while Blue Native-PAGE demonstrated defective respiratory supercomplex assembly. By linking enzymatic inhibition with structural destabilization, our study uncovers a functional vulnerability of the mitochondrial respiratory chain to viral manipulation.

Whilst there are known K. pneumoniae ciprofloxacin resistance determinants, there is a lack of systematic data on the effect of determinants, alone and in combination, and there are no publicly accessible tools for predicting resistance from whole genome sequence data.

METHODSThe KlebNET-GSP AMR Genotype-Phenotype Group aggregated a matched genotype-phenotype dataset of n=12,167 K. pneumoniae species complex (KpSC) isolates from 27 countries between 2001-2021. We developed a rules-based classifier to predict ciprofloxacin resistance by categorizing the number of quinolone resistance determining regions mutations in gyrA and parC, the number of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, and the presence/absence of aac(6')-Ib-cr (which can acetylate ciprofloxacin).

Predictive performance was assessed using the discovery dataset, for which we re-phenotyped discrepant isolates; and validated using externally contributed datasets (n=7,030 KpSC isolates).

RESULTSThe rules-based classifier predicted R vs S/I with categorical agreement, sensitivity, and specificity >96%, and major/very major error rates <4%. Performance was similar across diverse KpSC sources (human, animal, other), species, and intra-species lineages. External validation of the classifier yielded overall 93.12% categorical agreement [95% confidence interval (CI), 92.50-93.74%], 8.65% major errors [95% CI, 7.34-9.97%], and 6.20% very major errors [95% CI, 5.51-6.90%]. We implemented the classifier in Kleborate, a command-line tool that is integrated into the Pathogenwatch web platform. Using this to assess the global distribution of ciprofloxacin resistance determinants in KpSC genomes available in Pathogenwatch (n=31,319, from 109 countries between years 2000-2023), we observed a significant positive association between national quinolone consumption rates and predicted ciprofloxacin resistance (R2=0.20, p=0.004).

CONCLUSIONS

Ciprofloxacin resistance phenotypes can be reasonably predicted from genotypes, which is sufficient for informing surveillance. However, unexplained resistance remains and accuracy is insufficient for clinical applications. We demonstrate the value of aggregating genotype-phenotype data to explore resistance mechanisms and develop predictors, but highlight complexities in combining phenotype data from different assays and standards.","[{""name"":""Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV025280, INV077266;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""226432/Z/22/Z;""},{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""773830;""},{""name"":""Trond Mohn Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TMF2019TMT03;""},{""name"":""SARA project (Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance in Africa, through a grant from the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs within the Fonds de solidarité pour les projets innovants (FSPI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Academy of Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00c489v88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Health Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""UK Vietnam MRC Newton Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/N029399/1 RG83380;""},{""name"":""National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR207397;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

While tiller bud formation is primarily under strong genetic control, bud outgrowth into functional tillers is strongly influenced by physiological and environmental cues. However, integration of environmental cues to genetic regulators for controlling tiller outgrowth remains poorly understood. Nitrogen availability is one of the most critical environmental factors regulating tiller outgrowth. Therefore, we investigated the effects of Nitrogen on the early stages of bud outgrowth and dissected the genetic module mediating nitrogen-mediated tiller outgrowth. Both nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) triggered tiller outgrowth and induced largely overlapping transcriptional responses, although nitrate acted with a temporal delay. Phytohormone signaling emerged as the central interface linking nitrogen supply to the early stages of bud outgrowth, with cytokinin - auxin antagonism playing a key role. Cytokinin promoted bud outgrowth by repressing the TCP transcription factor OsTB1, the key inhibitor of tillering, via Cytokinin Response Factors OsERF53/54. OsERF53/54 further reduced polar auxin transport by repressing OsPIN1a, which in turn, promoted bud activation. Conversely, auxin promoted bud dormancy by inducing OsTB1 and OsPIN1a via OsARF11/16. Adequate nitrogen supplies induced cytokinin signaling while inhibiting auxin signaling and transport in tiller buds, thereby triggering bud outgrowth. Together, we identify a key regulatory role of auxin cytokinin antagonistic module for integrating nitrogen signals to determine tiller bud fate.","[{""name"":""Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BT/Ag/Network/Rice/2019–20;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

This was first made possible by fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (Fucci) technology, which distinguishes specific cell cycle phases through the reciprocal degradation of fluorescently tagged, truncated forms of human CDT1 and GMNN proteins. Fucci genetic systems have been successfully implemented in transgenic mice, zebrafish, and axolotls. To date, no viable, stably expressing Fucci line has been developed in an avian species. Although a range of continuously improving Fucci constructs have been developed in recent years, existing in vivo Fucci models remain limited because they rely on older reporter technology that fails to distinguish cells in S, G2, and M phases or to label cells in early G1. As a result, these models can be challenging to interpret and their utility for continuous cell tracking and precise analysis of cell-cycle dynamics is limited. Here, we introduce FuChi, a multicistronic Fucci-expressing chicken line incorporating a newly optimised reporter construct comprising of an mCerulean-tagged Histone H1.0 linker protein fused via a self-cleaving 2A peptide to the tandem Fucci(CA) cell cycle biosensor, with additional epitope tags included for detection in fixed tissues. We show that this system accurately discriminates and tracks cells in G1, S, G2, and M phases both in vitro and in vivo, enabling faithful visualisation of cell cycle status in intact tissues and organs. Using FuChi embryos, we mapped proliferation dynamics across developing tissues, analysed cell cycle states of migrating cells, and performed live imaging of early embryos. These latter experiments revealed that transition from S phase may be a key morphogenetic event during gastrulation as mesendoderm cells egress from the primitive streak to form embryonic structures including the prechordal plate. Pairing this advanced reporter with the intrinsic experimental advantages of the chicken embryo, positions FuChi as a premier in vivo system for studying cell-cycle kinetics in development, delivering clear technological improvements over current Fucci models. FuChi chickens provide a powerful new resource for studying embryonic development, organ growth, tissue homeostasis, disease processes, and infection responses.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BBS/E/D/10002071;BBS/E/RL/230001C;""},{""name"":""National Centre for the Replacement Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02w0kg036"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NC/T002328/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

We evaluated the accuracy, including plasmid reconstruction, of Nanopore long-read only genome assemblies of Enterobacterales.

We sequenced 92 genomes from clinical Enterobacterales isolates, collected in England under a national surveillance program, with long-read Nanopore (R10.4.1, Dorado v5.0.0 super-high-accuracy basecalled) and short-read Illumina (NovaSeq) sequencing approaches. Genomes were assembled using three long-read only (Flye; Hybracter long; Autocycler), and three hybrid assemblers (Hybracter hybrid; Unicycler normal; bold). Three polishing modalities (Medaka v2 with subsampled or un-subsampled long-reads; Polypolish + Pypolca with short-reads) were investigated.

Autocycler circularised the most chromosomes (87/92 [95%]). Plasmid sequence reconstruction was comparable between all assemblers except Flye, all recovering 90-96% of plasmids, although the  ground truth was uncertain. Flye performed worse than other assemblers on almost all metrics. Autocycler + Medaka (un-subsampled long-reads) was the most accurate long-read only assembler/polisher combination, comparable to hybrid assemblies (median 0 [IQR:0-0] SNPs and 0 [IQR:0-1] indels per genome; quality value/Q score, 100 [IQR: 64-100]), with only 4/92 genome sequences having >10 SNPs/indels. Medaka polishing with un-subsampled long-reads resulted in small improvements in indels but not SNPs for both Flye and Autocycler assemblies. Seven-locus MLST, antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and stress gene annotation was equivalent across assembler/polisher combinations.

Nanopore long-read only bacterial genome assembly with Autocycler combined with Medaka polishing (using un-subsampled reads) is similarly accurate and possibly more complete than hybrid assemblies, representing a viable alternative for incorporating high-quality genomic data, including plasmids, into Enterobacterales surveillance.

Impact StatementNanopore long-reads have historically been too error-prone to use alone for accurate bacterial genome assembly, necessitating additional Illumina short-reads to achieve structurally complete and accurate  hybrid genome assemblies for public health surveillance. This increases cost and complexity. Previous studies have shown that recent improvements in Nanopore chemistry (R10.4.1 flowcell) and basecalling (super-high accuracy) allow high-quality long-read only assemblies on a small number of laboratory reference strains. This is the first evaluation, to our knowledge, to assess Nanopore long-read only genome assembly compared with hybrid assembly on a large number of clinical isolates. In addition, this is the first large-scale evaluation of the recently released automated consensus long-read assembly tool, Autocycler.

We show that Autocycler long-read only assemblies are more structurally complete for chromosomal sequences, while reconstructing a similar number of plasmids to other long-read and hybrid assemblers. Most long-read polished, Autocycler-assembled genome sequences have 0 errors (median: 0 SNPs/indels) relative to a short-read polished (hybrid) Autocycler assemblies, enabling accurate annotation of key genes.","[{""name"":""National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR207397;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

Previous simulation studies have shown that early treatment initiation is critical to maximize the therapeutic response in antiviral treatment in an acute viral infection such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. A recent experimental study demonstrated that late therapy initiation can lead to diminished antiviral potency. However, most VD model simulations with varying treatment initiation time accounted only for the effect of initiation condition (i.e., state of different cell populations when the therapy started), the loss of drug potency has been under-investigated. This may overestimate the antiviral effect, potentially resulting in suboptimal dose selection. To this end, we aimed to characterize relationship between the drug potency (EC50) and the timing of drug addition, using nirmatrelvir and GS-441524 against SARS-CoV-2 as an example. Viral load data were obtained from in vitro experiments with various drug concentrations and treatment initiated between 0 to 3 days post infection. EC50 values were fitted for each treatment initiation group and were found to vary with the timing of treatment initiation in both drugs. Also, a VD model with time-varying EC50 provided better fits than a constant EC50 model (BIC = 1667.90 vs. 1677.84). Further simulations also indicated that a constant EC50 model overestimated the antiviral efficacy when treatment started late. These findings highlighted the importance of considering EC50 shift when optimizing dosage regimens for patients presenting late.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

Using polymer simulations and high-resolution live-cell microscopy, we identify rare but long-lived chromatin encounters arising from cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. These events occur when cohesin loads near the midpoint between two loci and extrudes them through a defined spatial radius, producing encounter durations that exceed those of random collisions. We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors. Our findings support a time-gated model of distal enhancer-promoter communication in which only rare, long-lived and mostly extrusion-driven encounters are productive, offering a unifying framework for how chromosome dynamics control transcription in single cells.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_192642;TMCG-3_213782;320030-236070;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 1305-2024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification1 to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) as well as from local ER- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

While single features showed high noise and low separability of ground-truth cell types, supervised machine learning revealed that integrating time-resolved features robustly predicts final cell fate.

Key discriminants included normalized Z-position, membrane-nucleus offset, and absolute experimental time, whereas movement contributed minimally to the results.

Synteny, the conservation of gene order along a chromosome, presents a promising alternative source of phylogenetic information that is potentially less prone to these issues. Here we compare sequence and synteny phylogenetic phylogenomic approaches to unravel the evolutionary history of Cypriniformes, one of the most species-rich lineages of freshwater fishes. This clade has been plagued by uncertainty, particularly concerning the phylogenetic relationships between its four major subclades: Gyrinocheilidae (algae eaters), Catostomidae (suckers), Cobitoidei (loaches), and Cyprinoidei (minnows and carps). Phylogenomic approaches require high-quality genomic resources, which have been lacking for the family Gyrinocheilidae, a key lineage for understanding cypriniform evolution. To address this, we generated the first chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation for the Chinese Algae Eater (Gyrinocheilus aymonieri). We utilized this new genome along with 42 other fish genomes to conduct comprehensive phylogenomic analyses and compare results from sequence-based methods with a microsynteny-based approach. Although chromosome-level macrosynteny is broadly conserved among cypriniforms, we demonstrate that microsynteny has impressive power to resolve deep phylogenetic nodes. Both sequence-based and microsynteny-based analyses find that Gyrinocheilidae is the sister lineage to all other cypriniforms, resolving a long-standing phylogenetic point of contention. However, while sequence-based analyses provided weak support for the relationships among the remaining subclades, our microsynteny analysis revealed a novel and strongly supported sister relationship between Catostomidae and Cyprinoidei. This conclusion is supported by a 3- to 12-fold greater number of shared microsynteny clusters (synapomorphies) compared to the alternative topologies. We also demonstrate that microsynteny synapomorphies often arise from gene family expansions. Conservation of synteny concentrated in specific genomic regions may harbor the genomic underpinnings of the unique aspects of these clades and have played an important role in the evolutionary history of these taxa. Together, these results provide a robust phylogenomic backbone for Cypriniformes. More broadly, our findings highlight the power of microsynteny to resolve recalcitrant phylogenetic nodes where sequence data is uninformative, while also underscoring the critical importance of high-quality reference genomes, as our work also shows that including fragmented assemblies can lead to spurious results. Beyond phylogenomics, our results also provide a functional genomics glimpse into how conserved, clade-specific blocks of collinear genes (synteny synapomorphies) might contribute to what makes this hyperdiverse clade so unique and evolutionarily successful.","[{""name"":""University at Buffalo, State University of New York"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01y64my43"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TJK laboratory startup funds;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

Although pain states increase vulnerability to opioid use disorders, the neural mechanisms underlying this interaction remain incompletely understood. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a key site for opioid actions, and emerging evidence suggests that pain states and opioid experience both induce transcriptional, molecular, and circuit adaptations in the VTA that contribute to motivated behaviors. However, the transcriptional responses of distinct VTA cell types to each of these factors (alone or in combination) have not been identified. Here, we employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to comprehensively define transcriptional alterations in the rat VTA to acute morphine administration in a chronic inflammatory pain model. We report that morphine induces gene expression changes primarily in glial cells and dopamine neurons, with minimal effects in other neuronal cell types. Surprisingly, VTA astrocytes and oligodendrocytes exhibited the most robust transcriptional responses to opioid exposure, despite lacking detectable opioid receptor expression. Among the most highly regulated glial genes was Fkbp5, which encodes a co-chaperone protein that acts in concert with heat shock proteins to modulate stress responses. Using pharmacological and CRISPR-based approaches in rat glial cells and human astrocytes, we demonstrate that regulation of Fkbp5 is mediated indirectly through glucocorticoid signaling rather than direct opioid receptor activation. These findings reveal that glial cells within reward circuits undergo profound transcriptional reprogramming in response to opioids through indirect, stress-hormone mediated mechanisms, highlighting a previously unappreciated non-neuronal contribution to opioid-induced neural adaptations.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01DA053743;R01DA054714;K99MH127244;""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Neurobiology of Brain Disorders Award;""},{""name"":""UAB Center for Addiction and Pain Prevention and Intervention"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pilot Award;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

For example, someone talking about their hand is not referring to the other speakers hand, but the word ""hand"" still carries speaker-general information (e.g., having five fingers). These two requirements impose a cross-speaker generalization / differentiation dilemma that is not well addressed by existing theories. We hypothesized that the brain resolves the dilemma by use of a vectorial semantic code that blends collinear and orthogonal coding subspaces. To test this hypothesis, we examined semantic encoding in populations of hippocampal single neurons recorded during conversations between epilepsy patients and healthy partners in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU). We found clear semantic encoding for both spoken and heard words, with strongest encoding just around the time of utterance for production, and just after it for reception. Crucially, hippocampal neurons codes for word meaning were poised between orthogonalized and collinearized. Moreover, different semantic categories were orthogonalized to different degrees; body parts and names were most differentiated between speakers; function words and verbs were least differentiated. Finally, the hippocampus used the same coding principle to separate different partners in three-person conversations, with greater orthogonalization between self and other than between two others. Together, these results suggest a new solution to the problem of binding word meanings with speaker identity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

In the brain parenchyma, it is executed by microglia, which are encumbered by large numbers of apoptotic debris generated during development, in adult neurogenic niches, aging, and brain diseases. Emerging evidence suggest that phagocytosis is not limited to garbage disposal, but triggers adaptations in the phagocytes that may have a functional impact. To test it we developed an in vivo model of superphagocytosis induced by low cranial irradiation (LCI, 2Gy) that specifically induced apoptosis in the neurogenic niche of the adult hippocampus, synchronizing microglia in a phagocytic state within 6h and leading to full clearance by 24h. Single cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics revealed an unexpected oxidative stress in post-phagocytic microglia, accompanied by catabolic shutdown, mitochondrial remodeling, increased expression of galectin 3, and production of polyamines that led to cell death and compensatory proliferation. To test whether these changes impaired subsequent microglial phagocytosis, we used a glioblastoma model treated with sequential irradiation to induce tumor cell apoptosis. The phagocytosis efficiency of tumor-associated microglia/macrophages was comparable in the first and second apoptotic challenge, suggesting that the metabolic remodeling induced by phagocytosis was adaptive and destined to sustain their functionality. Finally, we assessed the functional impact of post-phagocytosis adaptations using galectin 3 deficient mice under LCI. We found that the recovery of the neurogenic niche after LCI strongly depended on galectin 3, demonstrating the regenerative capacity of post-phagocytic microglia. Overall, our data unveils the complexity of post-phagocytosis adaptations in microglia, underscoring their unexplored therapeutic potential in brain disorders.","[{""name"":""Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation Competitiveness"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RTI2018-099267-B-I00;PID2022-136698OB-I00;RYC-2013-12817;""},{""name"":""Basque Government"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00pz2fp31"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IT1473-22;PIBA 2020_1_0030;""},{""name"":""Tatiana Foundation Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P-048-FTPGB 2018;""},{""name"":""Alzheimer's Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0375f4d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AARG-NTF-24-1304352;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

We analyzed 4,101 strains, representing 70 species, collected from grapevine- and oak-associated substrates at 17 vineyard and 20 non-vineyard sites in the USA and Slovenia. Species frequency varied with geography and substrate, but the majority of species commonly present in vineyards were also found in non-vineyard arboreal environments, representing a potential source for vineyard colonization and exploitation of sugar from grapes. Species varied in both copper and sulfite resistance, but only Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed elevated resistance in vineyard compared to non-vineyard samples.

Sideways locomotion is a defining feature of true crabs (Brachyura) and may have contributed to their ecological success. Yet, the evolutionary origin of this unique behavior remains unknown. Here we show that the prevalence of sideways locomotion in true crabs reflects a single evolutionary origin from a forward-moving ancestor. Our behavioral analysis of 50 live crab species indicates that crab locomotion can be separated into two distinct types, sideways and forward locomotion, with no intermediates. The phylogenetic comparative analysis revealed a single origin of sideways locomotion, with multiple independent reversions to forward locomotion in ecologically specialized groups. The species richness data show that the lineage in which sideways locomotion originated is far more diverse than its nearest outgroups. These results suggest that sideways locomotion acted as a key innovation, potentially promoting adaptive radiation by enabling true crabs to exploit a wide range of ecological niches. Such a rare but innovative behavioral trait provides a framework for understanding how locomotor modes shape evolutionary diversification in animals.","[{""name"":""Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from The Japan Science Society"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-4086;2025-4060;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

However, the conditions and mechanisms that lead to the robust induction of respiratory IgA responses following mucosal vaccination remain poorly understood. It is also currently debatable whether mucosal vaccination is still warranted given that most individuals in developed countries have established a hybrid immunity from vaccination and infection. Here we characterized respiratory mucosal immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination or both in humans. We found that hybrid immunity resulted in moderately increased respiratory IgA and neutralizing antibody responses compared to infection or vaccination alone. However, a direct comparison of hybrid immunity and a mucosal adenovirus-based booster vaccination in animal models revealed that respiratory booster immunization elicited markedly stronger and more durable respiratory IgA, T cell response, and protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, supporting the promise of respiratory mucosal vaccination. Mechanistically, we found that mucosal booster immunization induced local IgA- secreting cells in the respiratory mucosa, aided by pulmonary CD4+ T cells in situ. Strikingly, local IL-21-producing Blimp-1+ Th1 effector cells were critical in mediating the CD4+ T cell help for respiratory IgA production. Furthermore, lung macrophages were important for this respiratory IgA response via the production of TGF-{beta}. Consequently, we demonstrated delivery of adenoviral booster to the lower airway was necessary to generate robust upper and lower airway IgA responses. Collectively, our results uncover a local cellular network supporting enhanced respiratory IgA responses, with implications for the development of optimal mucosal immunization strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid.

This necessitates continuous RBC production, resulting in [~]200 billion new RBCs made per day to maintain oxygen delivery. Despite this enormous biosynthetic demand, the metabolic pathways supporting erythropoiesis are poorly understood. We profiled metabolites across four independent models of elevated erythropoiesis and a consistent increase in aspartate levels emerged when compared to controls. This suggested a potential role for aspartate metabolism in RBC production. To test this, we deleted the aspartate aminotransferases Got1 or Got2 globally or in an erythroid-specific manner. Loss of either enzyme resulted in anemia, with Got2 deficiency producing a more severe phenotype. Individual loss of either Got or dual Got deletion led to an erythroid defect, where early progenitors accumulated. In human and mouse models of erythropoiesis, GOT1 and GOT2 loss had opposing impacts on aspartate despite exhibiting similar anemic phenotypes, suggesting an aspartate-independent function for these enzymes. GOT1 and GOT2 are also components of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), which regulates NAD(H) homeostasis. However, conditional deletion of another MAS enzyme, Mdh1, did not cause anemia, and alleviating NADH reductive stress in GOT2-deficient cells with cytoplasmic bacterial NADH oxidase (LbNOX) failed to restore erythropoiesis. Instead, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses revealed dysregulation of chromatin histone modifications in GOT-deficient erythroid cells, implicating epigenetic dysfunction as a driver of defective erythropoiesis.

To investigate how task similarity and training regime interact during learning, we trained participants on spatial and conceptual learning tasks that shared either similar or distinct underlying structures, using either interleaved or blocked regimes. Interleaving the two tasks hindered performance when their structures were similar, compared to when they were different. In contrast, blocked training produced the opposite effect: it improved performance and facilitated transfer across similar tasks. This effect, however, emerged only when participants first learned the conceptual task, followed by the spatial task, suggesting an asymmetric interaction between task order and structural similarity.

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors1-5, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

Recent advances in conventional single-particle techniques have enabled the determination of an in-creasing number of structures smaller than 100 kDa, achieving resolutions relevant to drug research. Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions. We envision that this method will further lower the molecular weight limit of single-particle cryo-EM, enabling its application to important drug-binding complexes that are below 50 kDa.","[{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759183739549

Human participants learned sequences of environments in immersive virtual reality. They then learned novel environment transitions connecting previously separate sequences. During subsequent fMRI, participants predicted multiple steps into the future in both the newly connected sequence and control sequences that remained separate. The hippocampus integrated representations of the connected sequence, such that activity patterns became more similar across trials for the connected sequence vs. the unconnected sequences. These integrated sequence representations in the hippocampus emerged soon after learning, incorporated representations of the initial sequences as well as new activity patterns not previously present in either sequence, and predicted participants ability to update their predictions in behavior.

However, this knowledge is fragmented across resources and often is not directly accessible for analytical methods. We developed OmniPath (https://omnipathdb.org/), a database combining diverse molecular knowledge from 168 resources. It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

This study identified more than 421 million single-nucleotide variants and indels and more than 600 million copy-number and structural variants. Small variants had 756 million molecular effects annotated. Of 7.7 million polymorphic variants having an allele frequency (AF) of more than 5% in EGP, 1,348 have a predicted deleterious effect on a protein. Characterization with respect to global variation shows that EGP represents a genetic continuum encompassing the range of African, Asian, and European populations. It is best described by two Arabian, an Eurasian, and an African component, with the predominant Arabian component linked to mitochondrial haplogroups J and T that are commonly attributed to the Middle East. Various aneuploidies of sex chromosomes were detected in 93 individuals overall, and aneuploidy of chromosome 21 was identified in 41 individuals. Median inbreeding coefficient and cumulative runs of homozygosity (ROHs) lengths were increased due to extensive consanguinity, were largest in the groups with Arabian main ancestry components, and were higher than reported for Qatar. Families were identified based on genetic relatedness and classified into 264 families with unrelated parents and 247 families with third- and fourth-degree consanguineous parents. Representative consanguineous pedigrees of families in EGP were outlined. Cumulative ROHs were affected by the main ancestry component and significantly increased in offspring of consanguineous parents, with a pronounced difference between 3rd and 4th-degree relatedness. Investigation of cumulative AFs of variants causing Mendelian diseases highlighted genes related to alpha- and beta-thalassemia (HBB, HBA2) and showed a high burden of variants causing severe recessive diseases, metabolic and retinal disorders, and hearing loss. In summary, EGP represents a landmark effort in characterizing the genetic diversity of the Emirati population, leveraging the largest Middle Eastern cohort reported to date.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759183739549
