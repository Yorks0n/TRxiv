MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1744063819484

Many recent studies have quantified their adverse events with a focus on gastrointestinal adverse events. However, no large epidemiologic study has investigated the risk of hair loss with these medications. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of hair loss. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone. The adjusted hazard ratio for hair loss for all patients using semaglutide, for men, and for women compared to bupropion-naltrexone were 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.86-2.69), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.05-14.49), and 2.08 (95% CI: 1.17-3.72) respectively. Our results demonstrate an increased risk of hair loss with semaglutide in women. Future studies are required to ascertain the association between semaglutide and hair loss.","NA","medrxiv",1744063819484

While previous studies have focused on characterizing PASC and identifying its subphenotypes in children and adolescents following an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, the risks of PASC with Omicron-variant reinfections remain unclear. Using a real-world data approach, this study investigates the risks of PASC following reinfections during the Omicron phase in the pediatric population.

OBJECTIVETo investigate the risks of PASC diagnosis and 24 PASC symptoms and conditions after reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 during Omicron period in the pediatric population.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 40 childrens hospitals and health institutions in U.S. between January 2022 and October 2023.

EXPOSURESA second SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) or antigen tests, or a diagnose of COVID-19, occurring at least 60 days after the initial infection, compared to the initial infection.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESPASC was identified using two approaches: (1) the ICD-10- CM diagnosis code U09.9 and (2) a symptom-based definition including 24 physician-identified symptoms and conditions. Absolute risks of incident PASC were reported, and relative risks (RRs) were calculated by comparing the second infection episode with the first infection episode groups using a modified Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through exact matching and propensity scoring matching.

RESULTSA total of 465,717 individuals under 21 years old (mean [SD] age 8.17 [6.58] years; 52% male) were included. Compared to the first infection, a second infection was associated with significantly increased risk of an overall PASC diagnosis (RR, 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-2.59), and with many specific conditions including: myocarditis (RR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.46-8.86); changes in taste and smell (RR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.41-5.67); thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism (RR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.71-3.04); heart disease (RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.69 to 2.28); acute kidney injury (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.38 to 2.61); fluid and electrolyte (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.62 to 2.20); generalized pain (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.48 to 1.95); arrhythmias (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.45-1.74); abnormal liver enzyme (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.96); fatigue and malaise (RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.64); musculoskeletal pain (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.37 to 1.54); abdominal pain (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.34 to 1.50); postural orthostatic tachycardia syndromes (POTS)/dysautonomia (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.51); cognitive functions (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.50); and respiratory signs and symptoms (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.33). The risks were consistent across various organ systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEChildren and adolescents face significantly higher risk of various PASC outcomes after reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest a cumulative risk of PASC and highlight the urgent need for targeted prevention strategies to reduce reinfections, which includes an increased emphasis on initial or re-vaccination of children.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDo children and adolescents face an increased risk of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) following reinfection during the Omicron era?

FindingsDuring the post-acute phase, children and adolescents with reinfection are at statistically significant increased risk of incident PASC outcomes, including an overall PASC diagnosis and 24 most commonly complaints/symptoms/diagnoses associated with PASC. The risks remained consistent across different demographic and clinical subgroups.

MeaningThese findings underscore the significant long-term health risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in children and adolescents. Public health strategies should prioritize reinfection prevention, including enhanced vaccination efforts, to mitigate the burden of PASC in the pediatric population.","NA","medrxiv",1744063819484

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

Microglial mutations are directly linked to many neurodevelopmental (e.g., schizophrenia) and neurodegenerative (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) disorders, indicating the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of microglia for treating these conditions. Currently, we lack robust molecular tools to specifically image and manipulate microglia in vivo, which presents a major hurdle in our understanding of the brain-wide functions of these cells during the early onset of brain diseases. Here, we describe a molecular technology for imaging and manipulation of homeostatic microglia in live organisms (e.g., in zebrafish and mice) by covalently targeting the purinergic receptor, P2RY12. Using this technology, we imaged microglia-pathogen interactions in the larval zebrafish brain and revealed various morphological states of microglia in the adult mouse brain. We further expanded the microglia labelling approach to single-microglia tracking and microglial surfaceome mapping using photoactivatable fluorophores and photoproximity labelling, respectively. We anticipate the use of this universal tool for studying microglial biology across species to reveal the dynamics and polarization of resting microglia into a reactive state found in many neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

The effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in adolescents in real-world settings is not well understood. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in adolescents aged 12 to 20 years given within the first five days of acute COVID-19 illness on illness severity during the acute (days 0 to 27) and post-acute phases (days 28 to 179). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This target trial emulation used the electronic health records (EHR) data from twenty-nine medical institutions participating in the NIH's RECOVER consortium. We included data collected between April 1, 2022 and December 31, 2023, and included all patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not hospitalized on the day of entry. Those who were treated with oral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days after the positive test (n=2,923) and those who did not received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days after the positive test during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection (control group, n=31,947) were identified. EXPOSURES Treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir based on prescription records. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We used modified Poisson regression models for binary outcomes to examine the effects of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir on acute phase hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visits, and outpatient visits as well as progression to moderate or severe acute illness among individuals treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir compared to control counterparts. Additionally, we assessed the medication's associations with 16 conditions and symptoms during the acute phase of illness and its subsequent association with specific Long COVID diagnostic code U09.9 during the post-acute phase. We reported the absolute risks and estimated the relative risks (RRs), with adjustments made for demographic variables, clinical characteristics, and healthcare utilization, using propensity score matching. RESULTS The study cohort included 34,870 adolescents (median [Q1, Q3] age 16.0 [14.0, 18.0]); 46.0% male and 43.2% Non-Hispanic White. Among these patients, 2,923 were treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days of cohort entry and 31,947 received no treatment. The absolute rates were 0.58% vs. 0.96% for hospitalization, 74.17% vs. 82.66% for outpatient visits, 1.81% vs. 2.28% for ED visits, 3.08% vs. 3.99% for moderate/severe acute illness, and 0.21% vs. 0.20% for long COVID diagnosis in the treatment vs. control group. After propensity score matching, during acute-phase period, compared to the control group, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was associated with reduced risk of any hospitalization (relative risk (RR) 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29-0.80), outpatient visit (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.82-0.90), and moderate/severe acute illness (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.56-0.87). Additionally, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was associated with reduced risk of 7 of 16 specified conditions in chest pain (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.26-0.63), fatigue and malaise (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.32-0.76), generalized pain (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.45-0.95), headache (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.44-0.83), mental health (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.39-0.80), musculoskeletal (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.94), and respiratory signs and symptoms (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52-0.71). No evidence was found to suggest that the treatment was associated with the risk of long COVID diagnosis U09.9 (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.40-2.32). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found that treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in adolescents within 5 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection, was associated with reduced risk of acute-phase COVID-19 illness and subsequent healthcare utilization.

The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of PASC remains elusive, largely due to the lack of suitable animal models that replicate key clinical and pathological features, especially in survivors of acute infection. Here, we employed the Omicron BA.1-infected AC70 hACE2 Tg mice to explore the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Our findings in the AC70/BA.1 model demonstrated that surviving mice developed lasting neurological sequelae of COVID-19, making it a promising platform for studying the pathogenesis of neuro- or long-COVID. Histopathological examinations revealed a transient pulmonary inflammatory response that correlated with the levels of live virus, whereas neuroinflammation within the brains persisted and progressed beyond the acute phase, without a clear linkage to direct virus effects. We showed that the severity of neurological sequelae directly correlated with the degree of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disruption, alterations in tight junctions (TJs) and fibrinogen extravasation into the brain parenchyma. Additionally, BA.1-infected mice elicited a sustained systemic prothrombotic state, with dysregulated coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways in an organ-specific manner, as evidenced by distinct pattern of intracellular fibrin(ogen) depositions, elevated d-dimers, and tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) expression in the lungs and brains. We also found a positive correlation between progressive neuroinflammation and t-PA expression, which was closely co-localized with Iba-1-positive cells, indicating that activated microglia may serve as an additional source of t-PA in the CNS. Lastly, we showed that BA.1 variant triggered prolonged anti-Annexin A2 (ANXA2) autoantibody production. ANXA2 is essential for the neurovascular system, coordinating multiply dynamic processes within the endothelium, including cell surface fibrinolysis and TJ assembly. Our analysis revealed that impaired TJ structures coexisted with diminished ANXA2 levels around the brain vessels, suggesting its involvement in BBB dysfunction and neuroinflammation.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

This study details the clinical process development and application of an OSC product, known as Fertilo, to improve the in vitro maturation (IVM) of human oocytes, a method referred to as OSC-IVM. First, transcription factor (TF) mediated OSC differentiation using research-grade raw materials was shown to produce granulosa-like cells that improve the MII maturation rate of human oocytes. To support clinical application, several raw material upgrades were initiated, including substitution of the differentiation matrix with a higher-quality alternative, laminin-521, and the generation of a clinically suitable hiPSC seed bank and master cell bank. Single cell RNA sequencing of OSCs generated using the updated protocol for clinical translation demonstrated the consistency and reproducibility of cellular outcomes. Next, analytical release testing of the clinical product was performed and a murine oocyte maturation assay was developed to establish the potency of OSCs for use in OSC-IVM. Finally, the qualified Fertilo product was applied in a two-phase longitudinal cohort analysis, with the results showing improvement in key outcomes compared to traditional IVM treatment.

However, the mechanism of ribosome recruitment to mRNA start sites strikingly differs between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The eukaryotic small (40S) ribosomal subunit binds 5' end caps and scans for the start codon while the bacterial small (30S) subunit directly binds to the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) motif close to the initiation site. Pioneer studies have shown rare 30S loading events further upstream within 5' untranslated regions (5'UTRs), at ribosome standby sites (1-3). Together with the frequent occurrence of long bacterial mRNA 5'UTRs and degenerated SD sequences, this indicates that the 30S subunit might bind upstream of the SD more commonly than currently thought. We therefore developed 30S-seq to map 30S-mRNA interactions in a bacterial transcriptome (Escherichia coli), inspired by translation complex profile sequencing (TCP-seq) previously used in eukaryotes (4,5). Our results provide new and unsuspected insights into the behaviour of 30S and 70S complexes during the canonical translation initiation process. Notably, 30S subunits are recruited upstream of the start codon, primed to receive the SD released by the departing 70S ribosome. Remarkably, we also find hundreds of non-canonical 30S binding sites within mRNA 5'UTRs, sometimes over 100 nucleotides upstream of the start region. We validated several of these upstream ribosome binding sites, and demonstrated their strong impact on gene expression.

Recent advances, including RoseTTAFold-AA and AlphaFold3, have extended structure prediction models to work with small molecules, nucleic acids, ions, and covalent modifications. We present BoltzDesign1, which inverts the Boltz-1 model, an open source reproduction of AlphaFold3, to enable the design of protein binders for diverse molecular targets without requiring model fine-tuning. By utilizing only the Pairformer and Confidence modules, our method significantly reduces computational costs while achieving outstanding in silico success rates and diversity in binder generation. Optimizing directly on the distogram allows us to shape the probability distribution of atomic distances, rather than adjusting a single structure, steering the design toward sequences that yield robust structures with well-defined energy minima. By leveraging a fully atomic model trained on a wide variety of macromolecules, we can generate diverse heterocomplexes with flexible ligand conformations a capability not currently matched by existing methods. This approach enables the design of novel protein interactions with potential applications in biosensors, enzyme engineering, therapeutic development, and biotechnological innovations.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Early studies of mtDNA variation provided the first genetic evidence for the African origin of modern humans. With complete mitochondrial genome sequencing, we can now reconstruct maternal lineages with high resolution, yet large parts of the continent remain underrepresented. Using a newly developed long-range sequencing assay, we generated 1,288 complete mitochondrial genomes from 14 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on previously understudied regions. We combined these with over 3,600 publicly available African mitogenomes to produce a comprehensive dataset and updated overview of maternal genetic diversity across the continent. We contextualized this diversity with autosomal structure and information on major human expansions, integrating archaeological and linguistic evidence. Our analyses reveal a demographic expansion of Niger-Congo speakers around 17 thousand years ago (kya), followed by a second expansion associated with Bantu-speaking groups around 6 kya. We identify haplogroup L3e as a key marker of this early Bantu expansion, tracking its spread across sub-Saharan Africa. Distinct demographic signatures also emerge for different geographic sub-branches of Bantu speakers. These findings highlight the power of mitochondrial DNA to trace maternal ancestry and demographic history in Africa, while also acknowledging its limitations for phylogeographic reconstruction.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Particularly for transcriptional enhancers, deep learning models excel at deciphering sequence features and grammar that underlie their spatiotemporal activity. To enable end-to-end enhancer modeling and design, we developed a software and modeling package, called CREsted. It combines preprocessing starting from single-cell ATAC-seq data; modeling with a choice of several architectures for training classification and regression models on either topics or pseudobulk peak heights; sequence design using multiple strategies; and downstream analysis through a collection of tools to locate transcription factor (TF) binding sites, infer the effect of a TF (activating or repressing) on enhancer accessibility, decipher enhancer grammar, and score gene loci. We demonstrate CREsted using a mouse cortex model that we validate using the BICCN collection of in vivo validated mouse brain enhancers. Classical enhancers in immune cells, including the IFNB1 enhanceosome are revisited using a PBMC model, and we assess the accuracy of TF binding site predictions with ChIP-seq. Additionally, we use CREsted to compare mesenchymal-like cancer cell states between tumor types; and we investigate different fine-tuning strategies of Borzoi within CREsted, comparing their performance and explainability with CREsted models trained from scratch. Finally, we train a CREsted model on a scATAC-seq atlas of zebrafish development and use this to design and in vivo validate cell type-specific synthetic enhancers in three tissues. For varying datasets, we demonstrate that CREsted facilitates efficient training and analyses, enabling scrutinization of the enhancer logic and design of synthetic enhancers across tissues and species.

We confirmed their dominant role for adhesion by studying mutants where those edges are defective and through direct mechanical testing.

Most land plants form arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, an ancient trait for enhanced nutrition that was convergently lost in some clades. Carnivory, another nutritional trait, is a more recent adaptation that has convergently arisen in several angiosperm orders. The two biotic interactions similarly help plants acquire mineral nutrients, raising the question of whether they can coexist. However, the mycorrhizal status of carnivorous plants has long remained speculative. Here, we surveyed the occurrence of AM-associated genes in five angiosperm orders harbouring carnivorous species, revealing convergent losses of the AM trait either coincident with or predating the emergence of carnivory. Exceptionally, the carnivorous plant species Roridula gorgonias retains symbiosis-related genes and forms arbuscules upon inoculation assays, demonstrating the two nutritional strategies, although rare, can coexist. The youngest carnivorous lineage, Brocchinia reducta, showed signatures of the early stages of AM trait loss, as reflected by its gene retention and AM colonization patterns. An AM-associated CHITINASE gene encodes a digestive enzyme in the Australian pitcher plant Cephalotus, suggesting gene co-option. These findings illuminate the largely unexplored processes by which plant nutritional strategies evolve and supplant one another over time.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) protein translates the sensing of cytosolic DNA by cGAS (cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase) into an inflammatory response. However, the molecular mechanisms whereby cytosolic DNA-induced cGAS-STING pathway leads to aging remain poorly understood. We show that STING does not follow the canonical pathway of activation in human fibroblasts passaged (aging) in culture, senescent fibroblasts, or progeria fibroblasts (from Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome patients). Despite cytosolic DNA buildup, features of the canonical cGAS-STING pathway like increased cGAMP production, STING phosphorylation, and STING trafficking to perinuclear compartment are not observed in progeria/senescent/aging fibroblasts. Instead, STING localizes at endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear envelope, and chromatin. Despite the non-conventional STING behavior, aging/senescent/progeria cells activate inflammatory programs such as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and the interferon (IFN) response, in a cGAS and STING-dependent manner, revealing a non-canonical pathway in aging. Importantly, progeria/aging/senescent cells are hindered in their ability to activate the canonical cGAS-STING pathway with synthetic DNA, compared to young cells. This deficiency is rescued by activating vitamin D receptor signaling, unveiling new mechanisms regulating the cGAS-STING pathway in aging. Significantly, in HGPS, inhibition of the non-canonical cGAS-STING pathway ameliorates cellular hallmarks of aging, reduces tissue degeneration, and extends the lifespan of progeria mice. Our study reveals that a new feature of aging is the progressively reduced ability to activate the canonical cGAS-STING pathway in response to cytosolic DNA, triggering instead a non-canonical pathway that drives senescence/aging phenotypes.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Domestication of its wild progenitor, the African wildcat (F. lybica), is widely attributed to the emergence of farming. Wildcats are said to have been attracted to settled communities by the rodent populations that were thriving within this new agricultural niche. Some claim the African wildcat even reached Europe during the Neolithic, though many credit the Romans with their dispersal. Through a program of zooarchaeological analysis, genetic identification and radiocarbon dating, we redefine the established chronology for the cats domestication and dispersal across Europe. We argue that early human-cat relationships were more complex than the commensal and mutualistic pathways that have been proposed, and that both the domestication and translocation of cats were linked to its association with deities. Our results suggest domestic cats first arrived in Europe prior to Roman expansion during the early first millennium BCE, and that successive populations of domestic cats with unique mitochondrial signatures were introduced during the Roman, Late Antique and Viking periods. Lastly, by characterising the spatiotemporal representation of both domestic cats and the native European wildcat (F. silvestris), we argue that the introduction of domestic cats precipitated a decline in native European wildcat populations.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is a highly conserved signaling cascade that restores ER homeostasis by countering ER protein overload. Transcriptional response is paramount for UPR signaling and negating ER stress. While multiple UPR-linked mRNAs are post-transcriptionally regulated, the mechanisms mediating this regulation are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the highly conserved RNA-binding protein IGF2BP3 interacts with transcripts encoding a subset of UPR effectors. During ER stress, IGF2BP3 destabilized many of these target transcripts, including UPR targets. In contrast, IGF2BP3 stabilized mRNAs encoding transcriptional regulators and thereby upregulated expression of UPR target genes. This dual regulation allows IGF2BP3 to differentially upregulate stress response genes while tuning down the expression of other transcripts during ER stress, relieving protein folding load during this critical response. Our data reveal that posttranscriptional mechanisms control transcription, thus forming gene regulatory networks that robustly tune the UPR.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Transposable elements (TEs) are increasingly recognized as contributors to genome evolution, but their role in shaping neural crest regulatory programs remains underexplored. Here, we investigate the domestication of human-specific TEs as transcriptional enhancers during cranial neural crest cell (CNCC) specification, a process critical for vertebrate head development. Using human iPSC-derived CNCCs, we identified ~250 human-specific TEs acting as active enhancers. These TEs were predominantly LTR5Hs and, to a lesser extent, SVA-E/Fs. We demonstrate that these elements have been co-opted through the acquisition of the conserved CNCC coordinator motif, and are bound by the CNCC signature factor TWIST1, and that their co-option appears to be largely exclusive to CNCCs. To assess their functional relevance, we used CRISPR-interference to repress ~75% of all the LTR5Hs and SVAs active in CNCCs, which led to widespread transcriptional changes in genes associated with neural crest migration, a process essential for CNCCs to populate the embryo and form craniofacial structures. Using a cell migration assay, we showed that CNCC migration was significantly impaired by CRISPR-mediated TE repression. Finally, we demonstrate that genes near human-specific TEs are more highly expressed in human CNCCs relative to chimpanzee, and TE repression returns their expression to chimpanzee levels. These findings reveal how human-specific TEs have been co-opted to fine-tune CNCC regulatory networks, potentially contributing to the evolution of lineage-specific craniofacial traits.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

While abnormal crossover recombination is known to confer risk for aneuploidy, limited data have hindered understanding of the potential shared genetic basis of these key molecular phenotypes. To address this gap, we performed retrospective analysis of preimplantation genetic testing data from 139,416 in vitro fertilized embryos from 22,850 sets of biological parents. By tracing transmission of haplotypes, we identified 3,656,198 crossovers, as well as 92,485 aneuploid chromosomes. Counts of crossovers were lower in aneuploid versus euploid embryos, consistent with their role in chromosome pairing and segregation. Our analyses further revealed that a common haplotype spanning the meiotic cohesin SMC1B is significantly associated with both crossover count and maternal meiotic aneuploidy, with evidence supporting a non-coding cis-regulatory mechanism. Transcriptome- and phenome-wide association tests also implicated variation in the synaptonemal complex component C14orf39 and crossover-regulating ubiquitin ligases CCNB1IP1 and RNF212 in meiotic aneuploidy risk. More broadly, recombination and aneuploidy possess a partially shared genetic basis that also overlaps with reproductive aging traits. Our findings highlight the dual role of recombination in generating genetic diversity, while ensuring meiotic fidelity.","NA","medrxiv",1744063819484

We provide evidence from full-genome data that the carnivorous family that Pinguicula belongs to, the Lentibulariaceae, is most closely related to the Acanthaceae. We also report multiple tandem duplications of candidate digestive enzyme genes, including a putative tandem duplication of cysteine proteases that is syntenic with two cysteine protease tandem duplication in Utricularia gibba that contain genes with trap specific expression.

Despite their utility, no gnotobiotic systems have been established to investigate the role of antimicrobial effector proteins in the interactions between plants, their microbiota, and fungal pathogens. Here, we present a refined gnotobiotic system designed to study these interactions, establishing protocols for infections with the fungal pathogen Verticillium dahliae across multiple host plants under sterile conditions. We demonstrate that a synthetic microbial community (SynCom) derived from a culture collection generated for this study can be applied in this system where it interferes with fungal infections.

Comparative genomics offers a powerful framework to explore the dynamics of genomic erosion across species. Here, we analysed the genomes of three species -- the Mauritius parakeet, the Mauritius kestrel, and the pink pigeon -- that experienced extreme and well-documented population bottlenecks. We compared them to 36 species spanning the avian phylogeny, with varied IUCN Red List statuses to investigate the genomic consequences of their demographic collapses. For each species, we assessed nucleotide diversity, genetic load, and runs of homozygosity (ROH), alongside genome synteny and transposable elements. We found a negative correlation between nucleotide diversity and ROH, but neither metric was a good predictor of the species Red List status. Rather, the population effective to census size ratio showed a strong correlation to Red List status. Moreover, species with larger historical effective population sizes showed greater heterozygosity but carried a higher heterozygous load, highlighting the importance of historical demography to assess species vulnerability to genomic erosion. We found significant differences in homozygous load between taxonomic groups of our target species, possibly due to differences in life-history traits and demographic histories. Genome structure analyses revealed differences in transposable elements and genomic rearrangements between groups, suggesting their potential role in shaping genome architecture and adaptive potential across species. Our findings underscore the value of multispecies comparisons in understanding the evolutionary dynamics of genomic erosion and its relevance for biodiversity conservation.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Such empirically determined MSC values often fail to reflect the complexity of natural communities, where susceptibility and resistance-associated fitness costs vary widely across species. To address this limitation, computational approaches have been developed to predict no-effect concentrations for selection of antibiotic resistance (PNECres) from routinely collected minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data. However, these approaches often lack a strong ecological basis, undermining confidence in their predictions. Here, we propose a simple but biologically consistent framework to derive PNECres values by integrating MIC data with probabilistic estimates of resistance-related fitness costs. Our results suggest that current regulatory environmental threshold concentrations should be lowered by at least one order of magnitude to guard against selection for antibiotic resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Recently, engineered versions of these defective interfering particles (DIPs) have been proposed as an HIV-1 therapeutic. However, DIPs have yet to be reported in people with HIV-1 (PWH). Here, we find DIPs in PWH who have a rare, polyclonal form of non-suppressible viremia (NSV). While antiretroviral therapy (ART) rapidly reduces viremia to undetectable levels, some individuals experience sustained viremia due to virus production from cell clones harboring intact or defective proviruses. We characterized the source of NSV in two PWH who never reached undetectable viral load despite ART adherence. Remarkably, in each participant, we found a diverse set of defective viral genomes all sharing the same fatal deletions. We found that this paradoxical accumulation of mutations by viruses with fatal defects was driven by superinfection with intact viruses, resulting in mobilization of defective genomes and accumulation of additional mutations during untreated infection. We show that these defective proviruses interfere with WT virus replication, conditionally replicate, and, in one case, have an R0 > 1, enabling in vivo spread. Despite this, clinical outcomes show no evidence of a beneficial effect of these DIPs.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Beyond their metabolic roles, amino acids have been increasingly recognized as regulators of plant immunity. However, the molecular mechanisms by which amino acids modulate defense responses remain unclear. In this study, we identify a novel function for serine as a defense-priming signal. Serine pretreatment enhances immune gene expression and primes plants for a more rapid and robust response to pathogen infection, resulting in a significant delay in programmed cell death (PCD) during effector-triggered immunity (ETI). We further demonstrate that serine-induced defense activation is mediated by glutamate receptor-like calcium channel 3.4 (GLR3.4), which subsequently activates calcium-dependent protein kinase 5 (CPK5). CPK5 in turn phosphorylates WRKY transcription factors, including WRKY33, to induce key immune genes. Our findings uncover a previously unrecognized serine-initiated signaling pathway that primes plant defense, highlighting both its mechanistic novelty and its potential application in sustainable agriculture. Given that serine is a naturally occurring metabolite, its exogenous application-or the use of structurally similar analogs-may offer a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and non-genetic strategy to enhance disease resistance in crops.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Rich in adipose tissue, the breast exhibits increased adipocyte size in obesity, which correlates with poor prognosis. However, adipocyte size is highly heterogeneous as adipose tissue expands through both hyperplasia and hypertrophy; and adipocyte size can increase independently of weight gain. Despite these observations, the impact of adipocyte size on breast cancer cell behavior remains unclear due to insufficient approaches to isolate adipocytes based on size and maintain them in culture for mechanistic studies. Here, we develop strategies to culture size-sorted adipocytes from two mouse models of obesity and test their functional impact on tumor cell malignancy. We find that large adipocytes are transcriptionally distinct from small adipocytes and are enriched for gene sets related to adipose tissue dysfunction, including altered lipid processing. In coculture studies, large adipocytes promote lipid accumulation in breast cancer cells, and enhance their migration, proliferation, and aerobic metabolism in a manner dependent on fatty acid oxidation. These changes coincide with increased release of extracellular vesicles by large versus small adipocytes, which transfer lipid to recipient tumor cells. Moving forward, our findings suggest that adipocyte size could serve as a prognostic biomarker for women with breast cancer and help identify new therapeutic targets to advance clinical outcomes for these patients.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

To increase the yield of transformants, DNA from the in vitro transposition reaction was amplified using isothermal multiple displacement amplification. The resulting product was first transformed into the high-transformation efficiency DaddAB/ppol strain and then into a wild-type HB27 strain. Tn-seq analysis of the libraries showed that almost all genes contained insertions and the distribution of the number of insertions per gene was unimodal, unlike the bimodal distribution reported in most Tn-seq analyses, thus hindering the discrimination of required or essential genes. Upon comparing the Tn-seq results with gene conservation in pangenomic analysis from Thermus thermophilus to Deiococcota levels, as well as with available HB27 RNA-seq data, we observed a very low correlation between core genes or gene transcription levels and Tn-seq insertion frequency. Notably, many genes largely deemed part of the essential bacterial core, supporting critical cellular pathways, showed relatively high transposon insertion numbers. In the case of DNA repair routes, which are essential but somewhat redundant, our results align well with previously published essentiality data, indicating that many genes are dispensable and permissive to insertions. The analysis of these striking results in the context of Thermus biology suggests that the polyploidy of the Thermus genome and the differential stability of proteins may explain the apparent non-essentiality of key genes.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Hindgut ileal enterocytes resist the damaging detergent SDS and upstream caspase signaling by head-involution-defective (hid). This hid-induced death insensitivity arises early in adulthood and associates with numerous transcriptional changes. We interrogated 82 of these transcriptional changes in a candidate screen for enhancers of hid-induced death in the ileum. Top among our screen hits is an immunoglobulin family cell adhesion gene, CG15312. CG15312 maintains the adhesion protein FasIII on cell membranes. In hid-expressing ileal cells, CG15312 loss causes cell death and pyknotic nuclear clustering. We name this conserved gene low on-membrane fas and enhancer of hid (loofah).

Also, these studies have generally been performed on a limited number of CpGs, and a systematic investigation of iDMR methylation in the general population is lacking. By analysing the iDMRs in a large number of peripheral blood DNA methylation array datasets of unaffected individuals and patients with rare disorders, we determined the most common iDMR methylation profiles and identified many genetic and non-genetic factors contributing to their variability. We found that methylation variability is not homogeneous within the iDMRs and that the CpGs closer to the ZFP57 binding sites are less susceptible to methylation changes.

In vitro fertilisation (IVF) can help some couples conceive, but only ~30% of cycles are successful. One factor affecting IVF efficacy is mitotic-origin (mosaic) aneuploidy in which embryos contain a mixture of cells with different numbers of chromosomes. We previously showed that chromosome segregation error phenotypes are frequent in the first mitotic division of the human embryo. However, the cause of these errors and impact on daughter cell karyotype is unknown. Here, using live chromosome imaging and next generation sequencing we show that activation of the microtubule depolymerase KIF2C reduces chromosome segregation errors and mitotic-origin aneuploidy at the 2-cell stage. The number of first divisions that show alternative cleavage patterns (associated with failed embryo development in IVF clinics) are also reduced with KIF2C activation. Our findings demonstrate that modulation of microtubule dynamics is a potential therapeutic route to improving human embryo quality and IVF outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

To facilitate the cost-effective generation of large scATAC-seq atlases for model training, we developed a new version of the open-source microfluidic system HyDrop with increased sensitivity and scale: HyDrop v2. We generated HyDrop v2 atlases for the mouse cortex and Drosophila embryo development and compared them to atlases generated on commercial platforms. HyDrop v2 data integrates seamlessly with commercially available chromatin accessibility methods (10x Genomics). Differentially accessible regions and motif enrichment across cell types are equivalent between HyDrop-v2 and 10x atlases. Sequence-to-function models trained on either atlas are comparable as well in terms of enhancer predictions, sequence explainability, and transcription factor footprinting.

We show that memory of navigational episodes does not achieve a stable state, but rather continues to transform for many years. Our data suggest that at any given point in time, memory of navigational episodes is a changing combination of episode-independent schematic information with several interacting spatial representations that directly relate to a navigational episode and that show distinct decay rates.

While research addressing the microbial and immunological aspects of the bovine udder is limited, optimizing the udder microbiome has emerged as a promising strategy for preventing mastitis. This longitudinal study aimed to investigate the udder microbiome throughout lactation using both metataxonomic and shotgun metagenomic approaches, including analysis at the metagenome assembled genome (MAG) level. The use of such methodologies provide a deeper understanding of the microbial composition and dynamics within the udder, bridging critical gaps in knowledge and revealing potential interactions between the microbiota and host. Milk samples were collected from 342 individual quarters of 24 Norwegian Red dairy cows. Significant variations in somatic cell count and microbiota composition were observed across lactation stages. Quarters with low somatic cell count (< 100,000 cells/mL) were notably higher during early lactation (80%) and mid-lactation (78.9%) compared to dry-off (53.1%) and late lactation (53%), with high somatic cell count (> 100,000 cells/mL) observed in 20 and 47% of samples. Diversity indices based on Shannon and Simpson metrics indicated significant effects of lactation stage, somatic cell count, and individual animal variability on microbial diversity. PERMANOVA analyses confirmed that individual animal variability (15.73%) and lactation period (5.52%) were the strongest factors influencing microbiota structure, with dysbiosis linked to mastitis-causing pathogens contributing 7.17% of the variance. Key pathogens identified included E. faecalis, S. aureus, S. uberis, and S. chromogenes, with persistent infections observed for S. aureus and S. chromogenes, but not S. uberis. Samples with low somatic cell count were enriched in beneficial genera such as Corynebacterium, Bradyrhizobium, and Lactococcus, while Staphylococcus predominated in milk samples with high somatic cell count. Dimensionality reduction with tSNE and integration with culturomics enhanced milk microbiota classification, providing novel insights into udder microbiota dynamics and their role in bovine mastitis. Metagenomic shotgun sequencing revealed pathogen-specific metabolic signatures in the bovine mammary gland, identifying 289 MetaCyc pathways. Genome-centric analysis reconstructed 142 metagenome-assembled genomes, including 26 from co-assembly and 116 from individual assembly. Multi-locus sequence typing, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance gene profiling provided insights into pathogen adaptation and persistence in the bovine mammary gland. Notably, 27 bacteriocin gene clusters and 322 biosynthetic gene clusters were predicted using genome mining tools. Our findings contribute to the establishment of pathogen based therapies and enhance our understanding of the milk microbiome, which remains far from fully characterized. Such insights are vital for developing effective strategies to combat mastitis and improve dairy cattle health.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Whilst there is evidence of a general intestinal microbial dysbiosis, differences across CP resulting from diverse triggers remains poorly elucidated. Methods In this study, we investigated how different CP triggers, namely alcohol-induced CP (AIP) and CFTR-related CP (CFRP), might undermine differences across microbiota structure and predicted function. Faecal samples from 25 CP participants were collected, alongside 9 healthy controls for microbiota analyses. Both full and short (V4) 16S rRNA sequencing was performed, including predicted functionality using PICRUSt2. Clinical metadata was integrated to investigate relationships with microbiota structure and predicted functionality with ordination-based approaches. Results Microbiota diversity patterns between groups varied slightly by sequencing approach, with differences across common core and rarer satellite taxa diversity evident. Importantly, microbiota compositional profiles were shared between approaches, with control samples clustering closer than CP samples. Between groups, significant differences in microbiota composition were apparent, with the AIP group significantly different to both control and CFRP groups across various microbiota partitions (P < 0.05). Notable genera drove the observed dissimilarity, including Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and Ruminococcus, which were decreased in relative abundance across CP. Predictive functional analyses further demonstrated increased similarity of controls as compared to CP groups. Significant variation across both microbiota structure and predicted function was explained by CP subtype (P < 0.01). When compared back to controls, the relative abundance of various predicted functional pathways from both the core and satellite taxa was significantly different across groups (P < 0.05). Conclusions Overall, we demonstrate that gut microbiota structure and predicted function differs between not only healthy controls and CP, including across CP subtypes themselves. Various taxa with important physiological roles were implicated across CP. Differences in predicted functionality of the core and satellite taxa were evident, relating to microbial processes that may have downstream consequences at the site of the GI tract. Future studies will employ larger cohorts with the incorporation of additional omics-based approaches. This will better elucidate differences in microbiota structure and functionality across CP, including relationships with pancreatic-based clinical outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

To avoid potential environmental contamination, strict disinfection assays were performed. Among 104 mice of the C57BL/6J, BALB/c, and ICR strains purchased from three major experimental animal suppliers in China, 23 mice (22.1%) exhibited a high microbial burden (>1 x 104 CFU/g tissue) in at least one organ, and 42 mice (40.4%) exhibited >1 x 103 CFU/g tissue in at least one organ. In total, 216 microbial species were identified through culturomics. Of them, 56 microbial species were found in the organs of at least three mice of the 42 mice (>1 x 103 CFU/g tissue in at least one organ). Metagenomics analysis of 10 high-burden mice verified the existence of microbes in the mouse organs and identified 262 species.

The emergence of the ancient arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (AMS) was followed by the diversification of alternative mycorrhizal types, including the ericoid mycorrhizae (ErM)3. The evolution of ErM coincides with the emergence of the Ericaceae family of angiosperms and the diversification of leafy liverworts within the order Jungermanniales, as well as their expansion into boreal and high-altitude ecosystem4-6. Despite their evolutionary and ecological relevance, little is known about the molecular and genomic basis of ErM. Here, we sequenced the nuclear genomes of two leafy liverworts from Jungermanniales, and reconstituted ErM under laboratory conditions. We demonstrated the existence of a nutrient-regulated symbiotic state that enables ErM and underlies intracellular colonization of plant tissues. Genome and functional analyses revealed that leafy liverworts retain a conserved suite of functional genes that are required for endosymbiosis in land plants. Comparative transcriptomic analysis under ErM-permissive and restrictive conditions identified gene modules associated with endosymbiosis. Transcriptome sequencing cross-comparisons of ErM and AMS identified a conserved gene module required for the intracellular accommodation of fungal symbionts, marking it as a shared feature across diverse types of land plant symbioses. Our study presents the first genomic resources for leafy liverworts, and provides the first experimental evidence that ErM evolved from AMS. This evolutionary transition involved the co-option of a nutrient-based mechanism for the establishment of ErM, and additionally the co-option of two gene modules essential for signaling and symbiont accommodation during endosymbiosis. Our data offer valuable insights and resources for understanding the molecular basis of ErM and its diversification from AMS in land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

The plant microbiota is generally taxonomically structured. Some of the members can promote plant fitness including growth and stress tolerance. However, microbial imbalance can also result in deleterious effects, a phenomenon known as dysbiosis that was first coined in the gut microbiome field. To unveil the regulatory mechanism to maintain plant homeostatic interaction with microbiota, we performed screening using defined synthetic bacterial communities. We identified an Arabidopsis mutant with altered microbial profiles, an overall increase of microbial load and microbiota-dependent growth defects. Transcriptomic and chemical complementation analyses confirmed that the aforementioned microbiota-dependent phenotypes are contributed by an upregulation of the jasmonate signaling pathway. Upregulation of the jasmonate pathway further promotes microbial growth, possibly forming a positive feedback loop. Even though activation of the jasmonate signaling pathway is known to enhance plant stress tolerance, hyperactivation of the pathway alters plant tolerance or resistance against multiple stressors. Plant association with the microbiota together with proper regulation of the jasmonate signaling pathway are thus essential to maintain plant response to environmental stressors.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

In nature, protein folds are well-conserved over the course of evolution, such that there are 100,000 times as many extant protein sequences than there are folds. Despite their common shapes, similar protein folds can adopt wide-ranging functions, raising the question: are protein folds so strongly conserved for the purpose of maintaining function-driving energetic changes in protein families? Here we show that a set of key energetic relationships in a family of bacterial transcription factors (TFs) is conserved using high-resolution hydrogen exchange/mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations. We compared the TFs to their anciently diverged structural homologs, the periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs), expecting that protein families that share the same fold and bind the same sugars would have similar energetic responses. Surprisingly, our findings reveal the opposite: the ""energetic blueprints"" of the PBPs and the TFs are largely distinct, with the allosteric network of the TFs evolving specifically to support the functional requirements of genome regulation, versus conserved interactions with membrane transport machinery in PBPs. These results demonstrate how the same fold can be adapted for different sense/response functions via family-specific energetic requirements - even when responding to the same chemical trigger. Understanding the evolutionarily conserved energetic blueprint for a protein family provides a roadmap for designing functional proteins de novo, and will help us treat aberrant protein behavior in conserved domains in disease-related drug targets, where engineering selectivity is challenging.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Instead of using a Gaussian-like spot probe ion beam, we characterize the use of the stigmator as quasi-cylindrical lens to create a highly astigmatic beam that we term ""ion knife"". Using the ion knife allows for material ablation by spreading the current over a larger area and changes the dimension of the probe with an anisotropic change in apparent beam resolution, as observed in spot burn cross-sections. We demonstrate a method to approximate beam shapes by imaging that allows for convenient alignment of parameters for beam shaping.

Fine-tuned for various transcription regulation tasks, ChromBERT demonstrates superior performance in imputing previously unseen cistromes and modeling regulatory effects and dynamics in specific cell types. Notably, ChromBERT adapts its TRN representations for cell-type-specific tasks, providing deep insights into the roles of transcription regulators underlying observed regulatory effects or dynamics without requiring cell-type-specific genomic data for each regulator. By overcoming the limitations of sparse transcription regulator data, ChromBERT significantly enhances our ability to model, interpret, and predict transcriptional regulation across diverse biological contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1744063819484

Emerging preclinical data suggests activated EGC have beneficial roles in controlling gut pathophysiology.

ObjectiveUnderstanding EGC activation and adaptation during experimental and clinical IBD.

DesignWe provide the first highly integrated approach to identify EGC activation signature in IBD. Profiling 390 samples from IBD patients via bulk and single-nucleus (sn) transcriptomics and replicate the findings on publicly available bulk and single-cell (sc) datasets from 1160 patients and 19,000 single EGC. Preclinical modelling of Th1/Th17 inflammation, reporter-assisted EGC sorting, analysis of regulated cell death, and Casp8 ablation in EGC was performed

ResultsWe identified novel IBD type and sampling associated EGC activation signature. Specific EGC activation markers were shared in biopsies and resection specimens, and were divergent between Crohns disease and Ulcerative colitis. Preclinical modelling of intestinal inflammation identified combinatorial TNF and IFN-{gamma}-driven activation of EGC, associated with elevated necroptosis, and negatively impacting gut motility. Genetic-reporter-enabled sorting and downstream analyses confirmed TNF and IFN-{gamma}-driven EGC necroptosis, potentiated by Casp8 deficiency. Furthermore, snRNA-Seq from IBD patient samples confirmed elevated cell death signature in activated but not in rare neuroglia progenitor-like cluster.

ConclusionOur findings identify IBD type-associated activated EGC markers involved in immune and epithelial homeoastasis. We uncover necroptosis of activated EGCs as a constituent of intestinal inflammation. Advancing our understanding of activated EGC survival is pivotal in elucidating their complex roles in maintaining gut immune-epithelial homeostasis.

What is already known on this topicActivated EGC have emerged as important contributors in maintaining epithelial, immune and neuronal homeostasis. Increasing evidence from mouse studies points to the role of activated EGC in epithelial regeneration, tolerogenic T-cell activation, relaying psychological stress to the enteric nervous system, post-injury neurogenesis, and helminth clearance. Nevertheless, no consensus has emerged on what might define activated EGC in the context of IBD and how EGC turnover is affected in gut inflammation, limiting translation of their disease associated roles.

What this study addsBy combining bulk with single cell and single nucleus transcriptomes from IBD patients we identified new IBD type- and location-associated EGC activation signatures. Some of these are conserved with mouse EGC in gut inflammation models. We identified osteopontin an immunomodulator and Wnt6 an epithelial morphogen elevated in IBD EGC. We also identified IBD-associated EGC cell clusters, which display higher expression of cell death pathway transcripts. To investigate EGC turnover, we utilized preclinical models and found rapid EGC activation upon Th1/Th17 inflammation. This was associated with elevated EGC activation and caspase-independent necroptotic cell death. Ex vivo experiments showed a combinatorial requirement of IFN-{gamma} and TNF in mediating EGC necroptosis. Our findings were replicated on multiple publicly available sc-RNA sequencing datasets from IBD patients.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyExpanding on the available repertoire of EGC activation markers in IBD, both shared and unique to sampling procedure, disease type, and location will provide researchers with tools to identify EGC homeostasis during IBD. Moreover, the nature of the identified markers will stimulate research into specific EGC pathways triggered in inflammation. Adding to this, the rapid induction in pathological death of activated but not naive EGC upon IFN-{gamma} and TNF stimulation will shed light on EGC adaptation and turnover. Our identification of markers of activated EGC with immuno-modulatory and epithelial-regenerative properties, including osteopontin and wingless family of morphogenes will stimulate further research in EGC-immune and EGC-epithelial communication in the context of IBD.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Other eusocial species, such as bees, ants, and termites, also have long lifespans relative to their solitary kin. We propose that eusociality drives the evolution of longevity through three mechanisms: first, individuals in eusocial populations tend to be older than in non-eusocial populations, and thus genes favoring survival at later ages are more strongly selected; second, slower growth in eusocial populations reduces early mortality from resource scarcity, making longevity more important. Finally, the fitness benefits of long lifespan are stronger when the populations reproductive success rests on the survival of a single individual. Non-eusocial species reproducing in ways that partly access these benefits also have relatively long lifespans. We demonstrate these three mechanisms using mathematical models and computer simulations, highlighting longevity as an evolvable, selectable trait. Our results echo conclusions from Life History Theory but cast them in a new light.

Author summaryWe argue that eusocial populations have higher average ages than exponential ones, and grow more slowly and so have lower mortality from resource limitation. These two properties increase selection for longevity, which is further reinforced by unique ""queen effects"". The success of selection for longevity across eusocial species suggests the existence of multiple mechanisms of senescence--and multiple ways to evade it. This underscores that lifespan is a highly selectable and evolvable trait.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

However, despite this promise, few compounds have been identified that enhance ER proteostasis through defined mechanisms of action. We previously identified the phenylhydrazone-based compound AA263 as a compound that promotes adaptive ER proteostasis remodeling through mechanisms including activation of the ATF6 signaling arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, the protein target(s) of AA263 and the potential for further development of this class of ER proteostasis regulators had not been previously explored. Here, we employ chemical proteomics to demonstrate that AA263 covalently targets a subset of ER protein disulfide isomerases, revealing a molecular mechanism for the activation of ATF6 afforded by this compound. We then use medicinal chemistry to establish next-generation AA263 analogs showing improved potency and efficacy for ATF6 activation, as compared to the parent compound. Finally, we show that treatment with these AA263 analogs enhances secretory pathway proteostasis to correct the pathologic protein misfolding and trafficking of both a destabilized, disease-associated alpha-antitrypsin (A1AT) variant and an epilepsy-associated GABAA receptor variant. These results establish AA263 analogs with enhanced potential for correcting imbalanced ER proteostasis associated with etiologically-diverse protein misfolding disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Three quarters of the tested sweeteners individually impacted growth of at least one bacterial strain. Further, over 100 interactions were found between sweeteners and the four co-consumed compounds. Isosteviol, a commonly used sweetener, and duloxetine, an antidepressant, synergistically inhibited Roseburia intestinalis, a bacterium previously linked to glucose homeostasis, and Parabacteroides merdae, a prevalent commensal linked to healthy microbiota. Proteomic, metabolomic, and genetic analyses indicate altered small molecule transport underpinning this sweetener-drug synergy.

Here, we investigate the evolution of the olfactory system across the Heliconiini butterfly tribe, an ecologically diverse but closely related group. Using a comparative approach, we examined variation in antennal lobe morphology and its constituent structures, the glomeruli and antennal lobe hub, as well as olfactory receptor repertoires across species. We found that antennal lobe size variation is driven by independent shifts in glomerular and antennal lobe hub volumes, with species-specific differences occurring against a backdrop of broader phylogenetic stability. While no direct associations with ecological traits were observed, certain species showed large expansions in total glomerular volume and olfactory receptor numbers, warranting further investigation into unmeasured ecological or behavioural factors. Additionally, comparisons between wild-caught and insectary-reared individuals revealed a surprising pattern of developmental plasticity, with antennal lobe hub volumes increasing and glomeruli volumes decreasing in captivity, highlighting the influence of environmental conditions on neural development. These findings suggest that olfactory evolution in Heliconiini is shaped by both evolutionary divergence and developmental plasticity, emphasizing the need to integrate phylogenetic, ecological, and developmental perspectives to fully understand sensory system adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

One promising approach to modulate such connectivity between cortical areas is dual-site transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), which non-invasively applies weak alternating currents to two brain areas.

Objectives/HypothesesIn the current study, we aimed to modulate inter-regional functional connectivity with dual-site tACS to bilateral primary motor cortices (M1s) during bimanual coordination and, in turn, alter behaviour.

MethodsUsing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we recorded participants brain responses during a bimanual coordination task in a concurrent tACS-fMRI design. While performing a slow and fast version of the task, participants received one of three types of beta (20 Hz) dual-site tACS over both M1s: in-phase, jittered-phase or sham, in a within-subject, repeated measures design.

ResultsWhile we did not observe any significant tACS effects on behaviour, the study revealed a disruptive effect of in-phase tACS on interhemispheric connectivity. Additionally, the two active types of tACS (in-phase and jittered-phase) differed in the task-related M1 connectivity with other motor cortical regions, such as premotor cortex and supplementary motor area. Furthermore, individual E-field strengths were related to functional connectivity in the in-phase condition.

ConclusionsDual-site beta tACS over both M1s altered functional connectivity between motor areas. However, this effect did not translate to the behavioural level, possibly due to compensatory mechanisms.

Accelerated disease progression after infection was associated with substantial lymphocyte infiltration into the brain dominated by CD8+ T cells specific for MCMV. Moreover, T cell receptor analyses revealed that these responses were clonally diverse, suggesting that multiple viral antigens were targeted in the brain during chronic infection with MCMV. T cell depletion during virus chronicity rescued infection-induced cognitive decline. In addition, antiviral drug treatment reduced lymphocytic infiltrates in the brain and reversed cognitive decline, suggesting potential clinical utility.

Much debate has hence surrounded their possible role as intermediate hosts in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, but the virological phenotypes of most pangolin coronaviruses (pCoVs) remain unclear. Here, we comprehensively analyze all pCoVs to date identified from trafficked pangolins seized in the Guangdong province of China, which are remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the spike protein. We explore an unknown genetic diversity within these viruses and uncover how this diversity translates to different virological phenotypes. Strikingly, several Guangdong pCoVs harbor a lysine substitution at residue 519 of spike protein, which contributes to marked immune evasion potentially by modulating the conformational state of spike protein. Furthermore, we highlight that a similar immuno-evasive mutation at residue 519 of the spike protein was acquired by SARS-CoV-2. These findings support that pangolin- and human-infecting coronaviruses represent independent spillover events from natural bat reservoirs, and that immuno-evasive mutations at residue 519 may be a common vector of viral evolution in coronaviruses that infect non-bat hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Endothelial cell defects are caused by failure to repress Rtl1, a paternally-imprinted domesticated retrotransposon, whose cleavage in wild-type animals is triggered by miRNAs of the maternally-imprinted miR-433[~]127 cluster. Our data pinpoint an essential mRNA cleavage target of AGO2 and suggest that the repurposing of a TE-Argonaute regulatory interaction contributes to the retention of AGO catalytic competence in mammals.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Although most COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic or mild, severe infections requiring hospitalization have resulted in likely more than 14 million cumulative deaths to date. One hallmark of severe COVID-19 is a dysregulated immune response that leads to systemic inflammation and contributes to disease severity and mortality but is not explained by viral replication alone. Severe COVID-19 has been shown to disrupt the gut microbiome and increase intestinal permeability which may contribute to immune dysregulation and systemic inflammation. In this study, we investigated the differences in plasma biomarkers for microbial translocation and gut barrier damage as well as circulating cytokines between healthy volunteers and patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We then performed a correlation analysis to understand how the relationships between these plasma biomarkers differed and used a random forest model to assess their accuracy in distinguishing between these two groups. Our results demonstrated that hospitalized COVID-19 patients have elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers of microbial translocation, and that the relationships between these biomarkers were significantly altered compared to healthy volunteers, especially those related to the mucosal associated homeostatic cytokines IL-17A and IL-23. Furthermore, IL-6 and LBP were the top biomarkers for prediction accuracy in our random forest model, highlighting the importance of managing microbial translocation in COVID-19 and its potential utility as a biomarker for disease severity.

IMPORTANCECOVID-19 continues to be a burden on public health. Understanding how plasma biomarkers differ between healthy and acutely infected individuals can help in understanding pathogenesis and predict disease severity. It has been demonstrated that COVID-19 disrupts the gut microbiome and intestinal permeability, which contributes to systemic inflammation. Our study highlights the link between gut barrier integrity and inflammation in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 cases, demonstrating the usefulness of gut barrier integrity biomarkers in predicting disease severity, and offers insights for therapeutic interventions in acute COVID-19 infection.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

However, the molecular and neurochemical basis of signalling in Octopus visual circuits is not well understood. Through heterologous expression of ligand-gated ion channel genes from Octopus vulgaris, we have identified and characterised novel ionotropic receptors for two of the major optic lobe neurotransmitters, dopamine and acetylcholine. One of these, DopC1, defines a new class of dopamine-gated cation channels that is broadly conserved in many invertebrates. Dopamine robustly stimulates neural activity in the optic lobe, particularly in layers where DopC1 is expressed, consistent with a role for this channel in excitatory neurotransmission. A second protein, AChRB1, forms acetylcholine-gated anion channels and is implicated in inhibition of dopaminergic amacrine cells in the outer granular layer (OGL). This combination of inhibitory cholinergic input and excitatory dopaminergic output may allow OGL amacrine cells to carry out lateral inhibition; thus, despite their very different functional and neurochemical properties, Octopus amacrine cells may execute similar computations to amacrine and horizontal cells in the vertebrate retina.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

However, many questions about TADs function and their influence on transcription remain unresolved due to technical limitations in defining TAD boundaries and measuring the direct effect that TADs have on gene expression. Here, we develop consensus TAD maps for human and mouse with a novel ""bag-of-genes"" approach for defining the gene composition within TADs. This approach enables new functional interpretations of TADs by providing a way to capture species-level differences in chromatin organization. We also leverage a generative AI foundation model computed from 33 million transcriptomes to define contextual similarity, an embedding-based metric that is more powerful than co-expression at representing functional gene relationships. Our analytical framework directly leads to testable hypotheses about chromatin organization across cellular states. We find that TADs play an active role in facilitating gene co-regulation, possibly through a mechanism involving transcriptional condensates. We also discover that the TAD-linked enhancement of transcriptional context is strongest in early developmental stages and systematically declines with aging. Investigation of cancer cells show distinct patterns of TAD usage that shift with chemotherapy treatment, suggesting specific roles for TAD-mediated regulation in cellular development and plasticity. Finally, we develop ""TAD signatures"" to improve statistical analysis of single-cell transcriptomic data sets in predicting cancer cell-line drug response. These findings reshape our understanding of cellular plasticity in development and disease, indicating that chromatin organization acts through probabilistic mechanisms rather than deterministic rules.

However, because the piggyBac transposase originates from a lepidopteran genome, concerns about potential endogenous activity and remobilization raise questions about its suitability for long-term genomic modifications across a wide range of species. As an alternative, we tested the effectiveness of the Minos transposase, a Tc1/mariner family element derived from a dipteran insect, for stable germline transformation in the pantry moth Plodia interpunctella. By injecting a Minos-based construct along with in vitro synthesized Minos transposase mRNA into syncytial embryos, we observed somatic activity of the 3xP3::EGFP eye/glia reporter gene in only 1 out of 14 (7.1%) injected G0 individuals that reached the pupal stage.

Nonetheless, pooled in-crossing of G0 individuals resulted in high rates of germline transmission of the transgene, with 23.6% of G1 pupae showing 3xP3-driven eye fluorescence. Together with a previous study in Bombyx silkworms, these data suggest that Minos-mediated transgenesis yields practical rates of germline integration in Lepidoptera, providing an alternative tool for functional genomics in species where piggyBac may not be optimal.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

However, no efficient software reliably derives and tests --state-specific and contrastive-- molecular diagnoses. UITOTO addresses this gap by identifying, testing, and visualizing Diagnostic Molecular Combinations (DMCs). The software uses a weighted random sampling algorithm based on the Jaccard Index for building candidate DMCs. It then selects DMCs with the highest specificity stability, meeting user-defined thresholds for exclusive character states. If multiple optimal DMCs exist, it derives a majority-consensus DMC. UITOTO includes a validation module for testing DMCs against aligned or unaligned sequences. A user-friendly Shiny App GUI with an additional module for customizable publication-quality DMC visualizations is also available online and in RStudio. We assess UITOTOs performance by comparing its DMCs to those derived from a recent software (MOLD) for three large empirical datasets: i) genus Megaselia (69 species, 2,229 training and 30,289 testing barcodes); ii) family Mycetophilidae, (118 species, 1,456 training and 60,349 testing barcodes); and iii) European Lepidoptera (49 species, 591 training and 21,483 testing barcodes). Based on several classification metrics (e.g., Accuracy, F1 Score), UITOTOs DMCs are more reliable, because MOLDs DMCs tend to be too short to be species-specific. Overall, we demonstrate that the biggest challenge for generating molecular and morphological diagnoses are the same. This is balancing specificity and length. Short diagnoses often lack specificity, while excessively long DMCs are often so specific that they do not accommodate intraspecific variation. We thus provide guidelines for generating molecular diagnoses, including detailed instructions for using UITOTO.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

DNA analysis has become an essential tool for taxonomic research and biodiversity assessment; however, freezer storage for all samples is impractical due to space limitations and operational costs. This creates a pressing need to develop more widely applicable DNA preservation methods. We investigated the comparative effects of traditional preservation methods versus DESS (DMSO/EDTA/saturated NaCl solution) preservation on both morphology and DNA integrity using museum specimens from various taxonomic groups. Our results demonstrated that DESS preservation maintained high-quality DNA fragments exceeding >15 kb at room temperature across all examined species, with nematode samples maintaining DNA integrity even after 10 years of storage. When preserving whole organisms, the optimal preservation solution conditions for maintaining both morphological features and DNA integrity varied among species. Notably, DNA integrity was maintained even after complete evaporation of the DESS solution. These findings suggest that DESS utilization for specimen DNA preservation is effective across many species, not only for long-term storage in environments without freezer facilities but also for temporary preservation until freezing.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

However, analyzing these increasingly complex datasets requires specialized expertise across computational biology, statistics, and biological context. To address this challenge, we introduce the Spatial Transcriptomics AI Agent (STAgent), an autonomous multimodal agentic AI that integrates multimodal large language models (LLMs) with specialized computational tools to transform weeks-long analysis tasks into minutes of automated processing. Unlike conventional machine learning approaches that are limited to narrow, predefined tasks, STAgent leverages the emergent capabilities of multimodal LLMs - such as flexible reasoning, contextual understanding, and cross-modal integration - which allow it to adapt to novel data, execute multi-step analyses, and generate biologically meaningful insights with minimal human input. STAgent enables autonomous deep research through integrated capabilities, including dynamic code generation for complex analytical workflows, visual reasoning for interpreting spatial patterns, real-time retrieval of relevant peer-reviewd scientific literature, and synthesis of comprehensive, actionable reports. We applied STAgent to investigate the in vivo maturation of human stem cell-derived pancreatic cells (SC-pancreas) transplanted into immunodeficient mice. We generated single-cell spatial transcriptomics data spanning multiple developmental timepoints. STAgent autonomously (1) identified the maturation of initially scattered endocrine cells into well-defined islet-like structures, with predominantly peripheral -cells surrounding {beta}-cell cores supported by an expanding mesenchymal network; (2) revealed strengthening endocrine-endocrine cell interactions over time and, through context-aware gene set analysis, uncovered spatially resolved biological processes driving maturation; (3) unlike traditional analytical approaches, STAgent offers mechanistic explanations of spatial patterns, contextualizing findings with relevant literatures and developing cohesive insights into human pancreatic development. This agentic approach establishes a new paradigm in spatial transcriptomics analysis by substantially lowering the expertise barrier and reducing analysis time, accelerating biological and biomedical discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Here, we continuously monitored the interstitial glucose levels of 90 healthy adults for four weeks while they completed ecological momentary assessments (EMA; M=47 runs per participant) to rate their mood and metabolic states. As expected, hungry participants reported lower mood, and metabolic state ratings were associated with glucose levels. Although glucose levels were associated with mood, the metabolic state ratings fully mediated this association. Individual differences reflecting metabolic health (i.e., BMI and insulin resistance) did not affect the interaction between glucose and metabolic state ratings on mood. Notably, individuals with higher interoceptive accuracy had fewer fluctuations in mood ratings.

This concept recognition seems to depend on the human-specific knowledge about these objects. However, studies have shown that neurons in visual areas of non-human primates encode some object concepts, raising questions about the extent to which object concepts are uniquely possessed by humans. Here, we show that macaque monkeys can rapidly learn to classify natural object images according to a surprisingly rich set of rules defined by what humans would call abstract concepts. We tested more than 10 binary classification tasks, including animate versus inanimate, natural versus man-made objects, and mammalian versus non-mammalian animals. The monkeys learned each rule in a few days, generalized the learned rules to new images of objects they had probably never seen before and made error patterns consistent with human judgments. Visual deep neural networks (DNNs) could also perform the tasks that monkeys could learn, whereas both DNNs and monkeys failed to classify some less common abstract concepts. Thus, the monkeys successful classification likely depended on whether concepts were embedded in natural images as visual features that could be extracted by high-level visual processing. The observed capacity of primate brains may subserve the formation of rich abstract concepts that the human mind possesses.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

This survival strategy is conserved from Drosophila to mammals but little is known about its underlying metabolic mechanisms. Here, we show that CNS uptake and catabolism of circulating glutamine is essential for neural stem cell proliferation during brain sparing but not normal brain development. Glutamine is imported into perineurial glia of the blood-brain-barrier, which upregulate glutaminase (Gls) and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGlut1) to promote glutaminolysis and glutamate secretion. Neural stem cells then import released glutamate via excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (Eaat1) and maintain it at homeostatic levels via glutamine synthetase 1 (Gs1). Glutamine nitrogen contributes surprisingly little to newly synthesized DNA or protein in neural stem cells but its carbon fuels the oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle. These findings identify an intercellular metabolic relay specifically required to sustain the proliferation of neural stem cells during brain sparing.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Experiments with SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.258.17, B.1.1.7, and BA.5.3.2 (termed wild-type, alpha and omicron, respectively) revealed that human astrocytes, not neurons, support viral proliferation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, new virus variants exhibited milder disease progression. A retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 infected by wild-type or alpha variants was conducted to test whether ketamine, an anaesthetic that inhibits endocytosis, affects COVID-19. At admission, patients infected with the wild-type showed greater disease severity than alpha variant patients, but the disease course was similar. This may be due to distinct ketamine-mediated SARS-CoV-2 variant-dependent effects, revealing stronger ketamine inhibition of the wild-type variant than the alpha variant mediating astrocyte responses involving the expression of ACE2, a viral cell entry site, viral proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and envelope protein-E in infected cells. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 protein 3a attenuated astroglial lysosomal traffic, and 3a and nsp6 differentially modulated lipid droplet accumulation and initiation of autophagy, where ketamine predominantly affected vesicle dynamics. In summary, human astrocytes, but not neurons, contribute to SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, highlighting the potential benefits of ketamine treatment in coronavirus infections.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

The identification of prognostic biomarkers would greatly facilitate personalized treatments. Psychosis patients often display brain-wide disruptions of inter-regional functional coupling (FC), with some being linked to symptom severity and remission. FC may thus hold prognostic potential for people experiencing psychosis.

MethodsNinety antipsychotic-naive FEP patients (51% female, 15-25 years) were randomized to receive either antipsychotic or placebo tablets for 6 months alongside psychosocial interventions. A subset of these patients also completed functional magnetic resonance imaging (55 with usable data at baseline and 37 at 3 months), which was used to evaluate whether baseline FC, or 3-month change in FC, could predict 6- and 12-month changes in symptoms and functioning, quantified using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale, respectively. We considered three different cross-validated prediction algorithms: (i) connectome-based predictive modelling; (ii) kernel ridge regression; and (iii) multilayer meta-matching.

ResultsAll algorithms showed poor performance in predicting patients 6- and 12-month changes in symptoms and functioning (all rmean < 0.3), and no model achieved significance via permutation testing (all p > 0.05).

ConclusionsOur findings suggest that brain-wide measures of FC may not be suitable for predicting extended clinical outcomes over a 6-to 12-month period in FEP patients.","NA","medrxiv",1744063819484

These were classified into two groups: Pama-Nyungan (PN), comprised of one language Family, and Non-Pama-Nyungan (NPN) with more than 20 language Families. The Yolngu people belong to the larger PN Family and live in Arnhem Land in northern Australia. They are surrounded by groups who speak NPN languages. This study, using nuclear genomic and mitochondrial DNA data, was undertaken to shed light on the origins of the Yolngu people and their language. The nuclear genomic sequences of Yolngu people were compared to those of other Indigenous Australians, as well as Papuan, African, East Asian and European people.

Materials and methodsWith the agreement of Indigenous participants, samples were collected from 13 Yolngu individuals and 4 people from neighbouring NPN speakers and their nuclear genomes sequenced to a 30lil coverage. Using the short-read DNA BGISEQ-500 technology, these sequences were mapped to a reference genome and identified [~]24.86 million Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs). The Yolngu SNVs were then compared to those of 36 individuals from 10 other Indigenous populations/locations across Australia and four worldwide populations using multidimensional scaling, population structure, F3 statistics and phylogenetic analyses.

ResultsUsing the above methods, we infer that Yolngu speakers are closely related to neighbouring NPN speakers, followed by the Weipa population. No European or East Asian admixture was detected in the genomes of the Yolngu speakers studied here, which contrasts with the genomes of many other PN speakers that have been studied. Our results show that Yolngu speakers are more closely related to other PN speakers in the northeast of Australia than to those in central and western Australia studied here. Yolngu and the other Australian populations from this study share Papuans as an out-group.

DiscussionThe study presented here provides an account of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomic diversity within the PN Yolngu Aboriginal population. The results show the Yolngu sample and their NPN neighbours have a strong genetic relationship. They also offer evidence of ancestral links between the Yolngu and PN-speaking populations in Cape York. From earlier fingerprint studies, consistent with the genomic results shown here, we suggest that there was a movement of people from the east into northeast Arnhem Land, associated with the flooding of the Sahul Shelf, and that this occurred between about 11 Kya and 8 Kya ago. Several Yolngu myths point to such a movement. It is suggested that the spread of the PN language or its speakers may have influenced the population structure of the Yolngu. Further genomic studies, with larger samples, of populations to the east of the Yolngu around the Gulf of Carpentaria into Cape York are required to test this hypothesis. Our results imply that PN did not spread with the movement of people across the continent, rather, the PN languages diffused among the different populations. It seems clear that the languages dispersed and not the people. The low level of relatedness detected between the Yolngu people and the people of the central arid desert of Australia suggests a long period of separation with different patterns of migration. Beyond Australia, Yolngu are most closely related to the Papuan people of New Guinea.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

However, there is a need for ongoing development to improve accessibility and affordability of the required data, increase the range of usable sample types, and reliably resolve the most challenging, repetitive genome regions.  Cornetto is a new experimental paradigm in which the genome assembly process is adaptively integrated with programmable selective nanopore sequencing, with target regions being iteratively updated to focus LRS data production onto the unsolved regions of a nascent assembly. This improves assembly quality and streamlines the process, both for human individuals and diverse non-human vertebrates, including endemic Australian endangered species, tested here. Cornetto enables us to generate highly complete diploid human genome assemblies using only a single LRS platform, surpassing the quality of previous efforts at a fraction of the cost. Cornetto enables genome assembly from challenging sample types like human saliva, for the first time, further enhancing accessibility. Finally, we obtain complete and accurate assemblies for clinically-relevant repetitive loci at the extremes of the genome, demonstrating valid approaches for genetic diagnosis in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) and MUC1-autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (MUC1-ADTKD) - inherited diseases for which diagnosis is complicated by an inability to sequence the genes involved.

However, the neural processes during the performance of an intelligence test remains largely unknown. This study considers intelligence as a whole-brain network phenomenon and investigates how the connectedness of specific brain regions contributes to performance on the Raven Progressive Matrices (RAPM), a well-established intelligence test. Connectedness was characterized with graph-theoretical measures based on functional connectivity derived from fMRI BOLD (N=67) and EEG theta-band (N=128) activity. The results reveal that the extent to which specific frontal and parietal regions are connected to other brain systems during intelligence testing relates to individual test performance. These regions may act as controllers, enabling flexible and efficient switches between cognitive states required to excel in intelligence tests.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

This apparatus synthesizes the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall layer that forms the daughter cell poles and protects them from osmotic lysis. In the model Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, PG synthases called class A penicillin-binding proteins (aPBPs) have been proposed to play crucial roles in division. However, there is limited experimental support for aPBPs playing a specialized role in division that is distinct from their general function in the expansion and fortification of the PG matrix. Here, we present in situ cryogenic electron tomography data indicating that the aPBP-type enzyme PBP1b is required to produce a wedge-like density of PG at the division site. Furthermore, atomic force and live cell microscopy showed that loss of this structure weakens the division site and renders it susceptible to lysis. Surprisingly, we found that the lipoprotein activator LpoB needed to promote the general function of PBP1b was not required for normal division site architecture or its integrity. Additionally, we show that of the two PBP1b isoforms produced in cells, it is the one with an extended cytoplasmic N-terminus that functions in division, likely via recruitment by the FtsA component of the divisome. Altogether, our results demonstrate that PBP1b plays a specialized, LpoB-independent role in E. coli cell division involving the biogenesis of a PG structure that prevents osmotic rupture. The conservation of aPBPs with extended cytoplasmic N-termini suggests that other Gram-negative bacteria may use similar mechanisms to reinforce their division site.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, germ cell-less (gcl) is required for the formation of primordial germ cells in the form of cells that cellularize at the posterior pole of the embryo, called pole cells. Forming pole cells is a mechanism of germ cell formation unique to a subset of insects. Even though most animals do not form pole cells as primordial germ cells, gcl is conserved across Metazoa, raising the question of how this conserved gene acquired its central role in the evolutionarily derived process of pole cell formation. Here, we examine the functions of gcl in two other insects with different modes of germ cell specification: the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus and the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. We found that gcl is involved in germ cell development, but not strictly required for germ cell specification, in O. fasciatus, although it appears to function through a mechanism different from that in D. melanogaster. In contrast, we could not detect any impact on the embryonic germ line upon gcl knockdown in G. bimaculatus. This work serves as a case study into how the roles of genes in the process of germ line development can change over evolutionary time across animals.

For disease diagnosis, nuclear segmentation performed in 2D hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections has long represented the gold standard. However, recent advances in three-dimensional (3D) histology, which provide a more biologically accurate representation of the spatial heterogeneity of human microanatomy, has led to improved understandings of disease pathology. Yet challenges remain in the development of scalable and computationally efficient pipelines for extracting and interpreting nuclear features in 3D space. 2D histology neglects crucial spatial information, such as 3D connectivity, morphology, and rare events missed by sparser sampling. Here, through extension of the CODA platform, we integrate 3D imaging with nuclear segmentation to analyze nuclear morphological features in human tissue. Analysis of 3D tissue microenvironments uncovered critical changes in 3D morphometric heterogeneity. Additionally, it enables the spatial characterization of immune cell distribution in relation to tissue structures, such as variations in leukocyte density near pancreatic ducts and blood vessels of different sizes. This approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of tissue and nuclear structures, revealing spatial patterns and interactions that are critical for disease progression.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

MethodsData were extracted from linked administrative healthcare claims and electronic health records (EHR) for vaccinations from 23 August 2024 through 24 December 2024 and followed through 31 December 2024. We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study with propensity score weighting to adjust for differences between groups to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 outcomes. VE was calculated as 1 minus the hazard ratio (HR) from Cox proportional hazards models.

ResultsOverall, 465,073 mRNA-1273 KP.2 vaccine recipients were matched 1:1 to unexposed adults. The mean (standard deviation) age was 63 (17) years, with more than half of the population being 65 years or older. Approximately 70% of individuals had an underlying medical condition making them high risk for severe outcomes for COVID-19.

Bacteria containing pf5r mutant phage grow to a lower density but directly outcompete their ancestor and convert them into pf5r mutants via phage superinfection. Reduced fitness therefore spreads throughout the bacterial population, driven by weaponized Pf. Yet high intracellular phage replication facilitates another evolutionary conflict: ""cheater miniphages"" lacking capsid genes invade populations of full-length phages within cells. Although bacteria containing both full-length phages and miniphages are most immune to superinfection by limiting the Pf receptor, this hybrid vigor is extremely unstable, as a classic Tragedy of the Commons scenario ensues that results in complete prophage loss. The entire cycle - from phage hyperactivation to miniphage invasion to prophage loss - can occur within 24h, showcasing rapid coevolution between bacteria and their filamentous phages. This study demonstrates that P. aeruginosa, and potentially many other bacterial species that carry filamentous prophages, risk being exploited by these phages in a runaway process that reduces fitness of both host and virus.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

In addition, we introduce a layout algorithm that aims to improve clarity by minimizing the total stretch of reticulate edges. To address the common issue that biological publications often omit machine-readable representations of depicted trees and networks, we also provide an image-based algorithm for extracting their topology from figures.

Two factors that likely contribute to this situation include (a) conceptual disagreement about language and its component processes, and (b) intrinsic inter-individual variability in the topography of language areas. Recent functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) studies of small numbers of intensively scanned individuals have argued that a language-selective brain network emerges from correlations (individualized functional connectomics, iFC) in task-free (e.g., rest) or task-regressed activation timecourses. Here we test this hypothesis at scale and evaluate its practical utility for task-agnostic language localization: we apply iFC separately to each of 1,971 (fMRI) scanning sessions (1,199 unique brains), each consisting of diverse tasks. We find that iFC indeed reveals a left-lateralized frontotemporal network that is more stable within individuals than between them, robust to the granularity of the parcellation, and selective for language. These results support the hypothesis that this network is a key structure in the functional organization of the adult brain and show that it can be recovered retrospectively from arbitrary imaging data, with implications for neuroscience, neurosurgery, and neural engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1744063819484

Off-target binding, defined as a probe binding to something other than the target gene, can distort a genes true expression profile, making probe specificity essential for reliable transcriptomics. Here, we investigate off-target binding in the 10x Genomics Xenium v1 Human Breast Gene Expression Panel. We developed a software tool, Off-target Probe Tracker (OPT), to identify putative off-target binding via alignment of probe sequences and found at least 21 out of the 280 genes in the panel impacted by off-target binding to protein-coding genes. To substantiate our predictions, we leveraged a previously published Xenium breast cancer dataset generated using this gene panel and compared results to orthogonal spatial and single-cell transcriptomic profiles from Visium CytAssist and 3' single-cell RNA-seq derived from the same tumor block. Our findings indicate that for some genes, the expression patterns detected by Xenium demonstrably reflect the aggregate expression of the target and predicted off-target genes based on Visium and single-cell RNA-seq rather than the target gene alone. Overall, this work enhances the biological interpretability of spatial transcriptomics data and improves reproducibility in spatial transcriptomics research.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

A common theme is generating a nucleotide-derived second messenger in response to phage that activates an effector protein to halt virion production. Phages respond with counter-defenses that deplete these second messengers, leading to an escalating arms race with the host. Here we discover a novel antiphage system we call Panoptes that detects phage infection by surveying the cytosol for phage proteins that antagonize the nucleotide-derived second messenger pool. Panoptes is a two-gene operon, optSE. OptS is predicted to synthesize a second messenger using a minimal CRISPR polymerase (mCpol) domain, a version of the polymerase domain found in Type III CRISPR systems (Cas10) that is distantly related to GGDEF and Thg1 tRNA repair polymerase domains. OptE is predicted to be a transmembrane effector protein that binds cyclic nucleotides. optSE potently restricted phage replication but mutant phages that had loss-of-function mutations in anti-CBASS protein 2 (Acb2) escaped defense. These findings were unexpected because Acb2 is a nucleotide ""sponge"" that antagonizes second messenger signaling. Using genetic and biochemical assays, we found that Acb2 bound the OptS-synthesized nucleotide, 2',3'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (2',3'-c-di-AMP); however, 2',3'-c-di-AMP was synthesized constitutively by OptS and inhibited OptE. Nucleotide depletion by Acb2 released OptE toxicity thereby initiating abortive infection to halt phage replication. These data demonstrate a sophisticated immune strategy that hosts use to guard their second messenger pool and turn immune evasion against the virus.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Despite advances in collagen extraction protocols, the process remains destructive, requiring sampling by sawing, drilling or crushing of dry bone, that can damage or destroy physical features and archaeological evidence, and often consumes the entire specimen. While non-destructive approaches have recently been applied in ancient genomics and palaeoproteomics, no equivalent approach has been established for radiocarbon dating of bone. Here, we outline a non-destructive collagen extraction workflow that avoids invasive sampling (cutting or drilling) and produces no visible damage to the bone. By heating the bone in hot water for several hours, collagen is solubilized, and the resulting collagenous solution can be purified and AMS dated. Here we show that the amino acid composition, C/N atomic ratios, {delta}13C and {delta}15N values of the hot-water-extracted collagen are comparable to collagen isolated from the same bones using classic decalcification methodologies. The hot water extraction method was tested on various bones, ranging from the Bronze Age to the Middle and Upper Paleolithic periods, which had been dated previously using routine destructive methods that involved acid demineralization. Our results show that non-destructive collagen extraction, coupled with an additional purification step e.g., ultrafiltration, yields identical radiocarbon ages to those obtained via the routine destructive methods.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Understanding the functions of vocal mimicry can help to uncover the evolutionary drivers of vocal learning. Different adaptive functions like interspecific and intraspecific communication have been suggested, as well as the possibility of vocal mimicry to be a mistake during vocal learning. In the present study, we review the occurrence of mimicry in the family of corvids and investigate the socio-ecological factors driving the evolution of vocal mimicry in this group of birds. We recorded evidence of vocal mimicry from primary (xeno-canto recordings) as well as secondary sources (published literature) and found evidence for vocal mimicry in 31 out of 128 corvid species (24%). Smaller species were described as mimics more compared to larger species. Other socio-ecological factors like breeding status, habitat and trophic niche did not have a significant effect. More mimicry was recorded during the non-breeding season compared to the breeding season. We used Bayesian modelling based on existing data from primary and secondary sources to estimate the occurrence of mimicry, suggesting that vocal mimicry may be more widespread among corvids than currently documented, with many species potentially being  hidden mimics. Our study for the first time systematically reviews the occurrence of vocal mimicry across the family of corvids and investigates a range of socio-ecological factors driving the behaviour. Our analysis suggests many corvid species likely to be  hidden mimics and we provide specific suggestions for species which according to our statistical model are most likely mimicking corvid species, hopefully inspiring future field work on those species.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

However, a barrier to the adoption of BCIs is how long it can take users to learn to control them. We hypothesized that human BCI learning could be accelerated by leveraging the naturally occurring geometric structure of brain activity, or its intrinsic manifold, extracted using a data-diffusion process. We trained participants on a noninvasive BCI that allowed them to gain real-time control of an avatar in a virtual reality game by modulating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity in brain regions that support spatial navigation. We then perturbed the mapping between fMRI activity patterns and the movement of the avatar to test our manifold hypothesis. When the new mapping respected the intrinsic manifold, participants succeeded in regaining control of the BCI by aligning their brain activity within the manifold. When the new mapping sdid not respect the intrinsic manifold, participants could not learn to control the avatar again. These findings show that the manifold geometry of brain activity constrains human learning of a complex cognitive task in higher-order brain regions. Manifold geometry may be a critical ingredient for unlocking the potential of future human neurotechnologies.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

To better understand the mechanism of antidepressant response to TMS, we recruited two neurosurgical patients with indwelling electrodes and delivered TMS pulses to the DLPFC while simultaneously recording local field potentials from the sgACC. Spectral analysis revealed a decrease in high-frequency activity (HFA; 70-180 Hz) after each stimulation pulse, which was especially pronounced in the sgACC relative to other regions. TMS-evoked HFA power was generally anticorrelated between the DLPFC and sgACC, even while low-frequency phase locking between the two regions was enhanced.

However, these areas contributions to language remain unclear given that the evidence for their recruitment comes from diverse paradigms, many of which conflate language processing with perceptual, motor, or task-related cognitive processes. Using fMRI data from 772 participants performing an extensively-validated language  localizer paradigm that isolates language processing from other processes, we a) delineate a comprehensive set of areas that respond reliably to language across written and auditory modalities, and b) evaluate these areas selectivity for language relative to a demanding non-linguistic task. In line with prior claims, many areas outside the core fronto-temporal network respond during language processing, and most of them show selectivity for language relative to general task demands. These language-selective areas of the extended language network include areas around the temporal poles, in the medial frontal cortex, in the hippocampus, and in the cerebellum, among others. Although distributed across many parts of the brain, the extended language-selective network still only comprises [~]1.2% of the brains volume and is about the size of a strawberry, challenging the view that language processing is broadly distributed across the cortical surface. These newly identified language-selective areas can now be systematically characterized to decipher their contributions to language processing, including testing whether these contributions differ from those of the core language areas.

Significance statementLanguage processing consistently recruits a left-lateralized fronto-temporal brain network, but language tasks often engage areas outside this core system. In an fMRI dataset of 772 participants performing a validated language localizer task, we identified 17 brain areas outside the core network that respond to both auditory and written language. Most of these areas show selectivity for language, including regions in the temporal poles, medial frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Despite its large number of components, this extended language network still only takes up [~]1.2% of the brains volume, challenging the view that language processing is broadly distributed in the brain. These findings lay the foundation for systematically characterizing these newly identified non-canonical language-selective areas.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

We previously observed that during experimental evolution in the presence of abundant susceptible hosts, the AMR plasmid R1 rapidly evolves variants with increased horizontal transmission due to mutations causing increased plasmid copy number. Yet AMR was progressively lost from the evolving populations. Here, we show that AMR loss was associated with evolution of  stealth plasmids in which the AMR region is spontaneously deleted, making plasmid carriage undetectable by plating on selective antibiotic-containing media. These plasmids transmit both vertically and horizontally more efficiently than the ancestral AMR plasmid, driving AMR extinction in bacterial populations and effectively acting as an intrinsic defence against AMR plasmids. Our results suggest that within-host plasmid evolution could be exploited to limit the spread of AMR in natural populations of bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

In insects and other arthropods, which have only innate immune mechanisms, four main immune-specific modules contribute to defense against microbial invaders: the Toll pathway, the Imd pathway, the melanization response, and phagocytosis by plasmatocytes. Our present understanding of their relative importance remains fragmented, as their contribution to host defense has never been simultaneously assessed across a large panel of pathogens. Here, we have taken advantage of newly-described immune mutants in a controlled genetic background to systematically delete these four immune modules individually, in pairs, or all four simultaneously. Surprisingly, flies simultaneously deficient in all four immune modules are viable, homozygous fertile, and display no overt morphological defects, suggesting these immune mechanisms are not strictly required for organismal development. With this new set of lines, we assessed the individual and collective contribution of each module to host defense against five viruses, three fungi, eight Gram-positive bacteria, and eight Gram-negative bacteria. Our findings show that these four modules largely function independently or additively in host defense, although synergistic effects can occur for select pairs of modules. Our study confirmed the importance of the Imd pathway against Gram-negative bacteria and the Toll pathway against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, largely via the induction of effectors such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and Bomanins (Bom), but also reveals an important role of melanization against viruses, and a contribution of phagocytosis against various germs. Additionally, by examining microbial load kinetics in different mutants, we provide insight into how these modules contribute to tolerance or resistance against specific microbes. Our study provides insights into the architecture of the Drosophila immune system, revealing differential requirements of immune modules according to each pathogen. The set of immune deficient lines provided here offers tools to better assess the role of these immune modules in host defense.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

Many of these damaging modifications (i.e., lesions) persist into S-phase of the cell cycle where they may stall the canonical DNA replication machinery. In humans, these stalling events are circumvented by one of at least three interconnected DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathways; translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), Template Switching (TS), and Homology-dependent Recombination (HDR). Currently, the functional interplay between these pathways is unclear, leaving wide gaps in our fundamental understanding of human DDT. To gain insights, we focus on the activation mechanisms of the DDT pathways. PCNA sliding clamps encircling primer/template (P/T) junctions of stalled replication sites are central to the activation of both TLS and TS whereas exchange of RPA for Rad51 filaments on the single strand DNA (ssDNA) sequences of stalled replication sites is central to HDR activation. Utilizing direct, ensemble FRET approaches developed by our lab, we independently monitor and directly compare PCNA occupancy and RPA/Rad51 exchange at P/T junctions under a variety of conditions that mimic in vivo scenarios. Collectively, the results reveal that assembly of stable Rad51 filaments at P/T junctions via RPA/Rad51 exchange causes complete and irreversible unloading of the resident PCNA, both in the presence and absence of an abundant PCNA-binding protein complex. Further investigations decipher the mechanism of RPA/Rad51 exchange-dependent unloading of PCNA. Collectively, these studies provide critical insights into the interplay between human DDT pathways and direction for future studies.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

However, its precise chromosomal composition has remained elusive due to challenges in resolving repetitive regions. Using PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing, we assembled the complete nuclear genome of the Dm28c strain into 32 telomere-to-telomere chromosomes. The assembly revealed conserved chromosomal structures and synteny patterns when compared to the independently sequenced Dm25 strain, both of which belong to clade A (TcI). This indicates that the 32-chromosome karyotype is a stable and conserved feature of T. cruzi. Through a comprehensive annotation pipeline, we refined gene content and resolved haplotypes, resulting in an approximately 25% reduction in core gene redundancy. All chromosomes demonstrate a conserved compartmentalized architecture consisting of core, disruptive, and newly characterized subtelomeric regions. Subtelomeres, enriched in RHS, TS, and DGF-1 genes but lacking MASP and mucins, create a distinct third genomic compartment. Telomere analysis showed significant length heterogeneity, which may influence subtelomeric gene regulation. Overall, this work defines the complete chromosomal complement of T. cruzi, establishing a solid framework for comparative genomics and enabling detailed studies into genome organization, antigenic variability, and evolutionary dynamics across strains and clades. This assembly redefines the genomic reference landscape, paving the way for future research on T. cruzis fundamental biology, pathogenic diversity, and adaptive mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

This study presents the first comprehensive investigation of microbial communities inhabiting heritage artifacts from Argentinas Museum of Independence. By integrating advanced microscopy with phenotypic and genomic characterization, we analyzed samples collected from wooden objects, textiles, architectural elements, and exterior walls. Scanning electron microscopy revealed diverse and well-structured biofilms, with intricate three-dimensional arrangements embedded in extracellular polymeric substances. A total of 49 bacterial strains were isolated and identified via VITEK MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, with a predominance of Gram-positive genera such as Bacillus, Micrococcus, and Kocuria. Remarkably, the 19th-century albumen print photograph emerged as the most biodiverse artifact, yielding 21 distinct strains, including Streptomyces, Oceanobacillus, and thermophilic Caldibacillus thermoamylovorans. The protein-rich and halophilic environment of the albumen layer likely facilitated microbial colonization and persistence. Pseudomonas species were exclusively associated with this photographic substrate, further underscoring its niche specificity. Human-associated taxa like Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus equorum were prevalent in high-contact areas, while exterior surfaces displayed distinct microbial signatures, including potential pathogens linked to environmental exposure. These findings reveal a complex and artifact-specific microbial landscape, emphasizing the need for tailored, bio-informed conservation strategies. This work advances the field of heritage microbiology and supports efforts to safeguard culturally significant objects through a deeper understanding of their microbial ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819484

We investigate this for Type II restriction-modification (RM) systems, using a dataset of thousands of conjugative plasmids belonging to different plasmid taxonomic units (PTUs). Consistent with our hypothesis, we find evidence of RM target depletion in leading regions, despite higher average GC-content in the leading region which should increase palindrome density.

We found that populations that followed this two-stage strategy achieved higher payoffs in the long term than populations using the two exploration strategies in a random order.

However, little effort has been dedicated to determining which specific system(s) within defense islands limit lytic phage reproduction in clinical bacterial strains. Here, we employed the CRISPR-based Cascade-Cas3 system to delete defense islands in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate to identify mechanisms of lytic phage antagonism. Deletion of one island in a cystic fibrosis-derived clinical isolate sensitized the strain to phages from the Pbunavirus family, which are commonly used as therapeutics. The causal defense system is a Type IIS restriction endonuclease-like protein (ENDPaCF1), common in Pseudomonads, however it lacks an associated methyltransferase typical Type IIS R-M systems. ENDPaCF1 protects bacteria against phages with hypermodified DNA and is surprisingly agnostic to the specific structure of the modification, which is unlike typical type IV restriction endonucleases. In ENDPaCF1, the endonuclease domain is fused to a catalytically inactive Endonuclease III (iEndoIII), a domain that recognizes non-canonical bases to repair DNA in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. We therefore propose that nucleases containing an iEndoIII domain (END nucleases) can sense diverse DNA hypermodifications. Our findings reveal modularity of the sensing and cleavage domains, as expected of a modification-dependent endonucleases. We further show that some hypermodified phages, including Pbunavirus family members and Wrowclawvirus family (Pa5oct-like) of jumbo phages, encode END nuclease inhibitors that directly bind to the nuclease, likely via the iEndoIII domain. These inhibitors are necessary for Pbunavirus to plaque on clinical isolates and sufficient to enable other hypermodified phages to plaque in the presence of this defense system.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819485

In a surprising inversion of this process, we show here that the CRISPR-related enzyme mCpol synthesizes cyclic oligonucleotides constitutively as part of an active mechanism that maintains cell health. Cell-based experiments demonstrated that the absence or loss of mCpol-produced cyclic oligonucleotides triggers cell death, preventing spread of viruses that attempt immune evasion by depleting host cyclic nucleotides. Structural and mechanistic investigation revealed mCpol to be a di-adenylate cyclase whose product, c-di-AMP, prevents toxic oligomerization of the effector protein 2TM{beta}. Analysis of cells by fluorescence microscopy showed that lack of mCpol allows 2TM{beta}-mediated cell death due to inner membrane collapse.

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1744063819485

Yet how enhancers determine transcription of their target genes, and how this depends on their relative position inside a cis-regulatory landscape remains unclear. Here we use live-cell imaging to track the activity of a promoter under the control of the same enhancer, but inserted at different positions across a simplified regulatory landscape with minimal complexity. Combined with mathematical modeling, this reveals that RNA production from the promoter occurs in clusters of transcriptional bursts, with enhancer position controlling the frequency at which such clusters appear. This results in bursts being more frequent and occurring more uniformly across cells when the enhancer is genomically close to the promoter than when it is located at large genomic distance. Mathematical modeling further indicates that the enhancer modulates the promoters ability to transition from its basal transcriptional state to a regime where clusters of bursts become more frequent. Our results challenge existing models of mammalian promoter operation, and reveal that enhancer position within a cis-regulatory landscape critically controls the timing and variability of transcriptional output in single cells.","NA","biorxiv",1744063819485
