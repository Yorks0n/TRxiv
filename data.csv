However, it is not well understood whether personal light exposure patterns predicts and individuals risk of cardiovascular diseases.

ObjectiveTo assess whether day and night light exposure predicts incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and whether relationships of light with cardiovascular diseases differ according to genetic susceptibility, sex, and age.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

ParticipantsN=88,905, age (M{+/-}SD) = 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 56.9% female.

ExposureApproximately 13 million hours of personal light exposure data, tracked by wrist-worn light sensors (one week each).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, derived from UK National Health Service records, across a 9.5-year follow-up after light tracking.

ResultsPeople with the brightest nights (90-100th percentiles) had significantly higher risks of developing coronary artery disease (adjusted-HR range: 1.23-1.32), myocardial infarction (aHRs: 1.42-1.47), heart failure (aHRs: 1.45-1.56), atrial fibrillation (aHRs: 1.28-1.32), and stroke (aHRs: 1.28-1.30), compared to people with dark nights (0-50th percentiles). These relationships were robust after adjusting for established risk factors for cardiovascular health, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol, diet, sleep duration, socioeconomic status, and polygenic risk. Relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and coronary artery disease were stronger for women, and relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation were stronger for younger individuals in this cohort.

Conclusions and RelevanceNight light exposure was a significant risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases in this cohort. In addition to current preventative measures, avoiding light at night may be a useful strategy for reducing risks of cardiovascular diseases.

Key Points

QuestionDoes personal light exposure predict incidence of cardiovascular diseases?

FindingsIn this study of [~]89,000 adults aged >40 years, exposure to brighter light at night predicted higher incidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors.

MeaningAvoiding exposure to night light may lower risk for cardiovascular diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1752444628866

This study evaluates the impact of RDs on these outcomes and examines the effectiveness of vaccination and antiviral treatments among individuals with and without RDs.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using harmonized electronic health records (EHRs) from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), encompassing 21,704,702 individuals, including 4,825,605 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between Jan 1, 2020, and Jan 4, 2024. RDs were defined using 12,003 conditions curated from GARD and Orphanet, mapped to OMOP concepts, and classified into 18 RD classes based on medical specialty involvement. Primary outcomes included: (1) COVID-19 severity (hospitalization and life-threatening disease), (2) long COVID, and (3) SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. We applied multivariable logistic regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting and reported adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and associated p-values. Models were controlled for demographics, comorbidities, and exposure to vaccination and antiviral treatments.

FindingsOf 21,704,702 individuals, we identify 4,825,605 COVID-19 positive individuals, 6.36% had RDs, with markedly higher rates of rare disease (RD) patients that have life-threatening illness (16% vs. 6.1% without life-threatening illness) and that are hospitalized (13% vs. 6.0% without hospitalization). Otorhinolaryngologic diseases showed the highest risk of life-threatening outcomes (OR 4.51; 95% CI 3.81-5.33), followed by developmental defect during embryogenesis (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.72-1.98) and cardiac conditions (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.51-2.11). Hospitalization risk was highest for otorhinolaryngologic (OR 2.90; 95% CI 2.61-3.23), developmental defect during embryogenesis (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.97-2.16), and hematologic and endocrine diseases (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.75-1.87 and OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.64-1.99, respectively).

In patients with RDs, vaccination alone or antiviral treatment alone was associated with reduced odds of life-threatening COVID-19 disease compared to non-vaccinated individuals (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.66-0.77 and OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.26-0.42, respectively). The combination of both vaccination and antiviral treatment showed the greatest reduction in odds ratio (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.20-0.27). Similar results were observed in patients without RDs. In contrast, vaccination or antiviral therapy alone, compared to no intervention, did not significantly reduce long COVID risk in RD patients, although these interventions alone did result in a lower odds ratio in patients without RD. However, their combination was protective in both groups. Vaccination alone, compared to no vaccination, also reduced the risk of reinfection across RD and non-RD populations.

InterpretationRD patients face elevated risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes. While vaccination and antivirals significantly reduce the acute severity of illness, their impact on long COVID appears limited in this population. Notably, vaccination was protective against COVID-19 reinfection in both RD and non-RD populations. These findings highlight the need for targeted strategies to protect RD patients beyond current interventions, particularly in preventing long-term complications.

Human genetic data and functional experimentation have demonstrated that H2AK119ub is required for cortical development, however the molecular mechanism for this remains unknown. Here, we show that mouse embryos expressing catalytically deficient RING1B exhibit intact early neurogenesis but display impaired neuroectodermal fate restriction. Using in vivo, primary, and in vitro models, we demonstrate that reduced H2AK119ub leads to ectopic activation of lineage-inappropriate transcriptional programmes, including mesodermal and endodermal gene expression during neural differentiation. This transcriptional deregulation is not solely attributable to H2AK119ub or H3K27me3 loss but instead reflects sensitisation of PRC1 target genes to inappropriate transcription factor (TF)-mediated activation. Synthetic induction of candidate TFs, including GATA6, SOX7, and SNAI1, phenocopies the fate-skewing effects of PRC1 catalytic dysfunction, confirming their causal role. Our results uncover a buffering role for PRC1-catalysed H2AK119ub in safeguarding neural progenitor identity by preventing inappropriate TF-driven transcription and provides a mechanistic framework for understanding the cellular heterogeneity and phenotypic variability observed in Polycomb-associated neurodevelopmental disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Class 4 antibodies represent an intriguing case: they target a deeply conserved, cryptic epitope on the receptor-binding domain yet exhibit variable neutralization potency across subgroups F1 (CR3022, EY6A, COVA1-16), F2 (DH1047), and F3 (S2X259). In this study, we employed a multi-modal computational approach combining atomistic and coarse-grained simulations, mutational scanning of binding interfaces, binding free energy calculations, and allosteric modeling using dynamic network analysis to map the allosteric landscapes and binding hotspots of these antibodies. Through this approach, our data revealed that distal binding can influence ACE2 engagement and immune escape traits through the confluence of direct interfacial interactions and allosteric effects. We found that group F1 antibodies can operate via classic allostery by modulating flexibility in the receptor binding domain loop regions and indirectly interfering with ACE2 binding using long-range effects. Group F2 antibody DH1047 represents an intermediate mechanism, engaging residues T376, R408, V503, and Y508 hotspots which are both critical for ACE2 binding and under immune pressure. Mutational scanning and rigorous binding free energy calculations highlight the synergy between hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, while dynamic network modeling reveals a shift toward localized communication pathways connecting the cryptic site to the ACE2 interface. Our results demonstrate how group F3 antibody S2X259 achieves efficient synergistic mechanism through confluence of direct competition with ACE2 and localized allosteric effects leading to stabilization of the spike protein at the cost of increased escape vulnerability. Dynamic network analysis identifies a shared ""allosteric ring"" embedded in the core of the receptor binding domain and serving a conserved structural scaffold mediating long-range signal propagation with antibody-specific extensions propagating toward the ACE2 interface. The findings of this study support a modular model of antibody-induced allostery where neutralization strategies evolve via refinement of peripheral network connections, rather than complete redesign of the epitope itself. Taken together, this study establishes a robust computational framework for atomistic understanding of mechanisms underlying neutralization activity and immune escape for class 4 antibodies which harness conformational dynamics, binding energetics, and allosteric modulation to influence viral entry. The findings highlight the modular evolution of neutralization strategies, where progressive refinement of peripheral interactions enhances potency but increases susceptibility to immune pressure.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Plecia longiforceps, a species of lovebug flies native to southeast China and Taiwan, has recently been expanding in Okinawa in Japan and Seoul in South Korea, where massive outbreaks are garnering public attention. Here we analyzed whole-genome sequences of 150 individuals across China, Korea, Okinawa, and Taiwan, including a newly identified northern Chinese population from Qingdao. We found a deep divergence between continental (Korea-China) and insular (Okinawa-Taiwan) populations and specify northern China and Taiwan as sources for Korea and Okinawa, respectively. Severely reduced genetic diversity in Korea and Qingdao suggests serial founder events during their northward expansion. An old split time between Qingdao and Korea ([~]3,500 generations ago) and multiple gene flows into Qingdao reject a simple scenario of a single recent northward migration. Selection signals in northern groups include genes associated with pigmentation, thermal sensing, lipid metabolism, and immunity. We observed a markedly reduced genetic diversity on X chromosome in northern populations, indicating ongoing strong sex-biased selection. Our findings portrait details of the northward range expansion in the species and highlight the role of adaptation for successful invasion at higher latitudes.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Using a direct-contact acoustic system, we exposed yeast to distinct sound types: tonal vibrations, broadband noise, and consonant phonemes. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that tonal stimuli with coherent low-frequency patterns enhanced actin polymerization and shmoo formation, both markers of polarity and mating. In contrast, broadband noise disrupted actin integrity, while consonants produced no measurable effects. These results suggest that rhythmic continuity and spectral coherence, key features of speech, can modulate cytoskeletal organization in non-auditory cells.

The plant natural product (-)-englerin A (EA) is a potent, selective TRPC4/5 agonist that has transformed fundamental and translational research on TRPC4/5 channels. However, the structural basis of interactions between EA and TRPC4/5 proteins has remained elusive, limiting our ability to fully understand and exploit mechanisms of TRPC4/5 channel activation by this intriguing natural product. Here, we present nine high-resolution cryo-EM structures (2.4-3.2 [A]) of human TRPC5 - representing different states and ligand occupancies - which show that EA binds to a conserved lipid binding site between transmembrane domains of adjacent TRPC5 subunits. Our structural models are consistent with the effects of mutagenesis of nearby residues on EA's potency, efficacy and activation kinetics, and allow us to rationalise competitive inhibition by other TRPC4/5 modulators as well as EA's selectivity profile within the TRPC family. Comparison of structures containing various TRPC5:EA stoichiometries revealed key structural and molecular determinants of EA-mediated TRPC5 activation - most notably the aromatic interaction network around Phe520 - underscoring the critical function of Met-aromatic motifs in ion channel structure and function. Binding of EA causes conformational changes of nearby amino acid residues, resulting in rearrangement of the pore helices into a pre-open state. Collectively, we provide structural insight into the mode-of-action of the most widely used TRPC4/5 agonist, which will underpin fundamental TRPC4/5 channel research as well as ongoing drug discovery programmes.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Although the molecular basis of cellular heat shock responses is well understood, how thermosensory neurons contribute to systemic stress adaptation remains unclear. Here, using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, we examine whether thermosensory receptor guanylyl cyclases (rGCs) in AFD neurons regulate organism-wide stress responses under noxious temperatures and how individual rGCs contribute to this coordination. Among the AFD-expressed rGCs, we identify gcy-18 and gcy-23 as key regulators of the physiological response to thermal stress, acting through modulation of canonical heat shock response (HSR) genes. Our findings indicate that rGC signaling is crucial for activation of heat shock chaperones and maintenance of proteostasis under high temperatures (35{degrees}C). Supporting this, quantitative analysis of HSP-16.2 revealed that rGC activity in AFD neurons modulates the HSR magnitude in distal tissues, such as the intestine.

Using localization microscopy and biotin proximity labeling we demonstrate that Avs5 localizes to early infection vesicles, where it senses an essential, early expressed phage protein named JADA--Jumbophage AVAST5 Defense Activator. Recognition of phage infection triggers the Sir2-like effector domain of Avs5 across all three Avs5 clades, resulting in rapid NAD+ hydrolysis, disruption of phage nucleus formation, and arrest of infection.

However, the impact of disrupting anti-ferroptotic pathways in the broader tumor microenvironment (TME), such as in immune cells, is still undefined and may complicate treatments. Here, we show that Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1 (FSP1/Aifm2) is critically required for regulatory T cell (Treg) resistance to ferroptosis and their immunosuppressive function within the TME. Compared to other canonical ferroptosis regulators such as GPX4, GCH1, and NRF2, only FSP1 was induced upon T cell activation. Deletion of Aifm2 in all T cells, or Tregs specifically, enhanced tumor control by selectively disrupting Treg immunosuppression within tumors without inciting autoimmune pathology in mice. As opposed to deletion of Gpx4 in all T cells, T cell deletion of Aifm2 did not impair antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. These results reveal a unique opportunity for targeting a regulator of ferroptosis that can not only directly target cancer cells, but also simultaneously enhance anti-cancer immune responses without inciting autoimmunity.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Viruses can inhibit nucleotide immune signaling by producing proteins that sequester or cleave the immune signals. Here we analyzed evolutionarily unrelated signal-sequestering viral proteins, finding that they share structural and biophysical traits in their genetic organization, ternary structures and binding pocket properties. Based on these traits we developed a structure-guided computational pipeline that can sift through large phage genome databases to unbiasedly predict phage proteins that manipulate bacterial immune signaling. Numerous previously uncharacterized proteins, grouped into three families, were verified to inhibit the bacterial Thoeris and CBASS signaling systems. Proteins of the Sequestin and Lockin families bind and sequester the TIR-produced signaling molecules 3'cADPR and His-ADPR, while proteins of the Acb5 family cleave and inactivate 3'3'-cGAMP and related molecules. X-ray crystallography and structural modeling, combined with mutational analyses, explain the structural basis for sequestration or cleavage of the immune signals. Thousands of these signal-manipulating proteins were detected in phage protein databases, with some instances present in well-studied model phages such as T2, T4 and T6. Our study explains how phages commonly evade bacterial immune signaling, and offers a structure-guided analytical approach for discovery of viral immune-manipulating proteins in any database of choice.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

As a solution, we introduce Metalorian, a conditional diffusion model that generates de novo heavy metal-binding peptides, guided by MetaLATTE, a multi-label classifier fine-tuned to include underrepresented metal classes. Leveraging both continuous protein embeddings and discrete metal-binding constraints, Metalorian produces peptides with controllable lengths and user-defined binding specificity while preserving essential physicochemical properties. Crucially, our data augmentation strategy enables robust classification and generation even with sparse training data for certain metals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through peptides designed for copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), and zinc (Zn), which retain key features such as net charge and hydrophobicity, while significantly reducing sequence length and molecular weight compared to known metal-binding proteins. Metalorian-generated peptides exhibit stable conformations and favorable binding energetics, as confirmed through molecular dynamics simulations. To validate binding in vitro, we developed a streamlined SUMO-fusion expression and cleavage system coupled with ELISA-based quantification, confirming robust Cu and Zn binding by multiple Metalorian-generated peptides. Overall, our work establishes a foundational platform for engineering heavy metal-binding peptides tailored to diverse and underrepresented targets, and highlights the potential of well-trained continuous latent spaces for diffusion-based de novo peptide design.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Aminoglycosides kill bacteria by disrupting translation fidelity, leading to the synthesis of aberrant proteins. Surprisingly, mutations in fusA, a gene encoding translation elongation factor G (EF-G), frequently confer resistance, even though EF-G neither participates in mRNA decoding nor blocks aminoglycoside binding. Here, we show that EF-G resistance variants selectively slow ribosome movement along mRNA when aminoglycosides are bound. This delay increases the chance that the drug dissociates before misreading occurs. Over several elongation cycles, this selective silencing of drug-bound ribosomes prevents error cluster formation, preserving proteome and membrane integrity. As a result, fusA mutations confer resistance early in treatment by preventing self-promoted aminoglycoside uptake. Translation on drug-free ribosomes remains sufficiently rapid to sustain near-normal bacterial growth. This previously unrecognized resistance mechanism, namely the selective silencing of corrupted targets, reveals a novel antibiotic resistance strategy with potential therapeutic implications.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Chronic protein deficiency leads to stunting, height-for-age more than two standard deviations below the median, and affects 149 million children under five (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240073791). Linear growth is governed by the somatotropic axis, wherein pituitary growth hormone (GH) stimulates hepatic insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) to promote bone elongation. Although boys are consistently more stunted than girls across populations (ranging from 18% to 45%), mechanisms underlying this apparent resilience remain unclear. Rodent studies suggest that the protein-to-carbohydrate ratio modulates life-history traits such as metabolism, lifespan, and reproduction, with evidence of sex-dependent sensitivity. Whether such dimorphism reflects coordinated developmental adaptations in response to protein scarcity, particularly in females, has not been fully explored. Here, we show that juvenile dietary protein restriction causes sexually dimorphic adaptations with pronounced stunting in males and delayed reproductive maturation in females. Using liver-specific deletion, we identify fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) as a sex-specific hepatic regulator of female somatic growth and reproductive development, revealing a dimorphic endocrine adaptation to early-life protein scarcity.

The paradigm for appendage evolution in this phylum is that the gene regulatory network responsible for leg subdivision and patterning is broadly conserved. Recent surveys of these genes have suggested that chelicerate exemplars exhibit divergent appendage patterning dynamics, though functional data remain limited. One salient mismatch in expression occurs in homologs of the homeobox gene clawless. In insects, clawless is expressed in the distalmost leg territory, specifying the claw-bearing pretarsus. In the harvestman, Phalangium opilio, clawless occupies a broad tarsal domain early in development, localizing later to the metatarsus-tarsus boundary, suggestive of a tarsal patterning function. Here, we tested the function of harvestman clawless using RNAi. Unlike insects, we show that clawless knockdown results in disrupted tarsal growth and patterning of its proximal segmental boundary, with no effect on the claw. Truncation of the tarsus is associated with defective tarsomere formation. We additionally surveyed clawless homologs in exemplars of chelicerate diversity, which suggests that the tarsal-patterning function for clawless was likely present in the chelicerate common ancestor. These results, alongside available expression data, suggest panarthropod appendage patterning exhibits numerous cases of developmental system drift.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

It is essential for viability in Staphylococcus aureus and regulates genes that encode the autolysins and other critical proteins. The sensor kinase WalK phosphorylates WalR at aspartic acid residue 53 (D53) in the receiver domain, stimulating promoter DNA binding. Unlike other response regulators, WalR is thought to have a second kinase, the serine/threonine kinase PknB, which phosphorylates the receiver domain at threonine residue 101. We previously reported that a walR mutation that changed T101 to a methionine conferred low level resistance to vancomycin and greatly increased susceptibility to tunicamycin along with several other phenotypic traits. In this work we demonstrate similarities between pknB null and the WalRT101M mutants that support a regulatory role for PknB-mediated phosphorylation of WalR. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, we confirm the specificity of this posttranslational modification and confirm that phosphorylation at both D53 and T101 is important for dimer formation. Importantly, using an in silico approach, we have discovered that phosphorylation at T101 creates an intermolecular hydrogen bond between the phosphate group and E108, that strengthens contacts along the WalR dimerization interface. This is the first time that a clear molecular role has been assigned to this posttranslational modification and it is the strongest molecular evidence to date for a direct functional relationship between PknB and WalR. We propose that, together with primary activation by WalK, PknB serves as a second potentiating input into the WalKR system, stimulating WalR dimer formation, and target DNA binding and tethering this transcriptional event to important extracellular stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Most isolates (71/124) were capable of spoiling both foods, but some were only capable of spoiling only chicken (21/124) or spinach (23/124), or neither (9/124). Our data also demonstrated that the type of fresh food the strain was isolated from influenced spoilage capabilities: strains isolated from meat were likely to spoil both chicken and spinach, while those isolated from leafy greens were more likely to spoil only spinach. We used fluorescence microscopy to visualise how Pseudomonas spoilage species interacted with the meat or leaf tissue and observed significant tissue destruction associated with biofilm formation. For chicken, this was associated with the formation of dense biofilm pillars that penetrated deep into the tissue. For spinach we observed biofilms on the leaf in areas of tissue degradation. Finally, we explored the correlation between potentially relevant phenotypes (in vitro biofilm, motility and secreted enzyme production) and spoilage capabilities. There was no significant correlation between any of these phenotypes and spoilage, except for secreted protease activity and chicken spoilage.

Although there have been many successful uses of these tools for improved stability, solubility, and ligand binding, there have been fewer uses of these tools for designing proteins that have intrinsic allosteric mechanisms. In this regard, allosteric transcription factors (aTFs) are a class of regulatory proteins that includes repressors and activators that respond to environmental signals by allosteric communication to regulate their binding with DNA elements. The data exist for evaluating design algorithms for their ability to take allostery into account, as many aTFs have previously been engineered to respond to new ligands, enabling their use as biosensors. In particular, previous work from our lab used directed evolution to change the effector specificity of the transcriptional repressor, RamR, from cholic acids to each of five benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs). We wanted to see to what extent we could recapitulate these results by instead using LigandMPNN to design the ligand binding pocket. The wild-type RamR structure was predicted in complex with the five BIAs, and the binding pocket was then targeted for computational redesign. However, there was little overlap between the results of directed evolution and computational redesign, and in fact the nine redesigned protein variants tested proved not to be functional in Escherichia coli. Overall, these and other results suggest that different protein design methods may be needed to advance the computational design of allosteric or conformationally flexible proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

In aphids, dual-symbiotic systems involving the ancient obligate symbiont Buchnera aphidicola and a more recently acquired companion symbiont, such as Serratia symbiotica, have been well-documented in Lachninae and Chaitophorinae subfamilies. Recently, a novel Buchnera-Arsenophonus dual-symbiosis was discovered in Ceratovacuna japonica (Hormaphidinae). This study expands the knowledge of bacterial symbionts in the Hormaphidinae subfamily, particularly focusing on Ceratovacuna nekoashi and Pseudoregma panicola, to elucidate the evolutionary trajectory of dual-symbiosis within this lineage. Our 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis revealed that Cerataphidini species consistently harbor companion symbionts alongside Buchnera, whereas Hormaphidini and Nipponaphidini species harbor only Buchnera. Notably, Arsenophonus in C. nekoashi and C. japonica have distinct phylogenetic origins, and P. panicola has acquired Symbiopectobacterium instead of Arsenophonus. Microscopic analyses demonstrated that these companion symbionts are maternally transmitted and occupy distinct cell types from those harboring Buchnera. Genome sequencing revealed extreme reduction in Buchnera genomes to [~]0.4 Mbp in both C. nekoashi and P. panicola, comparable to C. japonica but significantly smaller than Buchnera genomes of [~]0.6 Mbp in mono-symbioses. The companion symbionts possess complete riboflavin biosynthesis pathways lost in Buchnera.

Recent phylogenetic work on various clades in the family has resulted in a plethora of names at various taxonomic levels. This results in a confusing set of names applied to clades at different ranks, and to the use of informal names that are often not accepted in online resources. To solve this problem, we present here a phylogenetic classification following the PhyloCode for the Solanaceae. Traditional taxon names previously recognized at the ranks of tribe, genus, and section were maintained when associated with clades. We base our clade definitions on a newly constructed phylogeny of the family using 10 plastid and nuclear markers with a broad sampling of 1,474 species, roughly half of the diversity of the family. We complement this marker-based analysis with a phylogenomic analysis of 110 taxa (including 97 of the 102 genera in the family) using the Angiosperms353 probe set. This pair of analyses produced highly concordant phylogenies and provides strong support for the clades included in the classification. In total, we propose and define rank-free names for 38 major clades, including 16 infrageneric taxa within the mega-diverse Solanum. This rank-free system intends to promote name stability as new data become available, avoiding name changes to well-known groups.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

It contains over 11 million cells, each assigned to one of ten curated cell-type categories designed to accommodate a pan-cancer setting. Annotations were derived through Tangram-based alignment to single-cell reference atlases, followed by slide-specific clustering and differential expression analysis. Co-registered H&E images enabled extraction of over 500,000 patches with segmentation and classification masks.

The reason often invoked is the dysregulation of the immune system, which is both cause and consequence of ageing. However, we do not all age in the same way, and increased susceptibility may not be solely due to immune dysregulation affecting resistance to infection. There are many possible ways to make a host less tolerant to infection by dysregulating key physiological or metabolic processes. We hypothesised that the increase in susceptibility to infection over age can be linked to both immune ageing and decreased tolerance, and importantly, that it will depend on genotype and sex of the host. We assessed susceptibility to Gram-negative bacterial challenge in both sexes in 22 Drosophila isolines at young and old ages, and leveraged variation between genotypes to investigate how frequently an increase in susceptibility to infection was more associated with a decline in resistance or disease tolerance mechanisms. To achieve this, we assessed pathogen load to report on host immune decline. Strikingly, in most cases, greater infection susceptibility at old age was driven by reduced tolerance, although we also frequently identify cases that suffered bona fide immunosenescence, e.g. impaired resistance. We screened across bacterial pathogens during systemic and oral infections and found sex-specific signatures in survival in young and old individuals, but increased susceptibility with age occurred in both sexes. Pairing infection survival with lifespan data, we find that transcending genotype variation, susceptibility at old age predicts lifespan in males only, regardless of the existence or direction of sex bias in longevity. This work highlights that increased infection susceptibility is an early-arising ageing phenotype that occurs in both sexes, but only predicts lifespan in males, paralleling burgeoning evidence in mammals for male-biased effects of age on infection and its connection with mortality. Our data support a model where infection susceptibility increases with age following the same multiplicative pattern as organismal mortality, with existing failures making new failures more consequential. We propose that the term ""immunosenescence"" be used specifically to describe proven dysregulation of immune tissue resistance mechanisms. We argue that to fully understand the drivers of age-related susceptibility to infection, it is essential to consider genotype, sex, and their interaction, as well as the dysregulation of non-immune functions that influence the ability to control pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Previous studies analysed associations between cephalic morphometry, trends through time and with diversity, and these behaviours. However, no studies have yet quantitatively compared the importance of these different varied factors on cephalic morphometry. Here, we explore the association between trilobite cephalic morphometry and taxonomic variables, moulting behaviour, and facial suture type in Principal Components Analysis morphospace, and assess whether these variables can predict cephalic morphometry using Linear Discriminant Analyses. We employed Linear Mixed-Effects Models (LMMs) to quantify the hierarchical importance of these variables for determining cephalic disparity. The dataset used comprises cephalon outlines for 762 species of trilobites from across the globe and through the entire Palaeozoic. We found that variation in cephalic morphometry is not clearly associated with moulting behaviour, nor is moulting behaviour linked to facial suture type. Trilobite moulting behaviour is evidently too phenotypically plastic, and/or preservationally impacted, to produce clear signals across broad datasets. Results demonstrate the utility of LMMs for palaeontological datasets; we found that family-level assignment overall well explains cephalic morphometry, more so than order-level assignment which shows significant overlap in morphospace. Geological Period, facial suture type, and moulting behaviour had little impact on cephalic morphometry. We thereby demonstrate that trilobite cephalic outline morphometry is generally in accordance with trilobite family-level systematics and highlight the use of LMMs for interrogating broad-scale fossil morphological data.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

However, the contribution of ipsilateral motor cortical outputs on motor control remains unclear. Here, we identify and characterize a distinct population of cortico-cerebellar (C-C) neurons in the motor cortex that form monosynaptic projections to the ipsilateral cerebellar nuclei. The C-C neurons receive preferential local motor cortical inputs and exhibit projection patterns distinct from cortico-pontine projecting neurons. Using in vivo imaging and optogenetic perturbations, we show that these neurons are active during locomotion and transitions of volitional movements. Disruption of the C-C projection severely affects the locomotion and balancing. Interestingly, the C-C pathway is selectively involved in the initiation and coordination of ipsilateral forelimb movements, without affecting contralateral movement kinematics. These findings shed light on a non-canonical cortico-cerebellar pathway that supports ipsilateral motor control, complementing the traditional control mechanisms of the cerebral cortex over the contralateral motor domains.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

We sought to connect escape response performance to genotype and phenotype across ontogenetic stages within a single population of Threespine Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.), to determine if a gene of major effect (Ectodysplasin; Eda) on adaptive lateral armour plate phenotype and fitness conveys a performance advantage in brackish and saltwater environments. We predicted that possession of one or more low-plated alleles would result in better escape performance in brackish environments across ontogeny, and that Eda genotype would result in variation in shape phenotype that would be predictive of escape performance before the completion of lateral plate development. We assessed three kinematic variables derived from C-start escape responses in wild-caught, F1 juvenile, and F1 adults, and found that Eda genotypes did not directly impact maximum velocity or curvature coefficient, but linked phenotypes contributed to an increase in total distance traveled in F1 adults. We further showed that Eda genotype impacted growth, producing variation in size which in turn influenced escape performance variables across age groups, with a particular focus on total distance traveled. The influence of Eda genotype on shape was confounded by sexual dimorphism, indicating that further sex-specific studies on shape and performance are needed. The presence of at least one low-plated allele conferred a growth advantage, particularly in a freshwater rearing environment, consistent with known pleiotropic effects of Eda, including on skeletal development, that may be modulating anti-predator responses before plate phenotype is fully expressed. Altogether, more ontogenic studies are needed to ensure the influence of development on adaptive traits is more clearly understood.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Using a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA), we tested the regulatory potential of a set of previously identified highly conserved craniofacial enhancers that showed convergent sequence acceleration in thylacine and wolf (TWARs). We compared orthologous sequences from six different taxa, including outgroup taxa with non-convergent craniofacial phenotypes (Tasmanian devil and giant panda) and ancestral reconstructions for marsupial and placental carnivores (Dasyuromorphia and Carnivora). Dense 10bp tiling allowed us to thoroughly examine features associated with activity, including percentage GC content and transcription factor binding motifs turnover. We identified marked conservation of levels and patterns of regulatory activity across all six taxa, as well as multiple cases of differentially active TWARs within each clade, with both thylacine and wolf driving functional divergence. However, evidence of convergent divergence was limited to a set of neighbouring TWARs near the neural crest gene Phox2b -- one of which exhibited reduced activity in the wolf, and the other in the thylacine. Ultimately our findings suggest that shared gene regulatory potential is not a feature of these convergently accelerated regions in the thylacine and wolf.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Here we present the first direct evidence that H3K4me3 is not a cause but a consequence of transcriptional activation, functioning as a downstream epigenetic response. Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription. Together, these findings redefine H3K4me3 as a post-transcriptional histone mark, revealing an unexpected layer of epigenetic regulation with broad implications for gene expression control.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Most current methods fall at one of two extremes: either opaque deep learning models that obscure biological meaning, or simplified frameworks that treat genes as isolated units. As such, these approaches overlook a crucial insight: gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cellular states can be harnessed to model perturbation responses. Here we present CIPHER (Covariance Inference for Perturbation and High-dimensional Expression Response), a conceptual framework leveraging linear response theory from statistical physics to predict transcriptome-wide perturbation outcomes using gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cells. We validated CIPHER on synthetic regulatory networks before applying it to 11 large-scale single-cell perturbation datasets covering 4,234 perturbations and over 1.36M cells. CIPHER robustly recapitulated genome-wide responses to single and double perturbations by exploiting baseline gene covariance structure. Importantly, eliminating gene-gene covariances, while retaining gene-intrinsic variances, reduced model performance by 11-fold, demonstrating the rich information stored within baseline fluctuation structures. Moreover, gene-gene correlations transferred successfully across independent experiments of the same cell type, revealing stereotypic fluctuation structures. Furthermore, CIPHER outperformed conventional differential expression metrics in identifying true perturbations while providing uncertainty-aware effect size estimates through Bayesian inference. Finally, most genome-wide responses propagated through the covariance matrix along approximately three independent and global gene modules. CIPHER underscores the importance of theoretically-grounded models in capturing complex biological responses, highlighting fundamental design principles encoded in cellular fluctuation patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Conversely, the global circulation of [mdash] and uneven competition between -- distinct Mtb strains suggest certain bacterial clades have enhanced ability to spread across communities, potentially by evading memory responses gained by prior infection with genomically different strains. To address whether memory responses induced by one strain can protect against a genetically distinct strain, we conducted a heterologous reinfection study in cynomolgus macaques involving primary infection by a Lineage 4 Erdman Mtb strain and subsequent re-challenge by a Lineage 2 strain (HT-L2). HT-L2 belongs to a clade that epidemiology showed to be spreading successfully over the last decade in Lima, Peru. Here, through microbiologic, PET-CT imaging and sequencing of Mtb genomic barcodes, we show that reinfected animals developed fewer lung lesions and controlled both pulmonary and disseminated forms of disease better than naive animals that have had no prior exposure to Mtb. Thus, protection against reinfection is not limited by Mtb lineage, providing optimism that vaccines can be effective across populations and geographic locations.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

SpaCNA constructs adjacency graphs using spatial proximity and H&E stained image similarity, refines the raw gene expressions, and implements a Hidden Markov Random Field model for robust CNA state inference. Through extensive benchmarking on simulated data and multi-cancer cohorts, SpaCNA demonstrates superior accuracy and outperforms existing methods in CNA detection and tumor region identification. In real-world applications to breast cancer and colorectal cancer, SpaCNA reveals spatially distinct subclones with context-dependent interactions within the microenvironment. Additionally, applied to a 3D ST dataset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, SpaCNA uncovers clone-specific CNAs associated with therapeutic resistance biomarkers across multiple slices. By facilitating precise spatial mapping of CNAs and tumor architecture, SpaCNA significantly enhances our understanding of intratumoral heterogeneity and spatial evolutionary patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

However, while the electrodes and acquisition systems for non-human electrophysiology have been enhanced over the past decades to enable higher-yield single-neuron detections, those advances have not been translated into human electrophysiology. Single-wire electrodes are still ubiquitously used, and although acquisition systems have augmented their signal-to-noise ratio over the last 15 years, we are still limited by their low electrode count. Moreover, unlike non-human recordings, human recordings often take place in hospitals where different noise sources and subject breaks can compromise the recording quality during experimental sessions. To bridge this gap, this work presents an automatic, open-source spike sorting pipeline that leverages contemporary computational capabilities and is tailored to single-neuron recordings from humans acquired via microwires. The pipeline is implemented in both MATLAB and Python, ensuring accessibility and compatibility across computational environments. Its modular and comprehensive structure supports customization and even opportunities for new developments as per the requirements of the user and the application. One feature is a data-driven automatic module to remove narrow-band interference, besides electrical line noise, which can be an essential tool while recording in clinical settings, particularly for online processing implementations. Following spike detection, the pipeline implements an artifact rejection module that separates waveforms that are unlikely to be associated with actual spikes. Additionally, we introduce a configurable feature-extraction, clustering, and benchmarking framework that not only allows flexibility in employing user-defined or conventional algorithms, such as wavelet transform with superparamagnetic clustering, but can also evaluate multi-method agreement among the different sorters. The pipeline also utilizes established and novel quality metrics to support semiautomatic curation of isolated clusters. Furthermore, we can integrate the customized pipeline with experimental tasks by removing task-unrelated waveforms (e.g., during a break in a task), and prevent over-clustering with the aid of metrics for comparing response profiles. Thus, the presented pipeline addresses the three-pronged objectives of algorithm-adaptability, rigorous validation, and human single-neuron recording optimization to support clinical and cognitive neuroscience applications.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

However, the mechanisms by which pathogens hijack helper NLR pathways are poorly understood. Here, we show that an effector from the potato late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans bridges the host protein NbTOL9a, a putative member of the host ESCRT pathway, to a helper NLR to suppress immunity. In this work, we solved the crystal structure of the RXLR-LWY effector AVRcap1b in complex with the ENTH domain of NbTOL9a. The structure revealed that unlike other RXLR-LWY effectors, AVRcap1b has a novel L-shaped fold that defines a new structural family of effectors in the Phytophthora genus. Moreover, we defined the AVRcap1b/NbTOL9a binding interface and designed effector mutants that dont bind NbTOL9a, impairing immune suppression. This indicates that ENTH binding is required for full virulence activity of this effector. Lastly, we show that AVRcap1b associates specifically with activated NbNRC2 independently of NbTOL9a binding. This suggests that the effector functions as a bridge that interconnects NbNRC2 with the NbTOL9a pathway. These results illustrate an unprecedented pathogen mechanism to hijack helper NLR pathways and suppress immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

This primary genetic cue is often located on a single locus--referred to as sex chromosomes--and can be limited to females (in a ZZ/ZW system) or males (in an XX/XY system). One trademark of sex chromosomes is a restriction or cessation of recombination surrounding the sex-limited region (to prevent its inheritance in the homogametic sex). This may lead to--through a variety of mechanisms--higher amounts of genetic divergence within this region, i.e. between the X/Z and Y/W chromosomes, especially when compared to their autosomal counterparts. Recent advances in genome sequencing and computation have brought with them the ability to resolve haplotypes within a diploid individual, permitting assembly of previously challenging genomic regions like sex chromosomes. Leveraging these advances, we identified replicable diagnostic characteristics between typical autosomes and sex chromosomes (within a single genome assembly). Under this framework, we can use this information to identify putative sex chromosome linkage groups across divergent vertebrate taxa and simultaneously curate misassembled regions on autosomes. Here, we present this conceptual framework and associated tool for identifying candidate sex chromosome linkage groups from a single, diploid individual dubbed Sex Chromosome Identification by Negating Kmer Densities, or SCINKD.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Average reported losses since the preceding spring exceeded 60%, with substantial variation among operations. Many colonies were still actively collapsing in January, 2025, when pooled and individual samples were collected then screened for levels of known honey bee pathogens and parasites. Deformed wing virus strains A and B, along with Acute bee paralysis virus, were found at unusually high levels, either in pooled colony samples or in individual bees exhibiting shaking behaviors and morbidity.

Differences between these two analyses suggest that direct collections of morbid bees provide a superior diagnostic for causal viruses, a suggestion borne out by confirmation of symptoms and morbidity following isolation and new inoculations. Since these viruses are known to be vectored by parasitic Varroa mites, mites from collapsed colonies were in turn screened for resistance to amitraz, a critical miticide used widely by beekeepers. Miticide resistance was found in all collected Varroa, underscoring the urgent need for new control strategies for this parasite. While viruses are a likely end-stage cause of colony death, other stressors such as nutritional stress and agrochemicals may have also played significant roles.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Whether computational prediction tools can identify amyloid-forming potential in thrombus proteomes remains unclear.

MethodsAmyloGram is a computational tool that estimates amyloid-forming potential based on n-gram sequence encoding and random forest classification. Using AmyloGram, we analyzed 204 proteins tagged by humans as amyloidogenic in UniProt. We then applied the same approach to proteins identified in thrombi retrieved using mechanical thrombectomy from patients with cardioembolic and atherothrombotic stroke. In addition we used AmyloGram to analyse the amyloidogenicity of 83,567 canonical human protein sequences.

ResultsAmong the UniProt-annotated  amyloid set, nearly all proteins received AmyloGram scores above 0.7, including 23 of the 24 human proteins. Even the lowest-scoring human protein, lysozyme (scoring 0.675), is known to form amyloid under certain conditions. In thrombi from both stroke subtypes, all detected proteins had AmyloGram scores above 0.7, suggesting a high likelihood of amyloid content. A majority of unannotated proteins also achieve AmyloGram scores exceeding 0.7.

ConclusionsAmyloGram reliably identifies known amyloid-forming proteins and reveals that stroke thrombi are enriched for proteins with high amyloidogenic potential. These findings support the hypothesis that thrombus formation in stroke involves amyloid-related mechanisms and warrant further investigation using histological and functional validation.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Here, we use a unique collection of longitudinal blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia to sensitively track the dynamics of DNA methylation changes at high temporal resolution. We identify thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that exhibit altered patterns of methylation up to 10 years before acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) diagnosis. Most of these DMRs are strongly associated with expanding clones carrying somatic driver mutations. We identify a subset of  epigenetic driver DMRs characterised by recurrent CpG alterations that are highly shared across pre-AML cases. These are likely to reflect early epigenetic reprogramming associated with AML development. We also reveal large numbers of stochastic  passenger CpGs whose differential methylation results from hitch-hiking with clonal expansions driven by somatically acquired genetic events. These passenger CpGs can be exploited for lineage tracing to discover clonal expansions driven by missing driver mutations.

Residential CD4 T cells, regulatory T cells, B cells, and NK cells have been demonstrated to share phenotypic properties with residential CD8 T cells, but the migratory kinetics are even more poorly defined. Here we used probabilistic modelling on a large parabiosis dataset, covering multiple time-points and tissues, to calculate migration kinetics and dwell times of multiple lymphocyte subsets across a diverse set of tissues. Markov chain modelling identified distinct cell type-specific and tissue-specific residency patterns. The liver and gut were prone to prolonged residency compared to other tissue types, and a hierarchy of residency was observed with CD8 T cells and NK cells demonstrating longer residency than CD4 conventional T cells and regulatory T cells, which in turn resided in tissues longer than B cells. With few exceptions, however, average residency was at least an order of magnitude shorter than the life-span of the mouse, indicating a more dynamic form of steady-state tissue residency than usually assumed.

Here, using confocal microscopy and genetically encoded fluorescent sensors targeted to mitochondria and cytosol, we visualized beat-to-beat ATP dynamics in ventricular myocytes from adult male and female mice. These probes showed fluctuations in mitochondrial ATP levels with each contraction, revealing two distinct, spatially localized waveforms--ATP ""gain"" and ATP ""dip""--representing transient increases or decreases in matrix ATP levels, respectively. These waveforms were tightly phase-locked to intracellular Ca2+ transients and organized into energetic microdomains. Although female myocytes exhibited larger local mitochondrial ATP transients than their male counterparts, their total mitochondrial volume was lower. Female myocytes also exhibited tighter coupling between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria and showed a higher concentration of mitofusin 2 and ATP synthase catalytic -subunit per unit volume, suggesting more efficient ATP production. Cytosolic ATP transients mirrored mitochondrial waveforms and domain structure in both male and female myocytes. During faster pacing, diastolic cytosolic ATP rose more rapidly in female myocytes, whereas the accompanying beat-locked ATP transients increased in both sexes but did so proportionally more in males than in females. These findings demonstrate that ATP is synthesized on demand--beat by beat--in a modular, microdomain-specific manner. We propose that male myocytes rely on greater mitochondrial mass for energetic scaling, whereas female cells employ architectural precision to optimize ATP delivery.

Excitation of ventricular myocytes triggers Ca2+ entry through T-tubular L-type CaV1.2 channels (red), activating type-2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) clusters in the adjoining sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Released Ca2+ traverses the 12-nm cleft and enters subsarcolemmal mitochondria via mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) tethers (magenta), accelerating oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP (red ovals). In female myocytes (left), a select subset of tightly SR-coupled mitochondria produces large, beat-locked ATP surges that create localized energetic micro-domains. In male myocytes (right), looser SR-mitochondrial spacing and a greater mitochondrial density distribute the Ca2+ load evenly, yielding smaller but spatially uniform ATP transients. Thus, sex-specific differences in SR-mitochondrial nano couplingnot the excitation-contraction sequence itselfdetermine the amplitude and heterogeneity of beat-to-beat ATP supply in the heart.

However, the regulatory logic and specific gene networks that define cell identities remain poorly resolved across the animal tree of life. As early-branching metazoans, cnidarians can offer insights into the early evolution of cell type-specific genome regulation. Here, we profiled chromatin accessibility in 60,000 cells from whole adults and gastrula-stage embryos of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We identified 112,728 CREs and quantified their activity across cell types, revealing pervasive combinatorial enhancer usage and distinct promoter architectures. To decode the underlying regulatory grammar, we trained sequence-based models predicting CRE accessibility and used these models to infer ontogenetic relationships among cell types. By integrating sequence motifs, transcription factor expression, and CRE accessibility, we systematically reconstructed the gene regulatory networks that define cnidarian cell types. Our results reveal the regulatory complexity underlying cell differentiation in a morphologically simple animal and highlight conserved principles in animal gene regulation. This work provides a foundation for comparative regulatory genomics to understand the evolutionary emergence of animal cell type diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

While both classical and AI-based structural approaches have recently provided crucial insights into ligand-LRR-RK binding mechanisms, our understanding of ligand perception by LRR-RPs remains limited. In contrast to LRR-RKs, many LRR-RPs typically embed one or more loopout regions in their extracellular domains that are crucial for functionality. Here, we employed an AI-based approach to reveal a novel ligand-binding mechanism shared by the Arabidopsis LRR-RPs RLP23 and RLP42 - the PRRs for the short peptide ligands nlp20 and pg13, derived from NECROSIS- AND ETHYLENE-INDUCING PEPTIDE 1-like proteins (NLPs) and fungal endopolygalacturonases (PGs), respectively. This mechanism relies on a {beta}-strand interaction with the N-terminal part of the island domain (ID) loopout, which adopts an antiparallel {beta}-sheet conformation. Additionally, we investigated the larger and more complex binding interface of RLP32 - the PRR for proteobacterial TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 1 (IF1), a folded protein ligand that requires its tertiary structure for recognition. Finally, we describe a mechanistic role of the ID for co-receptor recruitment conserved across LRR-RPs. Together, our results shed light on the ligand-binding mechanisms and receptor complex formation of this important class of PRRs. This opens avenues for a molecular understanding of the plant-pathogen co-evolution, as well as the engineering of plant immune receptors for crop disease resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Our account of harm-mitigating, neurobehavioural responses furnishes a mechanistic understanding of maladaptive behaviour and impaired belief-updating, which are often underspecified in conceptual analyses. Grounded in neurobiological evidence, we specify PTSD-related impairment in terms of Bayesian belief-updating, and establish an adaptive/maladaptive boundary using active inference and simulation studies.

We locate pathogenesis in maladaptive precision following traumatic learning, characterised by aberrant Bayesian credit assignment. Future scientific and clinical studies can test the validity of these insights, which could underwrite our understanding of the phenomenology, diagnostics and ultimately treatment intervention in post-traumatic disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Within allopolyploids, duplicated genes across subgenomes, called homeologs, are thought to enhance environmental robustness by shifting their expression ratios depending on environmental and developmental changes. However, existing methods for detecting such ratio shifts, including HomeoRoq and Fishers exact test, are limited to allopolyploids with two subgenome sets inherited from two progenitors, and thus cannot handle more complex cases (e.g., allohexaploid wheat). Here, we present the HOmeolog Bias Identification Test (HOBIT), a statistical method for detecting shifts in homeolog expression ratios across different conditions using RNA-Seq count data. HOBIT performs a likelihood ratio test for each homeolog, comparing a full model allowing homeolog expression ratios to vary across conditions with a reduced model assuming constant ratios. Simulation benchmarks for allotetraploids and allohexaploids demonstrated that HOBIT outperforms existing methods in both area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and F1 score. Application to real RNA-Seq datasets from allotetraploid Cardamine flexuosa, allotriploid Cardamine insueta, and Triticum aestivum (wheat) produced biologically consistent results reflecting experimental settings. HOBIT provides a promising framework for uncovering homeolog regulation and adaptive responses in allopolyploids, without restrictions of ploidy complexities.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

However, recent studies have uncovered their role in antigen surveillance and immune signalling initiation. To investigate how membrane protrusions initiate and contribute to signalling, from the first cell-cell contact to immunological synapse formation, we performed dynamic imaging experiments of endogenously tagged signalling proteins in T cells. To quantitatively capture the early dynamics of cell-cell interactions, we employed HER2-CAR-expressing T cells targeting HER2+breast cancer cells. By harnessing live-cell imaging and super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy we were able to capture topological membrane changes and their correlation with mesoscale protein rearrangements over time. Our findings indicate that, prior to activation, key molecular players in T cell activation, including the kinase Lck, the phosphatase CD45 and the adaptor LAT, as well as the exogenously expressed CAR, lack any enrichment in actin-rich protrusions. However, upon initial contact of the T cell with the target cell, a dynamic and fast rearrangement of the surface receptors, phosphatases, and kinases occurs within the protrusions, ensuring a rapid and effective initiation of the immune signalling cascade. The rapid clustering of the HER2-CAR occurs preferentially within protrusions rather than flat membrane regions and is accompanied by enhanced recruitment of the kinase ZAP-70 and LAT. While the localisation of the kinase Lck remained unchanged, protrusion-cell contacts trigger a pronounced exclusion of the phosphatase CD45, an effect observed both with and without the cytosolic signalling domain of the CAR. Overall, the signalling machinery rearranged more rapidly and efficiently at contacts mediated by protrusive structures compared to non-protrusive regions. Together, our data provide a quantitative framework illustrating how signalling proteins are dynamically reorganised to facilitate CAR-mediated activation within these specialised structures.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

By coupling base excision repair (BER) events to a programmable DNA-based transducer, our system converts the activity of DNA glycosylases, such as uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) and human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (hOGG1), into a robust fluorescence signal via Cas12a-mediated trans-cleavage.

Additionally, it also enables in 15 minutes the throughput screening of novel potential inhibitors with high sensitivity. The modular design allows adaptation to diverse repair enzymes, offering a generalizable strategy for transforming intracellular repair events into programmable outputs.

However, the specific metabolic adaptations driven by fructose in prostate cancer (PCa) remain unexplored.

MethodsWe investigated the metabolic consequences of chronic fructose exposure in androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (PC-3) PCa cell lines. We evaluated the expression, localization, and function of the fructose transporter Glut-5 and assessed metabolic fluxes, enzyme expression, lipid accumulation, and global metabolite profiles using molecular, imaging, and metabolomic approaches.

ResultsGlut-5 was primarily localized to early endosomes under basal and fructose-stimulated conditions, suggesting a non-canonical role potentially consistent with transceptor function. Chronic fructose exposure significantly upregulated Glut-5 expression and enhanced fructose uptake, but did not alter substantially its subcellular localization. Functionally, fructose reduced lactate production and mitochondrial ATP output, indicating a metabolic shift away from glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. In LNCaP cells, fructose induced robust activation of de novo lipogenesis (DNL), evidenced by upregulation of FASN and G6PD, increased lipid droplet accumulation, and enhanced levels of key fatty acid metabolites (e.g., TG, EPA, DHA). In contrast, PC-3 cells exhibited a distinct metabolic response, characterized by increased ceramide and amino acid metabolites. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of lipid metabolism using etomoxir abrogated proliferation in both cell lines under fructose stimulation.

ConclusionsThese findings reveal that fructose promotes a metabolic reprogramming in PCa cells that is cell type- and AR-dependent, enhancing lipogenesis and potentially contributing to tumor progression. Our study identifies Glut-5-mediated fructolysis and lipid metabolic pathways as key vulnerabilities in PCa, offering potential avenues for metabolic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Despite forays into the description and quantification of these punctuated events, the effects of such events on subsequent cancer evolution remain incompletely understood. Here we investigate how non-gradual mutagenesis affects the ability of tumor cells to acquire and retain fitness-enhancing adaptations. We find that punctuated mutagenesis significantly facilitates adaptation in scenarios where adaptation requires crossing a fitness valley, i.e. when multiple mutations are required which individually are maladaptive but jointly confer a fitness advantage. By increasing the probability that multiple mutations occur in close succession, punctuation increases the chance that mutants in a fitness valley mutate further to reach a fitness peak before going extinct. Analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we find that tumors with signatures of APOBEC mutagenesis, which has been shown to proceed in episodic bursts, exhibit patterns consistent with higher rates of crossing fitness valleys. Lastly, we characterize how the interplay between this enhanced ability to cross fitness valleys and adaptation-limiting effects of clonal interference affects overall adaptability in complex fitness landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

MethodsThis in vitro study used sixty dental enamel specimens, divided into 12 groups: traditional Red Bull(R) energy drink modified with three concentrations each of calcium/phosphorus/potassium complex (0.71, 1.43, and 2.15g), dicalcium malate (0.83, 1.66, and 2.50g), and calcium citrate malate (1.26, 2.53, and 3.80g); unmodified traditional Red Bull(R) energy drink; deionized water; and commercially available calcium-supplemented Life Mix Baixa Caloria(R) orange juice. The pH of all drinks was measured using a pHmeter. Specimens were exposed to the drinks for two minutes. Surface roughness and microhardness were assessed before and after exposure using a rugosimeter and a Vickers microhardness tester, respectively.

ResultsThe addition of calcium/phosphorus/potassium complex increased the energy drinks pH proportionally to the concentration added. Specimens exposed to modified drinks showed reduced roughness (p < 0.004) compared to control drinks. Drinks modified with 2.50g of dicalcium malate and 2.15g of the calcium/phosphorus/potassium complex significantly preserved enamel microhardness (p < 0.004) compared to the unmodified energy drink. Across all modifications, enamel surface microhardness loss was lower than in control groups, except for deionized water.

Genomic exploration continually reveals novel microbial lineages, often exhibiting extreme genome reduction, particularly within symbiotic relationships. Here, we report the discovery of Candidatus Sukunaarchaeum mirabile, a novel archaeon with an unprecedentedly small genome of only 238 kbp --less than half the size of the smallest previously known archaeal genome-- from a dinoflagellate-associated microbial community. Phylogenetic analyses place Sukunaarchaeum as a deeply branching lineage within the tree of Archaea, representing a novel major branch distinct from established phyla. Environmental sequence data indicate that sequences closely related to Sukunaarchaeum form a diverse and previously overlooked clade in microbial surveys. Its genome is profoundly stripped-down, lacking virtually all recognizable metabolic pathways, and primarily encoding the machinery for its replicative core: DNA replication, transcription, and translation. This suggests an unprecedented level of metabolic dependence on a host, a condition that challenges the functional distinctions between minimal cellular life and viruses. The discovery of Sukunaarchaeum pushes the conventional boundaries of cellular life and highlights the vast unexplored biological novelty within microbial interactions, suggesting that further exploration of symbiotic systems may reveal even more extraordinary life forms, reshaping our understanding of cellular evolution.

The majority of described species are arthropods, which tend to be small and require taxonomic expertise to identify to species level. Therefore, the ability to collect and preserve specimens in a suitable way for long read and Hi-C data generation using very simple approaches with minimal infrastructure is certain to be important in scaling up reference genome generation. Using Anopheles mosquitoes as an insect representative we evaluate how well different preservation liquids protect high molecular weight DNA, RNA, and nuclei for Hi-C when mosquitoes are held intact versus slightly squished. We find that squished samples stored in 100% ethanol and Allprotect held at room temperature for one week result in excellent preservation of both high molecular weight DNA and nuclei for Hi-C. Other tested buffers, including RNAlater, EDTA at several pHs, and DMSO Salt Solution (DESS) performed satisfactorily for long read data generation and RNA retrieval, but less ideally for Hi-C, which may have bigger negative impacts when aiming to generate data for organisms with larger genomes. Field collections requiring dry ice or dry shippers can be logistically challenging to arrange, are notoriously expensive, and DNA degrades rapidly if ultra-cold temperature is not maintained, which is devastating given how expensive and time consuming field work can be. Here we present multiple viable options for room temperature collection and/or shipment for arthropod samples. Further exploration across a broader range of species will hopefully enable cheaper and more widely available reference genome generation globally.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

The viral S protein evolved towards highly efficient antibody evasion and replicative capacity in the upper respiratory tract resulting in high transmissibility. At the same time, the mutations acquired in the S protein diminish infection of the lung epithelium and pathogenic potential. The changing entry requirements for Omicron sub-lineages that lead to this shift in tropism remain poorly understood. We resolve the changing replication requirements of SARS-CoV-2 to be related to two distinct pools of ACE2. The first pool relates to ACE2s role in the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and this pool can complex with TMPRSS2 (RAS-ACE2). The second pool relates to ACE2s role as a protein solute carrier chaperone than cannot complex with TMPRSS2 (Chaperone ACE2). Here, we demonstrate that pre-Omicron lineages replicate in a TMPRSS2 dependent manner across both ACE2 pools, whilst Omicron lineages can only spread and replicate using chaperone ACE2. This provides a mechanistic basis for the evolving infectivity requirements of SARS-CoV-2 and furthermore provides approaches to track and monitor ACE2 utilizing coronaviruses.

Graphical AbstractMechanistic basis for shift in SARS-CoV-2 tropism with the arrival of Omicron. A. Chaperone ACE2 is defined structurally as a heterodimer of dimers with a solute carrier protein-SLC6A19 or SLC6A20. Here this ACE2 structure can exist uncomplexed from TMPRSS2 and enables TMPRSS2 use by both pre-Omicron and Omicron lineages. B. Renin Angiotensin ACE2 is defined by ACE2 with an exposed collectrin-like domain (CLD), which enables binding of TMPRSS2 or ADAM-17. Here ACE2 can form a complex with TMPRSS2 in a manner that allows pre-Omicron but not Omicron lineages to utilize TMPRSS2 to facilitate infection. Here Omicron lineages are heavily attenuated as they cannot use TMPRSS2 to spread. C. to E. Based on single cell profiles, ACE2 can exist as a chaperone with SLC6A20 in C. the Nasal Cavity or D. primarily as RAS-ACE2 in the lung to respond to acute lung injury. E. The largest pool of ACE2 in our body resides within the small intestine on enterocytes and this further facilitates replication in this tissue by pre-Omicron and Omicron lineages.

We have previously shown that the transcription factor ADNP forms the ChAHP complex with the chromatin remodeler CHD4 and HP1 proteins, acting as a site-specific regulator of transcription and antagonist of CTCF binding. However, the molecular basis of these functions remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the CHD4 subunit is essential to antagonize CTCF and silence transcription of transposons, while HP1 proteins are dispensable. Although the remodeling activity of CHD4 is not required for ChAHP chromatin association, it is critical for both transposon repression and CTCF antagonism. Our findings support a model wherein ADNP recruits chromatin remodeling activity in a sequence-specific manner, enabling transcriptional control and local modulation of chromatin architecture.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

MORPH combines a discrepancy-based variational autoencoder with an attention mechanism to predict cellular responses to unseen perturbations. It supports both single-cell transcriptomics and imaging outputs and can generalize to unseen perturbations, combinations of perturbations, and perturbations in new cellular contexts. The attention-based framework enables inference of gene interactions and regulatory networks, while the learned gene embeddings can guide the design of informative perturbations. Overall, we envision MORPH as a flexible tool for optimizing perturbation experiments, enabling efficient exploration of the perturbation space to advance understanding of cellular programs for fundamental research and therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Using Staphylococcus aureus as a model, we found that gene transfer via various mechanisms is significantly restricted between strains from different clonal complexes (CCs), with the notable exception of lateral transduction, which occurs at high frequency. Interestingly, some strains exhibited a ""promiscuous"" ability to accept diverse mobile genetic elements. These strains were defective in the key immune defences of S. aureus, specifically the Type I restriction-modification systems that normally protect against foreign DNA. A broader analysis revealed that such immune-deficient mutants are widespread within S. aureus populations. Our study uncovered a trade-off that explains their persistence in nature: although these mutants are more susceptible to phage attack, they gain an evolutionary advantage by acquiring beneficial genes - such as those conferring antibiotic resistance - which enhance survival under selective pressure. These immune-deficient cells act as gateways for foreign DNA, which, once integrated and advantageous, can spread within the same CC. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for immune-deficient bacteria in facilitating the emergence of novel virulence factors and antibiotic resistance, emphasising their importance in shaping bacterial evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

The designer condensates assemble co-transcriptionally from branched RNA motifs interacting via base-pairing. Exploiting binding selectivity we express orthogonal, non-mixing condensates, and by embedding a protein-binding aptamer we achieve selective protein recruitment. Condensates can be made to dissolve and re-assemble upon thermal cycling, thereby reversibly releasing and re-capturing protein clients. The synthetic organelles are expressed robustly across the cell population and remain stable despite enzymatic RNA processing.

Here we analyzed the DrugAge database, assessing reporting study quality, bias and effect sizes across 667 anti-aging preclinical studies. We found significant shortcomings in reporting of crucial design features such as randomization and blinding, as well as large variation in reporting quality and effects across species. Non-mammal findings typically did not translate to mammals.

Studies supporting these views, however, measured neural activity as a bulk quantity, and related it to blood supply following disparate events in different regions. Here we measure fluctuations in neuronal activity and blood volume associated with the same events across the mouse brain, and find that their relationship is consistent across brain regions but differs in two opposing brainwide neural populations. Functional Ultrasound Imaging (fUSI) revealed that whisking, a marker of arousal, is associated with brainwide fluctuations in blood volume. Simultaneous fUSI and Neuropixels recordings in cortex and hippocampus showed that neurons that increase vs. decrease activity with whisking have distinct hemodynamic response functions. Brainwide Neuropixels recordings revealed that these two opposing populations are present in the entire brain. When summed, their contributions predicted blood volume across brain regions better than predictions from bulk neural activity. The mouse brain thus contains two neural populations with opposite relation to brain state and distinct relationships to blood supply, which together account for brainwide fluctuations in blood volume.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1752444628866

We combined chemically imposed immune activation with single-cell transcriptomics to profile ETI responses across all leaf cell types in Arabidopsis. Despite uniform ETI perception, we find striking divergence between transcriptional outputs: a core set of defense genes is broadly induced, while distinct cell types activate specialized immune modules. We infer that downstream immune execution is shaped not only by immune receptor activation, but also by cell identity and its associated transcriptional regulatory context, including local transcription factor availability and chromatin accessibility. We further demonstrate that transcriptional regulators preferentially induced in epidermal cells are required to restrict invasion by non-adapted pathogens. Their absence permits pathogen entry into deeper tissues despite intact recognition, revealing a spatial division of immune functions. Our findings uncover a layered immune architecture in plants, challenges the assumption of uniform immune execution, and provides a framework for exploring cell-type-specific resistance logic in multicellular hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

We trained participants over seven days to use an extra robotic thumb (Third Thumb, Dani Clode Design), worn on the right hand and controlled via the toes. We tested whether motor learning was confined to the specific tasks and body parts involved in controlling and interacting with the Third Thumb, or whether it could generalise beyond them.

Participants showed broad skill generalisation across tasks, body postures, and even when either the Third Thumb or the controller was reassigned to a different body part, suggesting the development of abstract, body-independent motor representations.

Training also reduced cognitive demands and increased the sense of agency over the device.

In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the initiation of actin assembly has remained a mystery. Here we show that S. cerevisiae Ldb17, the homolog of Dip1, functions as an on-switch for endocytic actin assembly. Unexpectedly, the regulation of Ldb17 is more complicated than that of constitutively active Dip1. Ldb17 is controlled by a coat protein, Sla1, via separate recruitment and activation steps. This regulation was likely lost in the S. pombe lineage and this simplification may be related to other changes in actin assembly between these species.

While environmental factors have been implicated in this behavior, the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We identify a novel role for the conserved calsyntenin protein CASY-1 in regulating swarming. Through genetic, behavioral, and optogenetic approaches, we show that CASY-1 functions in sensory neurons to modulate the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) signaling. Mutants in casy-1 show impaired PDF-1 signaling and reduced inhibition of the serotonin pathway, a known regulator of social behaviors. This dysregulation, along with its associated mechanosensory and foraging defects, likely contributes to the swarming phenotype.

Structural comparison with plants and algae shows that SOD could occupy a similar position via interactions with PsaD. C. velia PSI displays several distinct features, including a split subunit PsaA linked by PsaV, a unique iso-fucoxanthin bound to PsaB, and an extended PsaF coordinating an extra chlorophyll in the membrane.

Here, we visualized the changes in calcium signaling and organelle behavior after activation of the NRC4 (NLR-required for cell death 4) resistosome. We found that NRC4 membrane enrichment coincided with calcium influx. This is followed by sequential mitochondria and plastid disruption, endoplasmic reticulum fragmentation and cytoskeleton depolymerization. Subsequent loss of plasma membrane integrity, nuclear shrinkage, and vacuolar collapse mark the terminal stage of cell death.

In unicellular bacteria, the ParMRC DNA partitioning apparatus is well known for forming actin-like filaments that push low copy number plasmids to opposite cell poles. In multicellular cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the presence of a chromosomally encoded ParMR system suggests it may play an analogous role in chromosome segregation. However, we show here that it instead constitutes a novel cytoskeletal system - termed CorMR - whose loss does not impair DNA segregation but leads to severe morphological defects, revealing a role in maintaining cell shape. Using live-cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that CorM forms dynamically instable filaments. These filaments are recruited to the membrane by CorR, which has acquired a conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that CorM forms antiparallel double-stranded filaments, in contrast to the polar, parallel filament pair seen in ParM. Furthermore, CorMR filaments are excluded from the cell poles and division plane by MinC, via a long N-terminal extension also specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Comparative genomics suggests that cyanobacterial multicellularity co-evolved with the chromosomal relocation of ParMR genes, acquisition of the amphipathic helix in CorR, and functional extension of MinC, supporting an evolutionary link among these features. Our findings uncover a striking repurposing of ancestral biochemical systems, expanding the known roles of ParMR and Min systems beyond plasmid segregation and division site selection to include regulation of cell shape.

ImportanceThe ParMRC system is a well-characterized machinery for the segregation of low-copy-number plasmids to the cell poles and, until now, was primarily described to be encoded on plasmids. We found that during the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, a chromosome-encoded ParMR system has undergone extensive evolutionary and functional repurposing, resulting in a previously undescribed bacterial cytoskeletal system that controls cell shape. We also found that this new cytoskeleton, called CorMR, is under the control of the MinCDE system, which has evolved to not only antagonize Z-ring formation, but also to regulate CorM polymerization. Such interplay between different cytoskeletal systems highlights an intricate regulatory mechanism linking cell division and morphology. As this repurposing of existing cytoskeletal system coincided with the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, it may have played a key role for the evolution of cyanobacteria with distinct cell shapes. Overall, our discovery highlights the plasticity of bacterial polymeric systems and gives insight into the evolution of cellular and multicellular complexity.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

DesignMatched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

The viral non-structural protein NS3 is a membrane-bound AAA+ ATPase of superfamily 3 (SF3) with multiple proposed roles in the norovirus replication cycle. However, the structure of NS3, and the mechanisms by which it contributes to genome replication and membrane remodeling, have remained unknown. We engineered a soluble, hexameric, and catalytically active form of NS3 and determined its cryo-EM structure in the presence of a nucleotide analogue at 2.9 [A] resolution. The structure adopts a split lock-washer architecture characteristic of AAA+ motors that operate via a hand-over-hand translocation mechanism2. Modeling of the nucleotide-binding site reveals conserved features governing ATP binding and hydrolysis. Using integrative modeling with AlphaFold3, we generated a full-length, membrane-associated model of NS3, in which an N-terminal transmembrane domain, central helical bundle, and AAA+ motor form a continuous conduit. This model supports a role for NS3 as a candidate membrane-spanning RNA translocase that couples ATP hydrolysis to genome movement. This structural framework helps address long-standing gaps in our understanding of norovirus replication and establishes a basis for mechanistic studies and structure-guided antiviral design.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters.

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

As part of a broader long-term study on African leopard (Panthera pardus) population ecology in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda, we deployed camera traps on animal trails and at Python Cave, a known roost site of Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and a confirmed Marburg and virus reservoir. This serendipitous deployment yielded the first visual documentation of a multi-trophic predator and scavenger guild interacting at a filovirus reservoir site. Over a five month period (February 16th - June 5th 2025) across 304 trap nights, we recorded at least 14 different vertebrate species, including leopards, primates, raptors, and small carnivores, engaging in bat predation, scavenging on bat remains, guano foraging, or cave exploration across 261 temporally and spatially independent events (>1 hour apart). These instances were structured, repeated and the species continuously made contact with the bats or entered their roosting space. Camera traps also recorded an estimated 400 human individuals visiting the cave -- including school groups, tourists, and local trainees -- the majority with no personal protective equipment. The shallow, accessible structure of Python Cave appears to collapse the typical spatial buffers between reservoir species and both predators and humans. These observations constitute the first ecological confirmation of a dynamic, multispecies exposure network at a known Marburg virus site, and may represent a Rosetta Stone for interpreting the real-time mechanics of zoonotic spillover.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

While these have the potential to significantly accelerate scientific discoveries by creating AI-driven virtual cell models, their progress has been greatly limited by the lack of large-scale high-quality perturbation data, which remains constrained due to scalability bottlenecks and assay variability. Here, we introduce ""Fix-Cryopreserve-ScRNAseq"" (FiCS) Perturb-seq, an industrialized platform for scalable Perturb-seq data generation. We demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq exhibits high sensitivity and low batch effects, effectively capturing perturbation-induced transcriptomic changes and recapitulating known biological pathways and protein complexes. In addition, we release X-Atlas: Orion edition (X-Atlas/Orion), the largest publicly available Perturb-seq atlas. This atlas, generated from two genome-wide FiCS Perturb-seq experiments targeting all human protein-coding genes, comprises eight million cells deeply sequenced to over 16,000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell. Furthermore, we show that single guide RNA (sgRNA) abundance can serve as a proxy for gene knockdown (KD) efficacy. Leveraging the deep sequencing and substantial cell numbers per perturbation, we also show that stratification by sgRNA expression can reveal dose-dependent genetic effects. Taken together, we demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq is an efficient and scalable platform for high-throughput Perturb-seq screens. Through the release of X-Atlas/Orion, we highlight the potential of FiCS Perturb-seq to address current scalability and variability challenges in data generation, advance foundation model development that incorporates gene-dosage effects, and accelerate biological discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Can these divergent perspectives on cortical organization be reconciled within a unifying framework? Using data-driven decomposition of fMRI responses in face-, body-, and scene-selective areas, we identified overlapping activity patterns shared across individuals. Each area encoded multiple interpretable dimensions tuned to both finer subcategory features and coarser cross-category distinctions beyond its preferred category, even in the most category-selective voxels. These dimensions formed distinct clusters within category-selective areas but were also sparsely distributed across the broader visual cortex, supporting both locally selective, category-specific, and globally distributed, feature-based coding. Together, these findings suggest multidimensional tuning as a fundamental organizing principle that integrates feature-selective clusters, category-selective areas, and large-scale tuning maps, providing a more comprehensive understanding of category representations in human visual cortex.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

The protein C2CD3 is critical for distal appendage assembly, with mutations linked to orofaciodigital syndrome and other ciliopathies. However, its precise molecular role in appendage recruitment remains unclear. Using Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-ExM), iterative U-ExM, and in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), we reveal that C2CD3 adopts a radially symmetric 9-fold organization within the centrioles distal lumen. We show that the C-terminal region of C2CD3 localizes close to a [~]100 nm luminal ring structure consisting of [~]27 nodes, while its N-terminal region localizes close to a hook-like structure that attaches to the A-microtubule as it extends from the centriole interior to exterior. This hook structure is adjacent to the DISCO complex (MNR/CEP90/OFD1), which marks future appendage sites. C2CD3 depletion disrupts not only the recruitment of the DISCO complex via direct interaction with MNR but also destabilizes the luminal ring network composed of C2CD3/SFI1/centrin-2/CEP135/NA14, as well as the distal microtubule tip protein CEP162. This reveals an intricate ""in-to-out"" molecular hub connecting the centriolar lumen, distal microtubule cap, and appendages. Although C2CD3 loss results in shorter centrioles and appendage defects, key structural elements remain intact, permitting continued centriole duplication. We propose that C2CD3 forms the luminal ring structure and extends radially to the space between triplet microtubules, functioning as an architectural hub that scaffolds the distal end of the centriole, orchestrating its assembly and directing appendage formation.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628866

Protein- and RNA-rich liquid-like condensates form through phase separation on and around chromatin, driving diverse condensate morphologies with varying sphericity and intra-condensate chromatin density3,4. However, a unifying set of physical principles underlying these varied interactions and their implications for chromatin organization remains elusive. Here, we develop and experimentally validate a mesoscopic model that bridges the physics of phase separation and chromatin mechanics. Specifically, by integrating computational modeling with experiments using two canonical condensate proteins, the heterochromatin protein HP1, and the euchromatin protein BRD4, we demonstrate that wetting properties and chromatin stiffness shape condensate morphology, while condensates remodel chromatin mechanics and organization. This two-way interplay is governed by elastocapillarity--the deformation of chromatin by condensate interfacial tension -- and resolves discrepancies in nuclear condensate behavior, with emergent behaviors that deviate from the simplest liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) models5-8. Our findings underscore that nuclear condensates and chromatin cannot be studied in isolation, as they are fundamentally interdependent, impacted by biomolecularly-defined wetting properties, with implications for genome organization, transcriptional regulation, and epigenetic control in diverse phenotypes, including cancer2,9,10.

His Y-chromosome has been hypothesized to belong to haplogroup C3* (C2a1a3-F1918) but this has yet to be substantiated. To explore the genetic ancestry of Genghis Khan, we analyzed four archaeological individuals from the Golden Horde, including three males and one female, who were buried in separate medieval elite mausoleums in the Ulitau region of Kazakstan. One of the males is believed to be Joshi (Juchi), the eldest son of Genghis Khan. We generated genomic data from these archaeological individuals and found that the three males were paternally related, sharing the Y-chromosome haplogroup C3*, consistent with the hypothesized signature haplotype of Genghis Khan. In addition, we confirm that the Golden Horde elites derived most of their genomes from Ancient Northeast Asians (ANA) while having an additional ancestral component from either Ancient North Eurasians (ANE) or a Berel Scythian related population.

The mechanism by which ectopic gene activation occurs through these gain-of-function enhancer mutations remains poorly understood. Using the ZRS, a benchmark disease-associated enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), as a model, we demonstrate that poised (i.e., accessible but inactive) chromatin sensitizes Shh to aberrant activation in anterior limb bud, leading to polydactyly. In the anterior limb cells of wild-type mice, Shh is inactive, but the ZRS is accessible and marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. We demonstrate that this poising signature explains how over 20 independent rare variants within the ZRS cause Shh misexpression in the same anterior limb bud cell population, resulting in similar limb malformations, despite affecting binding sites for different activators and repressors. Disabling pioneer transcription factor binding to the ZRS suppresses its poised state in anterior cells, prevents aberrant activation of the ZRS by rare variants, and fully rescues limb malformations in variant knock-in mice. A thorough examination of other disease-associated enhancers with pathogenic gain-of-function variants revealed that they are all poised in tissues with ectopic activity. We use this poising signature to predict and validate in vivo ectopic forebrain activity of previously uncharacterized autism-associated non-coding variants. Our findings suggest that spatial enhancer poising, likely a byproduct of development, creates a susceptibility to non-coding mutations and offers a potential mechanistic explanation for the burden of disease-associated non-coding variants.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628867

However, these methods are inherently specialized, relying on predefined assumptions and/or limited scalability. Recent advances in simulation and deep learning provide an alternative approach: learning directly to generalize from synthetic genetic data to infer specific hidden evolutionary processes. Here we reframe the inference of coalescence times as a problem of translation between two biological languages: the sparse, observable patterns of mutation along the genome and the unobservable ancestral recombination graph (ARG) that gave rise to them. Inspired by large language models, we develop cxt, a decoder-only transformer that autoregressively predicts coalescent events conditioned on local mutational context. We show that cxt performs on par with state-of-the-art MCMC-based likelihood models across a broad range of demographic scenarios, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Trained on simulations spanning the stdpopsim catalog, the model generalizes robustly and enables efficient inference at scale, producing over a million coalescence predictions in minutes. In addition cxt produces a well calibrated approximate posterior distribution of its predictions, enabling principled uncertainty quantification.

While the virus itself contributes to pathogenesis, disease severity is primarily influenced by the hosts response to infection. One factor observed to impact the host response is sex, as epidemiological data indicates that male persons have a higher case fatality rate than females infected with MERS-CoV. However, the mechanism underlying this sex bias is unknown and disease course remains difficult to predict. This study investigates how male and female transgenic mice expressing humanized dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (hDPP4) respond to MERS-CoV infection following exposure to either a tolerance-inducing low dose or lethal high dose. We observed that female hDPP4 mice display dose-dependent tolerance to infection and males experienced uniformly lethal disease in both dosing groups. Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis revealed that males suppress innate and inflammatory responses early after infection, causing delayed induction of the host antiviral response. In contrast, high dose females mount an immediate and sustained interferon and inflammatory response, activating antiviral effectors and interferon-stimulated genes. Tolerant females displayed the greatest transcriptional control, showing no pathway enrichment and minimal changes in weight throughout infection. Our results suggest that the magnitude of the response is driven by dose while the nature of the response in shaped by sex. Females mount a more robust response to MERS-CoV infection, allowing females to tolerate low-dose infection but causing uncontrolled inflammation after high dose infection. In contrast, males experienced lethal outcomes regardless of dose. By examining the dynamics of sex-biased host transcriptional responses in determining disease severity, this study highlights the importance of sex as a biological variable in coronavirus pathogenesis research.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628867

We find that the two primates and mouse share similar X chromosome expression dynamics, including X chromosome reactivation (XCR), and that in Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) testes, germ cells undergo female-like XCR and escape of X inactivation. New male-specific regulatory regions have emerged progressively during mammalian evolution, especially on the X following sex chromosome origination. Further analyses revealed that male-specific regulatory regions evolved faster than female-specific ones in both supporting and pre-meiotic germ cells. However, female meiotic germ cells show even higher rates of molecular evolution and exhibit a permissive chromatin state that facilitates the birth of new genes, thus resembling their adult spermatogenic counterparts. Finally, we traced both conserved and species-specific gene expression trajectories across the three mammals, uncovering candidate genes for disorders of sex development that are typically central to cell-type-specific regulatory networks. Together, our study unveils both ancestral mammalian and recently evolved gene regulatory programs that control human- and primate-specific aspects of gonadal development in both sexes.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628867

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2. These structural predictions were based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database, together with corresponding protein sequences obtained from UniProt. We then assessed the predicted interaction structures through various confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we performed a limited evaluation against experimentally determined human protein complex structures not included in the Boltz-2 training regimen, which indicated prediction accuracy consistent with AlphaFold3. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, while highlighting both strengths and limitations. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628867

Correspondingly, current theories describe muscle activity as a function of cortical dynamics. Tasks like speech and locomotion, however, require the integration of voluntary commands with ongoing movements orchestrated by largely independent subcortical centers. In such cases, motor cortex must receive inputs representing the state of the environment and the state of subcortical networks, then transform these inputs into commands that modulate the rhythmic motor pattern. Here, we study this transformation in mice performing an obstacle traversal task, which combines a spinal locomotor pattern with voluntary cortical adjustments. Cortical dynamics contain a prominent representation of motor preparation that is linked to obstacle proximity and robust to removal of somatosensory or visual input, and also maintain a representation of the state of the spinal pattern generator. Readout signals resembling commands for obstacle traversal are consistent across trials, but small in amplitude. Using computational modeling, we identify a simple algorithm that generates the appropriate commands through phase-dependent gating. Together, these results reveal a regime in which motor cortex does not fully specify muscle activity, but must sculpt an ongoing, spinally-generated program to flexibly control behavior in a complex and changing environment.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628867

Here we present the design, development, and extensive validation of PEtracer, a prime editing-based, evolving lineage tracing technology compatible with both single-cell sequencing and multimodal imaging methodologies to jointly profile cell state and lineage in dissociated cells or while preserving cellular context in tissues with high spatial resolution. Using PEtracer coupled with MERFISH spatial transcriptomic profiling in a syngeneic mouse model of tumor metastasis, we reconstruct the growth of individually-seeded tumors in vivo and uncover distinct modules of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors that coordinate tumor growth. More generally, PEtracer enables systematic characterization of cell state and lineage relationships in intact tissues over biologically-relevant temporal and spatial scales.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628867

During reorientation, differential load on the balancer cilia leads to altered beating of the ciliated comb rows to elicit turns. To study the neural bases of gravity sensing, we imaged by volume electron microscopy (vEM) the aboral organ of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi. We reconstructed 972 cells, including syncytial neurons that form a nerve net. The syncytial neurons synapse on the balancer cells and also form reciprocal connection with the bridge cells that span the statocyst. High-speed imaging revealed that balancer cilia beat and arrest in a coordinated manner but with differences between the sagittal and tentacular planes of the animal, reflecting nerve-net organisation. Our results suggest a coordinating rather than sensory-motor function for the nerve net and inform our understanding of the diversity of nervous-system organisation across animals.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628867

Its speed is due to (a) a carefully engineered architecture involving only cache-coherent MSD radix sorts and merges, (b) a novel algorithm for finding adaptive seed hits in a linear merge of sorted k-mer tables, and (c) a variant of the Myers adaptive wave algorithm [1] to find alignments around a chain of seed hits that detects alignments with up to 25-30% variation. It further does not require pre-masking of repetitive sequence, and stores millions of alignments in a fraction of the space of a conventional CIGAR-string [2] using a trace-point encoding that is further compressed by the ONEcode data system [3] introduced here.

As an example, two bat genomes of size 2.2Gbp and 2.5Gbp can be compared in a little over 2 minutes using 8 threads on an Apple M4 Max laptop using 5.7GB of memory and producing 1.05 million alignments totaling 1.63Gbp of aligned sequence that cover about 60% of each genome. The output ""ALN""-formatted file occupies 66MB. This file can be converted to a PAF file with CIGAR strings in 6 seconds, where the PAF representation is a significantly larger 1.03GB file.

FastGA is freely available at github: http://www.github.com/thegenemyers/FASTGA along with utilities for viewing inputs, intermediate files, and outputs and transforming outputs into other common formats. Specifically, FastGA can, in addition to its highly efficient ONEcode representation, output PSL-formatted alignments, or PAF-formatted alignments with or without CIGAR strings explicitly encoding the alignments. There is also a utility to chain FastGAs alignments and display them in a dot-plot like view in Postscript files, and an interactive viewer is in development.","NA","biorxiv",1752444628867
