MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1746482958561

PFC often uses distinct subspaces to represent incoming sensory information and to maintain it in working memory. However, it's generally assumed that a subspace carries specific information within a specific time frame. Here, in two datasets, we show that neither assumption is correct. The same subspace used during initial encoding was later reactivated during the behavioral response. We also found that subspaces ostensibly dedicated to processing sensory information were recycled to represent behavioral response information later in a trial. We further found a consistent spatial mapping between the original subspace usage and its later recycling. These results demonstrate previously unknown flexibility of PFC subspace coding, both in the deployment of subspaces across time and in their multiplexing of information. This flexibility suggests that PFC subspaces function more like ""workspaces"" into which different types of information can be written.","NA","biorxiv",1746482958561

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

While multiplexed single-molecule assays can address these issues, suitable functionalization of surfaces is required, which remains a technical challenge--many commonly used approaches are constrained by random and sparse biomolecules arrangements, limiting programmability and throughput. An ideal anchoring method would enable (i) high surface densities to maximize throughput, (ii) precise control of spatial position and molecular identity for maximum control, (iii) covalent linking for high force application, and (iv) efficient patterning without the need for expensive facilities to maximize accessibility. To achieve these aims, we have developed a light-guided surface patterning method that can covalently organize oligonucleotides (oligos) without the need for lithographic equipment. Oligos with 3-Cyanovinylcarbazole (CNVK) nucleoside are crosslinked by UV patterns reflected through a digital micromirror device (DMD), with beads arranged accordingly. To demonstrate compatibility with established single-molecule methods, we performed single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments on patterned coverslips, using both magnetic tweezers and hydrodynamic-based systems. Our light-guided approach provides a scalable and accessible solution for biomolecular patterning that allows precise control over molecular identity and spatial positioning, enabling high-throughput measurements in single-molecule research.","NA","biorxiv",1746482958561

Gamete release is often synchronised with respect to the daily light changes at sunrise and sunset. In the hydrozoan jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica, morning spawning occurs when oocyte maturation and gamete release are induced by maturation-inducing hormone (MIH) neuropeptides released from opsin-expressing cells in the gonad directly upon light stimulus. Here, we characterise the distinct spawning cycle of a previously undescribed species Clytia sp. IZ-D identified on the Pacific coast of Japan, which releases gametes in the evening. Clytia sp. IZ-D jellyfish spawn 14 hours after light stimuli under a 24-hour light-dark cycle and exhibit autonomous and synchronised spawning cycles with a 20-hour interval under constant light. We found that the female spawning cycle reflects the growth and acquisition of maturation competence by oocytes, such that each day a new batch of growing oocytes becomes responsive to MIH at a time that correlates with the timing of actual spawning. We propose that the synchronised evening spawning in this species is controlled by an unusual circadian timing mechanism based on the progressive development of gamete competence to MIH and modulation of the opsin-controlled MIH signalling pathway. This mechanism may provide resilience to light cycle instability due to local climate variation and ensure reproductive isolation from other Clytia species by alternating the gamete release timing.","NA","biorxiv",1746482958561

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1746482958561

Cognitive theories assume that overlap of task representations may lead to between-task crosstalk in concurrent task processing and thus requires cognitive control. Recent research suggests that modality-based crosstalk contributes to multitasking costs, involving central overlap of modality-specific representations. Consistently increased costs for specific modality pairings (visual-vocal and auditory-manual vs. visual-manual and auditory-vocal) were demonstrated (modality-compatibility effect), which were recently linked to representational overlap in the auditory cortex. However, it remains unclear whether modality-based crosstalk emerges from overlapping patterns of global brain connectivity and whether resolving it requires additional involvement of cognitive control as reflected in the fronto-parietal control network. This preregistered functional imaging study investigates these questions in 64 healthy, young human adults. Specifically, we focus on the modality-compatibility effect in multitasking by employing functional connectivity (FC) analysis. First, we tested the FC similarity between the single-task networks. Second, we compared the strength of the control network in whole-brain FC between dual tasks. We found no evidence for different FC similarities of single-task networks between modality pairings and no additional involvement of the control network during dual tasks. However, post-hoc connectivity analysis revealed a brain-behavior correlation for the modality-compatibility effect in dual tasks. This effect was locally restricted to FC between lateral frontal and sensory auditory regions, providing evidence for the modality-based crosstalk theory. More generally, the findings suggest that robust behavioral differences in multitasking are not necessarily related to global functional connectivity differences but to local connectivity changes.","NA","biorxiv",1746482958561

Peripheral melanin (eumelanin and pheomelanin) is cyclically produced and degraded, while neuromelanin accumulates in dopaminergic neurons over time. Neurons containing excess neuromelanin (e.g., substantia nigra) exhibit increased degeneration in Parkinson's patients, suggesting a potential genetic interplay between pigmentation pathways and Parkinson's Disease (PD). We used linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis, Mendelian Randomization (MR), and multi-trait association analysis to examine shared genetic architecture between PD and nine pigmentation-related traits (basal cell carcinoma, brown hair, melanoma, nevi, red hair, skin colour, tanning response, vitiligo, vitamin D levels). PRS analyses identified limited shared genetic variation (max 0.15% for nevi), and MR analyses did not provide evidence of a causal relationship. Together, the ten-trait and pairwise multi-trait analyses identified 48 SNPs with suggestive pleiotropy, 31 of which were protein-coding and could be mapped to 22 different genes. Overall, while some genetic overlap exists, no definitive correlative or causal relationships were established. These results contribute to the broader understanding of the differing roles of melanin and neuromelanin, as well as potential implications in neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1746482958561

However, the collective impact of demographic traits on DNA methylation and subsequent gene expression across human tissues remains unexplored. Here, we quantify the contributions of sex, age, genetic ancestry, and BMI on DNA methylation variation across 9 human tissues and 424 individuals from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. Results: We observe that inter-individual DNA methylation variation is higher than inter-individual gene expression variation. We show that genetic ancestry and age have a greater impact on DNA methylation than does sex, with aging effects being more widespread but less pronounced. On average, less than 10% of the gene expression variation in sex, age, and ancestry is mediated by DNA methylation differences, with ancestry showing the largest percentage of mediation. We show that DNA methylation differences between populations accumulate at regions with outlier DNA methylation profiles (high/lowly methylated) and are largely under genetic control. The female genome is predominantly hypermethylated across tissues, likely driven by the polycomb repressive complex. Ultimately, we demonstrate how aging increases DNA methylation levels at targets of the polycomb repressive complex in most tissues except the gonads. Conclusions: Overall, our multi-individual and multi-tissue analysis provides a comprehensive characterization of the main drivers of human DNA methylation variation under healthy conditions, laying the foundations for clinical studies considering demographic perspectives.","NA","biorxiv",1746482958561

Nasal anti-CD3 treats animal models of progressive MS by inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and lessen clinical disease. Methods: Ten patients with non-active secondary progressive MS (naSPMS) that continued to progress on B cell therapy were treated with nasal anti-CD3 (foralumab) for a minimum of six months in an open label study. Safety monitoring included otolaryngology evaluation and neurologic assessments including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC-4), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II) and Low Contract Visual Acuity (LCVA). MRI and microglial translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging with [F-18]PBR06 were conducted. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic biomarkers and single cell RNA sequencing of blood was performed to evaluate foralumab-induced immunomodulation. The endpoints of our study were safety, clinical effects, microglial signal and immune measures. Results: All patients stabilized on EDSS scores and three of four patients treated continuously for 12 months had improvement on EDSS. Six of 10 patients had improvement in fatigue on the MFIS scale. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) or severe AEs and no new T2 lesions were observed on MRI. There was a reduction in TSPO-PET signal over six months (p<0.05). Changes in peripheral blood gene expression occurred as early as three months and affected antigen presentation, interferon responses and regulatory pathways in multiple cell types including FoxP3+ Tregs, CD4+ Tcm cells, CD8+ Tem cells, CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes and B cells. TGF{beta} expression was increased across cell multiple subsets. Interpretation: These findings identify a novel, non-toxic immune based therapy for the treatment for PIRA that acts by the induction of a regulatory immune responses and dampens microglial inflammation. Double blind placebo-controlled trials are warranted to explore nasal foralumab for the treatment of naSPMS.","NA","medrxiv",1746482958561

Caffeine is one of the most frequently administered medicines in neonatology - prescribed for the management of apnoea of prematurity, to aid extubation and increasingly for conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Caffeine guidelines for the management of apnoea of prematurity indicate use based on age of the infant, but this does not account for individual variation in apnoea rate. Consequently, infants may risk caffeine undertreatment or adverse events due to over-exposure. Apnoea in preterm infants is related to brainstem immaturity, hence as an essential first step to assessing whether brain maturity may be a useful biomarker for caffeine treatment, we tested the hypothesis that apnoea rate is related to brain maturity. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we demonstrate that apnoea rate in late preterm infants is dependent on brain maturity, not postmenstrual age. We provide initial evidence that when caffeine is discontinued, infants with immature brain activity have more frequent apnoeas and desaturations compared with those with more mature brain function. These findings indicate that brain maturity (assessed automatically using machine learning) is a candidate biomarker for personalised caffeine treatment in preterm infants.","NA","medrxiv",1746482958561

Their architecture forms the anatomic basis for brainstem connectomics, subcortical mesoscale circuit models, and deep brain navigation tools. However, their small size and complex morphology compared to cerebral white matter structures makes mapping and segmentation challenging in neuroimaging. This results in a near absence of automated brainstem white matter tracing methods. We leverage diffusion MRI tractography to create BrainStem Bundle Tool (BSBT), which segments eight key white matter bundles in the rostral brainstem. BSBT performs automated segmentation on a custom probabilistic fiber map generated from tractography with a convolutional neural network architecture tailored for detection of small structures. We demonstrate BSBTs robustness across diffusion MRI acquisition protocols through validation on healthy subject in vivo scans and ex vivo scans of brain specimens with corresponding histology. Using BSBT, we reveal distinct brainstem white matter bundle alterations in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and acute traumatic brain injury cohorts through tract-based analysis and classification tasks. Finally, we provide proof-of-principle evidence supporting the prognostic utility of BSBT in a longitudinal analysis of coma recovery. BSBT creates opportunities to automatically map brainstem white matter in large imaging cohorts and investigate its role in a broad spectrum of neurological disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1746482958561

Phase III clinical trials are critical for informing regulatory decision and treatment guidelines, but the extent to which they report and include racial and ethnic diverse participants in the US context has not been systematically assessed. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive retrospective review of all US-based Phase III AD clinical trials from 1997 to 2023 using the Trialtrove database, cross-referenced with PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and other public sources. We analyzed long-term trends in the reporting and representation of racial and ethnic groups across the longest observation period to date. Results: Of 88 identified trials, 71 (80.7%) had published data. Nearly half (49.3%) did not report any race or ethnicity information. Among those that did, most focused on White patients, with limited and inconsistent reporting for racial and ethnic minoritized groups. Median enrollment was 0.9% for Asian or Pacific Islander, 4.5% for Black (ethnicity unspecified), 7.2% for Black (non-Hispanic), 5.2% for Hispanic, and 0.4% for Native American participants, compared to nearly 90% for White participants. Only 4.2% of trials conducted subgroup analysis by race or ethnicity, and none reported detailed outcome differences. Terminology varied widely and no trials acknowledged underrepresentation or proposed corrective strategies. Notably, these patterns showed little to no improvement over time. Conclusions and Implications: Racial and ethnic minoritized populations remain consistently underreported and underrepresented in Phase III AD trials in the US, limiting the generalizability of findings and risking the exacerbation of health inequities. Improving equity in AD research will require standardized reporting, inclusive recruitment practices, and intentional efforts to engage underrepresented communities.","NA","medrxiv",1746482958561

These technologies offer potential benefits, including addressing data privacy concerns, overcoming limited sample sizes, and accelerating research timelines by providing alternative data sources. By leveraging its internal knowledge, GPT-4o demonstrated the capability to replicate overall symptom prevalence distributions observed in a real PD patient dataset without significant statistical deviation. Despite these advantages, the widespread utility of AI-generated diaries based solely on internal knowledge is hindered by significant limitations identified in this case study. Key challenges include the failure to capture complex inter-variable correlations essential for understanding symptom co-occurrence, and a lack of the narrative richness, contextual depth, and linguistic nuance found in authentic patient reports. These findings underscore the constraints of current models in replicating real-world patient experiences without specific domain grounding. Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach, including domain-specific fine-tuning, enhanced prompt engineering, and potentially hybrid data strategies to improve fidelity for high-stakes research applications. This case study explored the baseline capabilities and limitations of using GPT-4o's internal knowledge for synthetic PD diary generation. It emphasizes the need for a balanced approach, acknowledging the potential for exploratory uses while highlighting the necessity for rigorous validation and further development before deployment in contexts requiring high fidelity. By fostering continued research and methodological refinement, AI-driven synthetic data generation can be better harnessed to support PD research and ultimately improve patient understanding.","NA","medrxiv",1746482958561

Synthetic data generation offers a potential solution, but its utility hinges on rigorously evaluated fidelity to real-world data. This study quantitatively assesses the structural and distributional fidelity of synthetic tabular data designed to represent PD patients. Methods: We compared a synthetically generated dataset (N=500 hypothetical entries) against an anonymized real-world dataset (N=57 PD patients) containing demographics, clinical scores (UPDRS, MoCA), and mobility data (6MWT-related variables). The evaluation focused on three key quantitative metrics: (1) Column Correlation Stability, measured by the average absolute difference between Pearson correlation matrices, assessed overall and for clinically relevant variable subgroups (6MWT, UPDRS, MoCA); (2) Principal Component Analysis (PCA), evaluating the variance captured by the top principal components in both datasets; and (3) Jensen-Shannon Distance (JSD), quantifying the distributional similarity between real and synthetic variables across different groups. Results: The overall average absolute correlation difference between the real and synthetic datasets was 0.049, indicating moderate preservation of pairwise variable relationships globally. However, stability varied across subgroups, with the 6MWT group showing higher fidelity (difference ~0.044) compared to the UPDRS (~0.080) and MoCA (0.081) groups. PCA revealed that the first two principal components captured 21.36% and 16.36% of the variance, respectively, with visual analysis showing partial overlap between real and synthetic data clusters. Average JSD values indicated moderate distributional similarity overall, with the MoCA group exhibiting the highest fidelity (JSD = 0.0573), while Demographics (0.1167), Clinical (0.1256), and 6MWT (0.1175) groups showed lower distributional similarity. Conclusion: Synthetic data generation techniques can replicate univariate distributional properties of PD patient data with moderate success, particularly for certain variable types like cognitive assessments (MoCA). However, accurately capturing the complex multivariate correlation structures, crucial for understanding symptom interactions and building predictive models, remains a significant challenge, especially within specific clinical domains like UPDRS. While synthetic data holds promise for addressing data access issues in PD research, particularly for tasks less sensitive to correlation structure, its application requires careful, context-specific validation. Further development is needed to enhance the structural fidelity of synthetic tabular data for high-stakes, multivariate clinical research applications.","NA","medrxiv",1746482958561

We aimed to map the research landscape of digital biomarkers in early AD obtained with wearable or portable digital health technologies (DHTs). Methods: In our scoping review, we included original research on portable or wearable DHTs where digital biomarkers were measured in populations of early AD (mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia). We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science and EMBASE with a wide search strategy with independent review and data extraction by two review team members and charted data in tabular/graphical form. Results: After deduplication and screening of 8 893 records, we included 109 studies describing a wide array of wearable or portable obtained digital biomarkers. The study population consisted of 3 462 individuals with MCI due to AD (54.6% female, weighted mean age 74 years), and 3 387 individuals with mild AD (48% female, weighted mean age 73 years). The most studied biomarkers were rest/activity (39%), speech (17%), and gait (14%), with most studies focusing on one domain. Few studies reported outcomes associated with diagnosis (16%) and prognosis (3%). Conclusion: We identified a growing evidence base investigating digital biomarkers in early AD. There is a paucity of studies examining diagnostic and prognostic properties, representing a knowledge gap. This overview may help to guide future research efforts to bridge the gap between the development and clinical implementation of digital biomarkers in early Alzheimer's disease.","NA","medrxiv",1746482958561

Here, we present genetic circuit design that leverages AHL (acyl-homoserine lactone)-based quorum sensing and a transcriptional cascade regulated by an external inducer to drive synchronized proliferation and lysis events. In this system, the absence of the inducer arabinose prevents CinR mediated repression, enabling activation of a transcriptional cascade that drives the expression of the lysis protein, fluorescent protein, and a drug resistance gene. The accumulation of AHL acts as a proxy for population density and modulates gene expression through a quorum-sensing mechanism. This inducible circuit provides tunable and pulsatile control over bacterial population dynamics, enabling cycles of population growth and collapse. Such behavior prevents premature population clearance while ensuring functional bacterial densities for extended durations. Our system represents a foundational step toward implementing more complex multi-stable architectures for self-regulation of bacterial population. This dynamic and modular framework offers significant advantages for therapeutic interventions, such as self-regulating drug delivery, inflammation-responsive probiotic therapies, and targeted bacterial therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1746482958561

ADAPT-MS dynamically retrains simple, robust classifiers based on the proteins quantified in each sample, eliminating the need for imputation or fixed panels. Applied to plasma and cerebrospinal fluid datasets across diseases and clinical centers, it achieves high performance and generalizability using robust, transparent and generalizable statistical models. A single proteomic measurement can support multiple diagnostic questions via retrospective cohort matching, with each classification taking only seconds. As population-scale proteomics datasets grow, this approach lays the foundation for scalable, real-time, and personalized diagnostics directly from proteome-wide data.

Being born preterm or with low birth weight (PTB) has been emerging as a potential risk factor for developing mental health disorders in adolescence. Since PTB infants are also at an increased risk of developing cerebral visual impairment after birth and cognitive and sensory deficits throughout life, this systematic review seeks to understand the interplay between PTB, cognitive, visual, and motor abilities and their influence on mental health outcomes in adolescence. We conducted a registered systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO #513150). The search strategy focused on the databases PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library and included publications sampling participants born in 1980 or later. We analysed 18 studies including a total of 13.655 adolescents aged 11-20 (PTB=8.813, control=4.852) published between 2004 and 2022. PTB adolescents exhibited consistent and persistent deficits in cognitive and motor domains compared to their full-term (FT) peers, including lower intelligent quotient (IQ), attention and executive function, and a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders. Several studies demonstrate that PTB adolescents require psychiatric treatment more often and get diagnosed with more complex psychiatric disorders. Evidence for functional visual alterations is scarce. These findings highlight the multitude of challenges that PTB children face across multiple domains including their mental health. Quantifiying these challenges individually may represent potential markers for tailoring early detection and intervention to this vulnerable population and optimising their long-term outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1746482958561

Genomic exploration continually reveals novel microbial lineages, often exhibiting extreme genome reduction, particularly within symbiotic relationships. Here, we report the discovery of Candidatus Sukunaarchaeum mirabile, a novel archaeon with an unprecedentedly small genome of only 238 kbp --less than half the size of the smallest previously known archaeal genome-- from a dinoflagellate-associated microbial community. Phylogenetic analyses place Sukunaarchaeum as a deeply branching lineage within the tree of Archaea, representing a novel major branch distinct from established phyla. Environmental sequence data indicate that sequences closely related to Sukunaarchaeum form a diverse and previously overlooked clade in microbial surveys. Its genome is profoundly stripped-down, lacking virtually all recognizable metabolic pathways, and primarily encoding the machinery for its replicative core: DNA replication, transcription, and translation. This suggests an unprecedented level of metabolic dependence on a host, a condition that challenges the functional distinctions between minimal cellular life and viruses. The discovery of Sukunaarchaeum pushes the conventional boundaries of cellular life and highlights the vast unexplored biological novelty within microbial interactions, suggesting that further exploration of symbiotic systems may reveal even more extraordinary life forms, reshaping our understanding of cellular evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1746482958561

This suggests that a small sample-scanning step size is required to satisfy the Nyquist-Shannon sampling criterion.

Four-weeks saffron supplementation improved both subjective and objective sleep quality in older adults with sleep complaints, while increasing gut bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids. These results pave the way for further randomised controlled trials exploring the links between sleep quality and gut health and may help devising new preventative strategies for age-related brain disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1746482958561

The pathogenesis of LC is incompletely understood. In this study, we performed comprehensive cellular and transcriptional immunometabolic profiling within a cohort that included SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (NC, N=30) and individuals with prior COVID-19 ([~]4-months) who fully recovered (RC, N=38) or went on to experience Long COVID symptoms (N=58). Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing. Our findings support a profound and persistent immunometabolic dysfunction that follows SARS-CoV-2 which may form the pathophysiologic substrate for LC. Our findings suggest that trials of therapeutics that help restore immune and metabolic homeostasis may be warranted to prevent, reduce, or resolve LC symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1746482958561
