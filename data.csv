While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting 'spacetime attractor' excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219525/Z/19/Z;225926/Z/22/Z;219627/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GAT3955;GAT3755;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0040/2024-L;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 651-2023;""},{""name"":""Fondation Fyssen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

Currently, no holistic or even symptom specific treatment options are available, likely due to both a lack of insight into the disease processes that drive LC and an extreme heterogeneity in patient profiles. We characterised patients and post infection controls, with respect to their immunological profiles with a non-exhaustive panel of biomarkers rationalised based on their potential role in driving symptoms. We observed that the patients symptoms could be grouped into 4 clusters suggesting possible stratification. Systemic inflammation persisted and did not normalize over time in LC. This was not related to persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection, as the presence of circulating N-protein was detected similarly in both patients and controls. No obvious deviation in B-cells and monocytes profiles were observed with minor changes for NK-cells (CD62L+/CD16+/HLA-DR+). Major changes affected CD4+T-cells (and to a lesser extent CD8+T-cells) with respect to exhaustion (PD1+/LAG3+/CD44+), regulation (Treg) and differentiation (naive/memory-CD62L+). Several candidate biomarkers (cytokines, microRNAs, phosphate metabolism) were present more frequently in LC at high levels and provided information on underlying disease processes. While frequencies of candidate autoantibody+ participants were not different, levels of some antibodies were higher in LC. Yet none of these candidates stood out as a universal biomarker for LC, with the exception of CRP (73% cases), and loss of Treg (50%). However, we confirmed that several overlapping underlying aetiologies may be involved in this complex disease. Specific groups of biomarkers also associated with the 4 cluster of patients. Although to be taken with caution due to small numbers, 3 biomarkers discriminated controls from patients (Treg/CD4+PD1+/CD4+CD161+), others were associated with symptoms recovery (low IL10/IL12/IL4 and high miR766) or deterioration (high CD4+CD38+/ CD8+naiveCD62L+/low IL2) over 12 months. This study provides rational for developing targeted therapeutic strategies as well as biomarkers to stratify LC patients most likely to respond.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758751745835

Although pain states increase vulnerability to opioid use disorders, the neural mechanisms underlying this interaction remain incompletely understood. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a key site for opioid actions, and emerging evidence suggests that pain states and opioid experience both induce transcriptional, molecular, and circuit adaptations in the VTA that contribute to motivated behaviors. However, the transcriptional responses of distinct VTA cell types to each of these factors (alone or in combination) have not been identified. Here, we employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to comprehensively define transcriptional alterations in the rat VTA to acute morphine administration in a chronic inflammatory pain model. We report that morphine induces gene expression changes primarily in glial cells and dopamine neurons, with minimal effects in other neuronal cell types. Surprisingly, VTA astrocytes and oligodendrocytes exhibited the most robust transcriptional responses to opioid exposure, despite lacking detectable opioid receptor expression. Among the most highly regulated glial genes was Fkbp5, which encodes a co-chaperone protein that acts in concert with heat shock proteins to modulate stress responses. Using pharmacological and CRISPR-based approaches in rat glial cells and human astrocytes, we demonstrate that regulation of Fkbp5 is mediated indirectly through glucocorticoid signaling rather than direct opioid receptor activation. These findings reveal that glial cells within reward circuits undergo profound transcriptional reprogramming in response to opioids through indirect, stress-hormone mediated mechanisms, highlighting a previously unappreciated non-neuronal contribution to opioid-induced neural adaptations.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01DA053743;R01DA054714;K99MH127244;""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Neurobiology of Brain Disorders Award;""},{""name"":""UAB Center for Addiction and Pain Prevention and Intervention"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pilot Award;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

In the brain parenchyma, it is executed by microglia, which are encumbered by large numbers of apoptotic debris generated during development, in adult neurogenic niches, aging, and brain diseases. Emerging evidence suggest that phagocytosis is not limited to garbage disposal, but triggers adaptations in the phagocytes that may have a functional impact. To test it we developed an in vivo model of superphagocytosis induced by low cranial irradiation (LCI, 2Gy) that specifically induced apoptosis in the neurogenic niche of the adult hippocampus, synchronizing microglia in a phagocytic state within 6h and leading to full clearance by 24h. Single cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics revealed an unexpected oxidative stress in post-phagocytic microglia, accompanied by catabolic shutdown, mitochondrial remodeling, increased expression of galectin 3, and production of polyamines that led to cell death and compensatory proliferation. To test whether these changes impaired subsequent microglial phagocytosis, we used a glioblastoma model treated with sequential irradiation to induce tumor cell apoptosis. The phagocytosis efficiency of tumor-associated microglia/macrophages was comparable in the first and second apoptotic challenge, suggesting that the metabolic remodeling induced by phagocytosis was adaptive and destined to sustain their functionality. Finally, we assessed the functional impact of post-phagocytosis adaptations using galectin 3 deficient mice under LCI. We found that the recovery of the neurogenic niche after LCI strongly depended on galectin 3, demonstrating the regenerative capacity of post-phagocytic microglia. Overall, our data unveils the complexity of post-phagocytosis adaptations in microglia, underscoring their unexplored therapeutic potential in brain disorders.","[{""name"":""Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation Competitiveness"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RTI2018-099267-B-I00;PID2022-136698OB-I00;RYC-2013-12817;""},{""name"":""Basque Government"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00pz2fp31"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IT1473-22;PIBA 2020_1_0030;""},{""name"":""Tatiana Foundation Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P-048-FTPGB 2018;""},{""name"":""Alzheimer's Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0375f4d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AARG-NTF-24-1304352;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

Sideways locomotion is a defining feature of true crabs (Brachyura) and may have contributed to their ecological success. Yet, the evolutionary origin of this unique behavior remains unknown. Here we show that the prevalence of sideways locomotion in true crabs reflects a single evolutionary origin from a forward-moving ancestor. Our behavioral analysis of 50 live crab species indicates that crab locomotion can be separated into two distinct types, sideways and forward locomotion, with no intermediates. The phylogenetic comparative analysis revealed a single origin of sideways locomotion, with multiple independent reversions to forward locomotion in ecologically specialized groups. The species richness data show that the lineage in which sideways locomotion originated is far more diverse than its nearest outgroups. These results suggest that sideways locomotion acted as a key innovation, potentially promoting adaptive radiation by enabling true crabs to exploit a wide range of ecological niches. Such a rare but innovative behavioral trait provides a framework for understanding how locomotor modes shape evolutionary diversification in animals.","[{""name"":""Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from The Japan Science Society"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-4086;2025-4060;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

However, the conditions and mechanisms that lead to the robust induction of respiratory IgA responses following mucosal vaccination remain poorly understood. It is also currently debatable whether mucosal vaccination is still warranted given that most individuals in developed countries have established a hybrid immunity from vaccination and infection. Here we characterized respiratory mucosal immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination or both in humans. We found that hybrid immunity resulted in moderately increased respiratory IgA and neutralizing antibody responses compared to infection or vaccination alone. However, a direct comparison of hybrid immunity and a mucosal adenovirus-based booster vaccination in animal models revealed that respiratory booster immunization elicited markedly stronger and more durable respiratory IgA, T cell response, and protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, supporting the promise of respiratory mucosal vaccination. Mechanistically, we found that mucosal booster immunization induced local IgA-secreting cells in the respiratory mucosa, aided by pulmonary CD4+ T cells in situ. Strikingly, local IL-21-producing Blimp-1+ Th1 effector cells were critical in mediating the CD4+ T cell help for respiratory IgA production. Furthermore, lung macrophages were important for this respiratory IgA response via the production of TGF-{beta}. Consequently, we demonstrated delivery of adenoviral booster to the lower airway was necessary to generate robust upper and lower airway IgA responses. Collectively, our results uncover a local cellular network supporting enhanced respiratory IgA responses, with implications for the development of optimal mucosal immunization strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

Whether chromatin assembly on newly replicated strands is also asymmetric remains unknown, as visualizing this short-lived state in cells is impossible. To circumvent this limitation, we combine in vitro reconstitution of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA and chromatin replication machineries with replication-aware single-molecule chromatin footprinting, to study how chromatin is re-assembled on replicated DNA. Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid. These pathways have implications for essential chromatin-templated processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and gene silencing at replication forks.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""851564;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04jsz6e67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Vidi.233.038;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2-HG012442;""},{""name"":""W.

However, typical protocols for shaping this behavior are non-standardized and inefficient. Moreover, motor errors in fixation termed  violations often account for a significant fraction of experimental trials, leading to notable data loss during experiments. In light of this, we developed FixGrower, a standardized protocol for center-port fixation training. FixGrower (1) requires a longer initial fixation requirement, (2) increases the required fixation duration at session boundaries customized to each animals performance, and (3) delays the introduction of violation penalties until the end of training. We demonstrate FixGrower decreases training time by 61%, yields low violation rates, and generalizes across rodent species and task difficulty. Moreover, the success of this curriculum is well supported by theories of operant conditioning and reinforcement learning. Our findings establish FixGrower as an efficient and broadly applicable curriculum for training fixation behavior in rodents, thereby accelerating training of many tasks in the field.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01MH108358;R01MH138935;5U19NS132720;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

Interleaving the two tasks hindered performance when their structures were similar, compared to when they were different. In contrast, blocked training produced the opposite effect: it improved performance and facilitated transfer across similar tasks. This effect, however, emerged only when participants first learned the conceptual task, followed by the spatial task, suggesting an asymmetric interaction between task order and structural similarity.

While most USPs are agnostic to polyubiquitin linkage-type, their substrate specificity is thought to be mediated by the recognition of the ubiquitylated protein itself. In addition to their catalytic domain, USPs have one or more auxiliary domains (ADs) with key functions in regulating DUB activity and subcellular localization. We hypothesize that some ADs bind short linear motifs (SLiMs) typically found in intrinsically disordered regions of proteins to achieve targeting to substrates and multiprotein complexes. To test this hypothesis, we systematically assessed the potential of 29 USP-ADs and two full-length USPs for SLiM binding using a combination of proteomic-peptide phage display, peptide arrays and affinity measurements. We discovered SLiM-based interactions for 14 ADs from 9 USP-DUBs, including CYLD, USP11, USP19, USP20, USP22 and USP33, and define the consensus motif and properties of the SLiM-AD binding. Interestingly, we established that the zf-UBP and DUSP2 domains of USP20 and USP33 are SLiM binding ADs with similar binding profiles, explaining the functional redundancy between the two DUBs. Our work reveals unique motifs recognized by the auxiliary domains CAP-Gly, UBL, zf-UBP and DUSP, with potential functional implications for substrate recognition and complex assemblies.","[{""name"":""Swedish Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03zttf063"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2020-03380;""},{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101002428;""},{""name"":""Israel Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04sazxf24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""301/2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

Using polymer simulations and high-resolution live-cell microscopy, we identify rare but long-lived chromatin encounters arising from cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. These events occur when cohesin loads near the midpoint between two loci and extrudes them through a defined spatial radius, producing encounter durations that exceed those of random collisions. We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors. Our findings support a time-gated model of distal enhancer-promoter communication in which only rare, long-lived and mostly extrusion-driven encounters are productive, offering a unifying framework for how chromosome dynamics control transcription in single cells.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_192642;TMCG-3_213782;320030-236070;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 1305-2024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

Previous studies investigating the mechanism of toxin secretion from the bacterium have yielded disparate results as to whether the bacteria undergo lysis and whether TcdE is required. Here, we demonstrate that TcdE and TcdA are only expressed in a small subset of cells in culture. The cells with high TcdE and TcdA expression show disrupted membranes, consistent with a form of bacterial lysis. The artificial overexpression of TcdE and TcdA through TcdR induction promotes tcdE-dependent bacterial lysis and cell death, even in 630{triangleup}erm, a strain previously thought to have tcdE-independent toxin secretion.

The signatures that define each stage have been well studied, yet little is known about the mechanisms that coordinate cell state transitions across regenerative stages. Here, we show that stiffening of wounded epithelial tissues is essential for the formation of a prospective regenerative bud and, in turn, for the transition from wound healing to bud formation. Mechanistically, to detect prospective bud stiffening, cells use a mechanosensitive cascade involving Piezo1-dependent Yap1 activation. We also determined that this cascade is required for the acquisition of a transcriptional profile that endows bud cells with regenerative competence. Notably, the activation of this Piezo1-Yap1 mechanosensitive cascade in nonregenerative contexts is sufficient to induce the formation of competent bud-like structures, which are sufficient to drive de novo regeneration in these otherwise incompetent tissues. Taken together, our results reveal a mechanical state at the boundary between wound healing and regenerative bud formation, which is essential for synchronizing the transition between these pivotal stages of regeneration. More broadly, these findings support the general idea that the physical properties of tissues integrate with molecular frameworks to actuate cell state transitions during morphogenesis.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

The disease is mainly controlled by plant genetic resistances targeting a limited set of early fungal effector genes overexpressed during leaf infection and located in dynamic repeat-rich genomic regions. Thus, these resistances can be rapidly overcome by the pathogen. To find new sources of resistance, we focused on late effector genes, expressed during stem infection and located in gene-rich regions. A previous study revealed a quantitative resistance in the stem partly relying on a gene-for-gene interaction with a late effector gene. In this study, we deciphered whether all late effector genes shared the same genomic and evolutionary characteristics, and if they could be more stable than early effector genes, rendering the resistances they trigger more durable. In addition, as previous studies highlighted new criteria for selecting late effectors and suggested B. napus semi-winter genotypes as an interesting genetic pool for uncovering resistance sources, we selected six new late effector gene candidates and screened an enlarged panel of semi-winter genotypes. We revealed that early and late effector genes diverged for most of their genomic characteristics supplying for the hypothesis of late effector genes being more conserved. Moreover, we revealed new resistance sources to late effector genes, almost all belonging to the semi-winter genetic pool, validating their importance to uncover new resistance sources.","[{""name"":""Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00ht2ab73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Cifre project no. 2022/1063;""},{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-17-EUR-0007;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

This necessitates continuous RBC production, resulting in [~]200 billion new RBCs made per day to maintain oxygen delivery. Despite this enormous biosynthetic demand, the metabolic pathways supporting erythropoiesis are poorly understood. We profiled metabolites across four independent models of elevated erythropoiesis and a consistent increase in aspartate levels emerged when compared to controls. This suggested a potential role for aspartate metabolism in RBC production. To test this, we deleted the aspartate aminotransferases Got1 or Got2 globally or in an erythroid-specific manner. Loss of either enzyme resulted in anemia, with Got2 deficiency producing a more severe phenotype. Individual loss of either Got or dual Got deletion led to an erythroid defect, where early progenitors accumulated. In human and mouse models of erythropoiesis, GOT1 and GOT2 loss had opposing impacts on aspartate despite exhibiting similar anemic phenotypes, suggesting an aspartate-independent function for these enzymes. GOT1 and GOT2 are also components of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), which regulates NAD(H) homeostasis. However, conditional deletion of another MAS enzyme, Mdh1, did not cause anemia, and alleviating NADH reductive stress in GOT2-deficient cells with cytoplasmic bacterial NADH oxidase (LbNOX) failed to restore erythropoiesis. Instead, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses revealed dysregulation of chromatin histone modifications in GOT-deficient erythroid cells, implicating epigenetic dysfunction as a driver of defective erythropoiesis. Collectively, these findings identify a previously unrecognized role for GOT1 and GOT2 as a central link between metabolism and epigenetic regulation during erythroid development. These insights may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies for anemia.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R37 CA015910;RO1 CA025560;R01 CA001120;R01 CA148828;R01 CA245546;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00adh9b73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 DK095201;U2C DK129445;""},{""name"":""National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Division of Intramural Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/023ny1p48"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 HL148333;R01 HL157062;F31 HL172674-02.;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

However, tubulin conservation presents challenges in understanding the origins of diverse microtubule architectures. The mechanisms by which microtubule architecture varies through the life cycle of the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium are not understood and provide a valuable framework for exploring how intrinsic properties of tubulin contribute to architectural variety. Using parasite-purified tubulin, we determined structures of P. falciparum microtubules by cryo-electron microscopy. Parasite-specific sequences change the tubulin dimer structure, thereby modifying drug susceptibility and polymer mechanical properties. Within the P. falciparum microtubule, lateral contacts are smaller but stronger, and the lattice is stiffer than in mammalian microtubules. Non-canonical microtubule architectures found in parasites are highly similar to those observed in vitro, validating the physiological relevance of these properties. Our findings show how evolutionary adaptation of tubulin modulates the material properties of the microtubule cytoskeleton.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""528483508 – FIP 12;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/Y000633/1;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""227774/Z/23/Z;""},{""name"":""Office of Basic Energy Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mg91w61"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-SC0023318;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

From segmentations and trajectories, we extracted dynamic features-cell and nuclear shape, movement, position-to create a time-resolved morphodynamic dataset spanning the full course of differentiation. While single features showed high noise and low separability of ground-truth cell types, supervised machine learning revealed that integrating time-resolved features robustly predicts final cell fate. Gradient-boosted trees and multinomial logistic regression achieved moderate but consistent accuracy, especially for abundant epithelial lineages. Key discriminants included normalized Z-position, membrane-nucleus offset, and absolute experimental time, whereas movement contributed minimally to the results.

In most aerobic photosynthetic organisms such as B-cyanobacteria and all plants, the key CO2-fixing enzyme Rubisco strictly relies on dedicated chaperones for its assembly. Why these chaperones were recruited is unclear, as they are absent and not required in other prokaryotic autotrophs. By retracing the evolution of Rubisco-chaperone interactions, we find that Rubiscos dependence on chaperones evolved neutrally and not by adaptive optimization, and that this may be reversed without compromising catalytic function.

Using {Delta}zorABE,{Delta} druHE, and {Delta}armABCD single system deletion mutants in EDL933 {Delta}stx1/2, we showed that Druantia III and ARMADA II protect to different extents against a broad spectrum of phages, including the Drexlerviridae, Siphoviridae, Demerecviridae, Vequintavirinae and Autographiviridae, but not against hypermodified Tevenvirinae. Additionally, Zorya II caused strong protection only against Autographiviridae. Furthermore, EOP assays of combined system mutants revealed strong synergistic interactions of Druantia III and ARMADA II to provide more robust immunity against a similar phage spectrum than the additive protection of the individual systems.

HOS1 directly interacts with UVR8 specifically in response to UV-B, facilitating its efficient import into the nucleus. Consistent with this role, HOS1-deficient mutants exhibit reduced HY5 protein accumulation, compromised UV-B tolerance, and impaired expression of HY5-regulated genes, including those involved in anthocyanin synthesis. These findings reveal a novel role of HOS1 in bridging UV-B perception in the cytoplasm and gene transcriptional activation in the nucleus by enabling UVR8 nuclear import.

Using resting-state fMRI from 584 neonates in the Developing Human Connectome Project, we provide the first comprehensive systems-level characterization of human visual cortex within hours of birth and across the third trimester of gestation. We discover that newborns possess a sophisticated visual architecture already functionally organized into three distinct pathways (ventral, lateral, and dorsal), each exhibiting posterior-to-anterior hierarchical structure and adult-like topographic organization. This tripartite visual organization differs from the bipartite organization observed in macaques, suggesting this architecture emerges through intrinsic developmental mechanisms rather than being a product of extensive postnatal experience and environmental adaptation. Moreover, pathway segregation, hierarchical ordering, and connectivity maturity all strengthen progressively with gestational age, revealing that visual cortical organization emerges through an active developmental program that unfolds across late gestation. Yet, despite this large-scale structure, individual pathways follow strikingly different maturation trajectories: dorsal areas exhibit a near-adult-like functional organization, even at the earliest gestational timepoints tested, whereas ventral areas remain immature and poised for experience-dependent refinement. These findings reframe our understanding of early visual development by revealing that complex functional networks emerge before substantial visual experience, yet are differentially prepared for plasticity, providing crucial insights into how evolution has optimized the brain for rapid learning while maintaining the flexibility needed for adaptation to diverse environments.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

To address these challenges, we have developed PRIME, an autonomous protein engineering multi-agent system. The core innovation of PRIME is dynamic workflow synthesis: it interprets high-level engineering objectives, reasons over a curated library of more than 65 validated protein tools, and autonomously constructs custom computational pathways. Crucially, by grounding every step in verifiable tool execution, PRIME mitigates the risk of model hallucination. It also automates the complete pipeline for developing specialized AI models, from data acquisition through training. In a benchmark of 213 multi-step protein engineering tasks, PRIME exhibited superior performance, successfully completing the majority of tasks where state-of-the-art, general-purpose AI agents fail. We validated its capabilities in demanding real-world applications, including the fully autonomous training of a machine learning classifier and the de novo design of a therapeutic antibody against SARS-CoV-2. By abstracting technical complexity, PRIME empowers scientists to execute sophisticated computational experiments with unprecedented flexibility, establishing a new paradigm for autonomous scientific discovery. The PRIME agent and source code will be made publicly available.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

Yet, the findings from different data types or cohorts are often difficult to reconcile. Collecting multiple omics from the same individuals allows a comprehensive view of disease-related molecular mechanisms, while addressing conflicting findings derived from single omics. Such same-sample multi-omics can reveal, for instance, when changes observed in the transcriptome share distinct but coordinated signals in epigenetics and proteomics, relationships otherwise unclear. Here, we apply a data-driven multi-omic framework to integrate epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and cell-type-specific population data from up to 1,358 aged human brain samples from the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We demonstrate the existence of sprawling cross-omics cross-system biological factors that also relate to AD phenotypes. The strongest AD-associated factor (factor 8) involved elevated immune activity at the epigenetic level, decreased expression of heat shock genes in the transcriptome, and disrupted energy metabolism and cytoskeletal dynamics in the proteome. We also showed immune-related factors (factors 2 and 3) with discordant enrichments, reflecting reactive-like glial subpopulations and protective contributions from surveillance microglia. Both were negatively associated with AD pathology, suggesting potential immune resilience mechanisms. Finally, unsupervised clustering of participants revealed eleven molecular subtypes of the aging brain, including three clusters strongly associated with AD but displaying distinct molecular signatures and phenotypic characteristics. Our findings provide a comprehensive map of molecular mechanisms underlying AD heterogeneity, highlighting the complex role of neuroinflammatory processes, and yielding potential novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for precision medicine approaches to AD treatment.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Aging (NIA)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30AG10161;P30AG72975;R01AG15819;R01AG17917;U01AG079847;U01AG46152;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

Additionally, this means that the uptake of both vaccines (including SARS-CoV-2 boosters) will be encouraged within the same timeframe. Currently, patients receive separate vaccines in different arms on the same or different days. Induction of neutralising antibodies (NAbs) is used as the measure of efficacy for SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations while, the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay is the gold standard for seasonal influenza vaccine assessment. However, with the advent of novel universal influenza vaccine and dual SARS-CoV-2/Influenza vaccine approaches it is possible that functional NAb assays will become an essential component of a vaccine assessment toolbox. This assay is capable of distinguishing NAb responses during both dual vaccination development, and as part of co-infection and imprinting studies. Taking advantage of existing pseudotyped viruses developed by us, we present herein a dual neutralisation assay, which utilises 2 different luciferase (Renilla and Firefly) reporter lentiviral vectors. We configured assays with various combinations of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza subtype/variant combinations and compared sensitivity of this dual approach to neutralisation levels seen in single virus pseudotype Micro-neutralisation (pMN) in a double-blinded test of monoclonal antibody cocktails, and subsequently with a pre-screened serum panel. Mono and dual neutralisation pMN identified correctly positive and negative samples and IC50 values were all within 2-fold of each other, suggesting that specificity and sensitivity are retained post-multiplex. As we have taken a pseudovirus based approach there is the potential to tailor to specific vaccination candidates or currently circulating strains of each virus. The use of this versatile assay could form part of the toolbox of analysis of dual vaccination candidates and investigating responses during co-infection including studies assessing the impact of immune imprinting in the future.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

Although single-cell RNA-sequencing studies have characterized immune cellular features of COVID-19, they have not shown how tocilizumab treatment changes these features at single-cell resolution, or which features might persist into convalescence. In this study, we analyzed 2.5 million circulating immune cells from 428 patients across time points (840 PBMC samples), encompassing three contemporaneous SARS-CoV-2 cohorts: acutely infected patients across five WHO disease severity levels and three time points, patients from the first randomized control trial to study the efficacy of tocilizumab in the management of COVID-19, and convalescent patients three months after infection. We used linear modeling to integrate multiple data types -- including single-cell RNA-seq, CITE-seq, TCR and BCR sequencing, viral load measurements, viral neutralization assays, detection of 75 autoantibodies, HLA genotype data, and serum proteomics covering 1,463 targets -- to derive the most comprehensive view to-date of the biological features of COVID-19 disease severity. Our findings show that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) act as a key immunologic pivot point in severe COVID-19. Myeloid dysfunction, which is marked by impaired antigen presentation, drives a non-productive adaptive immune response, as reflected by reduced expression of B and T cell gene programs involved in antigen recognition, immune synapse formation, and cytotoxicity. Severe disease is also linked to autoantibodies targeting type I interferons, influenced by specific HLA-DQB1 allelic variants, and strongly correlated with serum IL-6 levels. Tocilizumab treatment eliminates CLU-expressing MDSCs and ISG-positive myeloid subsets, restores antigen presentation, and reactivates productive adaptive immunity. These changes align with improved clinical outcomes and better clinical laboratory measures, including reduced CRP. While many immunologic abnormalities in acute severe COVID-19 resolve during convalescence 3-months post-infection, we observed persistently high ICOS expression in regulatory T cells, potentially linking acute infection to chronic post-COVID syndromes. Overall, we define distinct innate and adaptive host immune responses associated with acute, IL-6-responsive, and convalescent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our multimodal and high-dimensional dataset with curated clinical metadata provides a foundational and clinically relevant resource for modeling host immune response biology in health and disease.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758751745835

Radial growth, reflected by an increase in fiber cross-sectional area, is mediated through an mTORC1-dependent signaling pathway, whereas longitudinal growth, marked by the in-series addition of sarcomeres, is mediated through an mTORC1-independent signaling pathway. To gain further insight into the events that drive longitudinal growth, we combined BONCAT-based labeling of newly synthesized proteins with high-resolution imaging and determined that the in-series addition of sarcomeres is mediated by a process that involves transverse splitting at the Z-lines of pre-existing sarcomeres. Collectively, our findings not only challenge the long-standing view that mechanically induced growth is uniformly governed by mTORC1, but they also lay the framework for a new understanding of the molecular and structural events that drive this process.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AR082816;R01AR074932;R56AR057347;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

Synteny, the conservation of gene order along a chromosome, presents a promising alternative source of phylogenetic information that is potentially less prone to these issues. Here we compare sequence and synteny phylogenetic phylogenomic approaches to unravel the evolutionary history of Cypriniformes, one of the most species-rich lineages of freshwater fishes. This clade has been plagued by uncertainty, particularly concerning the phylogenetic relationships between its four major subclades: Gyrinocheilidae (algae eaters), Catostomidae (suckers), Cobitoidei (loaches), and Cyprinoidei (minnows and carps). Phylogenomic approaches require high-quality genomic resources, which have been lacking for the family Gyrinocheilidae, a key lineage for understanding cypriniform evolution. To address this, we generated the first chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation for the Chinese Algae Eater (Gyrinocheilus aymonieri). We utilized this new genome along with 42 other fish genomes to conduct comprehensive phylogenomic analyses and compare results from sequence-based methods with a microsynteny-based approach. Although chromosome-level macrosynteny is broadly conserved among cypriniforms, we demonstrate that microsynteny has impressive power to resolve deep phylogenetic nodes. Both sequence-based and microsynteny-based analyses find that Gyrinocheilidae is the sister lineage to all other cypriniforms, resolving a long-standing phylogenetic point of contention. However, while sequence-based analyses provided weak support for the relationships among the remaining subclades, our microsynteny analysis revealed a novel and strongly supported sister relationship between Catostomidae and Cyprinoidei. This conclusion is supported by a 3- to 12-fold greater number of shared microsynteny clusters (synapomorphies) compared to the alternative topologies. We also demonstrate that microsynteny synapomorphies often arise from gene family expansions. Conservation of synteny concentrated in specific genomic regions may harbor the genomic underpinnings of the unique aspects of these clades and have played an important role in the evolutionary history of these taxa. Together, these results provide a robust phylogenomic backbone for Cypriniformes. More broadly, our findings highlight the power of microsynteny to resolve recalcitrant phylogenetic nodes where sequence data is uninformative, while also underscoring the critical importance of high-quality reference genomes, as our work also shows that including fragmented assemblies can lead to spurious results. Beyond phylogenomics, our results also provide a functional genomics glimpse into how conserved, clade-specific blocks of collinear genes (synteny synapomorphies) might contribute to what makes this hyperdiverse clade so unique and evolutionarily successful.","[{""name"":""University at Buffalo, State University of New York"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01y64my43"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TJK laboratory startup funds;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

For example, someone talking about their hand is not referring to the other speakers hand, but the word ""hand"" still carries speaker-general information (e.g., having five fingers). These two requirements impose a cross-speaker generalization / differentiation dilemma that is not well addressed by existing theories. We hypothesized that the brain resolves the dilemma by use of a vectorial semantic code that blends collinear and orthogonal coding subspaces. To test this hypothesis, we examined semantic encoding in populations of hippocampal single neurons recorded during conversations between epilepsy patients and healthy partners in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU). We found clear semantic encoding for both spoken and heard words, with strongest encoding just around the time of utterance for production, and just after it for reception. Crucially, hippocampal neurons codes for word meaning were poised between orthogonalized and collinearized. Moreover, different semantic categories were orthogonalized to different degrees; body parts and names were most differentiated between speakers; function words and verbs were least differentiated. Finally, the hippocampus used the same coding principle to separate different partners in three-person conversations, with greater orthogonalization between self and other than between two others. Together, these results suggest a new solution to the problem of binding word meanings with speaker identity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

We combine genetics, multi-omics and cryo-electron tomography to show that BAM complex inhibition by L-type pyocins or the peptide antibiotic darobactin triggers a multifaceted transcriptomic, proteomic and morphological response.

These distributed signals formed ensembles with consistent and anatomically structured patterns of activity, both within subregions and across multiple connected brain areas. By combining TRAP2-based activity tagging with acute whole-brain c-Fos staining, we identified morphine- and withdrawal-activated ensembles and found that they are largely non-overlapping at the single-cell level, even within the same brain region. Integration with existing spatial transcriptomics datasets identified molecular markers for these state-specific ensembles in key brain areas such as the nucleus of accumbens, amygdala and ventral tegmental areas. Lastly, by integrating Allen mouse whole-brain transcriptional datasets, we identified the molecular identity of the morphine- administration and withdrawal ensembles. These findings define dissociable neuronal ensembles that encode opposing drug states and introduce a scalable framework for linking whole-brain activity to molecular and circuit-level mechanisms.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R37 DA032750;R01 DA038168;R01 DA054317;P30 DA048736;""},{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DMS-2303371;DMS-2134107;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

Unfortunately, only minimal scientific information on the effects of 6-MN is available.

ObjectiveTo determine the extent to which 6-MN produces nicotine-like effects on body temperature, wheel activity and nociception in laboratory rodents.

MethodsMiddle-aged (starting at Post Natal Day 425) female Wistar rats were evaluated for rectal temperature, voluntary wheel activity, and nociceptive responses (warm water tail-withdrawal) to subcutaneous injection of nicotine (0.0, 0.8 mg/kg) or 6-methyl nicotine (6-MN; 0.0, 0.4, 0.8 mg/kg). Temperature and nociceptive responses to vapor inhalation of 6-MN [0-30 mg/mL in the propylene glycol (PG) vehicle] were assessed. Finally, the self-administration of 6-MN vapor was compared with nicotine vapor self-administration.

Results6-MN decreased rectal temperature, suppressed wheel activity and induced modest nociceptive effects. The magnitude of the effect of 0.8 mg/kg 6-MN and 0.8 mg/kg nicotine were similar across all three assays. Vapor self-administration of 6-MN and nicotine was likewise comparable at a 10 mg/mL concentration.

Conclusion6-MN administered by injection or by vapor inhalation produces behavioral and physiological effects that are very similar to those produced by nicotine in rats. It is therefore likely that detrimental health effects of 6-MN will be quite similar to those established for nicotine.","[{""name"":""Tobacco Related Disease Research Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T33IR6653;""},{""name"":""National Institute on Drug Abuse"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00fq5cm18"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R01 DA057423;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

While maternal uterine NK cells have been studied in pre-eclampsia, and fetal Hofbauer cells in early gestation, much less is known about fetal-derived adaptive immune cells in the placenta and their contributions to healthy gestation versus complications of pregnancy including preterm birth. In this study, we enriched immune cells from 32 term and preterm placentas (chorionic villi, decidua basalis, and cord blood) and conducted single cell transcriptomics to evaluate the state and putative function of innate and adaptive immunity accompanying fetal trophoblast cells. Gestational age was a major driver of pro-labor pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1B and TNF that in some cases were elevated too early by preterm complications. Similarly, term placentas exhibited notable expansion of TCR clones, which were gestational age-dependent except in pathologies like chorioamnionitis and vasa previa. We used genome-wide SNP calling to deconvolute the origin of fetal cells and maternal cells, finding that both mother and fetus contribute substantially to all major immune cell lineages within the placental villi. Comparing these cells to one another, we report novel candidate markers specific to fetal-derived T cells and strong expression of IL1RL1 by fetal mesenchymal cells from preterm birth cases. This work adds to our knowledge of fetal immune development and seeks to identify what immunological steps go awry in preterm birth, paving the way towards risk evaluation in pregnant mothers and ultimately preventive care.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

Yet it remains a major bottleneck, as the current gold standard relies on manual counting by multiple blinded observers. This process is slow, labor-intensive, and prone to variability. While some software can measure total neurite length, they arent made to specifically measure new growth in complicated images from real-life injury models, like the thoracic crush and pyramidotomy model. Existing software can measure total neurite length in culture, but it is not designed to capture new growth in complex images from injury models, such as thoracic crush or pyramidotomy. Crucially, these tools lack the ability to selectively analyze growth within user-defined regions, a key requirement for injury paradigms. To address this need, we developed the Deep Neurite Analysis Tool (DeNAT), an accessible deep-learning-based platform that automatically measures neurite outgrowth after injury. DeNAT allows users to define regions of interest to specifically quantify sprouting in images from common spinal cord injury paradigms. We benchmarked its performance against manual scoring and conventional automated approaches. DeNAT achieved 87 percent accuracy in detecting neurite sprouts relative to manual counts, while reducing variability and labor. By combining user-guided region selection with automated deep learning analysis, DeNAT offers an accurate, reproducible, and efficient solution for measuring neurite outgrowth in injury models.","[{""name"":""Council of Scientific and Industrial Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021wm7p51"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Department of Biotechnology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03tjsyq23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Science and Engineering Research Board"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03ffdsr55"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

A new assay captures a specific population of Golgi-derived vesicles at the bud neck, thereby revealing which resident Golgi proteins are carried as cargo in those vesicles. This method supplies evidence for at least three classes of intra-Golgi vesicles with different cargo compositions. Consistent with our previously published data, one class of vesicles mediates a late pathway of intra-Golgi recycling with the aid of the AP-1 and Ent5 clathrin adaptors, and a second class of vesicles mediates an early pathway of intra-Golgi recycling with the aid of the COPI vesicle coat.

PKD patients exhibit significant heterogeneity in disease progression, largely due to genetic and environmental modifiers. Like patients, mouse models of PKD also exhibit significant heterogeneity with regards to the gene mutated, age of disease onset, and rate of disease progression. To elucidate the cellular and molecular consequences of these variables, we constructed an integrated single-cell and spatial transcriptomics atlas across mouse models of PKD, mapping changes in cell type composition, gene expression, and intercellular signaling networks across the whole atlas and within individual models. Consistently across models, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data revealed increased Spp1 (osteopontin) expression and signaling from PKD-enriched clusters to Ly6clo monocytes. Global deletion of Spp1 in Pkd1RC/RC mice resulted in reduced cyst severity, improved kidney function, and reduced Ly6clo monocyte numbers, suggesting that SPP1 signaling to Ly6clo monocytes promotes PKD progression.

Current pathological models emphasize defects in nuclear mechanics and transcription regulation. Yet these models do not fully explain the complexity of EDMD or other laminopathies. Here, we uncover an emerging pathway linking nuclear lamina defects to the reorganization of cytoplasmic biophysics, revealing how nuclear dysfunction cascades throughout the cell. Using Caenorhabditis elegans EDMD models, we demonstrate that lamin mutations dramatically alter cytoplasmic organization, reducing macromolecular crowding and increasing diffusivity of 40 nm Genetically Encoded Multimeric (GEM) nanoparticles. These striking biophysical changes coincide with nuclear positioning defects and collapsed endoplasmic reticulum architecture, mirroring phenotypes associated with ribosome depletion. We propose a mechanism where mutations in the C. elegans lamin lmn-1 disrupt nucleolar density and ribosome biogenesis, creating a nucleolar-ribosomal axis that propagates defects from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Genetic interactions between lmn-1 and ribosomes support this regulatory relationship. While individual depletion of other nuclear envelope proteins produces minimal effects, combined loss of the functionally redundant emerin ortholog emr-1 and LEM-domain protein lem-2 phenocopied lmn-1 mutants, demonstrating that cytoplasmic biophysical disruption lies at EDMD's pathogenic core.

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors1-5, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

While motors and lysosomal surface adaptors driving this movement are well studied, how the microtubule cytoskeleton specifies lysosomal transport and its coupling to mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling remains unclear. Here, we show that tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs) define the tracks that guide nutrient-responsive lysosome positioning. Using super-resolution imaging and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that lysosomes carrying active mTORC1 preferentially traffic along tyrosinated microtubules to reach the cell periphery, whereas detyrosinated microtubules restrict their motility. Nutrient stimulation enhances this outward transport, while concurrently suppressing microtubule detyrosination through mTORC1-S6K1 signaling, likely via inhibition of vasohibin activity. This ensures selective expansion of tyrosinated microtubule tracks to sustain mTORC1 signaling. Strikingly, in cancer cells where aberrant mTORC1 activity correlates with altered microtubule tyrosination, restoring microtubule detyrosination rescues mTORC1 hyperactivation and suppresses cell migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Thus, demonstrating that tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs) define the tracks that guide the positioning of nutrient-responsive lysosomes.

Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach.

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

Recent advances in conventional single-particle techniques have enabled the determination of an in-creasing number of structures smaller than 100 kDa, achieving resolutions relevant to drug research. Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions.

Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either the uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects, whereas combined loss significantly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing showed that loss of PIEZO reduced expression of connexin43 (Gja1), a gap junction protein in uterine smooth muscle cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to impaired contraction.

We developed OmniPath (https://omnipathdb.org/), a database combining diverse molecular knowledge from 168 resources. It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

To this end, large-scale CRISPR screens have been conducted to perturb thousands of candidate enhancers. Using these data, predictive models have been developed that aim to generalize such findings to predict which enhancers regulate which genes across the genome. However, existing CRISPR methods and large-scale datasets have limitations in power, scale, or selection bias, with the potential to skew our understanding of the properties of distal regulatory elements and confound our ability to evaluate predictive models. Here, we develop a new framework for highly powered, unbiased CRISPR screens, including an optimized experimental method (Direct-Capture Targeted Perturb-seq (DC-TAP-seq)), a random design strategy, and a comprehensive analytical pipeline that accounts for statistical power. We applied this framework to survey 1,425 randomly selected candidate regulatory elements across two human cell lines. Our results reveal fundamental properties of distal regulatory elements in the human genome. Most element-gene regulatory interactions are estimated to have small effect sizes (<10%), which previous experiments were not powered to detect. Most cis-regulatory interactions occur over short genomic distances (<100 kb). A large fraction of the discovered regulatory elements bind CTCF but do not show chromatin marks typical of classical enhancers. Housekeeping genes have similar frequencies of distal regulatory elements compared to other genes, but with 2-fold weaker effect sizes. Comparisons to the predictions of the ENCODE-rE2G model suggest that, while performance is similar across two cell types, new models will be needed to detect elements with weaker effect sizes, regulatory effects of CTCF sites, and enhancers for housekeeping genes. Overall, this study describes the first unbiased, perturbation-based survey of thousands of distal regulatory element-gene connections, and provides a framework for expanding such efforts to build more complete maps of distal regulation in the human genome.","[{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Genomic Mechanisms of Disease"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF21SA0072102;""},{""name"":""NHGRI Impact of Genomic Variation on Consortium"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UM1HG011972;""},{""name"":""NHLBI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HL159176;""},{""name"":""NHGRI Genomic Innovator Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35HG011324;""},{""name"":""NSF Graduate Research Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DGE-1656518;""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG011664;""},{""name"":""AHA Postdoctoral Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""821920 and 23POSTCHF1019753;""},{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DMS-2113072 and NSF DMS-2310654.;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

Although limited zoonotic cases have resulted from the current epizootic outbreak, the wide diversity of influenza viruses in avian hosts means the emergence of new strains that could transmit to humans more readily cannot be ruled out. There is therefore a need to anticipate zoonotic potential before spillover occurs.

Here, we develop a novel zoonotic prediction model for avian influenza viruses, building upon ""host-predictor"" machine learning methods that estimate host potential given only a viral genome sequence. We construct a machine learning framework combining individual sub-models of influenza genome segments, each trained on many genomic and proteomic traits (e.g., k-mer composition, codon biases, protein physicochemistry).

To prevent over-fitting to heavily sampled lineages and ensure models generalise to phylogenetically distant viruses, we pre-process training data by considering clusters of shared sequence identity. Curated training sets cover [~]4,000 representative, complete genome sequences of avian influenza from 120 subtypes including 9 containing known zoonotic viruses.

We combine best-performing models into a single ensemble that can distinguish zoonotic capability of sequences held out from training with strong performance (AUROC = 0.95, F1 score = 0.90), including sequences of rarely-sampled subtypes, e.g., H10N8. Interrogating ensemble model decisions also allows us to identify influential genomic motifs most associated with human infection.

These findings suggest specific genomic traits that are key to understanding and monitoring evolution of influenza viruses that circulate within bird populations. Our ensemble model can estimate zoonotic potential for new sequence inputs, offering a means to quickly risk-assess emerging avian influenza strains as soon as a sequence becomes available.","[{""name"":""Seqirus (United Kingdom)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022 – 2027 Framework Research Collaboration Agreement Influenza Research Partnership collaboration plan 002;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

We found stronger inhibition by wMelM (median relative dissemination: 0.04) than wAlbB (median relative dissemination: 0.19). Furthermore, while we found substantial heterogeneity in inhibition across DENV isolates, we found that more DENV-3 isolates were weakly inhibited (median relative dissemination: 0.47 for wAlbB and 0.39 for wMelM) compared to the other serotypes (median relative disseminations: 0.10-0.18 for wAlbB and 0-0.11 for wMelM). Using transmission dynamic models, we further showed that differential Wolbachia inhibition results in increased probability of reemergence, particularly in high transmission intensity settings, with strong selection for DENV strains that have higher relative dissemination in mosquitoes. Our work highlights the importance of considering DENV genetic diversity, including the long-term risk of selection, in Wolbachia-based control interventions.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

Drastic, isotropic MHS compressions were observed once the epithelia reached confluence. Further studies revealed that the compression was a process independent of cell contractility but rather regulated by active transepithelial fluid flow. Compressive stresses of about 7 kPa are generated by such an active hydraulic mechanism. Tissue homeostasis is then maintained by a fine balance between cell proliferation and extrusion. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of fluid transport in generating mechanical forces within epithelial tissues. Supported by a theoretical mechano-hydraulic model, a mechanistic framework for understanding the intricate interplay between cellular processes and tissue mechanics was established. These results challenge traditional views of epithelial tissue mechanics, emphasizing the pivotal influence of osmotic and mechanical pressures in shaping tissues. We anticipate that this study will advance the understanding of epithelial tissue development, the maintenance of homeostasis, and the mechanisms underlying pathological conditions.

Significance StatementEpithelial tissues are vital for many bodily functions, but their mechanics remain poorly understood. Our study uncovers a novel mechanism by which epithelial cells generate mechanical stress, not through traditional cell contractility, but by actively pumping ions and water across their membranes. Using a model of micro-sized hydrogel spheres (MHSs) coated with epithelial cells, we demonstrate that epithelial cells actively transport fluid across the tissue to compress the MHSs. This facilitates the establishment of tissue homeostasis, which is further maintained by a balanced cell proliferation and extrusion rate. Supported by a theoretical model, our findings highlight the overlooked role of fluid transport in tissue mechanics, offering new insights into how epithelial tissues develop, maintain stability, and respond to disease.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Adv-101019835;""},{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0071;DFG-ANR-22-CE92-0048;ANR-10-INBS-04;""},{""name"":""Institut National Du Cancer"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03m8vkq32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INCa_16712;INCa_18429;""},{""name"":""Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012kf4317"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Alexander von Humboldt Professorship;""},{""name"":""La Ligue Contre le Cancer"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rkrv905"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Equipe labellisee 2029;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

However, the mechanisms underlying rearrangements of L1 retrotransposition intermediates are poorly understood. To address this gap, we developed GFP-based recombination reporter assays to study the formation of L1 retrotransposition-mediated rearrangements. Using these reporters combined with long-read sequencing approaches, we find that L1 retrotransposition intermediates can recombine with distal DNA breaks to generate chromosomal rearrangements. We also find that two distinct L1 insertion intermediates can recombine with each other to generate chromosomal rearrangements. Both types of rearrangements depend on L1-encoded ORF2p endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities. Using these reporters, we discover that L1 retrotransposition-mediated rearrangements are robustly induced when the recombining sequences share homology and that their formation requires the homologous recombination factor BRCA1. Given the repetitive nature of our genome, these findings highlight the risk of L1 insertion intermediates becoming substrates for aberrant recombination and promoting genome instability.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01CA240816;R01CA276112;R01CA289390;""},{""name"":""American Cancer Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02e463172"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""C.-T.L. is supported by an American Cancer Society Postdoctoral Fellowship Award;""},{""name"":""Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04yhme281"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""C.M.-D. is a fellow of The Jane Coffin Childs Fund for Medical Research;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3NS132127;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

While molecular screening of ChRs requires high-cost experiments, recent machine-learning-based protein functionality prediction enables more efficient selection of target proteins for characterization. Here, we constructed an elastic-net machine-learning model trained on 1,163 experimental data to predict the maximum absorption wavelength ({lambda}max) of uncharacterized ChRs.

Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of ChR024 in detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs at resolutions of 3.22 and 2.45 [A], respectively. The structures reveal an architecture strikingly similar to that of ion-pumping rhodopsins, even more so than other pump-like channelrhodopsins such as ChRmine. Structural, theoretical, and spectroscopic analyses uncover a unique color-tuning mechanism, in which charged residues close and distant from the retinal chromophore cooperatively modulate the pKa of the Schiff base counterion and thereby determine the absorption maximum wavelength. Finally, comparative structural analysis of channel- and pump-type rhodopsins, combined with electrophysiology, provides insights into the molecular boundary between these two functional classes and demonstrates the conversion of an outward proton pump into a light-gated channel.

We discovered that the F240A mutation of the light-gated potassium channel WiChR abolished potassium selectivity, turning it into a sensitive excitatory channel that we dubbed ""WAChR"". We systematically mutated WAChR and identified variants that expand the frontier of speed-sensitivity tradeoffs. Multiple WAChR variants produced large inward currents in response to indoor ambient office light, and responded to irradiances as low as 15 nW/mm2, something that we did not observe with other ultra-sensitive opsins. In vivo recording from the mouse cortex confirmed that WAChRs exhibit enhanced sensitivity in neurons.

Although ""correlation does not imply cau-sation"" has become a cliche, leveraging correlations effectively--and understanding their inferential pitfalls--remains a nuanced challenge. Correlation-based analyses are typically not able to yield causal conclusions, yet they are fre-quently used to underpin causal narratives in neuroscience research and especially in clinical contexts, which represent a problematic case of overinterpretation.

Using causal inference reasoning, simulations and analytic methods, we address three critical questions when performing resting-state fMRI:

O_LIHow reliable are correlation estimates for capturing cross-regional synchrony?
C_LIO_LIWhat are the consequences of inaccuracies in estimated correlations?
C_LIO_LITo what extent do estimated correlations reflect causal neural interactions?
C_LI

We identify two principal pitfalls. First, correlation estimates are systematically distorted by diverse noise sources, including variability in neurovascular coupling, which can generate spurious, suppressed, or even reversed effects. Second, graph-based approaches lack causal interpretability, meaning that even large samples and strong statistical evidence may obscure fundamental ambiguities in what the correlations represent. In light of these challenges, we advocate for three priorities: (1) cautious interpretation that avoids causal overreach, (2) multimodal validation to cross-check findings against independent measures, and (3) enhanced methodological rigor, particularly in biomarker discovery and clinical trials, to ensure that resting-state fMRI provides meaningful insights.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ZICMH002888;ZIAMH002783;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

However, it remains unclear how the nutrients released during cell lysis affect the growth dynamics of the remaining bacterial population. Addressing this gap, we built a controlled system consisting of two Escherichia coli lysogenic strains: one carrying a wild-type{lambda} prophage and the other a temperature-inducible variant that can be induced to lyse at 38 {degrees}C. Using this system, we selectively induced phage lysis in a defined fraction of the population and quantified both total biomass and the biomass of surviving, non-lysed cells. We observed that the biomass loss was consistently smaller than expected based on the fraction of lysed cells, supporting the idea that some of the released biomass is rapidly recycled by the non-lysed population. To formalize the observed dynamics and obtain quantitative insight, we developed a mathematical model showing that nutrients released during lysis can transiently enhance the growth rate of the surviving, non-lysed cells. This effect emerges on a short timescale of minutes, consistent with the rapid onset of biomass compensation observed experimentally. The growth rate increase was confirmed in single-cell experiments using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, where we cultured wild-type lysogens in lysate-containing culture supernatants. In summary, the results suggest that nutrients released through lysis are rapidly consumed, leading to an acceleration in the growth rate of non-lysed cells. The consequent partial compensation for cell loss can substantially influence the population dynamics, highlighting phage lysis as a direct modulator of bacterial growth. Overall, our findings provide quantitative insights into how phage-mediated lysis affects the physiology of non-lysed bacterial cells, extending beyond its well-established role in biomass recycling.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""180575;225148;188642;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835

Here, we investigate how metachronal coordination shapes the navigation of Didinium nasutum, a highly agile unicellular predator with two circumferential ciliary bands. Using high-speed imaging of freely swimming cells, we capture and quantify the dynamics of metachronal wave coordination and track their evolution across different swimming states and transitions. Combining these measurements with a hydrodynamic model, we uncover how dynamic changes in coordination directly regulate propulsion and maneuverability. We show that stable metachronal waves support persistent directed swimming, local inhomogeneities in coordination give rise to curved trajectories, and global wave reversals accommodate rapid evasion-like reorientations. Our findings reveal that transitions between coordination modes allow Didinium to access a diverse swimming repertoire, highlighting dynamic ciliary patterning as a key mechanism to encode complex microscale navigation strategies.

This study identified more than 421 million single-nucleotide variants and indels and more than 600 million copy-number and structural variants. Small variants had 756 million molecular effects annotated. Of 7.7 million polymorphic variants having an allele frequency (AF) of more than 5% in EGP, 1,348 have a predicted deleterious effect on a protein. Characterization with respect to global variation shows that EGP represents a genetic continuum encompassing the range of African, Asian, and European populations. It is best described by two Arabian, an Eurasian, and an African component, with the predominant Arabian component linked to mitochondrial haplogroups J and T that are commonly attributed to the Middle East. Various aneuploidies of sex chromosomes were detected in 93 individuals overall, and aneuploidy of chromosome 21 was identified in 41 individuals. Median inbreeding coefficient and cumulative runs of homozygosity (ROHs) lengths were increased due to extensive consanguinity, were largest in the groups with Arabian main ancestry components, and were higher than reported for Qatar. Families were identified based on genetic relatedness and classified into 264 families with unrelated parents and 247 families with third- and fourth-degree consanguineous parents. Representative consanguineous pedigrees of families in EGP were outlined. Cumulative ROHs were affected by the main ancestry component and significantly increased in offspring of consanguineous parents, with a pronounced difference between 3rd and 4th-degree relatedness. Investigation of cumulative AFs of variants causing Mendelian diseases highlighted genes related to alpha- and beta-thalassemia (HBB, HBA2) and showed a high burden of variants causing severe recessive diseases, metabolic and retinal disorders, and hearing loss. In summary, EGP represents a landmark effort in characterizing the genetic diversity of the Emirati population, leveraging the largest Middle Eastern cohort reported to date.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758751745835

YprA family helicases are central to widespread defense systems DISARM, Dpd, and Druantia. Here, through comprehensive phylogenetic and structural prediction analysis of the YprA family, we identify several major, previously unrecognized clades, with unique signatures of domain architecture and associations with other genes. Each YprA family clade defines a distinct class of defense systems, which we denote ARMADA (disARM-related Antiviral Defense Array), BRIGADE (Base hypermodification and Restriction Involving Genes encoding ARMADA-like and Dpd-like Effectors), or TALON (TOTE-like and ARMADA-Like Operon with Nuclease). In addition to the YprA-like helicase, ARMADA systems share two more proteins with DISARM. However, ARMADA YprA homologs are most similar to those of Druantia, suggesting ARMADA is a  missing link connecting DISARM and Druantia. We show experimentally that ARMADA protects bacteria against a broad range of phages via a direct, non-abortive mechanism. We also discovered multiple families of satellite phage-like mobile genetic elements that often carry both ARMADA and Druantia Type III systems and show that these can provide synergistic resistance against diverse phages.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835
"Hierarchical processing of sensory information across topographically organized thalamocortical-like circuits in the zebrafish brain","10.1101/2025.09.15.675867","biorxiv",19.549999999999997,0,0,8.45,19.549999999999997,"Trinh, A.-T.; Ostenrath, A.

Primary sensory cortices receive topographically segregated information from first-order thalamic nuclei, which process distinct sensory modalities. In contrast, higher-order cortical regions integrate information from multiple information channels. While such hierarchical processing and integration of information is the foundation for neural computations in the mammalian cortex, the fundamental principles of thalamocortical computations in non-mammalian vertebrates remains unexplored. The zebrafish pallium, located in the dorsal telencephalon, is regarded as the homolog of the mammalian cortex. However, it remains unclear how the zebrafish pallium receives and processes sensory information, and how the architecture and function of these processes compare to the thalamocortical circuits in other vertebrates. Using anatomical tracing, electrophysiological circuit mapping, and in vivo Ca2+ imaging, we revealed a thalamocortical-like pathway in the zebrafish brain. We found that the preglomerular nucleus (PG) is the primary source of visual and mechano-vibrational information to the zebrafish pallium. We demonstrated that PG neurons and their pallial projections exhibit sensory-specific and topographically organized responses. In contrast, the sensory responses of pallial neurons display multiple layers of topographically organized hierarchies, ranging from simple sensory-specific responses to multimodal and coincidence-detecting nonlinear responses. Notably, we observed a progressive increase in the complexity of sensory computations, which is organized topographically along the posterior-anterior axis of the zebrafish pallium. Collectively, our results suggest that hierarchical sensory processing across topographically organized pallial regions is a conserved functional feature of the vertebrate pallium.","[{""name"":""JSPS KAKENHI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JP24K02008;""},{""name"":""European Horizon Marie-Curie individual postdoctoral fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101066743;""},{""name"":""NFR FRIPRO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""239973;314212;""},{""name"":""RCN Centres of Excellence scheme"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""332640;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758751745835
