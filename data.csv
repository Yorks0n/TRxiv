MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial, several potential treatments for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were assessed in separate comparisons in RECOVERY, both of which are reported here. Eligible and consenting adults could join the molnupiravir comparison, the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, or both. For each comparison, participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the relevant antiviral (five days of molnupiravir 800mg twice daily or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir 300mg/100mg twice daily) or to usual care without the relevant antiviral drug, using web-based unstratified randomisation with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were time to discharge alive from hospital, and among those not on invasive ventilation at baseline, progression to invasive ventilation or death. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Both comparisons were stopped by the investigators because of low recruitment. ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsFrom 24 January 2022 to 24 May 2023, 923 patients were recruited to the molnupiravir comparison (445 allocated molnupiravir and 478 allocated usual care), and from 31 March 2022 to 24 May 2023, 137 patients were recruited to the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison (68 allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 69 allocated usual care). More than three-quarters of the patients in both comparisons were vaccinated and had anti-spike antibodies at randomisation, and more than two-thirds were receiving other SARS-CoV-2 antivirals (including remdesivir or sotrovimab). In the molnupiravir comparison, 74 (17%) patients allocated to molnupiravir and 79 (17%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.28; p=0.66). In the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, 13 (19%) patients allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 13 (19%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.47-2.23; p=0.96). In neither comparison was there evidence of a significant difference in the duration of hospitalisation or the proportion of patients progressing to invasive ventilation or death.

InterpretationIn adults hospitalised with COVID-19, neither molnupiravir nor nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were associated with reductions in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death although these comparisons had limited statistical power due to low recruitment.

The sequence features enabling such extreme-distance enhancer-promoter interactions remain elusive. Here, we used in vivo enhancer replacement experiments in mice to show that short- and medium-range enhancers cannot initiate gene expression at extreme-distance range. We uncover a novel conserved cis-acting element, Range EXtender (REX), that confers extreme-distance regulatory activity and is located next to a long-range enhancer of Sall1. The REX element itself has no endogenous enhancer activity. However, addition of the REX to other short- and mid-range enhancers substantially increases their genomic interaction range. In the most extreme example observed, addition of the REX increased the range of an enhancer by an order of magnitude, from its native 71kb to 840kb. The REX element contains highly conserved [C/T]AATTA homeodomain motifs. These motifs are enriched around long-range limb enhancers genome-wide, including the ZRS, a benchmark long-range limb enhancer of Shh. Mutating the [C/T]AATTA motifs within the ZRS does not affect its limb-specific enhancer activity at short range, but selectively abolishes its long-range activity, resulting in severe limb reduction in knock-in mice. In summary, we identify a sequence signature globally associated with long-range enhancer-promoter interactions and describe a prototypical REX element that is necessary and sufficient to confer extreme-distance gene activation by remote enhancers.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

High-resolution cryo-EM typically requires higher voltage cryo-TEMs with coherent FEG sources, stable columns, autoloader systems and direct electron detectors. These setups are specialised for Cryo-EM work and are expensive to establish and maintain. More recently the concept of using 100-keV cryo-TEMs has been introduced as a way to make cryo-EM more affordable and hence accessible to a larger group of researchers. So far, the implementation of these 100-keV cryo-TEMs have relied on specialised microscopes with FEG sources as well as more stable optics than usually present on the common 120-keV TEMs. We here explored whether a standard 120-keV TEM, commonly available at many laboratories worldwide, can be upgraded with a direct electron detector and its suitability for high-resolution cryo-EM using a standard side entry cryo-holder. Using this imaging configuration, we were successful in achieving a 2.65[A] reconstruction for standard apoferritin. We were also able to resolve a more challenging small 64kDa protein haemoglobin to 4.33[A]. Furthermore, we were able to solve an asymmetric 153 kDa membrane protein GPCR (M4 muscarinic acid receptor) to a resolution of 4.4[A]. Importantly, all these results were achieved using a standard automated data collection routine implemented through SerialEM, making it feasible to collect large cryo-EM data sets with a side entry cryo-holder. These results showcase a potentially widely accessible solution to obtaining interpretable cryo-EM structures. Furthermore, we envisage that this imaging configuration gives an option for many EM facilities and laboratories to set up a high-quality cryo-EM SPA sample screening capability without the need to procure costly specialised Cryo-TEMs. This could help to considerably lower the economic entry barrier for cryo-EM SPA and contribute to the ""democratisation"" of cryo-EM.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310
"The atypical antipsychotic lurasidone positively modulates the gut microbiota in rats: A comparative study to olanzapine","10.1101/2024.02.28.582623","biorxiv",45,27,45,45,45,"Kamath, S.; Hunter, A.; Collins, K.; Wignall, A.; Joyce, P.","Paul Joyce","University of South Australia","2024-03-03","1","new results","cc_by","pharmacology and toxicology","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/03/03/2024.02.28.582623.source.xml","Background and PurposeAntipsychotics like olanzapine are associated with significant metabolic dysfunction, attributable to gut microbiota dysbiosis. A recent notion that most psychotropics are detrimental to the gut microbiota has arisen from consistent findings of metabolic adverse effects. However, unlike olanzapine, the metabolic effects of lurasidone are conflicting, with most reports observing weight loss rather than gain. Thus, this study investigates the contrasting effects of olanzapine and lurasidone on the gut microbiota to explore the hypothesis of ""gut neutrality"" for lurasidone exposure.

Experimental ApproachUsing a Sprague-Dawley rat model, the impact of olanzapine and lurasidone administration on the gut microbiota was explored. Faecal and blood samples were collected weekly over a 21-day period to analyse changes to the gut microbiota and related metabolic markers.

Key ResultsLurasidone triggered no significant weight gain or metabolic alterations, instead positively modulating gut microbiota through increases in mean OTUs (+50 OTUs) and alpha diversity (+0.5 increase in Shannons index). This novel finding suggests an underlying mechanism for lurasidones metabolic inertia. In contrast, olanzapine triggered a statistically significant decrease in mean OTUs (-75 OTUs) and substantial compositional variation, suggesting a decrease in microbial richness. Microbiota alterations correlated with metabolic dysfunction, evidenced through a statistically significant 30% increase in weight gain, increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and increase in blood triglycerides and glycaemic levels.

Conclusion and ImplicationsThe study challenges the notion that all antipsychotics disrupt the gut microbiota similarly and highlights the potential benefits of gut positive or neutral antipsychotics like lurasidone in managing metabolic side effects. Further research is warranted to validate these findings in humans to guide personalised pharmacological treatment regimens for schizophrenia.

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

This decline is particularly evident in multiple sclerosis (MS), which has been suggested to exhibit features of accelerated biological aging. Whether cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, contributes to remyelination impairment remains unknown. Here, we show that senescent cells (SCs) accumulate within demyelinated lesions after injury, and their elimination enhances remyelination in young mice but not in aged mice. In young mice, we observed the upregulation of senescence-associated transcripts primarily in microglia after demyelination, followed by their reduction during remyelination. However, in aged mice, senescence-associated factors persisted within lesions, correlating with inefficient remyelination. Pharmacological reduction of SCs enhanced remyelination in young mice but was ineffective in aged mice. Proteomic analysis of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) revealed elevated levels of CCL11/Eotaxin-1 in lesions, which was found to inhibit efficient oligodendrocyte maturation.

Based on genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, these IAVs were subtyped as H3N2s that originated from reassortment of swine H3N2 (clade 1990.4h), human seasonal H1N1 (pdm09), and swine H1N2 (clade 1A.1.1.3). This reassortant has been subsequently observed in swine in several Midwest American states, as well as in swine and turkeys in Ontario, suggesting its spillover into farmed mink in British Columbia was incidental to its broader dissemination in North American swine populations. These detections reaffirm the need for extensive genomic surveillance of IAVs in swine populations to monitor reassortments that might become public health concerns.

These ruminants were presumed not to be hosts for IAVs. Previously, IAV-positive mammalian species were hunters and scavengers, possibly getting infected while feeding on infected birds. It is now presumed that H5N1 viruses that circulate in US dairy cattle transmit through a mammary gland route, in contrast to transmission by aerosols via the respiratory tract, although the latter cannot be excluded. The receptor display in the mammary and respiratory tract in cows for IAVs is unknown. Here, we used recombinant HA proteins representing current circulating and classical H5 viruses to determine the distribution of IAV receptors in the respiratory and mammary tract tissues of cows and goats. Most of the sialome of the cow and goat respiratory tract is lined with sialic acid modifications such as N-glycolyl and O-acetyl, which are not bound by IAV. Interestingly, the H5 protein representing the cow isolates bound significantly in the mammary gland, whereas classical H5 proteins failed to do so. Furthermore, whereas the 9-O-acetyl modification is prominent in all tissues tested, the 5-N-glycolyl modification is not, resulting in the display of receptors for avian IAV hemagglutinins. This could explain the high levels of virus found in these tissues and milk, adding supporting data to this possible virus transmission route.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

In this study, using cryogenic electron microscopy, we determined the 2.1 Angstrom resolution structure of a 104-subunit II2-III2-IV2 supercomplex from the parasite Perkinsus marinus, related to Apicomplexa, capable of complete electron transport from succinate to molecular oxygen. A feature of the parasite is the association of two copies of complex II via the apicomplexan subunit SDHG that interacts with both complexes III and IV and bridge the supercomplex. In the c1 state, we identified two protein factors, ISPR1 and ISPR2 bound on the surface of complex III, where Cytochrome c docks, acting as negative regulators. The acquisition of 15 specific subunits to complex IV results in its lateral offset, increasing the distance between the Cytochrome c electron donor and acceptor sites. The domain homologous to canonical mitochondria-encoded transmembrane subunit COX2 is made of three separate polypeptides encoded in the nucleus, and their correct assembly is a prerequisite for electron transport in the supercomplex. Subunits Cytochrome b and COX1 comprise a +2 frameshift introduced during protein synthesis by the mitoribosome. Among 114 modelled endogenous lipids, we detect a direct contribution to the formation of the divergent supercomplex and its functional sites, including assembly of CII and ubiquinone binding. Together, our findings expose the uniqueness of the principal components of bioenergetics in the mitochondria of parasites.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

However, existing methods differ in their modeling assumptions and approaches to account for biological and technical noise-leading to low concordance in their linking scores-and do not capture the effects of genomic distance. We propose pgBoost, an integrative modeling framework that trains a non-linear combination of existing linking strategies (including genomic distance) on fine-mapped eQTL data to assign a probabilistic score to each candidate SNP-gene link. We applied pgBoost to single-cell multiome data from 85k cells representing 6 major immune/blood cell types. pgBoost attained higher enrichment for fine-mapped eSNP-eGene pairs (e.g. 21x at distance >10kb) than existing methods (1.2-10x; p-value for difference = 5e-13 vs. distance-based method and < 4e-35 for each other method), with larger improvements at larger distances (e.g. 35x vs. 0.89-6.6x at distance >100kb; p-value for difference < 0.002 vs. each other method). pgBoost also outperformed existing methods in enrichment for CRISPR-validated links (e.g. 4.8x vs. 1.6-4.1x at distance >10kb; p-value for difference = 0.25 vs. distance-based method and < 2e-5 for each other method), with larger improvements at larger distances (e.g. 15x vs. 1.6-2.5x at distance >100kb; p-value for difference < 0.009 for each other method). Similar improvements in enrichment were observed for links derived from Activity-By-Contact (ABC) scores and GWAS data. We further determined that restricting pgBoost to features from a focal cell type improved the identification of SNP-gene links relevant to that cell type. We highlight several examples where pgBoost linked fine-mapped GWAS variants to experimentally validated or biologically plausible target genes that were not implicated by other methods. In conclusion, a non-linear combination of linking strategies, including genomic distance, improves power to identify target genes underlying GWAS associations.","NA","medrxiv",1716933918310

Marsupials exhibit short gestation and complete development externally, necessitating accelerated differentiation of anterior features required for locomotion and feeding. As such, they represent a unique outgroup with which to understand temporal shifts in development, known as heterochrony. Here, we generate the first single-cell transcriptomic atlas of gastrulation and early organogenesis in a marsupial, the opossum Monodelphis domestica. We find that anterior prioritisation is achieved by earlier initiation and shorter duration of transcriptional programmes relative to eutherians. The result is uncoupling of transcriptional and morphological progression, revealing unforeseen diversity in the order of developmental sequences in mammals. We uncover novel tissues for which heterochrony has not previously been documented. Our findings indicate that accelerated activation of transcriptional programmes facilitates the rapid growth needed for survival of the marsupial neonate.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

However, laboratory studies typically simplify reality and focus on the effects of an individual stressor. Here, we use a microfluidic approach to simultaneously provide a physical stressor (shear flow) and a chemical stressor (H2O2) to the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. By treating cells with levels of flow and H2O2 that commonly co-occur in nature, we discover that previous reports significantly overestimate the H2O2 levels required to block bacterial growth. Specifically, we establish that flow increases H2O2 effectiveness 50-fold, explaining why previous studies lacking flow required much higher concentrations. Using natural H2O2 levels, we identify the core H2O2 regulon, characterize OxyR-mediated dynamic regulation, and dissect the redundant roles of multiple H2O2 scavenging systems. By examining single-cell behavior, we serendipitously discover that the combined effects of H2O2 and flow block pilus-driven surface migration. Thus, our results counter previous studies and reveal that natural levels of H2O2 and flow synergize to restrict bacterial colonization and survival. By studying two stressors at once, our research highlights the limitations of oversimplifying nature and demonstrates that physical and chemical stress can combine to yield unpredictable effects.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

Their offspring were reared under both treatments in factorial experimental design. Parental acclimation to HypOA altered several offspring traits, including increased embryo survival under HypOA and an overall reduction in post-hatch growth rate. Offspring from HypOA-treated parents that were reared under control conditions had larger eyes across the developmental period. When compared against the overall control group, larvae directly exposed to HypOA exhibited 2,416 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs). Although most of these DETs were specific to individual parental treatments, the most enriched Gene Ontology terms were conserved across parental treatments, including terms related to neurotransmitter secretion, nervous system development, axon pathfinding, calcium channel activity, proteolysis, and extracellular matrix organization. Larvae from HypOA-treated parents that were reared under control conditions exhibited a shift in constitutive gene expression similar to that seen in larvae directly exposed to HypOA. This highly consistent finding indicates that parental acclimation before fertilization promotes the transcriptional frontloading of genes in offspring that are responsive to direct HypOA exposure. This highly consistent finding indicates that parental acclimation before fertilization promotes the transcriptional frontloading of genes in offspring.

We utilized high-throughput sample multiplexed proteomics and integrated intelligent data acquisition methods to map proteomes of five cancer cell lines in response to HDACi.

We utilized a unique GPS-telemetry dataset on a slow-life history migratory bird of prey - the European honey buzzard, tracked for multiple years after fledgling. Our aim was to assess how phenology, ranging behaviour and philopatry change as individuals gain experience. Individuals exhibited variability in the age at which they first returned to their breeding range, yet all survivors settled at sites proximate to their natal nests.

We show that transient GATA6 binding exploits accessible regions to decommission active enhancers and promote pluripotency gene silencing. Simultaneously, GATA6 targets closed chromatin and initiates an extensive remodeling culminating in the establishment of fragile nucleosomes flanked by ordered nucleosome arrays and increased accessibility. This is directly enhanced by rapidly expressed PrE TFs (SOX17) and by pluripotency TFs repurposed for differentiation (OCT4/SOX2). Furthermore, GATA6 mediates the replacement of essential nuclear receptors for PrE differentiation, from ESRRB to ESRRA. Therefore, pioneer TFs orchestrate a complex gene regulatory network involving many if not all available pioneer TFs, including those required to support the original identity of differentiating cells.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

NS1 antigen levels in acute dengue are often associated with increased disease severity, but there have been a wide variation in results based on past dengue infection and infecting dengue virus (DENV) serotype. As NS1 engages with many host lipids, we hypothesize that the type of NS1-lipid interactions alters its pathogenicity. Methods: Primary human monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) were co-cultured with NS1 alone or with HDL, LDL, LPS and/or platelet activating factor (PAF) from individuals with a history of past dengue fever (DF=8) or dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF=8). IL-1{beta} levels were measured in culture supernatants, and gene expression analysis carried out in MDMs. Monocyte subpopulations were assessed by flow cytometry. Hierarchical cluster analysis with Euclidean distance calculations were used to differentiate clusters. Differentially expressed variables were extracted and a classifier model was developed to differentiate between past DF and DHF. Results: Significantly higher levels of IL-1{beta} were seen in culture supernatants when NS1 was co-cultured with LDL (p=0.01), but with lower levels with HDL (p=0.05). MDMs of those past DHF produced more IL-1{beta} when NS1 with PAF (p=0.02). MDMs of individuals with past DHF, were significantly more likely to down-regulate RPLP2 gene expression when macrophages were co-cultured with either PAF alone, or NS1 combined with PAF, or NS1 combined with LDL. When NS1 was co-cultured with PAF, HDL or LDL two clusters were detected based on IL10 expression, but these did not differentiate those with past DF or DHF. Conclusions: As RPLP2 is important in DENV replication and in regulating cellular stress responses and immune responses and IL-10 is associated with severe disease, it would be important to further explore how differential expression of RPLP2 and IL-10 could lead to disease pathogenesis based on NS1 and lipid interactions.","NA","medrxiv",1716933918310

Here, we deploy a new CRISPRi-based screen to identify putative host factors that participate in CRISPR adaptation in the E. coli Type I-E system. Our screen uncovers a novel host factor, SspA, which transcriptionally regulates CRISPR adaptation. One target of SspA is H-NS, a known repressor of CRISPR interference proteins, but we find that the role of SspA on adaptation is not H-NS-dependent. We propose a new model of CRISPR-Cas defense that includes independent cellular control of adaptation and interference by SspA.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

In plants, due to the absence of cell migration, correct placement of newly produced cell walls during cell division is of eminent importance for generating functional tissues and organs. In particular, during radial growth of plant shoots and roots, concerted cell divisions in the cambium are essential to produce adjacent xylem and phloem tissues in a strictly bidirectional manner. While several intercellular signaling cascades have been identified to instruct tissue organization during radial growth, a role of mechanical forces in guiding cambium stem cell activity has been frequently proposed but, so far, not been functionally investigated on the cellular level. Here, we coupled anatomical analyses with a cell-based vertex model to analyze the role of mechanical stress in radial plant growth at the cell and tissue scale. Simulations based on segmented cellular outlines of radially growing Arabidopsis hypocotyls revealed a distinct stress pattern with circumferential stresses in cambium stem cells which coincided with the orientation of cortical microtubules. Integrating stress patterns as a cue instructing cell division orientation was sufficient for the emergence of typical cambium-derived cell files and agreed with experimental results for stress-related tissue organization in confining mechanical environments. Our work thus underlines the significance of mechanical forces in tissue organization through self-emerging stress patterns during the growth of plant organs.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

STING is degraded by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-driven lysosomal microautophagy (LMA), the impairment of which leads to sustained inflammatory responses. It has been unknown how ESCRT targets STING directly to lysosomes. Here, through kinase inhibitor screening and knockdown experiments of all the individual components of ESCRT, we show that STING degradation requires PIKfyve (a lipid kinase that generates PI(3,5)P2) and CHMP4B/C (components of ESCRT-III subcomplex). Knockdown of Pikfyve or Chmp4b/c results in the accumulation of STING vesicles of a recycling endosomal origin in the cytosol, leading to sustained type I interferon response. CHMP4B/C localize at lysosomes and their lysosomal localization is abolished by interference with PIKfyve activity. Our results identify lysosomal ESCRT-III as a PI(3,5)P2 effector, reveal a role of the less characterized phosphoinositide PI(3,5)P2 in lysosomal biology, and provide insights into the molecular framework that distinguishes LMA from other cellular processes engaged with ESCRT.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

The mechanisms of cognitive impairment after COVID-19 (COGVID) remain unclear, but neuroimaging studies provide evidence of brain changes, many that are associated with aging. Therefore, we calculated Brain Age Gap (BAG), which is the difference between brain age and chronological age, in a cohort of 25 mild to moderate COVID-19 survivors (did not experience breathlessness, pneumonia, or respiratory/organ failure) and 24 non-infected controls (mean age = 30 +/- 8) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). BAG was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (F = 4.22, p = 0.046) by 2.65 years. Additionally, 80% of the COVID-19 group demonstrated an accelerated BAG compared to 13% in the control group (X2 = 20.0, p < 0.001). Accelerated BAG was significantly correlated with lower cognitive function (p < 0.041). Females in the COVID-19 group demonstrated a 99% decreased risk of accelerated BAG compared to males (OR = 0.015, 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.300). There was also a small (1.4%) but significant decrease in risk for accelerated BAG associated with longer time since COVID-19 diagnosis (OR = 0.986, 95% CI: 0.977 to 0.995). Our findings provide a novel biomarker of COGVID and point to accelerated brain aging as a potential mechanism of this adverse effect. Our results also offer further insight regarding gender-related disparities in cognitive morbidity associated with COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1716933918310

How exactly does information flow among group members leading to a collective escape remains an open question. Here we study the collective responses of a flock of sheep to a shepherd dog in a driving task between well-defined target points. We collected highresolution spatio-temporal data from 14 sheep and the dog, using Ultra Wide Band tags attached to each individual. Through the time delay analysis of velocity correlations, we identify a hierarchy among sheep in terms of directional influence. Notably, the average spatial position of a sheep along the front-back axis of the groups velocity strongly correlates with its impact on the collective movement. Our findings demonstrate that, counter-intuitively, directional information on shorter time scales propagates from the front of the group towards the rear, and that the dog exhibits adaptive movement adjustments in response to the flocks dynamics. Furthermore, we show that a simple shepherding model can capture key features of the collective response of the sheep flocks. In conclusion, our study reveals novel insights on how directional information propagates in escaping animal groups.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

Determining how 11,269 enzyme structures catalysing 361 different metabolic reactions evolved over 400 million years alongside their molecular functions, we report that metabolism has shaped the structural evolution of enzymes at different levels: the organisms overall metabolism; the topological organisation of the metabolic network; and each enzymes molecular properties. For example, structural evolution depends on each enzymes reaction mechanism, on the variability rather than the amount of metabolic flux, and on biosynthetic cost. Evolutionary cost-optimization is stronger on highly abundant enzymes and acts differently on different structural domains, with the exception of small-molecule binding sites, which are prioritised over other structural domains and lack cost-optimisation. Finally, while enzyme surfaces are less constrained, surface residues can also be exposed to positive selection for the co-evolution of protein-protein interaction sites. Accessing AlphaFolds power to predict protein structures systematically and across species barriers, facilitating the integration of protein structures with functional genomics, we were thus able to map biological constraints which shape protein structural evolution at scale and over long timelines.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

We apply UnitedMet to investigate the metabolic impact of driver mutations in kidney cancer, identifying a novel association between BAP1 and a highly oxidative tumor phenotype. We similarly apply UnitedMet to determine that advanced kidney cancers upregulate oxidative phosphorylation relative to early-stage disease, that oxidative metabolism in kidney cancer is associated with inferior outcomes to combination therapy, and that kidney cancer metastases themselves demonstrate elevated oxidative phosphorylation relative to primary tumors. UnitedMet therefore enables the assessment of metabolic phenotypes in contexts where metabolite measurements were not taken or are otherwise infeasible, opening new avenues for the generation and evaluation of metabolite-centered hypotheses.

A reliable indexing of taxa based on their association with host health and microbiome resilience could accelerate development of microbiome-based therapeutics including selection of live biotherapeutics and facilitate microbiome comparisons in diverse study populations. Here we first investigated 196 taxa for their association with three hallmark properties of health and microbiome-resilience, namely prevalence/community-influence in non-diseased subjects, longitudinal stability and host health, using a discovery cohort of 39,926 publicly available adult (> 18 years) gut microbiomes from 127 studies spanning 42 countries and 28 disease conditions (including 9,434 longitudinal samples). We identified 18 species-level-taxa, referred to as Health-Associated Core Keystones (HACKs), with association-strengths in the top 30 percentile for all three properties. We integrated these association-strengths into a single value, the HACK-index, that ranks taxa based on their estimated contribution to both microbiome stability and host health. We then demonstrate the reproducibility of these indices for the taxon associations with the three properties, using a validation cohort of 4,500 gut microbiomes (from 11 studies with various demographics and diseases). Specific consortia of high HACK-index taxa are also associated with positive response to Mediterranean Diet interventions and Immuno-Checkpoint-Inhibitor therapies.

Vector-borne diseases are of particular concern and although mosquitoes are responsible for most of the 621 million cases annually, their response to temperature is not well characterized. We describe the transcriptome of the major vector for human malaria, Anopheles stephensi maintained under a diurnal temperature regime (DTR) totaling 9{degrees}C and daily means of 20{degrees}C, 24{degrees}C and 28{degrees}C respectively. Gene expression profiles were examined in the midguts and carcasses of adult mosquitoes from one to 19 days post-blood meal. Differences in temporal expression profiles at each temperature revealed a total of 3,106 and 3,590 genes in the carcasses and midguts respectively and analyzed further to make three inferences. First, we identified genes with shared temporal expression profiles across all three temperatures, suggesting their indispensability to mosquito life history. Second, tolerance to 20 DTR 9{degrees}C and 28 DTR 9{degrees}C was associated with a larger and more diverse repertoire of gene products compared to 24 DTR 9{degrees}C: assuming physiological costs scale accordingly, this finding could explain the fitness trade-offs underlying the unimodal effect of temperature.

The ability to design crosses with high means that will maintain genetic variation in the population is the goal for long-term applications. Herein, we describe a new computational package for mate allocation in a breeding program. SimpleMating is a flexible and open-source R package originally designed to predict and optimize breeding crosses in crops with different reproductive systems and breeding designs. Divided into modules, SimpleMating first estimates the cross performance (criterion), such as mean parental average, cross total genetic value, and/or usefulness of a set of crosses. The second module implements an optimization algorithm to maximize a target criterion while minimizing next-generation inbreeding. The software is flexible, allowing users to specify the desired number of crosses, maximum/minimum number of crosses per parent, and the maximum value of the parent relationship for creating crosses. As an outcome, SimpleMating generates a mating plan from the target parental population using single or multi-trait criteria. As example, we implemented and tested SimpleMating in a simulated maize breeding program obtained through stochastic simulations. The crosses designed via SimpleMating showed large genetic mean over time (up to 22% more genetic gain than conventional genomic selection programs, with lower genetic diversity decrease over time), supporting the use of this tool, as well as the use of data-driven decisions in applied breeding programs.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

However, the relationships and feedbacks between virus dynamics, microbial host dynamics, and environmental disturbance is not understood. Centralia, PA, USA, is the site of an underground coal seam fire that has been burning for over 60 years. As the fire moves along the coal seam, previously heated soils cool to ambient temperature, creating a gradient of heat disturbance intensity and recovery. We examined annual soil viral population dynamics over seven consecutive years in Centralia using untargeted metagenome sequencing. Viral communities changed over time and were distinct between fire-affected and reference sites. Dissimilarity in viral communities was greater across sites (space) than within a site across years (time), and cumulative viral diversity more rapidly stabilized within a site across years than within a year across sites. There also were changes in CRISPR investment as soils cooled, corresponding to shifts in viral diversity. Finally, there were also differences in viral-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes between fire-affected and reference sites. These results indicate that despite high site-to-site soil viral diversity, there was surprising viral community consistency within a site over the years and shifting host-viral interactions in soils recovering from disturbance. Together, these results provide insights into how viral and host communities collectively respond to unpredicted environmental disturbance.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

However, implementation can be costly and problematic to set up in fragile and high-burden countries, especially when targeting cohorts of children. To address these challenges, we investigated whether in the Democratic Republic of Congo pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC) services could act as a surrogate sentinel population. Between 2021 and 2023, we conducted a study in Kinshasa, targeting 4,001 pregnant women attending ANCs, and 2,794 children living in the same area. Blood samples from malaria-positive cases were genotyped using an amplicon sequencing platform, to allow comparisons of Plasmodium falciparum genomes between the two cohorts and estimations of drug-resistance mutations prevalence. Parasite populations sampled from the two cohorts exhibited highly similar allele frequencies at all tested loci, including drug resistance markers potentially under selection. Pregnant women did not have higher frequencies of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistant haplotypes, which undermine preventive treatments, than children, and we did not find any kelch13 mutation at significant frequency. Although parasite densities were lower in adults, the complexity of infection was similar to that in children. There was no evidence of Plasmodium vivax infections in the study. A cohort of pregnant women produces highly similar results to those from children, allowing the implementation of simple and efficient genomic surveillance systems integrated into routine ANC activities, while benefitting women with diagnosis and treatment.

Several subcortical structures, including neuromodulatory nuclei like the locus coeruleus (LC), are involved in the regulation of arousal. However, much less is known about the role of cortical circuits that provide top-down inputs to arousal-related subcortical structures. Here, we investigated the role of a major subdivision of the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), in arousal modulation. Pupil size, facial movements, heart rate, and locomotion were used as non-invasive measures of arousal and behavioral state. We designed a closed loop optogenetic system based on machine vision and found that real time inhibition of ACC activity during pupil dilations suppresses ongoing arousal events. In contrast, inhibiting activity in a control cortical region had no effect on arousal. Fiber photometry recordings showed that ACC activity scales with the magnitude of spontaneously occurring pupil dilations/face movements independently of locomotion. Moreover, optogenetic ACC activation increases arousal independently of locomotion. In addition to modulating global arousal, ACC responses to salient sensory stimuli scaled with the size of evoked pupil dilations. Consistent with a role in sustaining saliency-linked arousal events, pupil responses to sensory stimuli were suppressed with ACC inactivation. Finally, our results comparing arousal-related ACC and norepinephrinergic LC neuron activity support a role for the LC in initiation of arousal events which are modulated in real time by the ACC. Collectively, our experiments identify the ACC as a key cortical site for sustaining momentary increases in arousal and provide the foundation for understanding cortical-subcortical dynamics underlying the modulation of arousal states.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

We find the reduced response to low-dose LPS correlates with minimal TLR4 and CD14 surface expression, despite sufficient internal expression of TLR4. Additionally, we find that AMs do not produce IL-10 in response to a variety of PAMPs due to low expression of transcription factor c-Maf and that lack of IL-10 production contributes to an enhancement of pro-inflammatory responses by Type I IFN. Our findings demonstrate that AMs have cell-intrinsic dampened responses to LPS, which is enhanced by type I IFN exposure. These data implicate conditions where AMs may have reduced or enhanced sentinel responses to bacterial infections.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

By contrast, angiogenesis was significantly elevated in posterior-lateral regions such as visual cortex, primarily within 200 microns of the cortical surface. There were no regional differences in vessel pruning or sex effects except for the length and depth of new capillaries. To understand mechanisms, we surveyed gene expression and found Notch related genes were enriched in ultra-stable retrosplenial versus visual cortex.

We set out to determine if there were temporal differences in select athletics (track and field) records between females and males. Exploratory aims included: 1) evaluating the improvements in female and male world records over time, and 2) investigating the influence of doping programs on male and female world records before and after 1990 when sports governing bodies began to implement random out-of-competition and systematic in-competition drug testing. We collected the top 500 performances of all time for both sexes from an online database (worldathletics.org) in four running events (100m, 200m, 400m, and 800m) and two throwing events (discus throw and shot put). Data were stratified into quintiles based on world record ranking (1st to 100th, 101st to 200th, etc.). The temporal distribution of top 100 female performers was significantly earlier than top 100 male performers (year: 2000{+/-}1 vs 2005{+/-}1, respectively; p<0.001). Within event, the top performances occurred significantly earlier for females in the 800m (year: 1995{+/-}15 vs 2003{+/-}12; p<0.001) and shot put (year: 1992{+/-}14 vs 2003{+/-}17; p<0.001). Among females, world records rapidly improved through the 1980s, however following the 1990, the world records ceased to improve. Geographically, there was a greater representation of countries with state-sponsored doping programs, specifically among female performances. We postulate these sex differences in the temporal distribution of top performances are likely associated with enhanced effectiveness of exogenous androgens (steroid doping) among female athletes with lower endogenous androgen hormones compared to males.

HighlightsO_ST_ABSWhat is the central question of this study?C_ST_ABSDespite a longstanding notion that top performance in athletics occurred earlier for females compared to males, likely due to the larger performance benefits of androgenic-anabolic steroids, no study has compared this temporal relation. Thus, we examined the temporal distribution of select athletics events between females and males.

What is the main finding and its importance?The top-100 female performances occurred earlier than the top-100 male performances. The sex-related temporal differences were particularly notable for the shot put and 800m. Furthermore, there was a greater representation of countries with known state-sponsored doping programs, specifically among females. Our analyses suggest anabolic-androgenic steroids played a greater role in the worlds best female athletics performances.","NA","medrxiv",1716933918310

For example, in Drosophila parasitoids belonging to the Leptopilina genus, 13 viral genes from the Filamentoviridae family have been integrated and domesticated to deliver immunosuppressive factors to host immune cells, thereby protecting parasitoid offspring from host immune responses. The present study aims to comprehensively characterise this domestication event in terms of the viral genes involved, the wasp diversity affected by this event, and its chronology. Our genomic analysis of 41 Cynipoidea wasps from six subfamilies revealed 18 viral genes that were endogenised during the early radiation of the Eucoilini+Trichoplastini clade around 75 million years ago. Wasps from this highly diverse clade develop not only from Drosophila but also from a variety of Schizophora. This event coincides with the radiation of Schizophora, a highly speciose Diptera clade, suggesting that viral domestication facilitated wasp diversification in response to host diversification. Additionally, at least one viral gene was replaced by another Filamentovirus gene in one of the species, highlighting the dynamic nature of viral endogenisation. This study highlights the impact of viral domestication on the diversification of parasitoid wasps.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

Despite these important findings, we still lack effective treatments and people with PCD have significant pulmonary impairment. As with many other diseases, a better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms may lead to effective treatments. To pursue disease mechanisms, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to develop a PCD pig with a disrupted DNAI1 gene. PCD pig airway cilia lacked the outer dynein arm and had impaired beating. MCT was impaired under both baseline conditions and after cholinergic stimulation in PCD pigs. Neonatal PCD pigs developed neonatal respiratory distress with evidence of atelectasis, air trapping, and airway mucus obstruction. Despite airway mucus accumulation, lung bacterial counts were similar between neonatal wild-type and PCD pigs. Sinonasal disease was present in all neonatal PCD pigs.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying flotillin oligomerization and flotillin microdomain organization remain incompletely understood.

Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human flotillin complex, at an overall resolution of 3.57 [A]. It demonstrates that flotillin-1 and-2 are alternately arranged to form a 44-mer ring structure. This dome-shaped complex is hollow and sealed, attaching to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane and encompassing a circular domain with a diameter of approximately 30 nm. These structural features demonstrate a direct role for the flotillin complex in segregating the membrane to organize an isolated microdomain and also suggests a potential regulatory role in sequestering its interacting proteins. The cryo-electron tomography study further demonstrates the structural plasticity of the flotillin complexes in situ, indicative of dynamic conformational changes during their functional activities. In addition, aggregations of the flotillin complexes on the plasma membrane or intracellular vesicles, are frequently observed. Our data suggest that the flotillin complex constitutes the basic structural unit of membrane microdomains, and the further clustering of flotillin complexes might facilitate the formation of larger and more elaborate membrane microdomains.

These findings enhance our understanding of the architecture of the SPFH family proteins and their common role in membrane microdomain organization, and more importantly, provide models for explaining the diverse functions of flotillin proteins in different biological processes.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

Here, as proof of concept, we searched for viral remnants in sequence reads of Neanderthal genome data by mapping to adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus, which are double stranded DNA viruses that may establish lifelong latency and can, produce persistent infections. The reconstructed ancient viral genomes of adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus revealed conserved segments, with nucleotide identity to extant viral genomes, and variable regions in coding regions with substantial divergence to extant close relatives. Sequence reads mapped to extant viral genomes showed deamination patterns of ancient DNA and that these ancient viral genomes showed divergence consistent with the age of these samples ({approx}50,000 years) and viral evolutionary rates (10-5 to 10-8 substitutions/site/year). Analysis of random effects shows that the Neanderthal mapping to genomes of extant persistent viruses is above the expected by random similarities of short reads. Also, negative control with a nonpersistent DNA virus does not yield statistically significant assemblies. This work demonstrates the feasibility of identifying viral genome remnants in archaeological samples with signal-to-noise assessment.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

Such sweeps arise when an adaptation allows a clone to outcompete others within its niche followed by re-diversification, and manifest as clusters of closely related genomes on long branches in phylogenetic trees. This structure is revealed by excluding recombination events that mask the clonal descent of the genomes, and we find that genome-wide sweeps originate under a wide regime of recombination rates in at least 66 taxa from 25 bacterial families. Estimated ages of divergence suggest sweep clusters can spread globally within decades, and this process has occurred repeatedly throughout human history. We show, as an example, that the ecological differentiation of sweep clusters forms populations highly associated with age and colorectal cancer. Our analysis elucidates an evolutionary mechanism for the observation of stably inherited strains with differential associations and provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing adaptation among co-occurring microbial populations.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

Recently, the emergence and dominance of the JN.1 lineage over XBB variants have prompted a reevaluation of current vaccine strategies. Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of XBB-based vaccines against JN.1, concerns persist regarding the durability of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses against evolving JN.1 subvariants. In this study, we compared the humoral immunogenicity of XBB and JN.1 lineage infections in human subjects with diverse immune histories to understand the antigenic and immunogenic distinctions between these variants. Similar to observations in naive mice, priming with XBB and JN.1 in humans without prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure results in distinct NAb responses, exhibiting minimal cross-reactivity. Importantly, breakthrough infections (BTI) with the JN.1 lineage induce 5.9-fold higher neutralization titers against JN.1 compared to those induced by XBB BTI. We also observed notable immune evasion of recently emerged JN.1 sublineages, including JN.1+R346T+F456L, with KP.3 showing the most pronounced decrease in neutralization titers by both XBB and JN.1 BTI sera. These results underscore the challenge posed by the continuously evolving SARS-CoV-2 JN.1 and support the consideration of switching the focus of future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine updates to the JN.1 lineage.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

However, efficient intracellular delivery of the Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex remains one of the major hurdles in its therapeutic application. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are biological nanosized membrane vesicles released by cells, that play an important role in intercellular communication. Due to their innate capability of intercellular transfer of proteins, RNA, and various other biological cargos, EVs have emerged as a novel promising strategy for the delivery of macromolecular biotherapeutics, including CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins. Here, we present a versatile, modular strategy for the loading and delivery of Cas9. We leverage the high affinity binding of MS2 coat proteins (MCPs) fused to EV-enriched proteins to MS2 aptamers incorporated into single guide RNAs (sgRNAs), in combination with a UV-activated photocleavable linker domain, PhoCl. Combined with the Vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) protein this modular platform enables efficient loading and subsequent delivery of the Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex, which shows critical dependence on the incorporation and activation of the photocleavable linker domain. As this approach does not require any direct fusion of Cas9 to EV-enriched proteins, we demonstrate that Cas9 can readily be exchanged for other variants, including transcriptional activator dCas9-VPR and adenine base editor ABE8e, as confirmed by various sensitive fluorescent reporter assays. Taken together, we describe a robust and modular strategy for successful Cas9 delivery, which can be applied for CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic engineering as well as transcriptional regulation, underlining the potential of EV-mediated strategies for the treatment of genetic diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

We explore the thermodynamic driving forces that establish this gradient using a microfluidics-based droplet platform that allows us to sample in a continuous manner both the stability and composition of the condensates across a wide pH range. These results reveal that condensed biomolecular systems adjust the pH of the dense phase towards the isoelectric point (pI) of the component polypeptide chains. We demonstrate, on the basis of two representative systems, FUS and PGL3, that condensates can create both alkaline and acidic gradients with a magnitude exceeding one pH unit. Investigations of multicomponent protein/nucleic acid systems further show that heterotypic interactions can modulate condensate pH gradients. We further investigate using a bioinformatics approach the diversity of electrochemical properties of complex condensates by studying a large set of human condensate networks, showing that these span a wide range of mixture pIs and pH-response behaviours. In summary, our results reveal that protein condensation may present a fundamental physico-chemical mechanism for the effective segregation and optimisation of functional processes through changes in the emergent electrochemical microenvironment.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

However, experimental determination of protein-RNA structures is still challenging, therefore computational tools are needed for the prediction of protein-RNA interfaces. Although evolutionary pressures can be exploited for structural prediction of protein-protein interfaces, and recent deep learning methods using protein multiple sequence alignments have radically improved the performance of protein-protein interface structural prediction, protein-RNA structural prediction is lagging behind, due to the scarcity of structural data and the flexibility involved in these complexes. To study the evolution of protein-RNA interface structures, we first identified a large and diverse dataset of 2,022 pairs of structurally homologous interfaces (termed structural interologs). We leveraged this unique dataset to analyze the conservation of interface contacts among structural interologs based on the properties of involved amino acids and nucleotides. We uncovered that 73% of distance-based contacts and 68% of apolar contacts are conserved on average, and the strong conservation of these contacts occurs even in distant homologs with sequence identity below 20%. Distance-based contacts are also much more conserved compared to what we had found in a previous study of homologous protein-protein interfaces. In contrast, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and {pi}-stacking interactions are very versatile in pairs of protein-RNA interologs, even for close homologs with high interface sequence identity. We found that almost half of the non-conserved distance-based contacts are due to a small proportion of interface residues that no longer belong to the interface in the interolog, a phenomenon we term ""interface switching out"". We also examined possible recovery mechanisms for non-conserved hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, uncovering diverse scenarii of switching out, change in amino acid chemical nature, intermolecular and intramolecular compensations. Our findings provide insights for integrating evolutionary signals into predictive protein-RNA structural modeling methods.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic.

While diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in learning these distributions, their application to regulatory DNA has been limited. Evaluating the quality of generated sequences also remains challenging due to a lack of a unified framework that characterizes key properties of regulatory DNA. Here we introduce DNA Discrete Diffusion (D3), a generative framework for conditionally sampling regulatory sequences with targeted functional activity levels. We develop a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics that assess the functional similarity, sequence similarity, and regulatory composition of generated sequences. Through benchmarking on three high-quality functional genomics datasets spanning human promoters and fly enhancers, we demonstrate that D3 outperforms existing methods in capturing the diversity of cis-regulatory grammars and generating sequences that more accurately reflect the properties of genomic regulatory DNA. Furthermore, we show that D3-generated sequences can effectively augment supervised models and improve their predictive performance, even in data-limited scenarios.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

We then used ChemPrint, our Mol-GDL (Molecular-Geometric Deep Learning) machine learning model to predict drug inhibition of the Thumb-1 site in RdRp across +ssRNA viruses. Here, we identify MDL-001 as a promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidate with favorable properties that enable oral and once-a-day dosing. We also show how the cryptic nature of the Thumb-1 site masks itself to conventional virtual screening techniques, like docking, where activity prediction is heavily based on solving or predicting an accurate structure of the open pocket. This study demonstrates the utility of this approach in drug discovery for broad-spectrum antivirals that target the Thumb-1 site.

Lay SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThis paper addresses the challenge of developing broad-spectrum antivirals against +ssRNA viruses, which include pathogens like HCV and SARS-CoV-2. The highly conserved RdRp Thumb-1 site across these viruses is identified as a potential target for broad spectrum antiviral drugs, which would be vital tools in prophylactic and therapeutic responses to future viral threats.

MethodologyUtilizing bioinformatics and deep learning (through our proprietary AI platform called GALILEO), the study maps the conserved landscape of the RdRp Thumb-1 site across a range of human pathogenic +ssRNA viruses and screens for potential inhibitory compounds.

Key DiscoveriesMDL-001 emerges as a potential broad-spectrum non-nucleoside antiviral drug candidate and the RdRp Thumb-1 site exists as a family of targets, many of which may be targetable by a single drug.

Impact and ImplicationsThe discovery that the Thumb-1 site of RdRp can be targeted by small molecules for antiviral activity against a range of +ssRNA viruses.

Future DirectionsThis work paves the way for further development of MDL-001 and research for other broad-spectrum antiviral compounds that target the RdRp Thumb-1 domain.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

DesignThis case series study analyzed adverse event (AE) reports submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database following RSVPreF immunization from September 1, 2023, to February 23, 2024.

SettingVAERS, as a national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system, provides insights into the safety profile of the RSVPreF vaccine in a real-world setting.

ParticipantsSurveillance data included all AE reports submitted to VAERS for pregnant individuals following vaccination.

ExposureReceipt of RSVPreF vaccine among pregnant individuals in the U.S.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresDescriptive statistics assessed all AE reports with RSVPreF, including frequency, gestational age at vaccination, time to AE onset, and serious report proportions. The Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) was utilized, estimating the information component (IC) to identify disproportionate reporting of RSVPreF-event pairs.

ResultsVAERS received 77 reports pertained to RSVPreF vaccination in pregnant individuals, with 42 (54.55%) classified as serious. The most reported non-pregnancy-specific AEs were headache, injection site erythema, and injection site pain. Preterm birth was the most frequently reported pregnancy-specific AE, followed by preterm premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, cervical dilatation, and hemorrhage during pregnancy. The median time from immunization to reported preterm birth was 3 days, with two-thirds of cases within a week. Disproportionality analysis indicated a significant signal for various AEs, particularly highlighting preterm birth with an IC of 2.18 (95%CI, 1.54-2.63), suggesting that reports of preterm birth associated with RSVPreF vaccination occurred more frequently than statistically expected.

ConclusionsWhile reported AEs were generally consistent with the safety profile observed in prelicensure studies, this study highlights ongoing concern about preterm birth among pregnant individuals following RSVPreF vaccination. Comprehensive longitudinal follow-up, including prospective pregnancy registries and infant follow-up studies is urgently required.","NA","medrxiv",1716933918310

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

FundingNational Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2701800 and 2022YFC2304700), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82202567 and 32270003), Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2022278), Shanghai Rising-Star Program (23QA1410500), and Shanghai municipal three-year action plan for strengthening the construction of the public health system (2023-2025) GWVI-2.1.2.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1716933918310

Here, we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), a genome editing system that combines the programmability and precision of CRISPR/Cas9 with the RNA-mediated gene insertion capabilities of the human LINE1 (L1) element. CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

DesignNationwide cohort studies, using target trial emulation.

SettingDenmark, Finland, and Sweden, from 1 October 2023 to 29 February 2024.

ParticipantsIndividuals aged [&ge;]65 years who had previously received at least four covid-19 vaccine doses. Main outcome measures: Cumulative incidences of covid-19 hospital admission and death for 12 weeks after immunisation (defined as 1 week after vaccination) among recipients of an XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk differences.

ResultsDuring autumn and winter 2023-2024, a total of 1,867,448 1:1 matched pairs of XBB-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and non-recipients were included (mean age 75.4 years, standard deviation 7.4 years). The comparative vaccine effectiveness was 60.6% (95% confidence interval, 46.1% to 75.1%) against covid-19 hospital admission (930 v 2,551 events) and 77.9% (69.2% to 86.7%) against covid-19 related death (301 v 1,326 events) at 12 weeks of follow-up. This corresponded to 191.1 (95% confidence interval, 50.2 to 332.1) covid-19 hospital admissions and 109.2 (100.2 to 118.1) deaths prevented per 100,000 individuals vaccinated with an XBB.1.5-containing vaccine. The comparative vaccine effectiveness was similar across sex, age (65-74/[&ge;]75 years), number of previous covid-19 vaccine doses received, and seasonal influenza vaccination co-administration subgroups and periods of either omicron XBB- or BA.2.86-sublineage dominance. While the protection was highest during the first weeks after vaccination, it was well-preserved at end of week 12 of follow-up.

ConclusionAmong adults aged [&ge;]65 years, vaccination with a monovalent XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine reduced the rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and death during autumn and winter 2023-2024 across three Nordic countries.","NA","medrxiv",1716933918310

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918310

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1716933918311

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918311

Stress-induced exposure of ribosome-free mRNA following translational shutoff is thought to cause condensation by allowing new multivalent RNA-dependent interactions, with RNA length and associated interaction capacity driving increased condensation. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all mRNA species condense in response to multiple unrelated stresses in budding yeast, length plays a minor role, and instead, stress-induced transcripts are preferentially excluded from condensates, enabling their selective translation. Using both endogenous genes and reporter constructs, we show that translation initiation blockade, rather than resulting ribosome-free RNA, causes condensation. These translation initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are biochemically detectable even when stress granules, defined as microscopically visible foci, are absent or blocked. TIICs occur in unstressed yeast cells, and, during stress, grow before the appearance of visible stress granules. Stress-induced transcripts are excluded from TIICs primarily due to the timing of their expression, rather than their sequence features. Together, our results reveal a simple system by which cells redirect translational activity to newly synthesized transcripts during stress, with broad implications for cellular regulation in changing conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918311

It forms a right-handed helical barrel consisting of 22 pairs of Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 subunits, with a diameter of 32 nm its wider end and 19 nm at its narrower end. Oligomerization is stabilized by the C-terminus, which forms two helical layers linked by a {beta}-strand, and coiled-coil domains that enable strong charge-charge inter-subunit interactions. Flotillin interacts with membranes at both ends; through its SPFH1 domains at the wide end and the C-terminus at the narrow end, facilitated by hydrophobic interactions and lipidation. The inward tilting of the SPFH domain, likely triggered by phosphorylation, suggests its role in membrane curvature induction, which could be connected to its proposed role in clathrin-independent endocytosis. The structure suggests a shared architecture across the family of SPFH proteins and will promote further research into Flotillins roles in cell biology.

Significance statementIt is well known that many biochemical processes in cells must occur in localized regions. There are many different ideas about how cells keep processes localized. In this study we demonstrate that Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 co-assemble to form a large, truncated cone shaped cage whose wide end is always attached to a membrane surface and whose narrow end is sometimes attached to a separate membrane. The entire wall of the cage is without holes and is likely impervious even to small molecules, forming a diffusion barrier that can connect membrane systems. The Flotillin cage is thus well suited to isolate biochemical processes. Through membrane attachment, it also alters local membrane curvature, which could influence endocytic and mechanosensory processes.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918311

However, this approach can produce variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice appeared to habituate more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in withdrawal behavior. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdalar neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map pain sensation and affect.","NA","biorxiv",1716933918311
