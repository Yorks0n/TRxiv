While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1742854125982

However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive the onset and progression of synaptic pathology remain to be established. Here, we used synaptic density positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using the [11C]UCB-J radiotracer to reveal a prominent widespread pattern (p_FWE<0.05) of lower synaptic density in individuals with schizophrenia (n=29), compared to a large sample of healthy controls (n=93). We found that the spatial pattern of lower synaptic density in schizophrenia is spatially aligned (r_cca = 0.67; p<0.001) with higher normative distributions of GABAA/BZ, 5HT1B, 5HT2A, and 5HT6, and lower levels of CB1 and 5HT1A. Competing neighborhood deformation network models revealed that regional synaptic pathology strongly correlated with estimates predicted using a model constrained by both interregional structural connectivity and molecular similarity (.42 < r < .61; p_FWE<0.05). These data suggest that synaptic pathology in schizophrenia is jointly constrained by both global axonal connectivity and local molecular vulnerability. Simulation-based network diffusion models were used to identify regions that may represent the initial sources of pathology, nominating left prefrontal areas (p_FWE<0.05) as potential foci from which synaptic pathology initiates and propagates to molecularly similar areas. Overall, our findings provide in vivo evidence for widespread deficit in synaptic density in schizophrenia that is jointly constrained by axonal connectivity and molecular similarity between regions, and that synaptic deficits spread from initial source regions to axonally connected and molecularly similar territories.","NA","medrxiv",1742854125982

Single-cell resolved measures of RNA levels and single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTLs) have revealed genetic regulation that drives sub-tissue cell states and types across diverse human tissues. Here, we describe the first phase of TenK10K, the largest-to-date dataset of matched whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). We leverage scRNA-seq data from over 5 million cells across 28 immune cell types and matched WGS from 1,925 individuals. This provides power to detect associations between rare and low-frequency genetic variants that have largely been uncharacterised in their impact on cell-specific gene expression. We map the effects of both common and rare variants in a cell type specific manner using SAIGE-QTL. This newly developed method increases power by modelling single cells directly using a Poisson model rather than relying on aggregated 'pseudobulk' counts. We identify putative common regulatory variants for 83% of all 21,404 genes tested and cumulative rare variant signals for 47% of genes. We explore how genetic effects vary across cell type and state spectra, develop a framework to determine the degree to which sc-eQTLs are cell type specific, and show that about half of the effects are observed only in one or a few cell types. By integrating our results with functional annotations and disease information, we further characterise the likely molecular modes of action for many disease-associated variants. Finally, we explore the effects of genetic variants on gene expression across different cell states and functions, as well as effects that directly vary cell state abundance.","NA","medrxiv",1742854125982

However, simulations incorporating realistic selection along heterogeneous genomes in complex demographic histories are challenging, limiting our ability to benchmark statistical methods aimed at detecting selection and to explore theoretical predictions. stdpopsim is a community-maintained simulation library that already provides an extensive catalog of species-specific population genetic models. Here we present a major extension to the stdpopsim framework that enables simulation of various modes of selection, including background selection, selective sweeps, and arbitrary distributions of fitness effects (DFE) acting on annotated subsets of the genome (for instance, exons). This extension maintains stdpopsim's core principles of reproducibility and accessibility while adding support for species-specific genomic annotations and published DFE estimates. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by benchmarking methods for demographic inference, DFE estimation, and selective sweep detection across several species and scenarios. Our results demonstrate the robustness of demographic inference methods to selection on linked sites, reveal the sensitivity of DFE-inference methods to model assumptions, and show how genomic features, like recombination rate and functional sequence density, influence power to detect selective sweeps. This extension to stdpopsim provides a powerful new resource for the population genetics community to explore the interplay between selection and other evolutionary forces in a reproducible, low-barrier framework.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125982

Clade diversity trajectories follow rise and decline dynamics, with fast accumulation following recurrent speciation while slowdowns and losses are modulated primarily by changes in extinction. Diversity dynamics do not appear to be governed by clade-level processes expected from adaptive radiations or diversity equilibria. Rather, these patterns emerge from dynamics at the species-level, where lineages tend to become increasingly vulnerable to extinction and less likely to speciate with time. Those species that counteract this trend create and maintain biodiversity through deep time.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125982

However, its application in solid tumors remains limited because single targets are unlikely to suffice due to tumor antigen heterogeneity and off-tumor toxicities. To overcome these obstacles, we developed LogiCAR designer, a computational approach that utilizes single-cell transcriptomics data from patient tumors to systematically identify the cancer-specific antigen circuits with logic gates (""AND,"" ""OR,"" and ""NOT"") that target the majority of cancer cells in a tumor while sparing normal cells and tissues as much as possible. LogiCAR designer efficiently scales to higher-order antigen combinations involving up to five genes. Applied to a large-scale dataset encompassing approximately 2 million cells (including > 620k tumor cells) from 342 clinical patient samples across all major breast cancer subtypes, LogiCAR designer identified antigen circuits with enhanced tumor-targeting efficacy and improved safety profiles compared to both previously reported circuits and single-target therapies in clinical trials. However, even these optimized shared circuits still proved insufficient for some patients. We hence systematically studied LogiCAR designers ability to identify highly effective CAR circuits that are individualized to each patient. Remarkably, such personalized CAR circuits provide estimated tumor-targeting efficacy tantamount to complete response in 76% of patients and partial response for all patients. Taken together, this analysis is the first systematic quantification of the efficacy and safety of all possible CAR circuits, showing that: (a) the quality of existing solutions leaves much to be desired; (b) the ability of shared circuits optimized across many patients is moderate, and finally, (c) individually tailored circuits offer significantly higher tumor-targeting efficacies for patients. LogiCAR designer offers a rigorous, data-driven way to facilitate the rational design of safe and effective CAR-based immunotherapies for cancer.

Examining the subcellular localization of proteins using fluorescence microscopy is a powerful approach to infer their putative function. Here we report a plasmid-based method that enables YFP-tagging of a gene at the endogenous locus. By examining the localization of proteins whose homologs are involved in chromosome segregation in other eukaryotes, we discovered several interesting features in mitotically dividing P. papillatum cells. Cohesin is enriched on condensed interphase chromatin. During mitosis, chromosomes organize into two rings (termed metaphase rings herein) that surround the elongating nucleolus. Homologs of chromosomal passenger complex components (INCENP, two Aurora kinases, and KIN-A), a CLK1 kinase, spindle checkpoint protein Mad1, and microtubule regulator XMAP215 localize in between the two metaphase rings, suggesting that kinetochores may assemble in between them. We also found that a homolog of the meiotic chromosome axis protein SYCP2L1 is enriched in between metaphase rings during mitosis. These features have some resemblance to the bivalent bridge (also known as the modified synaptonemal complex), which is thought to mediate the linkage between homologous chromosomes using axis components in Bombyx mori female meiotic metaphase I.

To overcome these challenges, we explore Genomic Language Models (gLMs) -inspired by Large Language Models in Natural Language Processing- to enhance bacterial gene prediction. These models learn patterns and contextual dependencies within genetic sequences, similar to how LLMs process human language. We employ transformers, specifically DNABERT, for bacterial gene prediction using a two-stage framework: first, identifying Coding Sequence (CDS) regions, and then refining predictions by identifying the correct Translation Initiation Sites (TIS). DNABERT is fine-tuned on a curated set of NCBI complete bacterial genomes using a k-mer tokenizer for sequence processing. Our results show that GeneLM significantly improves gene prediction accuracy. Compared to Prodigal, a leading prokaryotic gene finder, GeneLM reduces missed CDS predictions while increasing matched annotations. More notably, our TIS predictions surpass traditional methods when tested against experimentally verified sites. GeneLM demonstrates the power of gLMs in decoding genetic information, achieving state-of-the-art performance in bacterial genome analysis.

The newly named ScmA protein of Caulobacter crescentus is one of these solitary cytosine methyltransferases. Here, we show that it methylates YGCCGGCR motifs introducing thousands of m5C bases on the C. crescentus genome. We also find that wild-type C. crescentus cells easily outcompete{Delta} scmA cells during competition experiments. Transcriptome comparisons and using single-cell fluorescent reporters reveal that a DNA damage response is turned on in a significant proportion of{Delta} scmA cells. We then show that this particular response is strictly dependent on the presence of a Vsr-like protein named VsrA. Eventhough the vsrA gene is surprisingly neither genetically linked with the scmA gene nor with another cytosine methyltransferase gene, VsrA is predicted to encode an endonuclease preventing m5C-to-T mutations. Fluorescence microscopy experiments then show that GFP-VsrA forms foci relatively frequently in stationary phase cells, which may correspond to active repair sites. We propose that VsrA may accidentally create double strand breaks when detecting mismatched bases on the genome of{Delta} scmA cells, leading to their observed loss of fitness. Thus, the presence of vsr-like genes can potentially stabilize genes encoding cytosine methyltransferases in bacterial genomes, providing a potential explanation for the relatively high prevalence of solitary cytosine methyltransferases in bacteria even if some of these do not appear to play an easily detectable regulatory role.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125982

While extensive research has explored navigation strategies in rodents, how these strategies emerge and evolve in freely moving non-human primates remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted a longitudinal study to investigate the dynamics of spatial learning and navigation strategies in freely moving common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) performing a foraging task in a semi-naturalistic environment. Marmosets were trained to collect rewards from eight spatially distributed dispensers. Using behavioral analyses combined with machine learning methods, including unsupervised clustering and probabilistic modeling, we examined how their navigation strategies evolved over time. Our results reveal a progressive improvement in performance, accompanied by an increasing structuring of movement patterns. Initially, marmosets exhibited exploratory behaviors, with high transition variability between food dispensers. As training progressed, their navigation became more structured, with the emergence of recurrent transition patterns and a shift towards route-based navigation. However, despite this increasing regularity, their navigation retained a degree of flexibility, allowing them to dynamically adapt their routes rather than following a fixed sequence. These findings suggest that marmosets develop structured yet flexible navigation strategies through experience. Their behavior reflects a balance between efficiency and adaptability and supports the emergence of a flexible representation of space. Our study provides novel insights into spatial memory development in primates and highlights the value of semi-naturalistic paradigms for studying navigation strategies and spatial learning in freely moving animals.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125982

The ability to grow on methoxylated aromatic acids (e.g., vanillic acid) has recently been identified in certain clades of methylotrophs, bacteria characterized by their unique ability to tolerate and metabolize high concentrations of formaldehyde. Here, we use a phyllosphere methylotroph isolate, Methylobacterium extorquens SLI 505, as a model to identify the fate of formaldehyde during methylotrophic growth on vanillic acids. M. extorquens SLI 505 displays concentration-dependent growth phenotypes on vanillic acid without concomitant formaldehyde accumulation. We conclude that M. extorquens SLI 505 overcomes potential metabolic bottlenecks from simultaneous assimilation of multicarbon and C1 intermediates by allocating formaldehyde towards dissimilation and assimilating the ring carbons of vanillic acid heterotrophically. We correlate this strategy with maximization of bioenergetic yields and demonstrate that formaldehyde dissimilation for energy generation rather than formaldehyde detoxification is advantageous for growth on aromatic acids. M. extorquens SLI 505 also exhibits catabolite repression during growth on methanol and low concentrations of vanillic acid, but no diauxie during growth on methanol and high concentrations of vanillic acid. Results from this study outline metabolic strategies employed by M. extorquens SLI 505 for growth on a complex single substrate that generates both C1 and multicarbon intermediates and emphasizes the robustness of M. extorquens for biotechnological applications for lignin valorization.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125982

Although these networks are beginning to find applications in magnetoencephalography (MEG), their use in this domain is still in the early stages. Here, we introduce MEEGNet, a novel Python library paired with an intuitive convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed primarily for MEG data, yet adaptable to EEG signals. The MEEGNet model was trained and cross-validated using MEG data from 643 participants across four classification tasks, including auditory and visual stimulus classification and age prediction. Our model achieves competitive performance across all tasks, with a notable balance of accuracy and efficiency - for instance, reaching 92.70% test accuracy in an auditory vs. visual classification task while maintaining shorter training times than other architectures. The MEEGNet pipeline also integrates latent space visualization tools, adapted for MEG and EEG data. These include saliency maps and Grad-CAM methods, which enhance the interpretability of ANN-based classification and help address the black-box critique of such models. Importantly, the MEEGNet library is designed for extensibility, allowing the neuroscience and machine learning communities to add functionalities and ANN models.

However, this effect was transient and less optimal when participants were highly confident in their self-motion-based spatial representation suggesting that internal priors hinder the assimilation of novel spatial cues. At the neural level, RSC theta-band activity supported these recalibration processes. When fine adjustments of the spatial representation were sufficient, landmark presentation elicited stronger theta-band activity and greater phase resetting compared to when substantial spatial updating was necessary.

CH is associated with risk for hematologic malignancies and cardiovascular disease, but most studies are predominately based on individuals of European ancestry. Using peripheral blood whole exome sequencing data from 125,748 individuals of diverse genetic ancestries, we cataloged 503,703 SM mutations based on low variant allele frequency distributions and 89,361 CH variants based on age-skewing. We examined CH prevalence across ancestry groups, including commonly recognized pathogenic variants in myeloid (M-CHIP) and lymphoid (L-CHIP) malignancies. CH and M-CHIP variants had the highest prevalence in the European non-Finnish ancestry group, and males trended toward more M-CHIP variants. Ancestry differences in CH included more mutations in NF1 in African/African American, TP53 in European, and CUX1 in Asian and Latino/Admixed American ancestry groups. Linking the identified CH variants to a cancer database, CH was detected in 14% (55,190/391,102) of patient tumors. Prevalence of CH variants in some solid tumors ranged from 25% - 40%. M-CHIP variants in solid tumors were associated with younger age (61 vs 63, p <0.001), while M-CHIP in hematologic malignancies were linked to older age (60 vs 50, p <0.001), suggesting differences in disease biology.

In this study, we generated a comprehensive and curated TE library for the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) by integrating two bioinformatic pipelines (EDTA and DeepTE). Our annotation revealed that TEs account for approximately 37% of the F. vesca genome. Analysis of TE-derived inverted repeats (IRs) and miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) demonstrated their association with 24-nt small interfering RNA (siRNA) production and differential DNA methylation patterns across tissues, suggesting a role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, particularly during fruit ripening. This MITE-mediated epigenetic regulatory mechanism was confirmed by evaluating gene expression and chromatin organization at FvH4_7g18570, which encodes the alcohol acyl transferase (FvAAT1). Three MITEs located upstream or downstream of the FvAAT1 coding sequence were shown to influence epigenetically this gene expression. Furthermore, we analyzed 210 re-sequenced accessions from the F. vesca European germplasm collection to identify and annotate TE insertion and deletion polymorphisms. A principal component analysis (PCA) based on these polymorphisms revealed subpopulation structures that reflect geographic origins. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) uncovered significant associations between specific TE polymorphisms and economically important fruit traits, including aroma-related volatile compounds and fruit size. Among them, the insertion of a hAT MITE near FvH4_2g00610 correlated with increased levels of {gamma}-decalactone, a desirable aroma compound in strawberries. These findings underscore the functional significance of TE-derived elements as key contributors to phenotypic diversity through novel regulatory functions. By integrating TE polymorphisms into population-genomic and functional studies, this work provides valuable insights into strawberry fruit development and quality traits. It also highlights the potential of harnessing TE-mediated variation in breeding initiatives and genome editing strategies to improve fruit quality.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125982

RNA polymerase II promoters are unconventional and characterised by regions of chromatin enriched for histones with specific patterns of post-translational modification on their highly divergent N-terminal tails. To investigate the roles of histone tail-residues in gene expression control in T. brucei, we engineered strains exclusively expressing novel mutant histones. We used an inducible CRISPR-Cas9 system to delete >40 native copies of histone H4, complementing the tandem arrays with a single ectopic H4 gene. The resulting histoneH4 strains were validated using whole-genome sequencing and transcriptome analysis. We then performed saturation mutagenesis of six histone H4 N-terminal tail lysine (K) residues and used multiplex amplicon-seq to profile the relative fitness of 384 distinct precision edited mutants. H4K10 mutations were not tolerated, but we could derive a panel of nineteen strains exclusively expressing novel H4K4 or H4K14 mutants. Both proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of H4K4Q mutants revealed significantly reduced expression of genes adjacent to RNA polymerase II promoters, where the glutamine (Q) mutation mimics an abnormally high level of acetylation.

However, imaging technologies for mammalian cell applications remain rare. Here, we set out to design and engineer a two-domain chimera fusing the split green fluorescent protein EGFP and the nitrate recognition domain NreA from Staphylococcus carnosus. Over 7 rounds of directed evolution, 15 mutations were accumulated resulting in the functional biosensor NitrOFF. NitrOFF has a high degree of allosteric communication between the domains reflected in a turn-off intensiometric response (Kd {approx} 9 M). This was further reinforced by X-ray crystal structures of apo and nitrate bound NitrOFF, which revealed that the two domains undergo a large-scale conformational rearrangement that changes the relative positioning of the EGFP and NreA domains by 68.4{degrees}. Such a dramatic difference was triggered by the formation of a long helix at the engineered linker connecting the two domains, peeling the {beta}7 strand off the EGFP and thus extinguishing the fluorescence upon nitrate binding.

Highly efficient editing of the different constitutive elements of the operons can be achieved by using a set of optimized guide RNAs and single- or double-stranded DNA repair templates carrying relatively short homology arms.

Here we utilise an influenza A virus (IAV) challenge to investigate the combinatorial roles of the iCCRs in the anti-IAV immune response. We did not observe any gross differences in infection-driven pathology in the absence of iCCRs. Despite iCCR deletion resulting in decreased migration of monocytes, migratory macrophages and B cells to lungs during acute IAV infection, no differences in dendritic cell numbers were observed. Whilst the total number of T cells was similar in lungs of iCCR-deficient mice, the number of IAV-specific CD4 but not CD8 T cells in the lung was strongly reduced in the absence of iCCRs. Furthermore, fewer CD4, but not CD8, T cells produced IFN-{gamma}. This CD4 T cell phenotype persisted into the memory stage of infection, with fewer IAV-specific and IFN-{gamma}+ CD4 but not CD8 T cells at 29 days post infection. In conclusion, despite having no impact on dendritic cell migration between the lung and the draining lymph node, iCCR deletion is associated with an altered CD4 T cell response to IAV infection.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125982

However, whether this function is driven purely by oscillatory activity or also involves aperiodic neural components remains unclear, making it difficult to develop precise theoretical models of alpha function and attention. Using EEG and concurrent TMS-EEG, this study aimed to (1) disentangle the contributions of oscillatory and aperiodic alpha activity to visuospatial attention and (2) examine their causal roles by differentially modulating aperiodic and oscillatory components. First, across three independent EEG datasets, we found that both oscillatory and aperiodic responses in the alpha band contribute to spatial attention encoding and univariate lateralisation effects. The two signals were uncorrelated across electrodes and their combination yielded stronger effects than either signal separately, suggesting that they may play complementary roles. Then, we used concurrent TMS-EEG to modulate the two signals. Compared to arrhythmic TMS (ar-TMS), rhythmic TMS (rh-TMS), enhanced oscillatory alpha power, especially at the stimulated area, while decreasing aperiodic alpha power across the scalp. Despite these opposing effects, rh-TMS improved visuospatial attention representation carried by both oscillatory and aperiodic alpha signals, suggesting that both signals may support attentional processing through different mechanisms. Moreover, TMS-induced changes in oscillatory and aperiodic alpha decoding differentially predicted behavioural performance, with TMS-induced changes in oscillatory alpha decoding correlating with response errors and changes in aperiodic alpha decoding correlating with response speed. Together these findings reveal a functional dissociation between oscillatory and aperiodic activity in the alpha band. We suggest a dual mechanism for alpha band activity in supporting visuospatial attention, where the two components have distinct but complementary roles. Oscillatory components may primarily support attentional filtering and target prioritization, while aperiodic components may reflect overall neural excitability and cognitive efficiency. Both of these mechanisms contribute to successful visuospatial attention.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125982

Traditionally, Public and Patient Involvement (PPI) groups have contributed to the design of clinical research but less often to the analysis and reporting of findings. This study is wholly led by a patient group with no direct input from clinicians, thus presenting an entirely novel and unique patient-centric view.

MethodsThis report draws on data from a Wellbeing Survey led by the Edinburgh IBD Science team as part of the MUSIC IBD cohort study (www.musiscstudy.uk) with over 1,375 IBD respondents over two time periods in 2023 from United Kingdom. The PPI group utilised high-level topic analysis and their own lived experience of IBD to explore the 415 free-text survey responses. Regular discussions allowed the team to reflect on patient narratives and generate findings collaboratively. PPI members contributed to both the structure and content of the final write-up, utilising their diverse backgrounds and skillsets.

ResultsThe analysis provided in-depth exploration of several key themes affecting wellbeing in IBD patients. Of interest, the PPI group discussed and explored themes such as  what does remission mean?, access to care, expectations of self-management, mental and womens health. The patient narratives highlighted the variability of IBD experiences, the interconnectedness of these issues, and the importance of holistic, patient-centric approaches to care. The findings emphasise the necessity for improved support, both within and beyond healthcare settings.

ConclusionThis patient-led research approach demonstrates that allowing patients to lead in analysis ( taking the reins) and reporting provides deeper and impactful insights into IBD experiences. By integrating patient perspectives, this study advocates for a patient-dominant approach to research and care, which can improve outcomes and support ways to address the complexities of living with IBD. The model highlights challenges and benefits of this approach, serving as a foundational template for future patient-led collaborations, in addition to the immediate impact of patients wellbeing from shared experiences, to educating clinicians and people without IBD about the impact of IBD on patients lives.","NA","medrxiv",1742854125982

The aim of this study was to elucidate the architecture of this region and the way in which it is presented to antibodies. As a model system, this peptide carrying a single lipophilic tail and the same peptide carrying a lipophilic tail at both ends (pseudocyclic) were incorporated into lipid membrane. Isolated anti-1147 antibodies interacted with it regardless of how the peptide was presented, be that freely exposed via the N-terminus, organized as a pseudocycle, or adsorbed on the surface. MDS showed that peptide 1147 is capable of closely approaching the membrane. Analysis of the surface properties of peptide 1147 in membrane-bound states and in available conformations in the full-sized S protein reveals interface for interaction with antibodies. Interestingly, the latter bears similarities to one published peptide-antibody complex. However, these antibodies, in spite of their high diagnostic significance, show no virus-neutralizing activity, indicating that peptide 1147 has no therapeutic value as a synthetic vaccine.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125982

Traditional community detection algorithms assign each node to one module, but this representation cannot capture integrative, multi-functional nodes that span multiple communities. Despite the increasing availability of overlapping community detection algorithms (OCDAs) to capture such integrative nodes, there is no objective procedure for selecting the most appropriate method and its parameters for a given problem. Here we overcome this limitation by introducing a datadriven method for selecting an OCDA and its parameters from performance on a tailored ensemble of generated benchmark networks, assessing 22 unique algorithms and parameter settings. Applied to the human structural connectome, we find that the  Order Statistics Local Optimization Method (OSLOM) best identifies ground-truth overlapping structure in the benchmark ensemble and yields a seven-network decomposition of the human cortex. These modules are bridged by fifteen overlapping regions that generally sit at the apex of the putative cortical hierarchy--suggesting integrative, higher-order function-- with network participation increasing along the cortical hierarchy, a finding not supported using a non-overlapping modular decomposition. This data-driven approach to selecting OCDAs is applicable across domains, opening new avenues to detecting and quantifying informative structures in complex real-world networks.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125983

MethodsWe used nationwide data from Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, using 28- and 180-days risk periods following BNT162b2 vaccination or a positive test for SARS-Cov-2 infection. Individuals aged 5-19 years during the study period (1st January 2021-31st December 2022) were included. We used a common data model, using individual level data linked from nation-wide registers and a shared analysis script to harmonize data and analysis. Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) comparing outcome rates in risk windows to unvaccinated or uninfected follow-up rates. This was supplemented with self-controlled case series analyses. Results from different countries were analyzed jointly in a meta-analysis.

ResultsWe observed no clear association between BNT162b2 vaccination and new-onset AH, GBS or T1D. Neither did we observe any clear association with recurrent hospital visits following BNT162b2 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Metatranscriptomic analyses suggest viral functional genes are actively expressed, potentially enhancing host metabolism of complex organic matter (COM). Indeed, purified viruses from deep-sea sediments were shown to facilitate COM metabolism in certain deep-sea microorganisms, enabling the isolation of previously uncultured bacterial taxa.

Using a mouse model with SEL1L deletion in proglucagon-expressing cells, we observed a progressive decline in stimulated glucagon secretion and a reduction in pancreatic glucagon content. Mechanistically, we found that endogenous proPC2 is a substrate of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD, and that degradation of misfolded proPC2 ensures the maturation of activation-competent proPC2 protein. These findings identify ERAD as a novel regulator of PC2 biology and an essential mechanism for maintaining  cell function.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125983

E. coli, a major causative agent of bloodstream infections, has evolved highly virulent and MDR strains, which contribute to the increasing burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), complicating clinical management and reducing the efficacy of conventional antibiotic therapies. This study highlights the negative implications of MDR E. coli sepsis through the genomic and phenotypic characterization of E. coli 266631E isolated from a sepsis patient. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and minimum inhibitory concentration analysis revealed resistance to multiple antibiotics, including amoxicillin, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin. Whole genome sequencing identified a broad array of AMR genes encoding resistance to various antibiotic classes, such as macrolides, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, carbapenems, and cephalosporins. Notably, the CTX-M-15 gene, a key extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase determinant, was found in both the bacterial chromosome and an IncF-type plasmid, emphasizing the potential for horizontal gene transfer and rapid dissemination of resistance. Confirming the taxonomy of the isolate through querying its 16S rRNA sequence and genome in recognised bacterial taxonomic databases presented a challenge.

Across datasets, we delineate two replicable axes of human white matter development. First, we find a deep-to-superficial axis, in which superficial tract regions near the cortical surface exhibit greater age-related change than deep tract regions. Second, we demonstrate that the development of superficial tract regions aligns with the cortical hierarchy defined by the sensorimotor-association axis, with tract ends adjacent to sensorimotor cortices maturing earlier than those adjacent to association cortices. These results reveal developmental variation along tracts that conventional tract-average analyses have previously obscured, challenging the implicit assumption that white matter tracts mature uniformly along their length. Such developmental variation along tracts may have functional implications, including mitigating ephaptic coupling in densely packed deep tract regions and tuning neural synchrony through hierarchical development in superficial tract regions - ultimately refining neural transmission in youth.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125983

Accurate TFBS identification is crucial for unraveling regulatory mechanisms driving cellular dynamics. Over the years, various computational approaches have been developed to model TFBSs, with Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) being one of the most widely adopted methods. PWMs provide a probabilistic framework by representing nucleotide frequencies at every position within the binding site. While effective and interpretable, PWMs face significant limitations, such as their inability to capture positional dependencies or model complex interactions. To address these, advanced methods, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based models, have been introduced. Leveraging human ChIP-seq data from ENCODE, this study systematically benchmarks the predictive performance of PWM and SVM-based models across different scenarios. We evaluate the impact of key factors such as training dataset size, sequence length, and kernel functions (for SVMs) on models' performance. Additionally, we explore the impact of synthetic versus real biological background data during model training. Our analysis highlights strengths and limitations of both PWM and SVM-based approaches under different conditions, providing practical guidance for selecting and tailoring models to specific biological datasets. To complement our analysis, we present a comprehensive database of pretrained SVM models for TFBS detection, trained on human ChIP-seq data from diverse cell lines and tissues.

Using an adrenocortical cell-specific HIF1 (Hypoxia inducible Factor-1)-deficient mouse model (P2H1Ad.Cortex) resulting in elevated glucocorticoid (GC) levels, we here demonstrate that sustained GC exposure promotes hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) expansion while shifting HSCs toward a more quiescent and metabolically restrained state. Functionally, these HSCs exhibited enhanced regenerative potential, as evidenced by superior donor chimerism in transplantation assays. In addition, we observed a striking increase in myeloid progenitors, as well as in their progeny (monocytes and granulocytes). Conversely, B-cell differentiation in the bone marrow was severely impaired, with a strong block at the pre-pro-B cell stage. To determine whether these phenotypes were driven by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling, we performed transplantation experiments using GR-deficient or WT control bone marrow into P2H1Ad.Cortex or WT littermate recipients. This approach decisively demonstrated that both the increase in myeloid cells and the block in B-cell differentiation were GR-dependent, confirming that GC-GR signaling plays a pivotal role in shaping hematopoiesis. Taken together, our findings clearly suggest a direct role for chronic glucocorticoid exposure in regulating HSC function, lineage differentiation, and stress hematopoiesis. The mouse model of adrenocortical cell-specific HIF1 deficiency provides a valuable tool to study the long-term effects of elevated glucocorticoid levels on hematopoietic regulation and may provide further insight into hematologic disorders associated with chronic therapeutic glucocorticoid administration.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125983

We report that deletion of the mRNA-translation repressor, eIF4A2 in early KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma leads to a dysregulated protein synthesis landscape characterised by a strongly upregulated secretome, enlarged secretory compartments, increased oxidative metabolism and acquisition of senescence-like characteristics. Paradoxically, this overdriven protein synthesis landscape delays tumorigenesis and leads to appearance of clusters of non-proliferative, p21-positive KRAS-expressing cells in the lung. Administration of rapamycin to reduce mRNA translation suppresses senescence and restores tumorigenesis following eIF4A2 deletion. Importantly, some eIF4A2 knockout cells overcome senescence to form tumours that exhibit enhanced MAP-kinase signalling and, in contrast to eIF4A2+/+ lesions, these may be eradicated by administration of a MEK inhibitor. Thus, dysregulated mRNA translation exposes a potential therapeutic vulnerability in KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma by forcing cancer cells to rely on MEK signalling.

Statement of significanceThe requirement for anabolism in cancers has led to the search for inhibitors of mRNA translation as anti-cancer agents. However, we report that increased rates of mRNA translation promote a senescence-like phenotype in KRAS-driven lung cancer which delays tumorigenesis and renders the resulting tumours sensitive to MEK inhibition.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125983

Using C. elegans, we demonstrate that TC-NER deficiency leads to DNA damage-induced motoneuronal and developmental failure, primarily caused by the lack of lesion removal due to persistent lesion-stalling of RNA polymerase II. If, in the absence of TC-NER, lesion-stalled RNA polymerase II is processed and removed, global genome NER acts as backup pathway to repair transcription-blocking lesions and prevents DNA damage-induced developmental failure. Our results furthermore show that processing of lesion-stalled RNA Polymerase II facilitates TC-NER and involves the activity of multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases. These findings reveal that persistently stalled RNA polymerase II, rather than TC-NER deficiency, is the major driver of severe disease features associated with TC-NER defects.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125983

Molecular glue degraders (MGD) are monovalent small molecules that accomplish this by redirecting E3 ubiquitin ligases to target proteins, offering the potential to degrade previously unliganded and ""undruggable"" proteins in cancer, neurodegenerative, and other diseases. While attractive due to their drug-like properties, MGDs are exceptionally hard to discover and have largely been identified serendipitously. The Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase is the second most widely used effector for TPD, though current VHL-based degraders are primarily large heterobifunctional PROTACs (proteolysis-targeting chimeras) designed using target-based ligands. Here, we have instead pursued target-agnostic discovery of VHL MGDs leveraging proprietary ultra-miniaturized microfluidics devices (Picowells) to facilitate unbiased RNA-seq screening of a biased E3-focused library. This resulted in dGEM3, a novel VHL molecular glue that targets the survival of motor neuron (SMN) complex member GEMIN3 for degradation. Through a combination of cellular, biochemical, and biophysical assays, we have characterized the GEMIN3 degron within its helicase ATP-binding domain, and how the kinetics of ternary complex formation impact degradation.

Here, we demonstrate that SB431542, a selective TGF-{beta} receptor I (ALK5) inhibitor, exhibits potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 through unprecedented multitargeted mechanisms. Through comprehensive in vitro, and in silico analyses, we identified that SB431542 directly binds to SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and disrupt its canonical function in inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion. This restored lysosomal acidification and normalized perinuclear LAMP-1 localization, significantly impairing virion assembly as evidenced by disrupted nucleocapsid-RNA association and reduced intracellular viral titers. Additionally, SB431542 downregulated the CLEAR network genes responsible for lysosomal biogenesis, further restricting viral egress pathways. Our temporal analyses revealed that at later infection stages (36-48 hpi), SARS-CoV-2 exploits TGF-{beta}-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and apoptosis for viral release--processes effectively inhibited by SB431542 through suppression of GADD45b and BAX expression. These multiple mechanisms resulted in an exceptional EC50 of 515 nM against SARS-CoV-2. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in embryonated chicken eggs, where SB431542 conferred dose-dependent protection against lethal infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) challenge, with a favourable therapeutic index of 34.54. Remarkably, sequential passaging of SARS-CoV-2 for 50 generations under SB431542 selection pressure failed to generate resistant variants, contrasting sharply with the rapid resistance emergence typical of direct-acting antivirals. These findings establish SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor with a unique triple-mechanism approach that simultaneously targets viral entry via TGF-{beta}/Smad modulation, disrupts ORF3a-mediated lysosomal dysfunction affecting assembly, and attenuates TGF-{beta}-induced apoptosis during late-stage infection--collectively imposing multiple selective constraints that impede escape mutation development.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125983

Although sequence-based computational methods can excel at predicting TF binding sites, they often exhibit TF-specific performance biases and rely heavily on high-quality training data. Here, we propose a structure-guided approach using AlphaFold 3 (AF3) to model TF-DNA complexes for downstream biophysical evaluation with FoldX. We benchmark this method on a SNP-SELEX dataset in which reference and alternative DNA alleles are tested for differential TF binding in vitro. For each allele pair, we generate AF3 models and assess binding differences using FoldX-derived binding energy changes and AF3s interface predicted template modelling (ipTM) score. Across three TFs, SPIB, SF-1 (steroidogenic factor 1, encoded by NR5A1), and PAX5, differences in ipTM ({Delta}ipTM) often align with SNP-SELEX results, slightly surpassing energy-based metrics, although performance varies by TF, with notably poorer performance for PAX5. We further apply this approach to clinically relevant non-coding SNVs from published studies, accurately recapitulating 5 of 6 reported effects. These findings highlight the promise of highly interpretable structural modelling for non-coding variant interpretation, which could even encompass complex homomeric or heteromeric TF assemblies. AF3 provides robust TF-DNA complex structures that can capture subtle differences in binding induced by single-nucleotide changes. Augmented by biophysical binding evaluation, such an integrative approach can elucidate how non-coding variants affect TF binding and regulatory function.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125983

Bacterial Sec substrates fold outside the cell and often use DsbA-catalysed disulfide bond formation between cysteines to ensure correct folding. Extracellular protein misfolding triggers a stress response that involves production of dual function HtrA-family chaperone/proteases. In Gram-negative bacteria this is called the envelope stress response and in Gram-positive bacteria the secretion stress response, but the exact signals sensed by bacteria to trigger these stress responses are not well understood. In Streptomyces bacteria the secretion stress response is mediated by the CutRS and CssRS two-component systems which control the levels of four conserved HtrA-family chaperones. Here we show that the CutS sensor kinase contains two conserved cysteine residues in its extracellular sensor domain that control CutS activity. CssS also has two conserved and invariant cysteines in its sensor domain, and we propose that CutS and CssS detect the extracellular redox state and work together to ensure secreted proteins fold correctly in the fluctuating soil environment. Further analysis of ~12,800 genomes indicated that 98.9% of strains across all bacterial classes have at least one sensor kinase with two or more extracellular cysteine residues, suggesting that extracellular redox sensing by two-component systems is widespread in bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125983

We imaged pyramidal cells (PCs), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST), and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons (INs) and found that locomotion reduced firing in PCs and VIP INs while increasing activity in SST and PV cells. Prolonged optical depolarization experiments and simulations revealed that intracellular theta oscillations are predominantly driven by inhibitory inputs in PCs and VIP cells. Firing rate-laser intensity (F-I) curves revealed distinct gain modulation across cell types, with a divisive gain reduction in PC bursting during locomotion, while simple spikes are unaffected.

SVs can significantly affect gene function, but detecting and characterizing them is challenging, even with long-read sequencing. Moreover, traditional single-reference methods can fail to capture many genetic variants. Using long-reads, we generated a Capuchino Seedeater (Sporophila) pangenome, including 16 individuals from seven species, to investigate how SVs contribute to species and coloration differences. Leveraging this pangenome, we mapped short-read data from 127 individuals to perform FST scans and genome-wide association studies. Species divergence primarily arises from SNPs and indels (< 50 bp) in non-coding regions of melanin-related genes, as larger SVs rarely overlap with divergence peaks. One exception was a 55 bp deletion near the OCA2 and HERC2 genes, associated with feather pheomelanin content. These findings support the hypothesis that the reshuffling of small regulatory alleles, rather than larger species-specific mutations, accelerated plumage evolution leading to prezygotic isolation in Capuchinos.

All four primer sets effectively amplified cetacean DNA from tissue samples. However, in the aquarium pool tests, three primer sets failed to accurately identify one or more cetacean species due to a lack of interspecific variation within the amplified region.

ExposuresDiagnostic MRI imaging was scored using PI-RADS v2.

Main outcomes and measuresPrimary outcomes were PCSM, OS, MFS, and BCR. Secondary measures included clinical confounders, such as age, Grade Group (GG), and Charlsons Comorbidity Index (CCI).

In multivariable Cox regression adjusted for clinical confounders, PI-RADS score 5 was significantly associated with PCSM (Hazard Ratio (HR) 18.4, 95% CI [6.62-51.1], p<0.001), along with biopsy GG 5 (HR 5.45 [1.82-16.3], p=0.002), CCI (HR 1.53 [1.42-1.7], p<0.001), and log2-PSA (HR 1.28 [1.11-1.5], p<0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated negligible PCSM after negative MRI (PI-RADS score 0-2) (log-rank p<0.001). PI-RADS score 5 was associated with OS in both the Helsinki and Tampere cohorts (p<0.001) and MFS and BCR in the Lille cohort (p<0.001).

Conclusion and relevancePI-RADS score 5 is strongly associated with an increased risk of PCSM and other clinically relevant outcomes. Conversely, a non-suspicious MRI presents a negligible risk of adverse outcomes. These findings support the use of MRI for risk stratification in PCa.","NA","medrxiv",1742854125983

Yet most milk research focuses on humans, or domesticated mammals that are historically poor in milk oligosaccharide complexity. Here, we perform an exhaustive mass spectrometry-driven structural characterization of milk oligosaccharides in a wild mammal, Atlantic grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), throughout their lactation period. Characterizing and quantifying 332 milk oligosaccharides, including 166 novel structures, we reveal seals to rival human milk in complexity, with seal free oligosaccharides reaching unprecedented 28 monosaccharides in size. Glycomics and metabolomics time course analysis establishes a concerted regulatory process reshaping the seal milk glycome throughout lactation,similar as in human milk. Functional analysis of herein newly characterized structures reveals anti-biofilm effects and immunomodulatory functions of seal milk oligosaccharides. We envision these findings to overturn long-held assumptions about milk complexity of non-human mammals and enable insights into the functional relevance of complex carbohydrates in breast milk.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125983

Genetically encoded oscillators (GEOs) built from bacterial MinDE-family ATPase and Activator modules generate fast orthogonal protein waves in eukaryotic cells, providing an experimental model system for genetic and biochemical coordination of synthetic protein dynamics. Here, we use budding yeast to experimentally define and model phase portraits that reveal how the breadth of frequencies and amplitudes available to a GEO are genetically controlled by ATPase and Activator expression levels and noise. GEO amplitude is encoded by ATPase absolute abundance, making it sensitive to extrinsic noise on a population level. In contrast, GEO frequency is remarkably stable because it is controlled by the Activator:ATPase ratio and thus affected primarily by intrinsic noise. These features facilitate noise-guided design of different expression strategies that act as filters on GEO waveform, enabling us to construct clonal populations that oscillate at different frequencies as well as independently tune frequency and amplitude variation within a single population. By characterizing 169 biochemically distinct GEOs, we provide a rich assortment of phase portraits as starting points for application of our waveform engineering approach. Our findings suggest noise-guided design may be a valuable strategy for achieving precision control over dynamic protein circuits.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125983

We analysed haplotype sharing among 858,635 modern individuals from Denmark and Britain to infer migration history from the Middle Ages to the modern day. We estimated the genetic relationship among 370,259 Danes using Danish healthcare registries and validated those with retrievable pedigree relationships from a national family registry. We also compared their IBD sharing with 488,376 British individuals from the UK Biobank.

Our analysis revealed the fine-grained population genetic history of Denmark and identified distinct coastal and island communities with a history of genetic isolation and bottlenecks. We observed a significant population decline in Jutland compared to Zealand during the late medieval period to the start of early modern period, accompanied by migration from Jutland to Zealand, corresponding to historical evidence.

We identified two major IBD sharing patterns between Denmark and Great Britain: early coast-to-coast connections between South Jutland and eastern England, likely driven by Viking settlements, continuous trade and people movements across the North Sea from the Middle Ages through early modern times, and later city-to-city connections such as those between London and Kobenhavn likely influenced by urbanisation and Industrial Revolution. Further comparisons using other North Sea countries showed both shared and unique histories of genetic exchange with Denmark and Britain.

Our study provides novel genetic evidence of migration across the North Sea from the Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution. It highlights the power of nationwide biobanks in reconstructing fine-scale historical population movements among closely related populations.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125983

To improve the efficiency of this process and accelerate the development of new mAbs, we characterized and isolated antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) from the spleen of immunized mice before cell fusion. This approach resulted in a high yield of hybridoma generation by increasing the probability of successive pairing between the most suitable cell fusion partners. Specifically, we developed an optimized workflow combining Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) with antibody secretion assays, using a panel of five cell-surface markers (CD3, TACI, CD138, MHC-II, and B220) that allowed us to identify a particular ASC subset with key characteristics. Such ASCs exhibited a plasmablast phenotype with high MHC-II expression and secreted high levels of Ag-specific antibodies in immunized mice. These features were also found in hybridomas, suggesting a preferential fusion of myeloma cells with this ASCs subset. Finally, the targeted electrofusion of TACIhighCD138high sorted ASCs led to a 100% fusion yield compared to a non-targeted approach. In particular, over 60% of these generated hybridomas secreted Ag-specific mAbs. Collectively, these results pave the way for a highly efficient method to produce new mAbs by cell fusion, which could facilitate hybridoma generation and expand therapeutic applications of mAbs.","NA","biorxiv",1742854125983

While COVID-19 exacerbated the decline in routine vaccination through disruption of healthcare services and the diversion of resources, factors including vaccine hesitancy, socioeconomic disparities and vaccine policy also contribute to changes in vaccination behavior. Understanding the factors that influence vaccination choice is necessary to develop effective public health policy.

MethodsWe collect county-level MMR vaccination rates for kindergarten children from 2017 - 2024 for 2,266 U.S. counties, evaluate coverage patterns and trends before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and implement multivariable weighted logistic regression models to identify factors associated with low and declining MMR vaccination rates in U.S. counties.

FindingsWe reveal a nationwide decline in MMR rates following the COVID-19 pandemic, with declines observed in 1,688 of the counties evaluated. We find state-level non-medical exemption (NME) policies to be strongly associated with low and declining MMR rates. We identify a positive association in vaccination rates across vaccine types. We find higher MMR rates are positively associated with Republican-aligned counties and declines in MMR rates to be positively associated with COVID-19 death rates.

InterpretationThe significant association between NMEs and low and declining MMR rates suggest these state level policies are harmful and reduce vaccination coverage. The positive associations among vaccine types suggest spillover effects in vaccine seeking behavior. The association between MMR rates and Republican-aligned counties contrast COVID-19 vaccination patterns, highlighting the complex nature of political polarization on vaccine-related behavior, while the association between MMR declines and COVID-19 death rate reveals an additional burden posed by the pandemic.

While highly processed food like packaged products, processed meat, and sweetened soft drinks have been increasingly associated with unhealthy diet, information on the degree of processing characterizing an item in a store is not straight forward to obtain, limiting the ability of individuals to make informed choices. Here we introduce GroceryDB, a database with over 50,000 food items sold by Walmart, Target, and Wholefoods, unveiling how big data can be harnessed to empower consumers and policymakers with systematic access to the degree of processing of the foods they select, and the potential alternatives in the surrounding food environment. The extensive data gathered on ingredient lists and nutrition facts enables a large-scale analysis of ingredient patterns and degrees of processing, categorized by store, food category, and price range. Our findings reveal that the degree of food processing varies significantly across different food categories and grocery stores. Furthermore, this data allows us to quantify the individual contribution of over 1,000 ingredients to ultra-processing. GroceryDB and the associated http://TrueFood.Tech/ website make this information accessible, guiding consumers toward less processed food choices while assisting policymakers in reforming the food supply.","NA","medrxiv",1742854125983
