In this context, windborne transmission, the idea that the virus can travel through the air over considerable distances, is a contentious concept and, documented cases are rare. Here, though, we provide genetic evidence supporting the feasibility of windborne transmission. During the 2023-24 HPAI season, molecular surveillance identified identical H5N1 strains among a cluster of unrelated commercial farms about 8 km apart in the Czech Republic. The episode started with the abrupt mortality of fattening ducks on one farm and was followed by disease outbreaks at two nearby high-biosecurity chicken farms. Using genetic, epizootiological, meteorological and geographical data, we reconstructed a mosaic of events strongly suggesting wind was the mechanism of infection transmission between poultry in at least two independent cases. By aligning the genetic and meteorological data with critical outbreak events, we determined the most likely time window during which the transmission occurred and inferred the sequence of infected houses at the recipient sites. Our results suggest that the contaminated plume emitted from the infected fattening duck farm was the critical medium of HPAI transmission, rather than the dust generated during depopulation. Furthermore, they also strongly implicate the role of confined mechanically-ventilated buildings with high population densities in facilitating windborne transmission and propagating virus concentrations below the minimum infectious dose at the recipient sites. These findings underscore the importance of considering windborne spread in future outbreak mitigation strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

To visualize membrane dynamics before, during, and right after vesicle fusion at central synapses under near-native conditions, we developed an experimental strategy for time-resolved in situ cryo-electron tomography with millisecond temporal resolution. We coupled optogenetic stimulation with cryofixation and confirmed the stimulation-induced release of neurotransmitters via cryo-confocal microscopy of a fluorescent glutamate sensor. Our morphometric analysis of tomograms from stimulated and control synapses allowed us to characterize five states of vesicle fusion intermediates ranging from stalk formation to the formation, opening, and collapsing of a fusion pore. Based on these measurements, we generated a coarse-grained simulation of a synaptic vesicle approaching the active zone membrane. Both, our morphofunctional and computational analyses, support a model in which calcium-triggered fusion is initiated from synaptic vesicles in close proximity to the active zone membrane, whereby neither tight docking nor an induction of membrane curvature at the active zone are favorable. Numbers of filamentous tethers closely correlated to the distance between vesicle and membrane, but not to their respective fusion readiness, indicating that the formation of multiple tethers is required for synaptic vesicle recruitment preceding fusion.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

How these clusters interact with genes and their impact on transcriptional activity remain heavily debated. Here we take advantage of the naturally occurring increase in transcriptional activity during Zygotic Genome Activation (ZGA) in Drosophila melanogaster embryos to characterize the functional roles of RNAPII clusters in a developmental context. Using single-molecule tracking and lattice light-sheet microscopy, we find that RNAPII cluster formation depends on transcription initiation and that cluster lifetimes are reduced upon transcription elongation. We show that single clusters are stably associated with active gene loci during transcription and that cluster intensities are strongly correlated with transcriptional output. Our data suggest that prior to ZGA, RNAPII clusters prime genes for activation, whereas after ZGA, clusters are composed mostly of elongating molecules at individual genes.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

Clearance occurs through both protein degradation and growth-dependent dilution. At slow growth, clearance is dominated by degradation, which leads to the accumulation of long lived proteins. At fast growth, however, it is dominated by dilution, preventing this accumulation. Thus, the concentration of long lived proteins will be reduced unless cells compensate by preferentially increasing synthesis rates. To determine the dominant regulatory mechanisms, we quantified the degree of compensation between activated and resting human B cells and across mouse tissues. The results indicate that growth-dependent dilution is insufficiently compensated for by changes in protein synthesis, and it accounts for over a third of the concentration changes between high and low growth conditions. Furthermore, we find that about 25 % of the differences in protein concentration across all tissues are controlled by protein clearance. When comparing only slowly growing tissues such as the brain and pancreas, clearance differences can explain as much as 42 %. Within a tissue or cell type, clearance variation is sufficient to account for 50 % of the abundance variation for all measured proteins at slow growth, contrasted with 7 % at fast growth. Thus, our model unifies previous observations with our new results and highlights a context-dependent and larger than previously appreciated contribution of protein degradation in shaping protein variation both across the proteome and across cell states.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

Owing to its high throughput and gentle, volumetric imaging nature, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is an attractive modality to image such samples. However, the orthogonal dual-objective geometry of LSFM makes sample mounting challenging. Oblique plane microscopy (OPM) circumvents these issues by achieving light-sheet imaging through a single objective near the sample, with a further two objectives acting to image a tilted, oblique plane in the specimen. However, at low magnification, as required for mesoscopic imaging, conventional OPM systems suffer from a complicated and inefficient light path and/or a limited numerical aperture. Here we present a simple method for mesoscopic OPM that enables efficient light collection at any numerical aperture. By placing the camera directly in the remote space, the oblique plane can be imaged without the need for a third microscope system. Using a commercially available camera with 1.4 m pixels, we demonstrate imaging over a 5.3 x 3 x 2.6 mm3 field of view with a lateral resolution of ~2 m and axial resolution of ~22 m. Our technique is then used to image a 4x-expanded brain organoid.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

Although they share a common evolutionary origin with modern-day plants and display complex multicellular development, we still lack comprehensive genome data from the most highly-evolved groups of red algae. Here, we present a chromosome-level genome assembly of Bostrychia moritziana, a species that is classified into the Rhodomelaceae family of the Ceramiales order, both of which constitute the largest and most diverse family and order of red algae, respectively. Contrary to the commonly held view that red algae generally have small genomes, we report significant genome size expansion in Bostrychia and other Ceramiales species, which we posit as one of at least three independent genome expansion events that occurred during red algal evolution. Our analyses suggest that these expansions do not involve polyploidy or ancient whole genome duplications, but in the case of Bostrychia appear to be largely driven by the dramatic proliferation of a single lineage of giant Plavaka DNA transposons. Consistent with increased genome size, we identify a substantial increase in gene content in Bostrychia that was shaped both by de novo gene emergence and by the amplification of gene families in common with other Ceramiales seaweeds, providing key insight into the genetic adaptations underpinning the evolutionary success of this species-rich order. Finally, our sex-specific assemblies enabled us to resolve the UV sex chromosomes in Bostrychia, which feature expanded gene-rich sex-linked regions. Notably, these sex-linked regions each harbour a distinct TALE-HD transcription factor orthologous to ancient regulators of haploid-diploid transitions in other multicellular lineages. Together, our findings offer a unique perspective of the genomic adaptations driving red algal diversity and demonstrate how this highly successful group of red seaweeds can provide insight into the evolutionary origins and universal principles of complex multicellular plant life.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

Previous studies have shown that many IC neurons exhibit receptive fields for individual features of auditory stimuli, such as sound frequency, intensity, and location, but growing evidence suggests that some IC neurons may multiplex features of sound. Here, we used in vivo juxtacellular recordings in awake, head-fixed mice to examine how IC neurons responded to frequency-modulated sweeps that varied in speed, direction, intensity, and frequency range. We then applied machine learning methods to determine how individual IC neurons encode features of FM sweeps. We found that individual IC neurons multiplex FM sweep features using various strategies including spike timing, distribution of inter-spike intervals, and first spike latency. In addition, we found that decoding accuracy for sweep direction can vary with sweep speed and frequency range, suggesting the presence of mixed selectivity in single neurons. Accordingly, using static receptive fields for direction alone yielded poor predictions of neuron responses to vocalizations that contain simple frequency changes. Lastly, we showed that encoding strategies varied across individual neurons, resulting in a highly informative population response for FM sweep features. Together, our results suggest that multiplexing sound features is a common mechanism used by IC neurons to represent complex sounds.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

The replication and segregation of elements integrated into the host chromosome are ensured by the host life cycle. In contrast, the persistence of autonomously replicating elements relies on their ability to remain within the host population. Here, we assess the evolutionary success of different persistence strategies of prokaryotic plasmids. Through intracellular competitions between plasmid genotypes, we find that combining active partitioning during cell division with a toxin-antitoxin (TA) system for post-segregational killing is more effective than either strategy alone. Mathematical modeling of long-term plasmid evolution, calibrated with empirical plasmid persistence probabilities, further supports these findings. A survey of enterobacterial genomes indicates that partitioning and TA systems are core features of large conjugative plasmids. Indeed, we confirm the presence of a previously unrecognized type I TA system in IncX3 plasmids, which serve as important vectors of antibiotic resistance in human pathogens. These findings suggest that large conjugative plasmids likely encode TA systems, including those yet to be identified. The combination of TA and partitioning systems emerges as the most effective strategy for the persistence of low-copy extrachromosomal elements with unstable segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

We developed RAD51 proximity identification sequencing (RaPID-seq), a sensitive method that marks all candidate templates searched by RAD51. We find that HDR is hierarchical, such that DSB proximity determines template candidacy and subsequent recombination is unlocked by DSB/template homology.

To investigate how animals perceive these intermittent cues, we developed a behavioral task in which head-restrained mice made binary decisions based on the total number of discrete odor pulses presented stochastically over several seconds. Mice readily learned this task, and their performance was well-described by widely used decision models. Logistic regression of binary choices against the timing of odor pulses within the respiratory cycle revealed that mice placed higher perceptual weight to stimuli arriving during inhalation than exhalation, a phase dependency that strongly correlated with the magnitude of responses in olfactory sensory neurons. The population response of anterior piriform cortex (APCx) neurons to odor pulses was also modulated by respiration phase, although individual neurons displayed varying levels of phase-dependence. Single APCx neurons responded stochastically and transiently to odor pulses, leading to a representation that carries signatures of sensory evidence, but not its accumulation. Our study reveals that mice can integrate intermittent odor signals across dozens of breaths, but respiratory modulation of sensory inputs imposes limits on information acquisition that cortical circuits cannot overcome to improve behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

CRISPR-based genetic screens have proven invaluable in elucidating gene function in mammalian cells. Single-cell functional genomics methods, such as Perturb-seq and Spear-ATAC, have made it possible to achieve high-throughput mapping of the functional effects of gene perturbations by profiling transcriptomes and DNA accessibility, respectively. Combining single-cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic data via multiomic approaches has facilitated the discovery of novel cis and gene regulatory interactions. However, pseudobulk readouts from cell populations can often cloud the interpretation of results due to a heterogeneous response from cells receiving the same genetic perturbation, which could be mitigated by using transcriptional profiles of single cells to subset the ATAC-seq data. Existing methods to capture CRISPR guide RNAs to simultaneously assess the impact of genetic perturbations on RNA and ATAC profiles require either cloning of gRNA libraries in specialized vectors or implementing complex protocols with multiple rounds of barcoding. Here, we introduce CAT-ATAC, a technique that adds CRISPR gRNA capture to the existing 10X Genomics Multiome assay, generating paired transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and perturbation identity data from the same individual cells. We demonstrate up to 77% guide capture efficiency for both arrayed and pooled delivery of lentiviral gRNAs in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and cancer cell lines. This capability allows us to construct gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in cells under drug and genetic perturbations. By applying CAT-ATAC, we were able to identify a GRN associated with dasatinib resistance, indirectly activated by the HIC2 gene. Using loss of function experiments, we further validated that the gene, ZFPM2, a component of the predicted GRN, also contributes to dasatinib resistance. CAT-ATAC can thus be used to generate high-content multidimensional genotype-phenotype maps to reveal novel gene and cellular interactions and functions.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

RAD51 showed two-tiered accumulation around DSBs, with a broad (~Mb) domain arising from the homology search. This domain is regulated by cohesin unloader, is constrained by TAD boundaries, and it overlaps with chromatin regions reeled through the break-anchored loop, suggesting that loop extrusion regulates the homology search. Indeed, depletion of NIPBL results in reduced HR, and this effect is more pronounced when the HR donor is far (~100 kb) from the break. Our data indicates that loop-extruding cohesin promotes the mammalian homology search by facilitating break-chromatin interactions within the damaged TAD.

Many redundant muscle patterns can solve a given task, and this high dimensionality allows flexibility but poses a problem for efficient learning. Although a feasible solution invokes subcortical innate motor patterns, or primitives, to reduce the dimensionality of the control problem, how cortex learns to utilize such primitives remains an open question. To address this, we studied cortical and subcortical interactions as head-fixed mice learned contextual control of innate hindlimb extension behavior. Naive mice performed reactive extensions to turn off a cold air stimulus within seconds and, using predictive cues, learned to avoid the stimulus altogether in tens of trials. Optogenetic inhibition of large areas of rostral cortex completely prevented avoidance behavior, but did not impair hindlimb extensions in reaction to the cold air stimulus. Remarkably, mice covertly learned to avoid the cold stimulus even without any prior experience of successful, cortically-mediated avoidance. These findings support a dynamic, heterarchical model in which the dominant locus of control can change, on the order of seconds, between cortical and subcortical brain areas. We propose that cortex can leverage periods when subcortex predominates as demonstrations, to learn parameterized control of innate behavioral primitives.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

Currently, little is known about the internal signals regulating haustorium development. Here, we identify root meristem growth factor (RGF) peptides in Phtheirospermum japonicum as endogenous inducers of prehaustorium formation. Treatment with specific RGF peptides in the absence of hosts triggered prehaustoria and induced expression of PjYUC3, a gene required for auxin biosynthesis and prehaustorium formation. CRISPR-mediated knockouts showed that PjRGFR1 and PjRGFR3, receptors activated by the haustorium specific RGF peptides PjRGF2 and PjRGF5, are essential for prehaustorium formation, revealing functional redundancy. Phylogenic analyses indicate that PjRGF2 is broadly conserved among Orobanchaceae, whereas PjRGF5 appears to have recently evolved through tandem multiplication and neofunctionalization. Our findings establish RGF peptides and their corresponding receptors as critical components of haustorium developmental signaling and provide insights into the evolutionary trajectories that shape plant parasitism.

Advances in long-read sequencing have allowed highly accurate TE detection, though at a higher cost than short-read sequencing. Recent studies using long reads have shown that existing short-read TE detection methods perform inadequately when applied to real data. In this study, we use a machine learning approach (called TEforest) to discover and genotype TE insertions and deletions with short-read data by using TEs detected from long-read genome assemblies as training data. Our method first uses a highly sensitive algorithm to discover potential TE insertion or deletion sites in the genome, extracting relevant features from short-read alignments. To discriminate between true and false TE insertions, we train a random forest model with a labeled ground-truth dataset for which we have calculated the same set of short-read features. We conduct a comprehensive benchmark of TEforest and traditional TE detection methods using real data, finding that TEforest identifies more true positives and fewer false positives across datasets with different read lengths and coverages, while also accurately inferring genotypes and the precise breakpoints of insertions. By learning short-read signatures of TEs previously only discoverable using long reads, our approach bridges the gap between large-scale population genetic studies and the accuracy of long-read assemblies. This work provides a user-friendly tool to study the prevalence and phenotypic effects of TE insertions across the genome.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1739484487230

While many network models have been proposed to describe connectome communication, current approaches assume that every pair of neural elements communicates according to the same principle. Connectomes, however, are heterogeneous networks, comprising elements with varied topological and neurobiological makeups. In this paper, we investigate how connectome architecture may facilitate different signalling regimes depending on the topological embedding of communicating neural elements. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that the modular structure of brain networks fosters a dual mode of communication balancing diffusion-passive signal broadcasting - and routing - selective transmission via efficient paths. To this end, we introduce the relative diffusion score (RDS), a measure to quantify the proportional capacity for network communication via diffusion versus routing. We examined the interplay between RDS and connectome architecture in 6 organisms spanning a wide range of spatial resolutions and connectivity mapping techniques - from the complete nervous system of the larval fly to the inter-areal human connectome. Our analyses establish multiple lines of evidence suggesting that connectomes may be universally organised to support within-module diffusion and between-module routing. Using a series of rewiring null models, we untangle the contributions of connectome topology and geometry to the relationship between routing, diffusion and modular architecture. In conclusion, our work puts forth a hybrid conceptualisation of neural communication, in which diffusion contributes to functional segregation by concentrating information within localised clusters, while specialised signal routes enable fast, long-range and cross-system functional integration.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

To combat this issue, the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI) has generated an iPSC repository using a single clonal reference line, KOLF2.1J, into which disease-causing mutations and revertants are introduced via gene editing.

However, they also increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods: We consider genetic variants in the region of the HMGCR gene, which encodes the target of statins, and their associations with downstream consequences of statins. We use various statistical methods to identify causal pathways influencing CAD and T2D, and investigate whether these are the same or different for the two diseases. Results: Colocalization analyses indicated that LDL-C and body mass index (BMI) have distinct genetic predictors in this gene region, suggesting that they do not lie on the same causal pathway. Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses restricted to variants in the HMGCR gene region revealed LDL-C and BMI as causal risk factors for CAD, and BMI as a causal risk factor for T2D, but not LDL-C. A Bayesian model averaging method prioritized BMI as the most likely causal risk factor for T2D, and LDL-C as the second most likely causal risk factor for CAD (behind ubiquinone). Colocalization analyses provided consistent evidence of LDL-C colocalizing with CAD, and BMI colocalizing with T2D; evidence was inconsistent for colocalization of LDL-C with T2D, and BMI with CAD. Conclusions: Our analyses suggest cardiovascular and metabolic consequences of statin usage are on different causal pathways, and hence could be influenced separately by targeted interventions. More broadly, our analysis workflow offers potential insights to identify pathway-specific causal risk factors that could provide possible repositioning or refinement opportunities for existing drug targets.","NA","medrxiv",1739484487230

However, conventional spike sorting methods are highly fragmented, labor-intensive, and heavily reliant on expert manual curation, limiting their scalability and reproducibility. This challenge has become more pressing with advances in neural recording technology, such as high-density Neuropixels for large-scale neural recording or flexible electrodes for long-term stable recording over months to years. The volume and complexity of these datasets make manual curation infeasible, requiring an automated and scalable solution. Here, we introduce SpikeAgent, a multimodal large language model (LLM)-based AI agent that automates and standardizes the entire spike sorting pipeline. Unlike traditional approaches, SpikeAgent integrates multiple LLM backends, coding functions, and established algorithms, autonomously performing spike sorting with reasoning-based decision-making and real-time interaction with intermediate results. It generates interpretable reports, providing transparent justifications for each sorting decision, enhancing transparency and reliability. We benchmarked SpikeAgent against human experts across various neural recording technology, demonstrating its versatility and ability to achieve curation consistency that are equal to, or even higher than human experts. It also drastically reduces the expertise barrier and accelerates the curation and validation time by orders of magnitude. Moreover, it enables automated interpretability of the neural spiking data, which cannot be achieved by any conventional methods.

However, while Bayesian integration provides a powerful explanatory framework, the question remains as to what extent it explains human behaviour in naturalistic situations, including more complex movements and distributions. Here, we examine whether humans can learn bimodal priors in a complex sensorimotor task: returning tennis serves. Participants returned serves in an immersive virtual reality setup with realistic movements and spatiotemporal task demands matching those in real tennis. The location of the opponent's serves followed a bimodal distribution. We manipulated visual uncertainty through three levels of ball speeds: slow, moderate, and fast. After extensive exposure to the opponent's serves, participants' movements were biased by the bimodal prior distribution. As predicted by Bayesian theory, the magnitude of the bias depends on visual uncertainty. Additionally, our data indicate that participants' movements in this complex task were not only biased by prior expectations but also by biomechanical constraints and associated motor costs. Intriguingly, an explicit knowledge test after the experiment revealed that, despite incorporating prior knowledge of the opponent's serve distribution into their behaviour, participants were not explicitly aware of the pattern.

MRSA strains are resistant to front-line beta-lactams due to PBP2a, a low-affinity penicillin-binding protein encoded by mecA. Daptomycin is used to treat MRSA infections but is not always effective and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Understanding why daptomycin fails is crucial to devising strategies to improve treatment outcomes. Here, using a panel of clinical bacteraemia isolates, we show that MRSA strains are less susceptible to daptomycin than methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) strains. This difference in susceptibility was due to mecA and was independent of any changes in surface properties previously associated with altered daptomycin susceptibility. Instead, using a mecA transposon mutant, we found that a lack of this gene led to higher activity of the Agr quorum sensing system, resulting in an increased release of the phenol-soluble modulin toxins. Increased levels of these surfactant-like toxins prevented daptomycin from being inactivated by lipids released by the bacteria, leading to enhanced susceptibility to the antibiotic. Additionally, the clinical MRSA strains tested produced lower levels of toxins than the MSSA strains and inactivated daptomycin to a greater extent, explaining their reduced susceptibility. Expression of mecA in clinical MSSA strains reduced toxin production, increasing daptomycin inactivation and thereby enhancing survival. Together, these results demonstrate that mecA does not only affect beta-lactam susceptibility but also compromises the efficacy of the last resort antibiotic daptomycin.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

Here, we introduce MicroSplit, a computational multiplexing technique based on deep learning that allows multiple cellular structures to be imaged in a single fluorescent channel and then unmix them by computational means, allowing faster imaging and reduced photon exposure. We show that MicroSplit efficiently separates up to four superimposed noisy structures into distinct denoised fluorescent image channels. Furthermore, using Variational Splitting Encoder-Decoder (VSE) networks, our approach can sample diverse predictions from a trained posterior of solutions. The diversity of these samples scales with the uncertainty in a given input, allowing us to estimate the true prediction errors by computing the variability between posterior samples. We demonstrate the robustness of MicroSplit across various datasets and noise levels and show its utility to image more, to image faster, and to improve downstream analysis. We provide MicroSplit along with all associated training and evaluation datasets as open resources, enabling life scientists to immediately benefit from the potential of computational multiplexing and thus help accelerate the rate of their scientific discovery process.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

Through four experiments with 123 young non-musicians, integrating eye-tracking, neurophysiological recordings, white matter structural imaging, and behavioral analysis, we reveal a previously unrecognized form of synchronization: spontaneous eye blinks synchronize with musical beats. Blinks robustly synchronized with beats across a range of tempi and independently of melodic cues. EEG recordings revealed a dynamic correspondence between blink timing and neural beat tracking. Individual differences in blink synchronization were linked to white matter microstructure variation in the left arcuate fasciculus, a key sensorimotor pathway. Additionally, the strength of blink synchronization reflected the modulation of dynamic auditory attention. These findings establish blink synchronization as a novel behavioral paradigm, expanding the auditory-motor synchronization repertoire and highlighting the intricate interplay between music rhythms and oculomotor activity. This discovery underscores a cross-modal active sensing mechanism, offering new insights into embodied music perception, rhythm processing, and their potential clinical applications.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

Crusty is capable of utilizing many sources of carbon and nitrogen and is resistant to multiple metals and UV-C due to its melanized cell wall. We were unable to recover a Pinky-free culture of Crusty via usage of antibiotics. However, when exposed to antibiotics that kill or stop the growth of the Pinky, growth of Crusty is significantly stunted, implying that actively growing Pinky symbionts are needed for Crusty's optimal growth. The Crusty-Pinky symbiosis also seems to be able to perform active metabolism in carbonless and nitrogenless medium, which we believe is due to Pinky's ability to perform aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis. Finally, Pinky was identified as being capable of growth stimulation of the algae Chlorella sorokiniana, indicating that Pinky likely produces cytokinins or auxins which Methylobacterium are known for. Features of this symbiosis provide us insight into the ecological roles of these microbes within the biological soil crust.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

We reveal that such Bt spore/toxin biofilms are embedded in a fibrous extrasporal matrix (ESM), and using cryoID, we resolved the structure and molecular identity of an uncharacterized type of pili, referred to here as Fibrillar ENdospore Appendages or  F-ENA. F-ENA are monomolecular protein polymers tethered to the exosporium of Bt and are decorated with a flexible tip fibrillum. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that F-ENA is widespread not only in the class Bacilli, but also in the class Clostridia, and the cryoEM structures of F-ENA filaments from Bacillus, Anaerovorax and Paenibaccilus reveal subunits with a generic head-neck domain structure, where the {beta}-barrel neck of variable length latch onto a preceding head domain through short N-terminal hook peptides. In Bacillus, two collagen-like proteins (CLP) respectively tether F-ENA to the exosporium (F-Anchor), or constitute the tip fibrillum at the distal terminus of F-ENA (F-BclA).

Here, we introduce sister-pore-C, a high-resolution method for mapping intra- and trans-molecular interactions in replicated chromosomes. We show that DSBs reshape chromosome architecture by recruiting two functionally distinct pools of cohesin. Loop-forming cohesin accumulates across a megabase-scale domain to control homology sampling within topologically associating domains (TADs) surrounding the break site, while cohesive cohesin concentrates at the break site to tether broken ends to the sister chromatid. This dual mechanism restricts the homology search space, highlighting how chromosome conformation helps preserve genomic integrity.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

One physiological change during the vertebrate stress response is the release of glucocorticoid hormones. Here, we measured plasma corticosterone in female domesticated budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) to test whether human presence, restraint, or removal and return of a newly stressed neighbor increases corticosterone. The presence of humans for 15 minutes at the beginning of the experiment did not significantly elevate corticosterone above baseline levels, suggesting that birds that acclimate to humans are minimally affected by their presence. However, at the end of the experiment after multiple blood sampling events, the same human presence test significantly elevated corticosterone above baseline and human presence levels measured at the beginning of the experiment. Thus, repeated blood sampling could cause progressively stronger stress responses to human presence. Restraint-induced corticosterone levels were significantly higher than all other treatments, indicating that human handling activates the stress response. After stressed birds were returned home, corticosterone levels of their neighbors were significantly higher than baseline at 25- and 45-minutes post-return. However, the 25- and 45-minute corticosterone levels were not significantly different from each other, or levels induced by human presence at the beginning or end of the experiment. This outcome suggests that social transmission of stress was limited across the sampled time frame. These data highlight the importance of evaluating the costs and benefits of different human-animal interactions in captivity, including in domesticated species that are more tolerant of forced proximity to humans.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

Although recent breakthroughs in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled high-quality reconstruction of numerous complex biomolecules, the resolution of bound ligands is often relatively poor. Furthermore, automated methods for building and refining molecular models into cryo-EM maps have largely focused on proteins and may not be optimized for the diverse properties of small-molecule ligands. Here, we present an approach that integrates generative artificial intelligence (AI) with cryo-EM density-guided simulations to fit ligands into experimental maps. Using three inputs: 1) a protein amino acid sequence, 2) a ligand specification, and 3) an experimental cryo-EM map, we validated our approach on a set of biomedically relevant protein-ligand complexes including kinases, GPCRs, and solute transporters, none of which were present in the AI training data. In cases for which generative AI was not sufficient to predict experimental poses outright, integration of flexible fitting into molecular dynamics simulations improved ligand model-to-map cross-correlation relative to the deposited structure from 40-71% to 82-95%. This work offers a straightforward template for integrating generative AI and density-guided simulations to automate model building in cryo-EM maps of ligand-protein complexes, with potential applications for characterization and design of novel modulators and drugs.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

Members of the recently identified family of bridge-like lipid transfer proteins (BLTPs) span opposing membranes at these contact sites to enable the rapid transfer of bulk lipids between organelles. While the VPS13 and ATG2 family members use organelle-specific adaptors for membrane targeting, the mechanisms that regulate other bridge-like transporters remain unknown. Here, we identify the conserved protein Ybl086c, which we name Hoi1 (Hob interactor 1), as an adaptor that targets the yeast BLTP2-like proteins Fmp27/Hob1 and Hob2 to ER-PM contact sites. Two separate Hoi1 domains interface with alpha-helical projections that decorate the central hydrophobic channel on Fmp27, and loss of these interactions disrupts cellular sterol homeostasis. The mutant phenotypes of BLTP2 and HOI1 orthologs indicate these proteins act in a shared pathway in worms and flies. Together, this suggests that Hoi1-mediated recruitment of BLTP2-like proteins represents an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for regulating lipid transport at membrane contact sites.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

Materials and methodsThis retrospective study utilized electronic health record data from OneFlorida+ (2015-2024). Adults eligible for AOMs were included, defined as having a BMI [&ge;]30 kg/m{superscript 2} or a BMI of 27-29.9 kg/m{superscript 2} with at least one obesity-related comorbidity. The primary outcome was the initiation of newer AOMs, specifically glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) including liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide. Trends across years were examined, and a multivariable logistic regression identified sociodemographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors associated with AOM initiation.

ResultsOf 319,949 adults, 1.8% initiated newer AOMs. Semaglutide accounted for 77.9% of initiations, tirzepatide 19.7%, and liraglutide 17.8%. Initiation trends showed liraglutide uptake peaked at 5% in 2018 but declined afterward, while semaglutide and tirzepatide uptake increased exponentially since 2022. Odds of initiation were lower for Black (aOR (95% CI): 0.87 [0.80- 0.94]) and Hispanic (0.84 [0.78-0.91]) groups vs. Whites, and for Medicaid (0.69 [0.63-0.76]) and uninsured (0.81 [0.74-0.87]) patients vs. privately insured. Higher odds were associated with being female, middle-aged, having more outpatient visits, and visiting endocrinologists.

ConclusionsThe initiation of newer AOMs among overweight and obese populations remains low, but uptake has increased exponentially since 2022. Our findings reveal significant disparities in obesity care, highlighting the importance of addressing inequities in AOM access to improve obesity outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1739484487230

Auxiliary or non-catalytic proteins can play a critical role in modulating metabolic flux and pathway efficiency. Chalcone isomerase-like (CHIL) is a non-catalytic protein known to serve as a partner to chalcone synthase (CHS) in flavonoid biosynthesis, rectifying its promiscuous activity and preventing by-product formation, such as the aberrant p-coumaroyltriacetic acid lactone (CTAL). Here, we extended the characterization of CHILs to the legume-characteristic isoflavonoid pathway. We assessed four CHIL orthologs from diverse plant lineages: Glycine max (GmCHIL), Oryza sativa (OsCHIL), Selaginella moellendorffii (SmCHIL), and Marchantia polymorpha (MpCHIL). Structural modelling suggested that naringenin (flavanone) entry into the CHIL binding cleft may be sterically hindered compared to catalytic CHIs. Moreover, legume CHIL isoforms possess an additional bulky residue, Tyr48, that is expected to impose further constraints on ligand binding. In vitro, CHS produced up to 60% lactone CTAL instead of its desired output; however, CHIL suppressed this aberrant activity to 10%, concomitantly increasing target compound titers. Combinatorial enzyme and yeast biotransformation assays revealed a critical role for CHIL in conducting flux through chalcone, flavanone, and isoflavone biosynthesis. The inclusion of CHIL in our engineered yeast strains enhanced overall titers and, unexpectedly, promoted carbon flux toward the so-called deoxy-branch (isoliquiritigenin, liquiritigenin, and daidzein) by up to 67%, with a 33% increase in final daidzein titers. By extending CHIL characterization to the isoflavonoid pathway, we have revealed an expanded role for this auxiliary protein and underscored its utility in engineered metabolic contexts. Our findings reiterate the often-overlooked impact of non-catalytic proteins in shaping specialized metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

Seagrasses, as globally distributed marine flowering plants, have critical ecological functions, but knowledge about their associated fungal communities remains relatively limited. Previous amplicon surveys of the fungal community associated with the seagrass, Zostera marina have revealed an abundance of potentially novel chytrids. In this study, we employed deep metagenomic sequencing to extract metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from these chytrids and other microbial eukaryotes associated with Z. marina leaves. Our efforts resulted in the recovery of five eukaryotic MAGs, including a single fungal MAG in the order Loubulomycetales (65% BUSCO completeness), three MAGs representing diatoms in the family Bacillariaceae (93%, 70% and 31% BUSCO completeness) and a single MAG representing a haptophyte algae in the genus Prymnesium (40% BUSCO completeness). Whole-genome phylogenomic assessment of these MAGs suggests they all largely represent under sequenced, and possibly novel eukaryotic lineages. Of particular interest, the chytrid MAG was placed within the order Lobulomycetales, consistent with the identity of the dominant chytrid from previous Z. marina amplicon survey results. Annotation of this MAG yielded 5,650 gene models of which 77% shared homology to current databases. With-in these gene models, we predicted 121 carbohydrate-active enzymes and 393 secreted proteins (103 cytoplasmic effectors, 30 apoplastic effectors). Exploration of orthologs between the Lobulomycetales MAG and existing Chytridiomycota genomes have revealed a landscape of high-copy gene families related to host recognition and interaction.

Histidine-rich oligopeptides have been recently shown to exhibit peroxidase-mimetic activities, but their catalytic function relies on maintaining unique supramolecular structures. This work demonstrates the design of a specific array of histidine residues on the internal surface of the ferritin cage to function as an active center for catalysis. The crystal structures of the ferritin mutants revealed histidine-histidine interactions, forming well-defined histidine clusters (His-clusters). These mutants exhibit peroxidase-mimetic activities by oxidizing 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Molecular dynamics simulations further highlight the co-localization of TMB and hydrogen peroxide at the histidine-rich clusters, indicating that the confined environment of the ferritin cage enhances their interactions. This study presents a simple yet effective approach to design cofactor-free artificial enzymes, paving the way for innovations in bioinspired catalysis.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

Despite numerous clinical observations and causality investigations, understanding of the diseases progression and recovery process following infection remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the causal connections between COVID-19 and various diseases using Mendelian randomization studies to provide robust theoretical underpinnings for the development of effective rehabilitation and intervention strategies.

MethodsWe systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies on Mendelian randomization related to COVID-19 published up to October 21, 2024. We used an extensive search strategy with the keywords ""Mendelian randomization"" and ""COVID-19"". Two pairs of coauthors independently extracted data on study characteristics, exposure, and outcomes, resolving discrepancies through discussion. We included studies that considered susceptibility to COVID-19, hospitalization, or severe infection as the exposure and disease-related effects or impacts on human health as outcomes. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the MR-STROBE criteria and extracted the relative risk (odds ratio [OR]) using a random-effects model for meta-analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42025615426.

ResultsOf the 1654 studies identified, 87 met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis. The primary outcome suggests that COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of cardio-cerebral vascular diseases. Subgroup analyses identified an increased risk of neuropsychiatric disorders, including optic nerve disorders, epilepsy, schizophrenia, generalized anxiety disorder, stroke, myocardial infarction with COVID-19. There is also a notable association between COVID-19 and the immune system, particularly neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders and myasthenia gravis.

ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that COVID-19 infection has direct causal effects on human health or certain diseases at the genetic level, which may manifest as increased or decreased susceptibility to disease and changes in disease severity.","NA","medrxiv",1739484487230

Yet, its precise role in shaping human-wildlife pathogen exchanges remains unclear. Analysing 40 years of global wildlife trade data, we show that traded mammals are twice as likely to share pathogens with humans than non-traded species. Moreover, time spent in trade strongly predicts the number of zoonotic pathogens that wildlife species host: on average, a species shares an additional pathogen with humans for every 9 years of presence in trade. This work highlights the importance of the wildlife trade in driving animal-to-human pathogen transmission, offering key insights into pathogen biogeography in the Anthropocene and the prevention of future pandemics.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

Vision initiates with a light-triggered phototransduction cascade occurring in photoreceptor cells (PRCs). The two main PRC types, ciliary and rhabdomeric, employ both specific and common genes for phototransduction. Despite being crucial for vision, the origin and evolution of photoreceptor cells and phototransduction pathways remain unclear.

Using phylogenetic methods, we studied the evolution of all phototransduction genes, elucidating their gene duplication patterns in over 80 species, including non-bilaterian metazoans and other eukaryotes. Then, we investigated the expression of phototransduction genes in available single-cell RNA-sequencing data from various animals, including non-bilaterians. By using phototransduction genes as markers, we identified putative photoreceptor-like cells across animals and compared their regulatory toolkits.

Gene families encoding phototransduction components are generally ancient, predating the origin of vision. However, many phototransduction genes originated in the metazoan stem group. Moreover, putative photoreceptor cells identified in non-bilaterians appeared to express some but not all components of the two well-characterised phototransduction pathways, suggesting potential lineage-specific components involved in phototransduction. Finally, we identified conserved expression of certain transcription factors in putative PRCs in non-bilaterians, suggesting the homology of PRCs.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

However, because non-bilaterian animals lack a through gut, the evolution of anus is still debated. The formation of bilaterian hindgut is governed by the spatial expression of several transcription factors (e.g. Caudal and Brachyury) under the control of Wnt signaling. This conserved pattern has been used to support the homology of the anus of protostomes (insects, snails) and deuterostomes (sea urchins, humans). Here we show, that these bilaterian ""hindgut"" marker genes are expressed around the male gonopore of several xenacoelomorphs, which have a blind gut without an anal opening. These findings suggest a deep evolutionary relationship between the xenacoelomorph male gonopore and the bilaterian anus. Since xenacoelomorphs are the potential sister group to all remaining Bilateria, our results suggest that the bilaterian anus evolved from a male gonopore that came in contact with the digestive endoderm to form the posterior opening.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

Using behavioral tracking in a semi-natural environment, neural recordings, and computational models integrating reinforcement and social learning, we show that groups of three isogenic mice spontaneously develop specialized roles while solving a foraging task requiring individual decisions under social constraints. Moreover, these roles are shaped by dopaminergic activity in the ventral tegmental area. Strikingly, despite minor sex-differences in behavior when mice were tested alone, male triads formed stable worker-scrounger relationships driven by competition, whereas female triads adopted uniform, cooperative strategies. Model analysis revealed how intra- and inter-sex parameter differences in resource exploitation, combined with contingent and dynamic social interactions, drive behavioral specialization and labor division. Most notably, it highlighted how contingency, amplified by competition, magnifies individual differences and shapes social profiles. The plastic, adaptive nature of social organization within triads was confirmed by manipulating dopaminergic cell activity, which reshaped social roles and altered group structure. Our findings support a feedback loop where social context shapes neural states, which in turn reinforce behavioral specialization and stabilize social structures.","NA","biorxiv",1739484487230

However, PRS model training presents significant challenges for broader adoption of PRS, including limited access to computational resources, difficulties in implementing advanced PRS methods, and availability and privacy concerns over individual-level genetic data. Cloud computing provides a promising solution with centralized computing and data resources. Here we introduce PennPRS (https://pennprs.org), a scalable cloud computing platform for online PRS model training in precision medicine. We developed novel pseudo-training algorithms for multiple PRS methods and ensemble approaches, enabling model training without requiring individual-level data. These methods were rigorously validated through extensive simulations and large-scale real data analyses involving over 6,000 phenotypes across various data sources. PennPRS supports online single- and multi-ancestry PRS training with seven methods, allowing users to upload their own data or query from more than 27,000 datasets in the GWAS Catalog, submit jobs, and download trained PRS models. Additionally, we applied our pseudo-training pipeline to train PRS models for over 8,000 phenotypes and made their PRS weights publicly accessible. In summary, PennPRS provides a novel cloud computing solution to improve the accessibility of PRS applications and reduce disparities in computational resources for the global PRS research community.","NA","medrxiv",1739484487230

While the well-studied zebrafish posterior lateral line has emerged as a powerful model to study collective cell migration, far less is known about development of the anterior lateral line, which produces the supraorbital and infraorbital lines around the eye, as well as mandibular and opercular lines over the jaw and cheek. Here we show that normal development of the zebrafish anterior lateral line system from cranial placodes is dependent on another vertebrate-specific cell type, the cranial neural crest. We find that cranial neural crest and anterior lateral lines develop in close proximity, with absence of neural crest cells leading to major disruptions in the overlying anterior lateral line system. Specifically, in the absence of neural crest neither supraorbital nor infraorbital lateral lines fully extend, such that the most anterior cranial regions remain devoid of neuromasts, while supernumerary ectopic neuromasts form in the posterior supraorbital region. Both neural crest and cranial placodes contribute neurons to the lateral line ganglia that innervate the neuromasts and in the absence of neural crest these ganglia, as well as the lateral line afferent nerves, are disrupted. Finally, we establish that as ontogeny proceeds, the most anterior supraorbital neuromasts come to lie within neural crest-derived frontal and nasal bones in the developing cranium. These are the same anterior supraorbital neuromasts that are absent or mislocated in specimens lacking neural crest cells. Together, our results establish that cranial neural crest and cranial placode derivatives function in concert over the course of ontogeny to build the complex cranial lateral line system.

However, few clinical trials have tested their value prospectively. The DUTRENEO trial (EudraCT: 2017-002246-6) investigated whether an 18-gene Tumour Inflammation Signature (TIS) that can robustly identify patients who respond to ICI in multiple tumour types could stratify patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) to receive neoadjuvant ICI (durvalumab+tremelimumab) or standard cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Patients with TIS-high tumors were randomized to ICI or NAC, while patients with TIS-low tumors received NAC. A total of 73 patients were treated. Pathological complete response (pCR) rates were 38.5% (TIS-High, ICI), 30% (TIS-High, NAC), and 55% (TIS-Low, NAC) (p = 0.349), indicating that - as applied - the TIS score did not significantly enrich in responders to ICI. Post-hoc analysis showed that higher TIS thresholds improved prediction of response to ICI but excluded many responders. Multi-omics analyses of pre-treatment samples, including whole-exome sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics (Visium, Xenium), revealed that bulk RNA response signatures originated mainly from cancer cells. Spatial transcriptomics showed that ICI response was associated with proximity between cancer cells and adaptive immune cells, while resistance to NAC was linked to phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells despite low genetic diversity. The unique design of the DUTRENEO trial underscores the challenges of translating retrospective biomarkers into clinical practice and highlights the importance of spatial features in understanding tumour-immune interactions. These findings suggest that integrating spatial and multi-modal biomarkers in well-designed clinical trials could improve stratification and response prediction to select neoadjuvant therapy.","NA","medrxiv",1739484487230
