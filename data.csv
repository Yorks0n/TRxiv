However, recent machine learning (ML) approaches to estimating recombination have used pooled sequencing data, which does not sample individual genotypes and cannot be used to calculate disequilibria beyond the length of a single sequence read. Motivated by these results, this study examines the ""black box"" of such ML methods to understand what signals are being used to infer recombination rates. We find that it is indeed possible to estimate recombination solely using the allele frequency spectrum, and we provide a genealogical interpretation of these results. We further show that even a simplified representation of the allele frequency spectrum can be used to estimate recombination. We demonstrate the accuracy of such inferences using both simulations and data from humans. These results offer a new way to understand the effects of recombination on patterns of sequence data, as well as providing an example of how the internal workings of ML methods can give insight into biological processes.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

In spite of this overwhelming disease prevalence and staggering cost, its severe impact on patients' lives and intense global research efforts, study of the disease has proved challenging due to its complexity. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified only four loci potentially associated with the disease, although these results did not statistically replicate between studies. A previous combinatorial analysis study identified a total of 73 genes that were highly associated with two long COVID cohorts in the predominantly (>91%) white European ancestry Sano GOLD population, and we sought to reproduce these findings in the independent and ancestrally more diverse All of Us (AoU) population. Methods We assessed the reproducibility of the 5,343 long COVID disease signatures from the original study in the AoU population. Because the very small population sizes provide very limited power to replicate findings, we initially tested whether we observed a statistically significant enrichment of the Sano GOLD disease signatures that are also positively correlated with long COVID in the AoU cohort after controlling for population substructure. Results For the Sano GOLD disease signatures that have a case frequency greater than 5% in AoU, we consistently observed a significant enrichment (77% - 83%, p < 0.01) of signatures that are also positively associated with long COVID in the AoU cohort. These encompassed 92% of the genes identified in the original study. At least five of the disease signatures found in Sano GOLD were also shown to be individually significantly associated with increased long COVID prevalence in the AoU population. Rates of signature reproducibility are strongest among self-identified white patients, but we also observe significant enrichment of reproducing disease associations in self-identified black/African-American and Hispanic/Latino cohorts. Signatures associated with 11 out of the 13 drug repurposing candidates identified in the original Sano GOLD study were reproduced in this study. Conclusion These results demonstrate the reproducibility of long COVID disease signal found by combinatorial analysis, broadly validating the results of the original analysis. They provide compelling evidence for a much broader array of genetic associations with long COVID than previously identified through traditional GWAS studies. This strongly supports the hypothesis that genetic factors play a critical role in determining an individual's susceptibility to long COVID following recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. It also lends weight to the drug repurposing candidates identified in the original analysis. Together these results may help to stimulate much needed new precision medicine approaches to more effectively diagnose and treat the disease. This is also the first reproduction of long COVID genetic associations across multiple populations with substantially different ancestry distributions. Given the high reproducibility rate across diverse populations, these findings may have broader clinical application and promote better health equity. We hope that this will provide confidence to explore some of these mechanisms and drug targets and help advance research into novel ways to diagnose the disease and accelerate the discovery and selection of better therapeutic options, both in the form of newly discovered drugs and/or the immediate prioritization of coordinated investigations into the efficacy of repurposed drug candidates.","NA","medrxiv",1738966087274

Due to its relatively weak binding affinity, the probe exhibits minimal cytotoxicity and labels actin filaments without significantly altering actin dynamics. Furthermore, SiR-XActin is suitable for time-resolved, live-cell super-resolution STED microscopy. Exchanging the SiR fluorophore in SiR-XActin for other fluorophores yields probes in different colors. All these properties make SiR-XActin and its analogs powerful tools for studying actin dynamics using live-cell fluorescence microscopy.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

Translation inhibition through tRNA cleavage or modification inhibits phage propagation, thereby protecting the bacterial population. To counteract this, some viruses encode their own tRNA molecules, allowing infection to take place. The AriB effector of the PARIS defence system is a Toprim nuclease previously shown to target the E. coli tRNALys(UUU), but not a tRNALys(UUU) variant encoded by bacteriophage T5. We demonstrate here that the T5-tRNALys(UUU) is required but not sufficient to bypass PARIS immunity. Combining tRNA-sequencing, genetics, phage infection and in vitro biochemical data, we reveal that the E. coli tRNAThr(UGU), is another prime target of AriB and tRNAAsn(GUU) represents a secondary, yet biologically relevant, target of the PARIS effector. Activated AriB protein cleaves these targets in vitro, and the cleavage reaction is not dependent on the presence of specific tRNA modifications. We show that the overexpression of phage T5 tRNALys(UUU), tRNAThr(UGU) and tRNAAsn(GUU) variants is sufficient to inhibit PARIS anti-viral defence. Finally, we propose a model for tRNA recognition by the AriB dimer and provide molecular details of its nuclease activity and specificity.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

This method enables the simultaneous analysis of cellular transcriptomes and adaptive immune receptor (AIR) repertoires within their native spatial context. We applied AIR-SPACE to mouse popliteal lymph nodes at five distinct time points after Vaccinia virus footpad infection and constructed a comprehensive map of the developing adaptive immune response. Our analysis revealed heterogeneous activation niches, characterized by Interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) production, during the early stages of infection. At later stages, we delineated sub-anatomical structures within the germinal center (GC) and observed evidence that antibody-producing plasma cells differentiate and exit the GC through the dark zone. Furthermore, by combining clonotype data with spatial lineage tracing, we demonstrate that B cell clones are shared among multiple GCs within the same lymph node, reinforcing the concept of a dynamic, interconnected network of GCs. Overall, our study demonstrates how AIR-SPACE can be used to gain insight into the spatial dynamics of infection responses within lymphoid organs.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

Place cells in CA1 of the hippocampus are crucial for spatial navigation and memories1 but show gradual changes in their preferred firing location over time when exposed to the same environment2-9. This drift occurs despite the fact that the animal maintains the ability to navigate and to perform spatial tasks, suggesting a complex relationship between neural activity and behaviour. Here, we show that while the spatial tuning functions of individual CA1 neurons drift over time, stable space coding prevails at the population level: Representational drift is not random but can be described as a translation and rotation in population state space, which preserves the internal geometry of population activity over time. Compensating for the coordinated translation and rotation allows for drift correction and a recovery of spatial tuning on future days. Moreover, the preserved internal geometry stabilises downstream readout under noisy conditions. We propose that the conserved population geometry might serve as a mechanism by which downstream reader networks achieve effective drift correction and, thus, ameliorate the readout of stable information.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

Human centromeres are defined primarily by a unique chromatin domain featuring the histone H3 variant, Centromere Protein A (CENP-A), that marks a single active centromere locus per chromosome. CENP-A chromatin typically occupies a small subregion of low DNA methylation within multi-megabase arrays of hypermethylated alpha-satellite repeats and constitutive pericentric heterochromatin. However, the mechanisms defining and maintaining precise centromere position and domain size, and the role of the underlying alpha satellite DNA sequence, are poorly characterised. Using an experimentally-induced neocentromere in RPE1 cells, we discovered that the SUV39H1 and H2 methyltransferases tri-methylate H3K9 at neocentromere boundaries to maintain CENP-A domain size independent of DNA methylation or satellite sequences. Furthermore, we found that the CENP-A domain at canonical alpha-satellite-based centromeres is characterized by local depletion of H3K9me3-mediated heterochromatin, coinciding with the DNA methylation dip region. We identified the SETDB1 methyltransferase as key to maintaining H3K9me3 within flanking active higher order alpha satellite arrays while SUV39s and SUZ12 contribute to globally heterochromatinize both alpha satellites and neighbouring repeats. Loss of this heterochromatin boundary results in the progressive expansion of the primary CENP-A domain, erosion of DNA methylation, and the nucleation of new centromeres across alpha satellite sequences. Our study identifies the functional specialization of different H3K9 methyltransferases across centromeric and pericentric domains, crucial for maintaining centromere domain size and number.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

Many of these animals regenerate the correct tissues and structures with remarkable fidelity according to the original polarity of the body, reflecting positional information present in the remaining tissue. Understanding the cellular and molecular basis of this positional information is a central question in regeneration biology. In planarians and acoels, muscle cells have been shown to carry such positional information, but where this information originates and whether this function is conserved in other highly regenerative animals, is not well understood. Here we use the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis to address the role of the nervous system in whole-body regeneration. We generated a transgenic line for conditional ablation of neurons and first showed that Nematostella can repeatedly regenerate its nervous system. Bisection experiments following nervous system ablation showed that all head fragments regenerate a second head instead of a foot, whereas foot fragments correctly regenerate the missing head. We further found that regenerating head fragments of nervous system-ablated animals increase the expression of Wnt signaling genes that in wildtype animals are only upregulated in regenerating foot fragments. These molecular changes and the initiation of ectopic head regeneration precede the re-appearance of neurons, suggesting that the nervous system does not directly control whether a head or foot will be regenerated. Instead, we propose a model in which the nervous system provides positional information to the tissue of the body column, and that this information allows foot regeneration by suppressing a default program for head regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

Models of protein complexes provide important insights into interaction mechanisms, but their interpretation can be difficult if they lack fine structural detail, which is often the case in experimental and predicted models.

ResultsHere I show that AlphaFold3 often fails to predict protein complexes that are either weak, or dependent on the presence of a cofactor that is not included in a prediction. To address this problem, I developed gapTrick, an AlphaFold2-based approach that uses multimeric templates to improve prediction reliability. The tool uses AlphaFold2 neural network models trained on single-chain proteins, which reduces training-set bias and allows for an extensive validation using a large benchmark set of protein complexes. I show that gapTrick improves predictions of the weak and incomplete complexes based on low-accuracy templates, such as separate protein chains rigid-body fitted into cryo-EM reconstruction of a complex. I also show that it identifies with very high precision residue-residue interactions that are critical for complex formation. The approach can aid in the interpretation of challenging experimental structures and the computational identification of protein-protein interactions.

Availability and implementationThe gapTrick source code is available at https://github.com/gchojnowski/gapTrick and requires only a standard AlphaFold2 installation to run. The repository also provides a Colab notebook that can be used to run gapTrick without installing it on the user's computer.

The pathophysiologic mechanisms of this complex disease are poorly understood. Beyond the described symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, myalgias, among others, Long COVID can affect the patients ability to work and function in society compared to their baseline. Frailty is defined as the decline of physiologic reserve that leads to increased vulnerability to stressors and poor health outcomes. Our study aimed to examine the characteristics of frailty seen in patients with Long COVID compared to the frailty seen in aging patients with multimorbidity.

MethodsThis is a retrospective cohort study conducted in the Miami Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). The data used to calculate the Fried phenotype through the Johns Hopkins frailty calculator was collected from two separate clinics, a Long COVID clinic and a Geriatric Frailty clinic. We obtained the VA Frailty Index from VA CDW (Corporate Data Warehouse).

ResultsWe included 106 patients from the Long COVID clinic and 97 from the frailty clinic. Patients from the Long COVID clinic were significantly younger than those from the frailty clinic (60{+/-}12.6 vs.. 79.8{+/-}5.8, p<0.01). In the standard frailty group, weakness and slowness were the predominant features present in both the frail and pre-frail groups, with increasing exhaustion and lower activity in the frail group. Patients with frailty in the Long COVID group experienced exhaustion and low activity at a higher rate than those in the Geriatric frailty clinic.

ConclusionsLong COVID may predispose patients to develop a subtype of frailty (""post-viral frailty"") that presents with a higher frequency of exhaustion and low activity. This frailty appears phenotypically different from the frailty encountered in geriatric patients with multimorbidity, which presents more often with slowness and weakness as the initial drivers.","NA","medrxiv",1738966087274

However, while myriad studies have investigated relationships between MGEs and variation in fitness among microbial and eukaryotic hosts, few studies have incorporated this variation into the context of MGE evolution and ecology. Combining HiC-resolved metagenomics with the model honey bee worker gut microbiome, we show that the worker gut contains a dense, nested MGE community that exhibits a wide degree of host range variation among microbial hosts. Using measures of gene similarity and syntenty, we show that plasmids likely mediate gene flow between individual honey bee colonies, though these plasmids exhibit broad host range variation within their individual microbiomes. We further show that phage-microbe networks exhibit high variation among individual metagenomes, and that phages show broad host range with respect to both the number and phylogenetic distance of their hosts. Finally, we provide evidence that measures of nucleotide variation positively correlate with host range in bee-associated phages, and that functional targets of diversifying selection are partitioning differently between broad or narrow host range phages. Our work underscores the variability of MGE x microbial interactions within host-associated microbial communities and highlights the genomic variation associated with MGE host range diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

Phenological associations between deciduous trees, phytophagous insects and their consumers (passerine birds) have become one of the model systems for understanding this process. However, most existing research reports population-level associations rather than examining the smaller spatial scales at which these trophic interactions occur. Furthermore, a variety of methods have been used to measure phenology, particularly on producers and primary consumers, with little formal comparison. To investigate how different methods of measuring producer and primary consumer phenology influence our understanding of these biological relationships at the appropriate scale, we quantified phenological metrics for individual host trees and the phytophagous insects that depend on them in a deciduous woodland during spring 2023. We sampled 170 trees from six deciduous species in Wytham Woods, UK, deriving nine metrics of phenology from five distinct field methods: multispectral drone imaging (NDVI), hemispherical canopy photography, and bud-scoring observations to track tree phenology, as well as water traps and frass traps to monitor insect herbivore phenology. We assessed the reliability of these methods within both trophic levels and across tree species. We further evaluated the extent to which tree phenology metrics best correlated with herbivore phenology, at the level of individual trees and links to variation in subsequent herbivory rates across a subsample of 72 oak (Quercus robur) trees. Our results illustrate how methodological choices can affect our ability to study the timing of trophic interactions and reveal fine-scale spatiotemporal variation in phenology across both trophic levels. We discuss the implications of these results for considering how the scale-dependence of trophic interactions may stabilise populations and shape broader-scale responses to environmental change.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

We integrate an extensive reference sample set of previously published ancient DNA datasets from Western and South-Central Asia, enhancing our understanding of genetic continuity and diversity within ancient Iranian populations. A new Early Chalcolithic sample, predating all other Chalcolithic genomes from Iran, demonstrates mostly Early Neolithic Iranian genetic ancestry. This finding reflects long-term cultural and biological continuity in and around the Zagros area, alongside evidence of some western genetic influence. Our sample selection prioritizes northern Iran, with a particular focus on the Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sassanid periods (355 BCE-460 CE). The genetic profiles of historical samples from this region position them as intermediates on an east-west genetic cline across the Persian Plateau.

The aim of the reCOVer trial was to investigate safety, tolerability and clinical effects of BC007 on fatigue, its severity and quality of life in PCS patients.

MethodsreCOVer is a prospective, exploratory, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover phase IIa clinical trial with 1350 mg BC007 at the University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany. Eligible participants were 18-80 years with GPCR-fAAb, whose PCS symptoms persisted [&ge;]3 months after PCR-confirmed COVID-19, with fatigue as the major symptom (Bell score [&le;]60) and at least three of eight defined PCS symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) according to a crossover design to either receive BC007 (sequence A) or placebo (sequence B) at day 0 and day 48 with a follow-up of 28 days, respectively. A crossover design was chosen to increase patient adherence. Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in comparison between sequence A and B from d0 to d28 and d0 to d70 were the primary and co-primary endpoint, respectively.

FindingsBetween 31.10.2023 and 12.06.2024, 30 PCS patients were randomised and analysed. The trial has been concluded. Summarising all AE rates, no statistically significant differences between sequence A und sequence B were observed within day 28 and day 70. One report of a serious adverse event, not related to treatment, was recorded. As a secondary endpoint, BC007 showed a significant improvement on self-reported fatigue and its severity, as well as quality of life.

InterpretationAs BC007 was well tolerated and showed a significant improvement of fatigue and quality of life, it might offer a therapeutic option for an autoimmune subgroup of PCS patients.

The methodology utilizes molecular docking simulations to predict interactions based on structural compatibility and binding affinity estimations. This approach highlights proteins, such as sodium/myo-inositol cotransporters, which exhibit theoretical high affinity for puberulic acid, suggesting possible competitive inhibition or mimetic interactions that could disrupt osmoregulation. It is important to clarify that these simulations provide a hypothetical framework for understanding potential interactions. The high docking scores do not directly translate to biological effects but serve as a basis for further experimental validation. This cautious interpretation acknowledges the inherent limitations of predictive modeling while maintaining confidence in the robustness of the computational process. Moreover, the exploratory nature of this study is supported by the fact that binding affinity predictions are not influenced by protein amino acid length or the predictive accuracy (pLDDT scores) provided by AlphaFold2. This independence from structural prediction metrics suggests that the docking results offer a reliable exploration of potential interactions across a wide array of proteins, making this approach a valuable asset in the fields of drug discovery and toxicological research. The ability to comprehensively identify candidate proteins with potential affinity to chemical compounds enhances the predictive capacity of toxicological assessments and supports the strategic development of safer pharmaceutical agents.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

If sequences from two strains share less than [~]99% identity, the strains are usually classified as different species.

Here we update these thresholds by determining sequence identity of the 16S rRNA gene for nearly 18,000 type strains. This represents 86.5% of all strains validly published, and it involved making more than 161 million pairwise sequence alignments. In 90% of all cases, sequences from the same species shared a minimum of 97.2 to 100% identity.

The more generalized, SECIS-independent incorporation of selenocysteine is of interest because of the high nucleophilicity of selenium and the greater durability of diselenide bonds. It is likely that during the course of evolution selenocysteine insertion originally arose without the presence of a SECIS element, relying only on SelB. Herein we undertake experiments to evolve an ancestral version of SelB that is SECIS-independent and show that not only can this protein (SelB-v2) generally incorporate selenocysteine across from stop codons, but also that the new, orthogonal translation factor can be repurposed to other amino acids, such as serine. Given the delicate energetic balancing act already performed by EF-Tu, this achievement raises the possibility that greatly expanded genetic codes that relied in part on SelB-based loading can now be contrived.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

Since most of the neural matrix is composed of sugars, development of genetically encoded tags has been limited. Therefore, although several staining protocols exist for ECM in fixed tissue, there are no reliable matrix labels for live imaging. Here we report a viral-mediated fluorescent probe that binds to HA and labels the mouse brain ECM. The vector encodes the HA binding domain from neurocan fused to GFP and an externalization tag (AAV-Ncan-GFP), enabling transduced cells to secrete the fluorescent hyalectan into the extracellular space, thereby labeling HA. We demonstrate stable probe expression in organotypic brain slices, as well as in vivo in the mouse cortex, where it labels both perineuronal nets and interstitial matrix. We validate HA labeling through colocalization with HABP and sensitivity to hyaluronidase, and confirm the probe extracellular localization by shadow imaging. As a proof of concept, we combine AAV-Ncan-GFP with dendritic spine imaging ex vivo and calcium transient imaging in vivo, providing a real-time map of local ECM alongside neural function. The probe enables time-lapse imaging of ECM dynamics in live mice, facilitating longitudinal studies across a wide range of timescales, from minutes to days.

The presence of polyphosphate within these condensates, which we termed HP-bodies, controls Hfq function by selectively stabilizing polyadenylated RNAs involved in transcription and protein translation, and promoting interactions with translation- and RNA-metabolism-associated proteins involved in de novo protein synthesis. Lack of polyphosphate prevents HP-body formation, which increases cell death and significantly hinders recovery from N-starvation.

Vaccinia was historically thought to encode all the proteins required for its replication. However, recent findings have shown that nuclear host proteins are redirected to the cytoplasm to facilitate viral replication. Among these, topoisomerase 2 (TOP2A) and 2{beta} (TOP2B), which mediate nuclear transcription, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation are the most abundant host proteins associated with nascent viral genomes. Here, we investigate the mechanisms driving TOP2A and TOP2B cytoplasmic translocation and their role in viral replication. We found that early viral protein synthesis induces the cytosolic relocalization of both isoforms, which are subsequently recruited to viral factories by an interaction of their C-terminal domains with the viral ligase, A50. TOP2A promotes replication by interacting with the vaccinia DNA replication machinery. In contrast, TOP2B suppresses replication by enhancing the formation of double-stranded RNA and antiviral granules, containing components of the tRNA splicing ligase complex.

This study aims to investigate these mechanisms by examining the presence of the viral nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) genes, their mRNA expression, associated immunoglobulins (IgG), and immune regulation via IDO-2 activity in blood of individuals suspected of long COVID. Here we show that a unique pattern of test results contributes to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of long COVID, ultimately leading to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this condition. This study focuses on four key objectives: detecting viral or vaccin induced genetic material, quantifying mRNA expression of the N and S genes, profiling immunoglobulin levels, and measuring IDO-2 activity. These objectives aim to differentiate long COVID from other post-infectious conditions and provide insights into prolonged symptoms. The study population comprised 72 participants, 31 of whom were suspected of having long COVID based on defined symptomatology. Viral genetic material was detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, Immunoglobulin levels varied, with symptomatic males exhibiting lower anti-Spike IgG levels than females, suggesting possible gender differences in immune response. Logistic regression models revealed that mRNA spike data alone in this small group was insufficient to predict symptoms presence, but the inclusion of immunoglobulins and inflammatory markers significantly improved predictive accuracy.

Overall, this study highlights the complexity of long COVID and suggests that a multi-variable approach, combining mRNA and genomic spike data with inflammatory markers and demographic factors, provides a basis for effective prediction of symptoms, helping refine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for long COVID","NA","medrxiv",1738966087274

Although the S-layers role as a mechanical support for the membrane might be expected to hinder cell division, we show that in rapidly dividing Sulfolobus acidocaldarius cells, the S-layer protein SlaA self-assembles into flexible lattice that helps flattens the cytokinetic furrow to accelerate ESCRT-III dependent cell division - a role that is especially important under conditions of mechanical stress. Taken together, these results generated using mutational analysis, live and fixed cellular imaging, along with electron cryomicroscopy, define the rules governing S-layer self-assembly and show how the mechanical properties of flexible lattice coats can enhance membrane functions to both physically support a cell and help to drive ESCRT-III dependent cell division.

Significance statementThe bounding membrane of a cell must be protected from environmental insults. In many bacteria and archaea that lack a cell wall, this is achieved by an enveloping S-layer. By virtue of its rigid, planar structure, the S-layer is also expected to act as a barrier to the cell shape changes required for cytokinesis. In this study of the S-layer lattice in the archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius however, we demonstrate a role for this self-assembling mechanical support in re-shaping the cytokinetic furrow as an aid to ESCRT-III-mediated division. In showing how mechanically active and passive structures can work together to give rise to mechanically stable cells that can divide, this reconciles what seems like a trade-off between resilience and flexibility.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

There is no approved medical treatment for these types of head injuries. To this end, we tested the healing effects of the psychedelic psilocybin, as it is known to reduce neuroinflammation and enhance neuroplasticity. Using a model of mild repetitive head injury in adult female rats, we provide unprecedented data that psilocybin can reduce vasogenic edema, restore normal vascular reactivity and functional connectivity, reduce phosphorylated tau buildup, enhance levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and its receptor TrkB, and modulate lipid signaling molecules.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

We consider datasets from three species performing a classic reward-learning task that has been the focus of substantial modeling effort, and find that the discovered programs outperform state-of-the-art cognitive models for each.

Here we describe a general deep learning-based design approach for solubilizing native membrane proteins while preserving their sequence, fold, and function using genetically encoded de novo protein WRAPs (Water-soluble RFdiffused Amphipathic Proteins) that surround the lipid-interacting hydrophobic surfaces, rendering them stable and water-soluble without the need for detergents. We design WRAPs for both beta-barrel outer membrane and helical multi-pass transmembrane proteins, and show that the solubilized proteins retain the binding and enzymatic functions of the native targets with enhanced stability. Syphilis vaccine development has been hindered by difficulties in characterizing and producing the outer membrane protein antigens; we generated soluble versions of four Treponema pallidum outer membrane beta barrels which are potential syphilis vaccine antigens. A 4.0 [A] cryo-EM map of WRAPed TP0698 is closely consistent with the design model. WRAPs should be broadly useful for facilitating biochemical and structural characterization of integral membrane proteins, enabling therapeutic discovery by screening against purified soluble targets, and generating antigenically intact immunogens for vaccine development.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

We demonstrate that endowing CAR T cells with ectopic interleukin-9 (IL-9) signaling by co-expressing an IL-9 receptor, rewires CAR T cell fate under antigen stress to enhance anti-tumor efficacy. In preclinical solid tumor models, IL-9-signaling CAR T cells exhibit increased expansion, persistence, and tumor infiltration, resulting in superior tumor control at significantly lower doses than conventional products. Trajectory and RNA velocity analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data reveal that IL-9 signaling alters CAR T cell differentiation under antigen stress away from dysfunction, favoring a multipotent transition toward CD8+ cell memory and effector states, and promoting a CD4+ cell proliferative state. Interrogation of transcription factor pathways indicates that IL-9-mediated activation of STAT1 and STAT4 drives the superior phenotype of IL-9-signaling CAR T cells, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for targeting solid cancers.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

Detailed clustering demonstrated unique fibroblasts specific to lupus skin with likely roles in inflammatory cell recruitment and fibrosis. We also evaluated the association of retroelement expression with type I interferons in the skin. We observed increased retroelement expression which correlated with interferon-stimulated genes across multiple cell types. Moreover, we saw elevated expression of genes involved in RIG-I and cGAS-STING pathways, which transduce elevated nucleic acid signals. Treatment of active cutaneous lupus with Anifrolumab reduced RIG-I and cGAS-STING pathways in addition to the most abundant retroelement family, L2b.

Mosquito vision plays a role in predator avoidance, mate finding, oviposition, locating vertebrate hosts, and vectoring disease. Recent work has shown that when sensitized to CO2, the visual responses of Aedes aegypti are wavelength-dependent, but little is known about how other olfactory stimuli can modulate visual responses. The visual cues associated with flowers, vertebrate hosts, or oviposition sites differs substantially and it is possible that odors might prime the mosquito visual system to respond to these different resources. To investigate the interplay of olfactory and visual cues, we adapted previously used wind tunnel bioassays to use quasi-monochromatic targets (390-740 nm) created with a novel LED synth. We coupled these visual targets with CO2 and the odors representative of vertebrate hosts, floral nectar or oviposition sites and assessed responses via 3D tracking of female mosquitos. When CO2 alone is present, we observe a lower preference for wavelengths in the green portion of the visible spectrum with a gradual increase as wavelengths moved towards the violet and red ends of the spectrum. However, when odors associated both with flowers and oviposition sites, we observed significant increases in mosquito preference for green (475-575 nm) stimuli. In contrast when vertebrate host odor was present, we saw increased preference for stimuli across the entire visible spectrum. These odor shifts in the mosquito spectral preferences suggest these preferences are not fixed and shift depending on behavioral context.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

PDN is a common and challenging complication of diabetes, characterized by changes in skin innervation accompanied by neuropathic pain. While there is growing evidence that epidermal non-neuronal cells, such as resident immune cells, play a crucial role in the progression of PDN, the underlying mechanisms of this neuropathy remain poorly understood. In our studies, we utilized transgenic methods, pain behavioral assessments, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in a clinically relevant high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model of PDN and skin biopsy samples from PDN patients, to investigate the role of epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) in this condition. We observed an increased density of LCs in the skin of PDN male mice coinciding with the onset of mechanical allodynia. Furthermore, we found that LCs density correlated with small fiber degeneration in HFD mice and skin biopsies taken from well-characterized PDN patients compared to healthy controls. Importantly, the selective ablation of LCs using a diphtheria-toxin strategy was found to prevent nociceptive behavior in male mice. This indicates that LCs are both necessary and sufficient for the development of mechanical allodynia and spontaneous pain in HFD male mice. Interestingly, when LCs were ablated in HFD female mice, it did not prevent but rather promoted pain behavior, suggesting the existence of sex-specific mechanisms mediated by LCs. scRNAseq transcriptomic analysis of the paw epidermis from HFD mice, which included both males and females, revealed significant sex-mediated differences in the expression of specific target genes within this PDN model. In male mice, scRNAseq identified differentially expressed genes associated with axonal guidance and immune responses in LCs. Additionally, by integrating single-cell RNA data from the epidermis and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of male mice, we uncovered altered communication between LCs and cutaneous afferents through Semaphorin-Plexin signaling pathways in PDN. These findings highlight LCs as key contributors to the development of PDN and suggest their potential as therapeutic targets for innovative treatments, particularly topical therapies aimed at modulating immune cell activity and neuroimmune communication in the skin. Our investigations of male and female mice indicate that LCs may play different roles in mechanical sensation under both normal and pathological conditions, such as PDN. This underscores the importance of considering sex differences when developing more effective treatments.

BRIEF SUMMARYThe interaction between non-neuronal cells and nerve endings in the epidermis plays a significant role in the development of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy (PDN), a challenging complication of diabetes. Using transgenic methods, pain behavioral assessments, and single-cell transcriptomics in a clinically relevant high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model of PDN, and in skin tissues from PDN patients, we identified epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) as key contributors to the development of PDN. In these studies, we revealed, for the first time, a dimorphic role for LCs in the development of mechanical allodynia and spontaneous pain in a HFD model of PDN. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of the paw epidermis from both male and female HFD mice identified sex-mediated differences in the expression of specific target genes within this PDN model. In male mice, scRNAseq of LCs revealed differentially expressed genes related to immune responses and axonal guidance, including Semaphorin-Plexin signaling pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

However, the mechanisms for IL-33 secretion and regulation in the context of chronic airway disease is poorly understood.

ObjectivesWe sought to define how a disease associated isoform IL-33{Delta}34 that escapes nuclear sequestration and is tonically secreted from epithelial cells can be recruited to non-canonical secretory pathways.

MethodsIL-33{Delta}34 interaction with HSP70 was assessed and validated by affinity purification, mass-spectrometry and miniTurboID proximity labeling. Secretion and activity reporter assays were used to probe the effect of HSP70 on epithelial IL-33{Delta}34 secretion and receptor binding. Human airway disease biospecimens were analyzed for dysregulation of heat shock pathways revealing modulation of TCP1 complex intermediates.

Measurements and Main ResultsWe confirmed that HSP70 interacts directly with IL-33{Delta}34, recruits the cytokine to a vesicular compartment and enhances stability upon secretion. IL-33, HSP70 and other key mediators of proteostasis were found to be dysregulated in airway disease biospecimens and secreted extracellular vesicles. The IL-33{Delta}34 interactome was characterized and novel secretion modulators were identified.

ConclusionsThis study confirms a role for HSP70 in non-canonical IL-33{Delta}34 secretion and function that may be amenable for therapeutic targeting in airway diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

To address this, we investigated hippocampal activity in 5xFAD model mice performing a continuous spatial alternation task, combining behavioural assessment with in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. Young 5xFAD mice exhibited mild performance deficits, which worsened with age. Older 5xFAD mice showed significant impairments in task acquisition and alternation accuracy, with significant behavioural hyperactivity. Hippocampal CA1 neurons in 5xFAD mice showed early impairments in spatial representation, prior to showing behavioural deficits. Both young and old 5xFAD mice exhibited reduced spatial tuning, fewer place cells, and decreased trial-to-trial reliability in comparison to wildtype sibling controls. Additionally, 5xFAD mice demonstrated disrupted spatial encoding of reward locations, with reduced spatial correlation between correct and error trials. Analysis of hippocampal ""splitter"" cells revealed reduced splitting activity in 5xFAD mice, with reduced discriminability and reliability of trajectory-dependent activity. These deficits correlated with poorer task performance, suggesting that disrupted contextual encoding contributes to cognitive decline in AD.

Investigations in myeloid-only humanized mouse models demonstrated the contribution of M{Phi} to viral rebound upon ART interruption. Two distinct M{Phi} subsets exist in mice and humans: one of embryonic origin and self-renewal capacity generating long-lived tissue-resident M{Phi} (LL-TRM), and another one of short-lived M{Phi} (SL-M{Phi}), constantly replenished by bone marrow monocytes. The relative contribution of LL-TRM versus SL-M{Phi} to tissue HIV-1 reservoir persistence during ART remains understudied. Here, we used a humanized BM-liver-thymus (hu-BLT) mouse model to quantify integrative HIV-1 infection in liver/lung M{Phi} versus CD4+ T-cells before/after ART and document their expression of LL-TRM/SL-M{Phi} markers.

ResultsLung/liver immune cells were extracted from ART-naive (ART-) and ART-treated (ART+) HIV-infected (HIV+) hu-BLT mice, as well as HIV-uninfected mice (HIV-). M{Phi} were identified as cells expressing the myeloid markers CD33/HLA-DR and/or CD68 and flow-cytometry sorted based on their differential expression of CD14 and/or CCR2. Matched CD3+CD4+ T-cells were sorted in parallel and used as controls. HIV-DNA integration was measured by nested real-time PCR. In contrast to CD4+ T-cells that carried the highest levels of proviral HIV-DNA before and after ART, integrative infection in liver/lung M{Phi} was detected before ART, but was drastically reduced in HIV+ART+ hu-BLT mice, regardless of CD14 or CCR2 expression on M{Phi}. Markers of LL-TRM (CD163/CX3CR1/Ki67/c-Kit) were expressed on a small fraction of liver but not lung M{Phi}, indicative of a deficient LL-TRM development in this hu-BLT model.

ConclusionsTogether our results demonstrate that lung/liver M{Phi} in hu-BLT mice support integrative HIV-1 infection in vivo, but their contribution to viral reservoir persistence during ART is minor when compared to CD4+ T-cells. This is consistent with the deficient development of LL-TRM we observed in hu-BLT mice.

To make strides towards this goal in a rapidly changing, exemplar marine ecosystem, the Baltic Sea, we studied basin-scale nitrifier spatio-temporal dynamics, coupled with enrichment-enabled comparative genomics. Based on metagenomes and rRNA gene sequencing, we found nitrifiers to be persistently relatively abundant throughout deep depths (>25 m), and from late-fall to spring in surface waters, as revealed by twice-weekly sampling across two years in the southwest Baltic Sea surface waters. In these surface waters, we observed time-lagged dynamics between ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizers, which were positively correlated with nitrite, nitrate, and diverse other prokaryotes, and negatively correlated with day length, light, and chlorophyll. For the dominant nitrifiers, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), we enriched five novel species including the dominant deep Baltic Sea species, and obtained genomes from all dominant AOA phylotypes. Among these genomes, which enabled fine-scale niche-differentiation, we observed a high degree of gene conservation, with most differences related to genes associated with interactions with the external environment, including genes involved in signal transduction, cell wall/membrane biogenesis, and inorganic ion transport, indicating these may be the primary drivers of strain-variability. We also observed differences in nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism between two dominant surface types. Together our study provides key insights into the niche of nitrifiers, and begins the process of understanding the mechanisms and functional implications of these patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

To address the first issue, we introduce salad, a family of sparse all-atom denoising models for protein backbone generation. Our models are notably faster than the state-of-the-art while matching or improving designability and diversity, and generate designable structures for protein lengths up to 1,000 amino acids.

Larger brains facilitate the evolution of greater behavioural plasticity, which could facilitate diversification in two ways, either by driving increased speciation (behavioural drive) or by making lineages more resilient to extinction (cognitive buffer). Here, we model brain-size-dependent diversification dynamics from published endocranial volume data for a sample of 2291 extant and fossil bird taxa, jointly modelling speciation rate, extinction rate and fossilisation rate separately for perching birds and other groups. We find that increasing relative brain size primarily increased diversification rate through decreasing extinction rate, supporting the cognitive buffer hypothesis and suggesting that larger brains in birds promote diversification by making species more resilient to extinction. Although speciation and extinction are dependent on relative brain size in both perching birds and other groups, this dependence is non-linear. In perching birds, the highest diversification rates are found over a narrow range of relative brain sizes, in contrast to other bird groups which show lower diversification rates over a broader range of relative brain sizes.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

While recent advances in self-supervised learning have revolutionized the ability to study cellular morphology and transcriptomics, dynamic cellular processes have remained challenging to phenotypically profile. To address this limitation, we developed Plexus, a novel self-supervised model specifically designed to capture and quantify network-level neuronal activity dynamics. Unlike existing phenotyping tools that focus on static readouts, Plexus leverages a novel network-level cell encoding method, which enables it to efficiently encode dynamic neuronal activity data into rich representational embeddings. In turn, Plexus achieves state of the art performance in detecting phenotypic changes in neuronal activity. We validated Plexus using a comprehensive GCaMP6m simulation framework and demonstrated its enhanced ability to classify distinct neuronal activity phenotypes compared to traditional signal-processing approaches. To enable practical application, we integrated Plexus with a scalable experimental system utilizing human iPSC-derived neurons equipped with the GCaMP6m calcium indicator and CRISPR interference machinery. This integrated platform successfully identified nearly twice as many distinct phenotypic changes in response to genetic perturbations compared to conventional methods, as demonstrated in a 52-gene CRISPRi screen across multiple iPSC lines. Using this framework, we identified potential genetic modifiers of aberrant neuronal activity in frontotemporal dementia, illustrating its utility for understanding complex neurological disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

Studies on host immune responses to infection have mostly targeted mechanisms of resistance, and consequently, these are now well-described in both vertebrates and invertebrates. By comparison, the mechanistic basis of disease tolerance is less well understood. This is in part because both processes interact and can be difficult to separate under an infection scenario. Using the highly tractable insect model Drosophila melanogaster exposed to its natural entomopathogen, Pseudomonas entomophila, we aimed to tease apart mechanisms of disease tolerance from those of resistance. To this aim, we reasoned that oral exposure to heat-killed entomopathogenic bacteria should require disease tolerance without relying on resistance. Using this method, we observe that oral exposure to heat-killed P. entomophila causes mortality and reduced fecundity in D. melanogaster. We confirm that this reduction in fitness-related traits depends on the duration of the exposure, is sexually dimorphic, and is dependent on the virulence of the bacterium. We also found the microbiota to play a role, with its presence exacerbating the deleterious effect on host survival. This experimental framework, which may be extended to other systems, can be instrumental towards an understanding of the molecular, genetic, and physiological basis of disease tolerance and its interactions with resistance mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

Over the past decades, single-cell and clonal analyses have revealed substantial functional and molecular heterogeneity within this compartment, challenging the notion that self-renewal is inherently tied to balanced, multi-lineage blood production. However, a cohesive model that explains the relationships among these diverse HSC states remains elusive. Here, we combined single-cell transplantations of over 1,000 highly purified murine long-term HSCs with in-depth phenotyping of their clonal progeny to achieve a detailed, time-resolved understanding of heterogeneous reconstitution outcomes. We identified reconstitution kinetics as an overall unifying metric of HSC functional potency, with the most potent HSCs displaying the greatest delay in hematopoietic reconstitution. Importantly, a progressive acceleration in reconstitution kinetics was also associated with a gradual shift in mature cell production from platelet and erythro-myeloid bias to balanced, and eventually lymphoid bias. Serial single-cell transplantations of HSCs revealed a unidirectional acceleration in reconstitution kinetics accompanied by a gradual decline in functional potency of daughter HSCs, aligning diverse phenotypes along a linear hierarchical trajectory. Mathematical modeling, together with experimental modulation of lineage-biased blood production, demonstrated that apparent lineage biases actually arise from cell-extrinsic feedback regulation and clonal competition between slow- and fast-engrafting clones to occupy the limited compartment sizes of mature lineages. Our study reconciles multiple layers of HSC heterogeneity into a unifying framework, prompting a reevaluation of the meaning of lineage biases in both normal and diseased hematopoiesis, with broad implications for other regenerating tissues during development, homeostasis, and repair.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

PGSs are often thought of as capturing the direct genetic effect of ones genotype on their phenotype. However, because PGSs are constructed from population-level associations, they are influenced by factors other than direct genetic effects, including stratification, assortative mating, and dynastic effects (""SAD effects""). Our interpretation and application of PGSs may hinge on the relative impact of SAD effects, since they may often be environmentally or culturally mediated. We developed a method that estimates the proportion of variance in a PGS (in a given sample) that is driven by direct effects, SAD effects, and their covariance. We leverage a comparison of a PGS of interest based on a standard GWAS with a PGS based on a sibling GWAS--which is largely immune to SAD effects--to quantify the relative contribution of each type of effect to variance in the PGS of interest. Our method, Partitioning Genetic Scores Using Siblings (PGSUS, pron. ""Pegasus""), breaks down variance components further by axes of genetic ancestry, allowing for a nuanced interpretation of SAD effects. In particular, PGSUS can detect stratification along major axes of ancestry as well as SAD variance that is ""isotropic"" with respect to axes of ancestry. Applying PGSUS, we found evidence of stratification in PGSs constructed using large meta-analyses of height and educational attainment as well as in a range of PGSs constructed using the UK Biobank. In some instances, a given PGS appears to be stratified along a major axis of ancestry in one prediction sample but not in another (for example, in comparisons of prediction in samples from different countries, or in ancient DNA vs. contemporary samples). Finally, we show that different approaches for adjustment for population structure in GWASs have distinct advantages with respect to mitigation of ancestry-axis-specific and isotropic SAD variance in PGS. Our study illustrates how family-based designs can be combined with standard population-based designs to guide the interpretation and application of genomic predictors.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

Convergent evidence suggests that neurodevelopment proceeds in a hierarchical manner, characterized by heterogeneous maturation patterns across brain regions and networks. However, the maturation of the intrinsic spatiotemporal propagations of brain activity remains largely unexplored. This study aims to bridge this gap by delineating spatiotemporal propagations from childhood to early adulthood. By leveraging a recently developed approach that captures time-lag dynamic propagations, we characterized intrinsic dynamic propagations along three axes: sensory-association (S-A),  task-positive to default networks (TP-D), and somatomotor-visual (SM-V) networks, which progress towards adult-like brain dynamics from childhood to early adulthood. Importantly, we demonstrated that as participants mature, there is a prolonged occurrence of the S-A and TP-D propagation states, indicating that they spend more time in these states. Conversely, the prevalence of SM-V propagation states declines during development. Notably, top-down propagations along the S-A axis exhibited an age-dependent increase in occurrence, serving as a superior predictor of cognitive scores compared to bottom-up S-A propagation. These findings were replicated across two independent cohorts (N = 677 in total), emphasizing the robustness and generalizability of these findings. Our results provide new insights into the emergence of adult-like functional dynamics during youth and their role in supporting cognition.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

VPS29 is a central conductor of this network through its assembly into Retromer, Retriever and Commander endosomal sorting complexes, and its role in regulating RAB GTPase activity. Two VPS29 isoforms have been described, VPS29A and VPS29B, that differ solely in their amino-terminal sequences. Here we identify a third VPS29 isoform, which we term VPS29C, that harbours an extended amino-terminal sequence compared to VPS29A and VPS29B. Through a combination of AlphaFold predictive modelling, in vitro complex reconstitution, mass spectrometry and molecular cell biology, we find that the amino-terminal VPS29C extension constitutes an autoinhibitory sequence that limits access to a hydrophobic groove necessary for effector protein recruitment to Retromer, and association with Retriever and Commander. VPS29C is therefore unique in its ability to uncouple Retromer-dependent cargo sorting from the broader roles of VPS29A and VPS29B in regulating the endosomal-lysosomal network through accessory protein recruitment. Our identification and characterisation of VPS29C points to additional complexity in the differential subunit assembly of Retromer, an important consideration given the increasing interest in Retromer as a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe endosomal-lysosomal network is essential for normal cellular function with network defects being associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Two heterotrimeric complexes, Retromer and Retriever, control transmembrane protein recycling through the network. Of these, reduced Retromer expression is observed in Alzheimers disease and Retromer mutations lead to familial Parkinsons disease. Here, we identify and characterise a new isoform of VPS29, a subunit shared between Retromer and Retriever. We reveal how this isoform, VPS29C, adopts an auto-inhibitory conformation to limit its association into Retriever and restrict the binding of VPS29C-containing Retromer to accessory proteins vital for regulating network function. By revealing added complexity in Retromer assembly and function, we provide new insight into Retromers potential as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

Here, using unbiased proteomics and computational modelling, we identify leucine rich melanocyte differentiation associated (LRMDA) as a novel Commander binding protein. Using recombinant protein reconstitution, we show that LRMDA simultaneously associates with Commander and active RAB32, and, by revealing that LRMDA and SNX17 share a common mechanism of Commander association, establish the mutually exclusive nature of RAB32-LRMDA-Commander and SNX17-Commander assemblies. From functional analysis in human melanocytes, we establish an essential role for RAB32-LRMDA-Commander in melanosome biogenesis and pigmentation and reveal a distinct functional role for SNX17-Commander in this organelle biogenesis pathway.

Recently, the development of alternative methods, such as CUT&Tag, have provided researchers with alternative strategies that eliminate the need for chromatin purification, and allow for in situ investigation of histone modifications and chromatin bound factors. Mindful of technical differences, we set out to investigate whether distinct chromatin modifications were equally compatible with these different chromatin interrogation techniques. We found that ChIP-Seq and CUT&Tag performed similarly for modifications known to reside at gene regulatory regions, such as promoters and enhancers, but major differences were observed when we assessed enrichment over heterochromatin-associated loci. Unlike ChIP-Seq, CUT&Tag detects robust levels of H3K9me3 at a substantial number of repetitive elements, with especially high sensitivity over evolutionarily young retrotransposons. IAPEz-int elements for example, exhibited underrepresentation in mouse ChIP-Seq datasets but strong enrichment using CUT&Tag. Additionally, we identified several euchromatin-associated proteins that co-purify with repetitive loci and are similarly depleted when applying ChIP-based methods. This study reveals that our current knowledge of chromatin states across the heterochromatin portions of the mammalian genome is extensively incomplete, largely due to limitations of ChIP-Seq. We also demonstrate that newer in situ chromatin fragmentation-based techniques, such as CUT&Tag and CUT&RUN, are more suitable for studying chromatin modifications over repetitive elements and retrotransposons.

HighlightsIn situ fragmentation overcomes biases produced by ChIP-Seq.

Heterochromatic regions of the genome are lost to the insoluble pellet during ChIP-Seq.

CUT&Tag allows for mapping chromatin features at young repetitive elements.

While the triggers of NETosis in atherosclerotic plaque are well-characterized, the mechanisms underlying NET degradation and clearance remain unclear. Moreover, the impact of impaired NET clearance on atherosclerosis progression have not been elucidated. Here we show that macrophages are critical for the release of DNases, which degrade NETs. We identified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress mediated activation of PERK-ATF4 pathway as a key driver of impaired macrophage DNase secretion, leading to delayed NET clearance and their persistence. Elevated NET levels trigger cleavage of the efferocytosis receptor Mertk leading to defective macrophage efferocytosis and exacerbation of plaque necrosis. Human atherosclerotic plaques and Ldlr-/- mice treated with ISRIB, a PERK inhibitor, show enhanced DNase secretion and clearance of NETs. Together, the identification of key mechanisms of NET clearance in atherosclerosis offers new therapeutic strategies to stabilize plaques.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

The hippocampus plays a key role in mismatch detection, but it is not known what information the hippocampus uses to form expectations. Here we show that the human hippocampus bases its expectations on episodic memories and not generalised schematic knowledge. Across three fMRI experiments, we demonstrate that the hippocampus is selectively engaged by mismatches with episodic memories of specific events. In contrast, mismatches with schematic knowledge activate regions of the Semantic Control and Multiple Demand Networks, as well as subcortical regions involved in prediction error signalling. Notably, mismatches with episodic memories also engage the Default Mode Network. Overall, our findings provide direct support for some models of learning via mismatch detection and refute models that propose the hippocampus plays a wider role as a more generalised mismatch detector.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

Voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.8, a pivotal driver of pain signaling, is a clinically validated target for the development of novel, non-addictive pain therapeutics. Small molecule inhibitors against NaV1.8 have shown promise in acute pain indications, but large clinical effect sizes have not yet been demonstrated and efficacy in chronic pain indications are lacking.

An alternative strategy to target NaV1.8 channels for analgesia is to reduce the number of channels that are present on nociceptor membranes. We generated a therapeutic heterobifunctional protein, named UbiquiNaV, that contains a NaV1.8-selective binding module and the catalytic subunit of the NEDD4 E3 Ubiquitin ligase. We show that UbiquiNav significantly reduces channel expression in the plasma membrane and reduces NaV1.8 currents in rodent sensory neurons. We demonstrate that UbiquiNaV is selective for NaV1.8 over other NaV isoforms and other components of the sensory neuronal electrogenisome. We then show that UbiquiNaV normalizes the distribution of NaV1.8 protein to distal axons, and that UbiquiNaV normalizes the neuronal hyperexcitability in in vitro models of inflammatory and chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. Our results serve as a blueprint for the design of therapeutics that leverage the selective ubiquitination of NaV1.8 channels for analgesia.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

We consider this an important question, as stem cell dynamics are essential for formation and maintenance of the entire epithelium. We used Drosophila to determine the impact of stem cell-specific loss of NF-{kappa}B on tissue regeneration upon chemical injury. We found that loss of NF-{kappa}B enhanced cell death, impaired enterocyte renewal and increased mortality. Mechanistically, we showed that inhibition of stem cell apoptosis is essential for NF-{kappa}B-dependent maintenance of cell viability and tissue repair.

This suggests that simple tractography techniques might not be sensitive enough to identify language dominance. Significant insights into the functional organization of the human brain may be achieved by considering networks and brain connectivity, providing more information about discrepancies in people with different hemispheric language dominance. In this study, we examined 285 healthy participants compare their structural connectomes at the whole-brain level and determine the networks responsible for the three different functional language lateralisation groups (typical, atypical and strongly atypical). Probabilistic tractography generated whole-brain tractograms, and white matter fibres were filtered according to anatomical Boolean guidelines. Connectivity matrices with nodes corresponding to supramodal sentence areas in the language atlas and edges weighted by fractional anisotropy (FA) were generated to compare the groups using graph theory and network-based statistic (NBS) approaches. We demonstrated that both atypical (bilateral) and strongly atypical (right-lateralised) lateralisation are characterised by heightened interhemispheric temporal connectivity. Post-hoc analyses showed that strongly atypical individuals exhibited increased temporo-frontal connectivity, while atypical individuals had enhanced temporal and frontal connectivity but lacked temporo-frontal connections. These connectivity patterns diverge from traditional models of hemispheric dominance, suggesting a reliance on integrated bilateral networks in atypically lateralised individuals. This reflects distinct neural mechanisms underlying atypical language organisation, departing from developmental trajectory of typical lateralisation and offering insights into cognitive flexibility and clinical applications.","NA","biorxiv",1738966087274

Whole-genome sequencing of S. sonnei isolated over the last three decades has revealed phylogenomic diversity within the population and the emergence of multiple lineages associated with distinct epidemiological patterns such as resistance to critical antimicrobials and/or transmission within different groups. However most experimental work on S. sonnei biology and pathogenicity has focused on a single laboratory strain (53G), which is phylogenetically distant from currently circulating strains. Here we introduce a set of 15 phylogenetically diverse and epidemiologically relevant S. sonnei isolates made available through publicly accessible culture collections as a resource for laboratory science. We present their complete whole-genome sequences, including the pINV invasion plasmid (missing from a large proportion of public genome data due to loss during laboratory culture). Finally, the characterisation and comparison of these complete genome sequences highlight evidence for ongoing adaptive evolution in S. sonnei, featuring the accumulation of insertion sequences, gene pseudogenisation and structural variation.

Significance as a BioResource to the communityGenomic analysis of Shigella has historically been challenging due to presence of hundreds of repetitive sequence elements (which can cause fragmented assemblies) and loss of the pINV invasion plasmid (essential to virulence) during laboratory culture. Furthermore, most experimental work on S. sonnei pathogenicity uses a lab strain that is phylogenetically distant from circulating isolates. To support S. sonnei experimental and in silico research and increase its relevance to current clinical problems, we report here the complete, high-quality genome sequences of 15 S. sonnei isolates, each selected to represent distinct sub-clades of epidemiological interest. We also make the corresponding strains publicly available in national reference culture collections.

Genome assemblies and Bakta annotations used in the analysis can be found in Figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28302986) together with Mauve multiple-sequence alignments for the chromosome and pINV plasmid sequences, and genome-scale metabolic models produced for each strain.

A proper error analysis for time series data leads to significantly wider confidence intervals than the official evaluation. In addition to vaccination and seasonality, only few NPIs - such as restrictions in public spaces - can be confidently associated with variations in [R](t), but even then effect sizes have large uncertainties. Furthermore, due to multicollinearity in NPI activation patterns, it is difficult to distinguish potential effects of NPIs in public spaces from other interventions that came into force early, such as physical distancing.

ME/CFS symptoms can range from mild to severe, and include immune system effects alongside incapacitating fatigue and post-exertional disease exacerbation. In this study, we examined immunological profiles of people living with ME/CFS by flow cytometry, focusing on cytotoxic cells, to determine whether people with mild/moderate (n= 43) or severe ME/CFS (n=53) expressed different immunological markers. We found that people with mild/moderate ME/CFS had increased expression of cytotoxic effector molecules alongside enhanced proportions of early-immunosenescence cells, determined by the CD28-CD57- phenotype, indicative of persistent viral infection. In contrast, people with severe ME/CFS had higher proportions of activated circulating lymphocytes, determined by CD69+ and CD38+ expression, and expressed more pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN{gamma}, TNF and IL-17, following stimulation in vitro, indicative of prolonged non-specific inflammation. These changes were consistent across different cell types including CD8+ T cells, mucosal associated invariant T cells and Natural Killer cells, indicating generalised altered cytotoxic responses across the innate and adaptive immune system. These immunological differences likely reflect different disease pathogenesis mechanisms occurring in the two clinical groups, opening up opportunities for the development of prognostic markers and stratified treatments.

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.
