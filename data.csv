We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1721772525772

Yet, viral tools to access and manipulate fine neuronal subtypes are still limited. Here, we performed systematic analysis of single cell genomic data to identify enhancer candidates for each of the cortical interneuron subtypes. We established a set of enhancer-AAV tools that are highly specific for distinct cortical interneuron populations and striatal cholinergic neurons. These enhancers, when used in the context of different effectors, can target (fluorescent proteins), observe activity (GCaMP) and manipulate (opto- or chemo-genetics) specific neuronal subtypes. We also validated our enhancer-AAV tools across species. Thus, we provide the field with a powerful set of tools to study neural circuits and functions and to develop precise and targeted therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Thereafter, JN.1 subvariants, such as LB.1 (JN.1.9.2.1), KP.2.3 (JN.1.11.1.2.3), and KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which convergently acquired a deletion of Serine at the 31st position in S (S:S31del) in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. We recently reported the virological features of JN.1 subvariants including KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3.2,3 Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.3.1.1. First, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3.1.1 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model4 based on genome surveillance data from Spain, the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, where this variant has spread as of June 2024. In Spain, the Re of KP.3.1.1 is over 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and even higher than those of KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein show higher Re for KP.3.1.1. However, it must be noted there is the possibility of overestimation in these countries due to more limited KP.3.1.1 sequence numbers. These results suggest that KP.3.1.1 will spread worldwide along with other JN.1 sublineages. We then assessed the virological properties of KP.3.1.1 using pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus of KP.3.1.1 had significantly higher infectivity than that of KP.3. Neutralization of KP.3.1.1 was tested using i) convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or EG.5, ii) convalescent sera after the infection with HK.3 or JN.1, and iii) sera after monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination. The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.3.1.1 was significantly lower than KP.3 (1.4-1.6-fold) in all four groups of convalescent sera tested. KP.3.1.1 also showed a 1.3-fold lower NT50 against XBB.1.5 vaccine sera than KP.3. Moreover, KP.3.1.1 showed stronger resistance with a 1.3-fold lower NT50 with statistical significances to the convalescent sera infected with EG.5 and HK.3 than KP.2.3. Altogether, KP.3.1.1 exhibited a higher Re, higher pseudovirus infectivity, and higher neutralization evasion than KP.3. These results align with our recent report that the JN.1 subvariants with S:S31del (e.g., KP.2.3 and LB.1) exhibited enhanced Re and immune evasion compared to the other JN.1 subvariants without S:S31del (e.g., JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3), highlighting the evolutionary significance of S:S31del in the JN.1 lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

However, genome-wide depletions of architectural proteins such as cohesin result in only limited changes in gene expression, despite a loss of contact domains and loops. Consequently, the role of cohesin and 3D contacts in enhancer function remains debated. Here, we developed CRISPRi of regulatory elements upon degron operation (CRUDO), a novel approach to measure how changes in contact frequency impact enhancer effects on target genes by perturbing enhancers with CRISPRi and measuring gene expression in the presence or absence of cohesin. We systematically perturbed all 1,039 candidate enhancers near five cohesin-dependent genes and identified 34 enhancer-gene regulatory interactions. Of 26 regulatory interactions with sufficient statistical power to evaluate cohesin dependence, 18 show cohesin-dependent effects. A decrease in enhancer-promoter contact frequency upon removal of cohesin is frequently accompanied by a decrease in the regulatory effect of the enhancer on gene expression, consistent with a contact-based model for enhancer function. However, changes in contact frequency and regulatory effects on gene expression vary as a function of distance, with distal enhancers (e.g., >50Kb) experiencing much larger changes than proximal ones (e.g., <50Kb). Because most enhancers are located close to their target genes, these observations can explain how only a small subset of genes -- those with strong distal enhancers -- are sensitive to cohesin. Together, our results illuminate how 3D contacts, influenced by both cohesin and genomic distance, tune enhancer effects on gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

Of these, the Portuguese man-o-war (Physalia) is uniquely suited to dispersal, sailing the ocean surface with a muscular crest. We tested the hypothesis of a single, panmictic Physalia population by sequencing 133 genomes, and found five distinct lineages, with multiple lines of evidence showing strong reproductive isolation despite range overlap. We then scored thousands of citizen-science photos and identified four recognizable morphologies linked to these lineages. Within lineages, we detected regionally endemic subpopulations, connected by winds and currents, and identified individual long-distance dispersal events. We find that, even in these sailing species, genetic variation is highly partitioned geographically across the open ocean.

SummaryThe open ocean is a vast and highly connected environment. The organisms that live there have a significant capacity for dispersal and few geographic boundaries to separate populations. Of these, the Portuguese man-o-war or bluebottle (genus Physalia) is uniquely suited to long-distance travel, using its gas-filled float and muscular crest to catch the wind and sail the sea surface. Physalia are distributed across the globe, and like many pelagic organisms, have been hypothesized to represent a massive, well-mixed population that extends across ocean basins. We tested this hypothesis by sequencing whole genomes of 133 samples collected from waters of over a dozen countries around the globe. Our results revealed five distinct lineages, with multiple lines of evidence indicating strong reproductive isolation, despite regions of range overlap. We combined these data with an independent dataset of thousands of images of Physalia uploaded to the citizen-science website inaturalist.org, which we scored for morphological characters including sail size, tentacle arrangement, and color. From these images, we identified four recognizable morphologies, described their geographical distribution, and linked them to four of the lineages identified with genomic data. We conclude there are at least four species, three of which correspond to species proposed by scientists in the 18th and 19th centuries: P. physalis, P utriculus, and P. megalista, along with one as yet unnamed species Physalia sp. from the Tasman Sea. Within each species, we observe significant population structure, with evidence of persistent subpopulations at a regional scale, as well as evidence for individual long-distance dispersal events. Our findings indicate that, instead of one well-mixed, cosmopolitan species, there are in fact multiple Physalia species with distinct but overlapping ranges, each made up of regionally endemic subpopulations that are connected by major ocean currents and wind patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness.

Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

The lack of a comprehensive understanding on the biology of the disease is paralleled by its dismal survival rates (5-20%). To overcome this challenge, we first identified and prioritized urgently needed resources for clinicians and researchers. Thus, we established genome-wide single-cell RNA-sequencing and bulk proteomic data of in vitro and in vivo-generated knockdown models of the pathognomonic DSRCT fusion oncoprotein (EWSR1::WT1) and combined them with an original systems-biology-based pipeline including patient data and the largest histology collection of DSRCTs and morphological mimics available to date. These novel tools were enriched with curated public datasets including patient- and cell line-derived ChIP-seq, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq studies resulting in a multi-model and multi-omic toolbox for discovery analyses. As a proof of concept, our approach revealed the alpha-2/delta subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex, CACNA2D2, as a highly overexpressed, super-enhancer driven, direct target of EWSR1::WT1. Single-cell and bulk-level analyses of patient samples and xenografted cell lines highlighted CACNA2D2 as a critical component of our newly established EWSR1::WT1 oncogenic signature, that can be employed to robustly identify DSRCT in reference sets. Finally, we show that CACNA2D2 is a highly sensitive and specific single biomarker for fast, simple, and cost-efficient diagnosis of DSRCT. Collectively, we establish a large-scale multi-omics dataset for this devastating disease and provide a blueprint of how such toolbox can be used to identify new and clinically relevant diagnostic markers, which may significantly reduce misdiagnoses, and thus improve patient care.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

How the physicochemical properties of the cytoplasm affect spindle architecture and size remains largely unknown. Using quantitative biochemistry in combination with adaptive feedback microscopy, we investigated mitotic cell and spindle morphology during neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells. While tubulin biochemistry and microtubule dynamics remained unchanged, spindles changed their scaling behaviour: in differentiating cells, spindles were significantly smaller than those in equally-sized undifferentiated stem cells. Integrating quantitative phase imaging, biophysical perturbations and theory, we found that as cells differentiated, their cytoplasm became more dilute. The concomitant decrease in free tubulin activated CPAP (centrosomal P4.1-associated protein) to enhance the centrosomal nucleation capacity. As a consequence, in differentiating cells, microtubule mass shifted towards spindle poles at the expense of the spindle bulk, explaining the differentiation-associated switch in spindle architecture. This study shows that cell state-specific cytoplasmic density tunes mitotic spindle architecture. Thus, we reveal physical properties of the cytoplasm as a major determinant in organelle size control.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

By recording from large ensembles of hippocampal place cells in combination with optogenetic manipulation of cortical input in freely behaving rats, we show here that the selection of hippocampal replay is governed by a novel self-avoidance principle. Following movement cessation, replay of the animal's past path is strongly avoided, while replay of the future path predominates. Moreover, when the past and future paths overlap, early replays avoid both and depict entirely different trajectories. Further, replays avoid self-repetition, on a shorter timescale compared to the avoidance of previous behavioral trajectories. Eventually, several seconds into the stopping period, replay of the past trajectory dominates. This temporal organization contrasts with established and recent predictions but is well-recapitulated by a symmetry-breaking attractor model of sequence generation in which individual neurons adapt their firing rates over time. However, while the model is sufficient to produce avoidance of recently traversed or reactivated paths, it requires an additional excitatory input into recently activated cells to produce the later window of past-dominance. We performed optogenetic perturbations to demonstrate that this input is provided by medial entorhinal cortex, revealing its role in maintaining a memory of past experience that biases hippocampal replay. Together, these data provide specific evidence for how hippocampal replays are generated.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

Their genomes encode extensive repertoires of secreted effector proteins that suppress host immunity. Here, we revised and analyzed the candidate secreted effector protein (CSEP) effectome of the barley powdery mildew fungus, Blumeria hordei (Bh) and identified seven CSEPs that are broadly conserved in powdery mildew fungal species, rendering them core effectors of these phytopathogens. We show that one of these, CSEP0214, interacts with the barley VPS18 protein, a core component of the CORVET and HOPS endosomal tethering complexes, mediating fusions of early endosomes and multivesicular bodies with the central vacuole, respectively. Overexpression of CSEP0214 and knockdown of either VPS18, HOPS-specific VPS41 or CORVET-specific VPS8 caused a block of the vacuolar pathway and the accumulation of the fluorescent vacuolar marker protein (SP)-RFP-AFVY in the endoplasmic reticulum. Co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid experiments suggest that CSEP0214 blocks the interaction of VPS18 and VPS16, which are both core components of CORVET as well as HOPS. Additionally, expression of CSEP0214 blocked the hypersensitive cell death response associated with resistance gene-mediated immunity in barley, indicating that endomembrane traffic is required for this process. It also prevented callose deposition in cell wall appositions at attack sites and encasements of fungal infection structures. Our results indicate that this powdery mildew core effector is an essential immunity suppressor.

We develop and use a high-throughput recruitment assay (HT-RNA-Recruit) to identify regulatory domains within human RBPs by recruiting over 30,000 protein tiles from 367 RBPs to a reporter mRNA. We discover over 100 unique RNA-regulatory effectors in 86 distinct RBPs, presenting evidence that RBPs contain functionally separable domains that dictate their post-transcriptional control of gene expression, and identify some with unique activity at 5 or 3UTRs. We identify some domains that downregulate gene expression both when recruited to DNA and RNA, and dissect their mechanisms of regulation. Finally, we build a synthetic RNA regulator that can stably maintain gene expression at desired levels that are predictable by a mathematical model. This work serves as a resource for human RNA-regulatory effectors and expands the synthetic repertoire of RNA-based genetic control tools.

Highlights- HT-RNA-Recruit identifies hundreds of RNA-regulatory effectors in human proteins.

This discrepancy may have a particular influence in fields like phylogeography, molecular ecology and conservation genetics, where the rise of genomics has increased the cost and technical expertise required to apply state-of-the-art methods. Here we ask whether a fundamental biogeographic pattern--the latitudinal gradient of species richness in tetrapods--is reflected in available reference genomes, an important data resource for various applications of molecular tools for biodiversity research and conservation. We also ask whether sequencing approaches differ between Global South and Global North, reviewing the last five years of conservation genetics research in four leading journals. We find that extant reference genomes are scarce relative to species richness at low latitudes, and that reduced-representation and whole-genome sequencing are disproportionately applied to taxa in the Global North. We conclude with recommendations to close this gap and improve international collaborations in biodiversity genomics.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

Despite best efforts, the occasional introduction of errors is inevitable, especially where the experimental data are of limited resolution. We have previously established a novel protein structure validation approach based on spotting inconsistencies between the residue contacts and distances observed in a structural model and those computationally predicted by methods such as AlphaFold 2. It is particularly well-suited to the detection of register errors. Importantly, the new approach is orthogonal to traditional methods based on stereochemistry or map-model agreement, and is resolution-independent. Here we identify thousands of likely register errors by scanning 3-5A resolution structures in the PDB. Unlike most methods, application of our approach yields suggested corrections to the register of affected regions which we show, even by limited implementation, lead to improved refinement statistics in the vast majority of cases. A few limitations and confounding factors such as fold-switching proteins are characterised, but we expect our approach to have broad application in spotting potential issues in current accessions and, through its implementation and distribution in CCP4, helping ensure the accuracy of future deposits.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

Previous studies, including our own research, have shown that specific interneuron subtypes are closely associated with particular pyramidal neuron types, forming stereotyped local inhibitory microcircuits. However, the developmental processes that establish these precise networks are not well understood. Here we show that pyramidal neuron types are instrumental in driving the terminal differentiation and maintaining the survival of specific associated interneuron subtypes. In a wild-type cortex, the relative abundance of different interneuron subtypes aligns precisely with the pyramidal neuron types to which they synaptically target. In Fezf2 mutant cortex, characterized by the absence of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons and an expansion of layer 6 intratelencephalic neurons, we observed a corresponding decrease in associated layer 5b interneurons and an increase in layer 6 subtypes. Interestingly, these shifts in composition are achieved through mechanisms specific to different interneuron types. While SST interneurons adjust their abundance to the change in pyramidal neuron prevalence through the regulation of programmed cell death, parvalbumin interneurons alter their identity. These findings illustrate two key strategies by which the dynamic interplay between pyramidal neurons and interneurons allows local microcircuits to be sculpted precisely. These insights underscore the precise roles of extrinsic signals from pyramidal cells in the establishment of interneuron diversity and their subsequent integration into local cortical microcircuits.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

Study DesignSixty-six participants with psychotic disorders were longitudinally assessed soon after inpatient admission, at discharge, and at 3- and 6-months. Psychosis symptoms were measured with semi-structured interviews and standardized scales. Recordings were collected from paragraph reading, fluency, picture description, and open-ended tasks. Longitudinal relationships between psychosis symptoms and 357 automated speech and language features were analyzed using a single component score and as individual features, using linear mixed models.

Study ResultsAll three psychosis symptom domains demonstrated significant longitudinal relationships with the single component score. Thought Disorder was particularly related to features describing more subordinated constructions, less efficient identification of picture elements, and decreased semantic distance between sentences. Negative Symptoms was related to features describing decreased speech complexity. Positive Symptoms appeared heterogeneous, with Suspiciousness relating to greater use of nouns, and Hallucinations related to decreased semantic distances. These relationships were largely robust to interactions with gender and race. However, interactions with timepoint revealed variable relationships during different phases of illness (acute vs. stable).

ConclusionsAutomated speech and language features show promise as scalable, objective markers of psychosis severity. The three symptom domains appear to be distinguishable with different features. Detailed attention to clinical setting and patient population is needed to optimize clinical translation; there are substantial implications for facilitating differential diagnosis, improving psychosis outcomes and enhancing therapeutic discovery.","NA","medrxiv",1721772525772

Climate change is severely increasing the likelihood of such stresses to occur individually, sequentially, or simultaneously. However, the understanding of acclimation to abiotic stress in crops in general, especially with multiple stresses, is still very limited. Here, we present a comprehensive one month-long molecular and physiological high-throughput profiling of potato (Solanum tuberosum, cv.

Acclimation time-responses were monitored via daily phenomic analysis and leaf samples were processed for multi-omics spanning from transcriptomics to proteomics and hormonomics. Additionally, critical metabolites of tuber samples were analysed at the end of the period. To facilitate the multi-omics analyses, the dataset was integrated with prior knowledge, which is indispensable for development of high-throughput pipelines in agricultural research. Waterlogging had the most immediate and dramatic effects, with responses similar to drought stress. In addition, we observed distinct stress signatures at multiple molecular levels in response to heat or drought and to a combination of both. In general, there was a downregulation of photosynthesis at different molecular levels, accumulation of minor amino acids and diverse stress induced hormones. Our integrative multi-omics analysis provides global insights into plant stress responses, facilitating improved breeding strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

Underlying this observation is the concept that the kinetochore is spatially linked with the pericentromere where sister-chromatids are most tightly cohered. Here, we found an unconventional pericentromere specification with sister chromatids mainly cohered at a chromosome end, spatially separated from the kinetochore in Peromyscus mouse oocytes. This distal locus enriched cohesin protectors, such as the Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) and PP2A, at a higher level compared to its centromere/kinetochore region, acting as the primary site for sister-chromatid cohesion. Chromosomes with the distal cohesion site exhibited enhanced cohesin protection at anaphase I compared to those without it, implying that these distal cohesion sites may have evolved to ensure sister-chromatid cohesion during meiosis. In contrast, mitotic cells enriched CPC only near the kinetochore and the distal locus was not cohered between sister chromatids, suggesting a meiosis-specific mechanism to protect cohesin at this distal locus. We found that this distal locus corresponds to an additional centromeric satellite block, located far apart from the centromeric satellite block that builds the kinetochore. Several Peromyscus species carry chromosomes with two such centromeric satellite blocks. Analyses on three Peromyscus species revealed that the internal satellite consistently assembles the kinetochore in both mitosis and meiosis, whereas the distal satellite selectively enriches cohesin protectors in meiosis to promote sister-chromatid cohesion at that site. Thus, our study demonstrates that pericentromere specification is remarkably flexible and can control chromosome segregation in a cell-type and context dependent manner.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

This outbreak is associated with the 2.3.4.4b clade of influenza A, and it is as yet unclear what factors have contributed to its spread at the continental scale. In this study we use Bayesian additive regression trees, a machine learning method designed for probabilistic modelling of complex nonlinear phenomena, to construct species distribution models for HPAI presence across Europe. Using these models we identify factors driving the geospatial distribution of cases and project the distribution of risk across Europe. Our models are stratified by time to capture both seasonal changes in risk patterns and shifts in HPAI epidemiology associated with the introduction of the 2.3.4.4b clade. While previous studies have aimed to predict HPAI presence from physical geography, here we explicitly consider the impact of wild bird ecology by including in our model estimates of bird species richness, abundance of specific high-risk bird taxa, and ""species-trait abundance indices"" describing the total abundance of species with high-risk behavioural and/or dietary traits. Our projections point to a shift in concentration of risk towards cold, low-lying regions of coastal northwest Europe associated with 2.3.4.4b, with the margins of uncertainty extending that risk further into central and eastern Europe. In coastal northwest Europe specifically, we predict a persistence of high risk throughout the year.

This is a powerful approach since it is a multi-region measurement, but because the imaging is done post-mortem, each animal only provides one set of counts. Experiments are expensive and since cells are counted by imaging and aligning a large number of brain sections, they are time-intensive. The resulting datasets tend to be under-sampled with fewer animals than brain regions. As a consequence, these data are a challenge for traditional statistical approaches. We demonstrate that hierarchical Bayesian methods are well suited to these data by presenting a  standard partially-pooled Bayesian model for multi-region cell-count data and applying it to two example datasets. For both datasets the Bayesian model outperformed standard parallel t-tests. Overall, the Bayesian approachs ability to capture nested data and its rigorous handling of uncertainty in under-sampled data can substantially improve inference for cell-count data.

Significance StatementCell-count data is important for studying neuronal activation and gene expression relating to the complex processes in the brain. However, the difficulty and expense of data collection means that such datasets often have small sample sizes. Many routine analyses are not well-suited, especially if there is high variability among animals and surprising outliers in the data. Here we describe a multilevel, mixed effects Bayesian model for these data and show that the Bayesian approach improves inferences compared to the usual approach for two different cell-count datasets with different data characteristics.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

This has translational significance because a standard treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prolonged exposure therapy. However, few studies have investigated psilocybins potential effect in fear learning paradigms. More specifically, the extents to which dose, timing of administration, and serotonin receptors may influence psilocybins effect on fear extinction are not understood. In this study, we used an auditory delay fear conditioning paradigm to determine the effects of psilocybin on fear extinction, extinction retention, and fear renewal in male and female mice. Psilocybin robustly enhances fear extinction when given acutely prior to testing for all doses tested. Psilocybin exerts long-term effects to elevate extinction retention and suppress fear renewal in a novel context, though these changes were sensitive to dose. Administration of psilocybin prior to fear learning or immediately after extinction yielded no change in behavior, indicating that concurrent extinction experience is necessary for the drugs effects. Co-treatment with a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist blocked psilocybins effects for extinction, extinction retention and fear renewal, whereas 5-HT1A receptor antagonism attenuated only the effect on fear renewal. Collectively, these results highlight dose, context, and serotonin receptors as crucial factors in psilocybins ability to facilitate fear extinction. The study provides preclinical evidence to support investigating psilocybin as a pharmacological adjunct for extinction-based therapy for PTSD.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

Here, we conducted an RNA-seq analysis of mice subjected to 20 compound treatments in the Interventions Testing Program (ITP). By integrating it with the data from over 4,000 rodent tissues representing aging and responses to genetic, pharmacological, and dietary interventions with established survival data, we developed robust multi-tissue transcriptomic biomarkers of mortality, capable of quantifying aging and change in lifespan in both short-lived and long-lived models. These tools were further extended to single-cell and human data, demonstrating common mechanisms of molecular aging across cell types and species. Via a network analysis, we identified and annotated 26 co-regulated modules of aging and longevity across tissues, and developed interpretable module-specific clocks that capture aging- and mortality-associated phenotypes of functional components, including, among others, inflammatory response, mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, and extracellular matrix organization. These tools captured and characterized acceleration of biological age induced by progeria models and chronic diseases in rodents and humans. They also revealed rejuvenation induced by heterochronic parabiosis, early embryogenesis, and cellular reprogramming, highlighting universal signatures of mortality, shared across models of rejuvenation and age-related disease. They included Cdkn1a and Lgals3, whose human plasma levels further demonstrated a strong association with all-cause mortality, disease incidence and risk factors, such as obesity and hypertension.

It is well established that the phenotype of senescent cells is highly heterogeneous and influenced by their cell type and senescence-inducing stimulus. Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing studies identified heterogeneity within senescent cell populations. However, proof of functional differences between such subpopulations is lacking. To identify functionally distinct senescent cell subpopulations, we employed high-content image analysis to measure senescence marker expression in primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. We found that G2-arrested senescent cells feature higher senescence marker expression than G1-arrested senescent cells. To investigate functional differences, we compared IL-6 secretion and response to ABT263 senolytic treatment in G1 and G2 senescent cells. We determined that G2-arrested senescent cells secrete more IL-6 and are more sensitive to ABT263 than G1-arrested cells. We hypothesize that cell cycle dependent DNA content is a key contributor to the heterogeneity within senescent cell populations. This study demonstrates the existence of functionally distinct senescent subpopulations even in culture. This data provides the first evidence of selective cell response to senolytic treatment among senescent cell subpopulations. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of considering the senescent cell heterogeneity in the development of future senolytic therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

This bias introduces spurious associations between disease progression and genetic variants that are truly only associated with disease incidence. Methods of statistical adjustment to reduce this bias have been published, but rely on assumptions regarding the genetic correlation of disease incidence and disease progression which are likely to be violated in many human diseases. MR-Horse is a recently published Bayesian method to estimate the parameters of a general model of genetic pleiotropy in the setting of Mendelian Randomisation. We adapted this method to provide bias-reduced GWAS estimates of associations with disease progression, robust to the genetic correlation of disease incidence and disease progression and robust to the presence of pleiotropic variants with effects on both incidence and progression. We applied this adapted method to simulated GWAS of disease incidence and progression with pleiotropic variants and varying degrees of genetic correlation. When significant genetic correlation was present, the MR-Horse method produced less biased estimates than unadjusted analyses or analyses adjusted using other existing methods. Type 1 error rates with the MR-Horse method were consistently below the nominal 5% level, at the expense of a modest reduction in power. We then applied this method to summary statistics from the CKDGen consortium GWAS of kidney function decline. MR-Horse attenuated the effects of variants with known likely biased effects in the CKDGen GWAS, whilst preserving effects at loci with likely true effects.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

Aside from variation of the prion protein itself, molecular risk factors are not well understood. Prion and prion-like mechanisms are thought to underpin common neurodegenerative disorders meaning that the elucidation of mechanisms could have broad relevance. Herein we sought to further develop our understanding of the factors that confer risk of sCJD using a systematic gene prioritization and functional interpretation pipeline based on multiomic integrative analyses. We integrated the published sCJD genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics with publicly available bulk brain and brain cell type gene and protein expression datasets. We performed multiple transcriptome and proteome-wide association studies (TWAS & PWAS) and Bayesian genetic colocalization analyses between sCJD risk association signals and multiple brain molecular quantitative trait loci signals. We then applied our systematic gene prioritization pipeline on the obtained results and nominated prioritized sCJD risk genes with risk-associated molecular mechanisms in a transcriptome and proteome-wide manner. Genetic upregulation of both gene and protein expression of syntaxin-6 (STX6) in the brain was associated with sCJD risk in multiple datasets, with a risk-associated gene expression regulation specific to oligodendrocytes. Similarly, increased gene and protein expression of protein disulfide isomerase family A member 4 (PDIA4), involved in the unfolded protein response, was linked to increased disease risk, particularly in excitatory neurons. Protein expression of mesencephalic astrocyte derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), involved in protection against endoplasmic reticulum stress and sulfatide binding (linking to the enzyme in the final step of sulfatide synthesis, encoded by sCJD risk gene GAL3ST1), was identified as protective against sCJD. In total 32 genes were prioritized into two tiers based on level of evidence and confidence for further studies. This study provides insights into the genetically-associated molecular mechanisms underlying sCJD susceptibility and prioritizes several specific hypotheses for exploration beyond the prion protein itself and beyond the previously highlighted sCJD risk loci through the newly prioritized sCJD risk genes and mechanisms. These findings highlight the importance of glial cells, sulfatides and the excitatory neuron unfolded protein response in sCJD pathogenesis.","NA","medrxiv",1721772525772

Despite this general heterogeneity, several common factors have been identified. For example, nearly all patients show pathological accumulations of phosphorylated TDP-43 protein in affected regions of the motor cortex and spinal cord. Moreover, large patient cohort studies have revealed that most patient samples can be grouped into a small number of ALS subtypes, as defined by their transcriptomic profiles. These ALS molecular subtypes can be grouped by whether postmortem motor cortex samples display signatures of: mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress (ALS-Ox), microglial activation and neuroinflammation (ALS-Glia), or dense TDP-43 pathology and associated transposable element de-silencing (ALS-TE). In this study, we have built a deep layer ALS neural network classifier (DANcer) that has learned to accurately assign patient samples to these ALS subtypes, and which can be run on either bulk or single-cell datasets. Upon applying this classifier to an expanded ALS patient cohort from the NYGC ALS Consortium, we show that ALS Molecular Subtypes are robust across clinical centers, with no new subtypes appearing in a cohort that has quadrupled in size. Signatures from two of these molecular subtypes strongly correlate with disease duration: ALS-TE signatures in cortex and ALS-Glia signatures in spinal cord, revealing molecular correlates of clinical features. Finally, we use single nucleus RNA sequencing to reveal the cell type-specific contributions to ALS subtype, as determined by our single-cell classifier (scDANCer). Single-cell transcriptomes reveal that ALS molecular subtypes are recapitulated in neurons and glia, with both ALS-wide shared alterations in each cell type as well as ALS subtype-specific alterations. In summary, ALS molecular subtypes: (1) are robust across large cohorts of sporadic and familial ALS patient samples, (2) represent a combination of cellular, genetic, and pathological features, and (3) correlate with clinical features of ALS.

While hyphal transcriptional networks have been the subject of intense study, relatively little is known about post-transcriptional regulation. Previous work reported that P Body (PB) factors Dhh1 and Edc3 were required for virulence and filamentation, suggesting an essential role for post-transcriptional regulation of these processes. However, the molecular roles of these factors have not been determined. To further study the function of PB factors in filamentation, we generated homozygous deletions of DHH1 and EDC3 in the prototrophic strain SC5314 using CRISPR-Cas9. Homozygous dhh1 deletion strongly impaired growth and altered filamentation, in addition to exhibiting unusual colony morphology in response to heat stress.

Using RNA-seq, we found DHH1 deletion disrupts the regulation of thousands of genes under both yeast and hyphal growth conditions. This included upregulation of many stress response genes in the absence of stress, similar to deletion of the S. cerevisiae DHH1 homolog. In contrast, we found EDC3 was not required for heat tolerance or filamentation. These results support a model in which DHH1, but not EDC3, represses hyphal stress response transcripts in yeast and remodels the transcriptome during filamentation. Our paper supports distinct requirements for specific mRNA decay factors, bolstering evidence for post-transcriptional regulation of filamentation in C. albicans.

Author summaryIn the dimorphic fungal pathogen C. albicans, the hyphal phenotype corresponds with pathogenicity. While transcriptional control of hyphal growth has been extensively studied, comparatively little is known about post-transcriptional regulation of this significant morphological shift. PB factors are associated with mRNA decay and translational repression. Here we investigate the roles of two PB factors in growth, filamentation, and gene expression. Although deletion of PB factor EDC3 did not impact growth or filamentation, dhh1{Delta}/{Delta} had greatly impaired growth and heat tolerance as well as unusual hyphal phenotypes. Additionally, we found that the transcriptomes of dhh1{Delta}/{Delta} yeast and hyphae were highly dysregulated. The extensive transcriptomic impacts of the absence of Dhh1 correlated with our phenotypic findings. Stress-associated genes were induced under non-stress conditions and the filamentation response was blunted under physiologically relevant in vitro conditions. We demonstrate that mRNA decay factors play distinct roles in regulating C. albicans morphology and that Dhh1 contributes to environmentally appropriate expression of the stress response and hyphal growth.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

The resulting metabolic blockade triggers autoinflammatory responses, primarily due to deficient isoprenoid intermediates such as geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). This first reported pilot study evaluates the safety and efficacy of dietary geranylgeraniol supplementation (GG) in three patients with HIDS. Over three months, GG supplementation showed no liver toxicity and did not alter lipid profiles. Although GG did not rise the plasma levels of GGPP, the plasma proteomics showed significant changes induced by GG. Proteomic analysis further revealed that GG supplementation can reverse some of the features of HIDS-specific plasma protein signature, highlighting its potential to modulate inflammation and protein prenylation pathways. These findings suggest that GG supplementation could be a promising metabolic intervention to mitigate inflammation in HIDS, warranting further, more targeted investigation in larger clinical trials.","NA","medrxiv",1721772525772

In mice, iNKT1c cells showed potent CD1d-dependent and -independent antitumor functions, with responses influenced by NK receptors. IL-15 enhances their cytolytic activity, while retinoic acid is essential for their generation. In humans, terminally differentiated CD57+ iNKT cells showed marked NK-receptor expression and most effectively killed C1R tumor cells in vitro. These cells appeared activated/exhausted within tumors of non-small cell lung cancer patients. Additionally, a central memory-like CD62L+ CD4- iNKT subset efficiently expanded and generated cytotoxic CD57+ iNKT cells in vitro, making them an appealing candidate for ACT.

To address this issue, we recorded the spiking activity of single SC neurons while photoactivating cortical areas in awake head-fixed Thy1-ChR2 rats. We classified 309 neurons that responded significantly into 8 clusters according to the response dynamics. Among them, neurons with monophasic excitatory responses (7-12 ms latency) that returned to baseline within 20 ms were commonly observed in the optic and intermediate gray layers of centromedial and centrolateral SC. In contrast, neurons with complex polyphasic responses were commonly observed in the deep layers of the anterolateral SC. Cross-correlation analysis suggested that the complex pattern could be only partly explained by an internal circuit of the deep gray layer. Our results indicate that medial to centrolateral SC neurons simply relay cortical activity, whereas neurons in the deep layers of the anterolateral SC dynamically integrate inputs from the cortex, SNr, CN, and local circuits. These findings suggest a spatial gradient in SC integration, with a division of labor between simple relay circuits and those integrating complex dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

Here we investigated the function of FGF in a stem cell model for human gastrulation known as a 2D gastruloid. We found a ring of FGF-dependent ERK activity that closely follows the emergence of primitive streak (PS)-like cells but expands further inward. We showed that this ERK activity pattern is required for PS-like differentiation and that loss of PS-like cells upon FGF receptor inhibition can be rescued by directly activating ERK. We further demonstrated that the ERK-ring depends on localized activation of basally localized FGF receptors (FGFR) by endogenous FGF gradients. We confirm and extend previous studies in analyzing expression of FGF pathway components, showing the main receptor to be FGFR1 and the key ligands FGF2/4/17, similar to the human and monkey embryo but different from the mouse. In situ hybridization and scRNA-seq revealed that FGF4 and FGF17 expression colocalize with the PS marker TBXT but only FGF17 is maintained in nascent mesoderm and endoderm. FGF4 and FGF17 reduction both reduced ERK activity and differentiation to PS-like cells and their derivatives, indicating overlapping function. Thus, we have identified a previously unknown role for FGF-dependent ERK signaling in 2D gastruloids and possibly the human embryo, driven by a mechanism where FGF4 and FGF17 signal through basally localized FGFR1 to induce PS-like cells.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

RNF168 activity is triggered by DSB signaling cascades, reportedly through K63-linked poly-ubiquitylation of linker histone H1. However, direct experimental evidence of this mechanism has been elusive, primarily due to the lack of methods to specifically poly-ubiquitylate H1. Here, we developed a versatile click-chemistry approach to covalently link multiple proteins in a site-specific, controlled, and stepwise manner. Applying this method, we synthesized H1 constructs bearing triazole-linked di-ubiquitin on four DNA repair-associated ubiquitylation hotspots (H1KxUb2, at K17, 46, 64 and 96). Integrated into nucleosome arrays, the H1KxUb2 variants stimulated H2A ubiquitylation by RNF168 in a position-dependent manner, with H1K17Ub2 showing the strongest RNF168 activation effect. Moreover, we show that di-ubiquitin binding is the driving force underlying RNF168 recruitment, introducing H1K17Ub2 into living U-2 OS cells. Together, our results support the hypothesis of poly-ubiquitylated H1 guiding RNF168 recruitment to DSB sites. Moreover, we demonstrate how the streamlined synthesis of H1KxUb2 variants enables mechanistic studies into RNF168 regulation, with potential implications for its inhibition in susceptible cancers.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

Understanding how behavioral and artifactual variation in these populations relates to climate change and ecology is vital to correctly interpreting the archaeological record, especially given the major climatic and cultural fluctuations during the Pleistocene. Bifacially flaked core tools - which technologically define the tradition - are sometimes regionally and periodically absent within the Acheuleans boundaries. Biface presence is broadly associated with, but rarely formally tested against, environmental conditions. Here, we investigate biface presence/absence and climate/ecological variation at a continental scale between 726 and 130ka. Using a comprehensive sample of European sites matched to paleoenvironmental reconstructions, we demonstrate clear associations between Acheulean presence and specific environments. Acheulean habitat suitability was most strongly associated with mean winter temperatures above -5/-10{degrees}C, and precipitation of the driest month above 15 mm. Two major habitats, warm forest/woodland and shrubland, comprised the European Acheulean niche. Acheulean spatial presence was reconstructed through time: during interglacial and glacial periods it covered most of southwestern Europe, but extended along northern coastal routes during interglacials. Central and Eastern Europe always remained unsuitable. The Acheulean was excluded from areas experiencing both low winter temperatures and low summer precipitation, but reached areas including only one of those two climatic extremes, suggesting seasonal migrations to avoid the harshest seasons. These analyses explain current Acheulean site distributions in Europe and suggest strong links between handaxes, specific ecological conditions, and prehistoric demographic patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

Lipotoxicity exerts detrimental effects on pancreatic islet {beta}-cells by reducing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), altering {beta}-cell transcriptional identity, and promoting apoptosis. While {beta}-cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEV) have been shown to contribute to {beta}-cell failure in T2D, their specific role in lipotoxicity-mediated {beta}-cell failure remains to be elucidated. In this work, we demonstrate that lipotoxicity enhances the release of sEVs from {beta}-cells, which exhibit altered proteomic and lipidomic profiles. These lipotoxic sEV induce {beta}-cell dysfunction in healthy mouse and human islets and trigger significant islet transcriptional changes, including the upregulation of genes associated with the TGF{beta}/Smad3 pathway, as noted by RNA sequencing. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of the TGF{beta}I/II receptor improved lipotoxic sEV-induced {beta}-cell dysfunction, underscoring their involvement in activating the TGF{beta}/Smad3 pathway during this process.

While thylakoid membranes are sites of translation, evidence in the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii supports translation also on non-canonical membranes in a discrete translation-zone in the chloroplast. To characterize the membranous platforms for translation and the biogenesis of thylakoid membrane, we profiled membranes during chloroplast development, using the yellow-in-the-dark 1 mutant, and carried out proteomic analyses on membranes of interest. The results support roles of two membrane types in preliminary and ongoing stages of translation: a low-density membrane and a denser chloroplast translation membrane, respectively.

Here, we took a comparative evolutionary approach to understand how P. syringae infects distantly related plants. We identify broad host P. syringae isolates causing significant disease in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, the fern Ceratopteris richardii, and the flowering plant Nicotiana benthamiana, which last shared a common ancestor over 500 million years ago. We demonstrate that phytotoxin enriched isolates belonging to the phylogroup 2 clade of the P. syringae species complex are particularly virulent in non-flowering plants, relying on a combination of type-3 secreted effector proteins and the lipopeptide phytotoxin syringomycin. The application of purified syringomycin promotes necrosis in diverse host tissues and activates conserved genes associated with redox regulation and cell death. Toxin-deficient phylogroups normally unable to infect Marchantia thalli exhibit enhanced bacterial growth when supplemented with exogenous syringomycin, further highlighting its role as a host-range defining factor in Pseudomonas.

A popular MPI is the flash-lag effect, where a static object briefly presented in spatiotemporal alignment with a moving object, is perceived in a position behind the moving object. Recently, Cottier et al. (2023) observed that there are stable individual differences in the magnitude of these illusions, and possibly even their direction. To investigate the possible neural correlates of these individual differences, the present study explored whether a trait-like component of brain activity, individual alpha frequency (IAF), could predict individual illusion magnitude. Previous reports have found some correlations between IAF and perceptual tasks. Participants (N=61) viewed the flash-lag effect (motion and luminance), Frohlich effect, flash-drag effect, flash-grab effect, motion-induced position shift, twinkle-goes effect, and the flash-jump effect. In a separate session, five minutes of eyes-open and eyes-closed resting state EEG data was recorded. Correlation analyses revealed no evidence for a correlation between IAF and the magnitude of any MPIs. Overall, these results suggest that IAF does not represent a mechanism underlying MPIs, and that no single shared mechanism underlies these effects. This suggests that discrete sampling at alpha frequency is unlikely to be responsible for any of these illusions.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

Since first characterized, they have been classed as distinct projection neurons based on size and location: laminarly-arranged mitral cells with a diameter larger than 20m in the mitral layer (ML), and smaller tufted cells spread across both the ML and external plexiform layer (EPL). Recent in vivo work has shown that these neurons encode complementary olfactory information, akin to parallel channels in other sensory systems. Yet, many ex vivo studies still collapse them into a single class, mitral/tufted, when describing their physiological properties and impact on circuit function. Using immunohistochemistry and whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology in fixed or acute slices from adult mice, we attempted to align in vivo and ex vivo data and test a soma size-based classifier of OB projection neurons using passive and intrinsic firing properties. We found that there is no clear separation between cell types based on passive or active properties. Rather, there is a heterogeneous continuum with three loosely clustered subgroups: EPL tufted cells, putative tufted cells, and putative mitral cells in the ML. These findings illustrate the large functional heterogeneity present within the OB projection neurons and complement existing literature highlighting how heterogeneity in sensory systems is preponderant and possibly used in the OB to decode complex olfactory information.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

Untargeted AAV vectors require high doses to achieve therapeutic efficacy, which is associated with toxic off-target impacts and increased therapeutic costs. The ability to reprogram existing AAV vectors to selectively transduce target tissues is essential to develop next-generation human gene therapies that are safer, more efficacious, and less expensive. Using selective and high-affinity antibodies and antibody-like proteins to retarget existing AAV vectors to bind novel cell-surface receptors offers an attractive and modular approach to reprogram their tropism. However, attaching these proteins onto the complex and delicate AAV capsids remains challenging. Here, we report a versatile chemical strategy to covalently attach recombinant proteins onto the capsid of AAV, using a combination of genetic code expansion and bioorthogonal conjugation chemistry. This method is efficient, and allows precise control over the site and stoichiometry of protein attachment onto the AAV capsid, enabling systematic optimization of the resulting conjugate. Using this approach, we generated conjugates of AAV2 with an anti-HER2 nanobody and a full-length anti-HER2 IgG, which show highly efficient and selective gene delivery into HER2+ cancer cells. Remarkably, the optimized AAV2-nanobody conjugate facilitated efficient transduction of HER2+ tumor xenograft in mice with little off-target gene expression, including in the liver. Programmable synthesis of AAV-protein conjugates using this method offers a promising new strategy to rationally engineer next-generation gene therapy vectors.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

The extent of such local adaptation has been shown to depend on a balance between divergent selection and gene flow, but also on other factors such as phenotypic plasticity or the genetic architecture of traits. Here, we explore the role of life history in this process. We develop a quantitative genetics model and run individual-based simulations to contrast the evolution of local adaptation between short- and long-lived species. We show that life history does not have a unidirectional effect on local adaptation. Instead, local adaptation varies with a species life cycle and how this cycle modulates the scheduling of selection and dispersal among stage classes. When a longer generation time is associated with more frequent events of selection than dispersal, local adaptation is more pronounced in long-lived than in short-lived species. If otherwise dispersal occurs more frequently than selection, long-lived species evolve weaker local adaptation. Our simulations confirm these findings and further highlight how the scheduling of selection and dispersal shape additive genetic variance, effective dispersal between patches, and the genetic response at quantitative trait loci. Taken together, our results suggest that the effect of longevity on local adaptation depends on the specifics of a species life cycle, potentially explaining why current meta-analyses have not consistently detected this effect.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

For that reason, publishing images of individuals affected by pathogenic variants in disease-associated genes has been an important part of scientific communication. Furthermore, medical imaging data is also crucial for teaching and training artificial intelligence methods such as GestaltMatcher. However, medical data is often sparsely available and sharing patient images involves risks related to privacy and re-identification. Therefore, we explored whether generative neural networks can be used to synthesize accurate portraits for rare disorders. We modified a StyleGAN architecture and trained it to produce random condition-specific portraits for multiple disorders. We present a technique that generates a sharp and detailed average patient portrait for a given disorder. We trained our GestaltGAN on the 20 most frequent disorders from the GestaltMatcher database. We used REAL-ESRGAN to increase the resolution of portraits from the training data with low quality and colorized black-and-white images. The training data was aligned and cropped to achieve a uniform format. To augment the models understanding of human facial features, an unaffected class was introduced to the training data.

We tested the validity of our generated portraits with 63 human experts. Our findings demonstrate the models proficiency in generating photorealistic portraits that capture the characteristic features of a disorder but preserve the patients privacy. Overall, the output from our approach holds promise for various applications, including visualizations for publications, educational materials, as well as augmenting training data for deep learning.","NA","medrxiv",1721772525772

In Medicago truncatula, their action is mediated by the Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase COMPACT ROOT ARCHITECTURE 2 (CRA2). As most land plants, under inorganic phosphate (Pi) limitation, M. truncatula establishes another root endosymbiotic interaction with arbuscular fungi, the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (AMS). Because this interaction is beneficial for the plant but has a high energetic cost, it is tightly controlled by host plants to limit AMS infections mainly depending on Pi availability. We show in this study that the expression of a subset of CEP encoding genes is enhanced in the low Pi conditions that favour AMS colonization, and that overexpression of the low Pi-induced MtCEP1 gene, previously shown to promote the nitrogen-fixing root nodulation symbiosis, enhances the AMS colonization from the initial entry point of the fungi. Conversely, a loss-of-function mutation of the CRA2 receptor required for mediating CEP peptides action decreases the AMS interaction capacity from the same initial fungal entry stage. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the cra2 mutant is negatively affected in the regulation of key Pi transport and response genes as well as in the biosynthesis of strigolactone (SL) hormones that are required for establishing the AMS interaction. Accordingly, SL contents were drastically decreased in cra2 mutant roots. Overall, we showed that the CEP/CRA2 pathway promotes, in legume plants, both root nodulation and AMS depending on soil mineral nutrients availability.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

Consequently, they typically grow-up lacking an accurate understanding of what it means to be autistic on both a collective and individual level (2). Without this foundational knowledge, childrens understanding of autism is garnered from how others perceive their autism, resulting in an understanding of autism, and of themselves, that is inherently negative (3). This lack of appreciation of their own individual needs, also denies them the important self-understanding afforded by the diagnosis in the first instance, alongside the opportunity to effectively self-advocate for themselves when these needs go unmet.

AimsHere we sought to directly assess the benefit of a pre-recorded, online autistic-led psychoeducation course about autism and the lived experience of being autistic (i.e.,  NeuroBears https://www.pandasonline.org), for childrens understanding of autism and their autistic experiences, their feeling about being autistic, their communication with others about their autistic experiences, and their confidence to self-advocate for their needs.

MethodsUsing a concurrent embedded mixed-methods, repeated-measures design, autistic children (aged 8-14 years), completed a bespoke questionnaire exploring the above topics, both before and after completing NeuroBears at home with a nominated safe adult. A total of 63 children (mean age=10.57 years) completed sufficient content to be included in the analysis.

ResultsSignificant benefit was observed across a range of areas, including a significant improvement in the childrens knowledge and understanding of being autistic and of their unique strengths and challenges, a significant rebalancing of how the children viewed being autistic, evidence of emerging positive autistic identities and a growing sense of belongingness, a significant change in the childrens abilities to communicate about being autistic, and evidence of strengthening self-advocacy skills.

ConclusionLearning about autism in a neutral and non-stigmatizing manner, and presented through the lens of autistic lived experience, conferred numerous benefits on autistic childrens self-understanding, emergent autistic identity, sense of belonging, and on their communication/self-advocacy skills. Future work is needed to establish the downstream benefits on wellbeing and quality of life.","NA","medrxiv",1721772525772

Here, we have determined structures of coupled transcription-translation complexes having mRNA spacers between RNAP and ribosome longer than the maximum-length mRNA spacer compatible with formation of TTC-B. The results define a new class of coupled transcription-translation complex, termed ""TTC-LC,"" where ""LC"" denotes ""long-range coupling.""

TTC-LC accommodates long mRNA spacers by looping out mRNA from the gap between RNAP and ribosome. We propose that TTC-LC is an intermediate in assembling and disassembling TTC-B, mediating pre-TTC-B transcription-translation coupling before a ribosome catches up to RNAP, and mediating post-TTC-B transcription-translation coupling after a ribosome stops moving and RNAP continues moving.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

New drugs and protein targets are required for the treatment of these diseases, particularly therapies targeting multiple stages of the parasite life cycles. Nuclear import, carried out by the transporters importin (IMP)  and {beta} subunits, is a valid target for the discovery of lead compounds against these protozoan parasites: small molecules were identified that inhibit interactions between IMP and nuclear localisation signals in vitro and also inhibit the growth of the rapidly-dividing stages of P. falciparum and T. gondii (asexual stages and tachyzoites) in culture. In this report, we add another small molecule (Bay 11-7082) to the panel of inhibitors of IMP and test the ability of these inhibitors to first, inhibit nuclear transport in the rapidly dividing stages and, next, the maturation of differentiated stages of both parasites. We show that GW5074 and CAPE inhibit nuclear transport in the P. falciparum blood stages, while Bay 11-7085 inhibits nuclear transport in T. gondii tachyzoites. Interestingly, CAPE strongly inhibits gametocyte maturation, the sexual stages of P. falciparum, and Bay 11-7085 weakly inhibits bradyzoite differentiation, the latent stages of T. gondii. As differentiation of both these stages is dependent on activation of gene expression, triggered by the nuclear translocation of transcription factors, our work provides a ""proof of concept"" that targeting nuclear import is a viable strategy for the development of therapeutics against multiple stages of apicomplexan parasites, some of them recalcitrant to existing drugs.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

There are no vaccines available and no effective treatments for these patients.

Cryptosporidia are transmitted as an oocyst that is made up of a hardy oocyst wall that protects four parasites. Little is understood about how the oocyst is constructed, its composition, and the how it resists chlorination. A family of predicted Cryptosporidium Oocyst Wall Proteins (COWPs) was identified from the genome. Using a genetic approach, we confirm that all members of the COWP family localise to the oocyst wall. Our studies indicate that COWP2, 3 and 4 localise specifically to the oocyst ""suture"", a zipper-like structure on the oocyst wall from which parasites emerge during infection. In parasites lacking COWP8, we observe that the inner and outer layers of the oocyst wall are no longer associated suggesting a role for COWP8 in oocyst wall morphology.

So far, a well-known mammalian mutation PB2-E627K has not been maintained in AIV in poultry, which limits the spread of AIVs from avian to humans. Here, we discovered a variant, PB2-627V, which combines the properties of avian-like PB2-627E and human-like PB2-627K, overcoming host restrictions and posing a risk for human pandemics. Specifically, by screening the global PB2 sequences, we discovered a new independent cluster with PB2-627V emerged in the 2010s, which is prevalent in various avian, mammalian, and human isolates of AIVs, including H9N2, H7N9, H3N8, 2.3.4.4b H5N1, and other subtypes. And, the increasing prevalence of PB2-627V in poultry is accompanied by a rise in human infection cases with this variant. Then we systematically assessed its host adaptation, fitness, and transmissibility across three subtypes of AIVs (H9N2, H7N9, and H3N8) in different host models, including avian and human cells, chickens, mice, and ferrets where infections naturally occur. We found that PB2-627V facilitates AIVs to efficiently infect and replicate in chickens and mice by utilizing both avian- and human-origin ANP32A proteins. Importantly, and like PB2-627K, PB2-627V promotes efficient transmission between ferrets through respiratory droplets. Deep sequencing in passaged chicken samples and transmitted ferret samples indicates that PB2-627V remains stable across the two distinct hosts and has a high potential for long-term prevalence in avian species. Therefore, the mutation has the ability to continue spreading among poultry and can also overcome the barrier between birds and humans, greatly enhancing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, it is crucial to closely monitor influenza viruses carrying PB2-627V to prevent a pandemic.

Author summaryAvian influenza viruses (AIVs) play a critical role in the evolution of pandemic influenza viruses. Adaptive changes in AIVs enable them to infect mammalian species by altering viral interactions with host-specific factors, and one well-known example is the PB2-E627K mutation. Fortunately, this mutation is sporadic and rare in AIVs, usually occurring after infecting humans, and AIVs with PB2-627E, which is prevalent in poultry, cannot easily infect humans. However, if an AIV manages to overcome this species barrier, the risk of a pandemic originating from an AIV will significantly increase. In our study, we identified a dual adaptive variant called PB2-627V that combines avian-like properties of PB2-627E and human-like properties of PB2-627K. This variant not only maintains viral fitness in chickens but also facilitates aerosol transmission of AIVs between ferrets. Mechanistically, PB2-627V utilizes both avian and human host protein ANP32A to support viral polymerase function. The mutation exhibited good fitness in both birds and humans, thereby greatly increasing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans.

The latest example is the BA.2.86 Variant Of Interest (VOI), which rapidly outcompeted all other lineages following its detection in late July 2023. Descending sublineages dominated globally by July 2024, at the time of writing this study. The mechanisms by which highly-divergent viral lineages tend to emerge remain unclear, with the most strongly supported hypothesis being the acquisition of multiple mutations through accelerated evolution in chronically infected individuals, with spread back into the community facilitated by prolonged shedding. We used BA.2.86 as a case study to investigate the evolutionary process behind the emergence of a highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variant. Through fine-scale evolutionary analyses applied to four independently subsampled datasets, we identify over 100 genomes representing evolutionary intermediates occupying the branch in the phylogenetic tree leading to the BA.2.86*/JN.1* clade. Additionally, we detected more than 2,600  hybrid genomes across the evolutionary history of the Omicron-descending BA.2* sub-lineages, displaying a sequential acquisition of BA.2.86 lineage-defining mutation constellations through time. We observe that hybrid strains circulated up to 19 months prior to BA.2.86, denoting cryptic circulation in various countries, with further evidence of early transmission chains. We also found signals of recombination between pre-existing parental lineages, suggesting that this process contributed to the emergence of BA.2.86. Our results suggest that the BA.2.86 lineage emerged sequentially through a complex evolutionary process, rather than via accelerated evolution associated with a single emergence event.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

While the aetiology of Parkinsons disease remains elusive, the degeneration of the dopamine - producing nigrostriatal neurons, along with the accumulation of alpha-synuclein, are pathophysiological hallmarks. The impairment of motor functions, a consequence of the involvement of the thalamic-frontal loop, dominates the overt clinical picture. However, more recent findings clarified that the symptoms are more widespread, and cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunctions are also common. Accordingly, neuroimaging studies show that, even in early disease, structural and functional alterations are not confined to the motor areas. This suggests that the effects of the nigro-striatal neurodegeneration are not restricted to the motor areas alone but, rather, they modify the behavior of the brain on a large scale. Understanding how the local degeneration of dopaminergic neurons affects the whole brain dynamics remains an open question.

The purpose of this study is to understand how the ability of the nigrostriatal pathways to support a dopaminergic stimulation affects the brain as a whole. To this end, we leverage simultaneous recordings from EEG and deep electrodes placed near the subthalamic nuclei (STN) from 10 Parkinsonian patients, acquired both before and after administration of L-Dopa. We used the topography of the spreading of aperiodic waves over a large scale (i.e. neuronal avalanches), utilizing the recently described avalanche transition matrix (ATM), to characterize the brain dynamics. To simulate the effect of L-Dopa in silico, we deployed a mechanistic neural-mass model derived from the adaptive quadratic integrate-and-fire model (aQIF) of individual neurons that has been extended to include dopamine concentration as a variable. Each parcelled brain region is equipped with a neural mass and then coupled according to the empirical connectomes, where connections can be either excitatory, inhibitory, or dopaminergic. Then, the whole-brain dynamics have been simulated for different configurations, i.e., for different dopaminergic tones. This way, we obtained a numerical prediction of the expected dynamics (in terms of properties of the ATMs), as observed in the deep electrodes and the EEG, given different dopaminergic tones. Then, in a Bayesian set-up, we used a class of deep neural networks to ""invert"" the model and infer the most likely dopaminergic tone given the empirically observed dynamics. For all ten patients, we correctly inferred that the dopaminergic tone was higher given the dynamics observed after administration of L-Dopa, and lower before. In other words, we could distinguish and quantify the dopaminergic tone from the electrophysiological data if the subjects had orally taken L-Dopa. This was achieved by integrating the background (anatomical and dynamical) knowledge into model prediction about the physiology of dopamine (as opposed to training a classifier to distinguish empirical data). Finally, we carried out a diagnostic for the validation of the model, as well as a further description of the simulated dopamine dynamics.","NA","medrxiv",1721772525772

Obtaining targets at sufficient purity and scale typically requires the screening of several protein variants and expression hosts. Existing cloning strategies allow to produce constructs for co-expression of proteins, but are often time-consuming, labour-intensive, host-specific, or involving error-prone assembly steps. Here we present a unique set of vectors together with a novel assembly strategy designed to overcome these limitations. It allows for the generation of expression constructs for multi-subunit protein complexes for various hosts in a single cloning step. Its modular nature allows the system to be easily extended to target additional expression hosts or to include new tags or regulatory sequences. As a proof of principle, we present the parallel construction of expression vectors for several Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes, allowing us to devise strategies for the recombinant production of these targets in bacteria, insect cells, and human cells, respectively.

Some bacteria, including the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), encode a proteasome system that selectively degrades damaged or misfolded proteins crucial for the pathogens survival within host macrophages2-7. Consequently, the 20S core particle (CP), the central component of the proteasome system, has emerged as a viable target for tuberculosis treatment strategies2,8-10.

Here we present the first structure of Mtb 20S CP, and indeed any 20S CP, in an inactive state called 20SOFF, distinguished from the canonical active state, 20SON, by the conformation of switch helices I and II. The rearrangement of these helices collapses the S1 pocket, effectively inhibiting substrate binding. The switch helices are conserved and regulate the activity of HslV protease, the proteasomes ancestral enzyme in bacteria, and a diverse family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases.

This shortcoming increases the rate of false positives and false negatives, giving rise to a potentially misleading scientific record. To address this shortcoming, many researchers now use point-and-click software to run sample size calculations.

ObjectiveWe aimed to (1) estimate how many published articles report using the G*Power sample size calculation software; (2) assess whether these calculations are reproducible and (3) error-free; and (4) assess how often these calculations use G*Powers default option for mixed-design ANOVAs--which can be misleading and output sample sizes that are too small for a researchers intended purpose.

MethodWe randomly sampled open access articles from PubMed Central published between 2017 and 2022 and used a coding form to manually assess 95 sample size calculations for reproducibility and errors.

ResultsWe estimate that more than 48,000 articles published between 2017 and 2022 and indexed in PubMed Central or PubMed report using G*Power (i.e., 0.65% [95% CI: 0.62% - 0.67%] of articles). We could reproduce 2% (2/95) of the sample size calculations without making any assumptions, and likely reproduce another 28% (27/95) after making assumptions. Many calculations were not reported transparently enough to assess whether an error was present (75%; 71/95) or whether the sample size calculation was for a statistical test that appeared in the results section of the publication (48%; 46/95). Few articles that performed a calculation for a mixed-design ANOVA unambiguously selected the non-default option (8%; 3/36).

ConclusionPublished sample size calculations that use G*Power are not transparently reported and may not be well-informed. Given the popularity of software packages like G*Power, they present an intervention point to increase the prevalence of informative sample size calculations.","NA","medrxiv",1721772525772

Antioxidant delivery as a therapeutic for AAA is of substantial interest although clinical translation of antioxidant therapy has met with significant challenges due to limitations in achieving sufficient antioxidant levels at the site of AAA. We posit that nanoparticle-based approaches hold promise to overcome challenges associated with systemic administration of antioxidants.

MethodsWe employed a peptide-based nanoplatform to overexpress a key modulator of oxidative stress, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). The efficacy of systemic delivery of SOD2 mRNA as a nanotherapeutic agent was studied in two different murine AAA models. Unbiased mass spectrometry-enabled proteomics and high-dimensional bioinformatics were used to examine pathways modulated by SOD2 overexpression.

ResultsThe murine SOD2 mRNA sequence was mixed with p5RHH, an amphipathic peptide capable of delivering nucleic acids in vivo to form self-assembled nanoparticles of [~]55 nm in diameter. We further demonstrated that the nanoparticle was stable and functional up to four weeks following self-assembly when coated with hyaluronic acid. Delivery of SOD2 mRNA mitigated the expansion of small AAA and largely prevented rupture. Mitigation of AAA was accompanied by enhanced SOD2 protein expression in aortic wall tissue. Concomitant suppression of nitric oxide, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and cell death was observed. Proteomic profiling of AAA tissues suggests that SOD2 overexpression augments levels of microRNAs that regulate vascular inflammation and cell apoptosis, inhibits platelet activation/aggregation, and downregulates mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Gene set enrichment analysis shows that SOD2 mRNA delivery is associated with activation of oxidative phosphorylation, lipid metabolism, respiratory electron transportation, and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways.

ConclusionsThese results confirm that SOD2 is key modulator of oxidative stress in AAA. This nanotherapeutic mRNA delivery approach may find translational application in the medical management of small AAA and the prevention of AAA rupture.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

These protofibrils and fibrils can intertwine to form mature amyloid fibres. Similar phenomena occur in blood from individuals with circulating inflammatory molecules (also those originating from viruses and bacteria). In the presence of inflammagens, pathological clotting can occur, that results in an anomalous amyloid form termed fibrinaloid microclots. Previous proteomic analyses of these microclots have shown the presence of non-fibrin(ogen) proteins, suggesting a more complex mechanism than simple entrapment. We provide evidence against a simple entrapment model, noting that clot pores are too large and centrifugation would have removed weakly bound proteins. Instead, we explore whether co-aggregation into amyloid fibres may involve axial (multiple proteins within the same fibril), lateral (single-protein fibrils contributing to a fibre), or both types of integration. Our analysis of proteomic data from fibrinaloid microclots in different diseases shows no significant overlap with the normal plasma proteome and no correlation between plasma protein abundance and presence in microclots. Notably, abundant plasma proteins like -2-macroglobulin, fibronectin, and transthyretin are absent from microclots, while less abundant proteins such as adiponectin, periostin, and von Willebrand Factor are well represented. Using bioinformatic tools including AmyloGram and AnuPP, we found that proteins entrapped in fibrinaloid microclots exhibit high amyloidogenic tendencies, suggesting their integration as cross-{beta} elements into amyloid structures. This integration likely contributes to the microclots resistance to proteolysis. Our findings underscore the role of cross-seeding in fibrinaloid microclot formation and highlight the need for further investigation into their structural properties and implications in thrombotic and amyloid diseases. These insights provide a foundation for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting amyloidogenic cross-seeding in blood clotting disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1721772525772

This paper aimed to assess a multitude of cardiac signs, symptoms, and conditions, as well as focused on patients with and without congenital heart defects (CHDs), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the post-acute cardiovascular outcomes among children and adolescents after COVID-19.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 19 US childrens hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and September 2023. Every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry. Absolute risks of incident post-acute COVID-19 sequelae were reported. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by contrasting COVID-19-positive with COVID-19-negative groups using a Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through propensity scoring stratification.

ResultsA total of 1,213,322 individuals under 21 years old (mean[SD] age, 7.75[6.11] years; 623,806 male [51.4%]) were included. The absolute rate of any post-acute cardiovascular outcome in this study was 2.32% in COVID-19 positive and 1.38% in negative groups. Patients with CHD post-SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks of any cardiovascular outcome (RR, 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-1.80), including increased risks of 11 of 18 post-acute sequelae in hypertension, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias), myocarditis, other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest), thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain and palpitations). Those without CHDs also experienced heightened cardiovascular risks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57-1.69), covering 14 of 18 conditions in hypertension, arrhythmias (ventricular arrhythmias and premature atrial or ventricular contractions), inflammatory heart disease (pericarditis and myocarditis), other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock), thrombotic disorders (pulmonary embolism and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and syncope).

ConclusionsBoth children with and without CHDs showed increased risks for a variety of cardiovascular outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the need for targeted monitoring and management in the post-acute phase.

The main outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To evaluate the association between COVID-19 and the new onset of kidney diseases relative to both control groups, we employed multivariable stratified Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.

ResultsThe study included 939,241 individuals with COVID-19, 1,878,482 individuals in the negative control group, and 199,071 individuals with influenza. After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and medication histories, COVID-19 was significantly associated with increased risks of AKI (adjusted hazards ratio, aHR: 2.74, 2.61-2.87), CKD (aHR: 1.38, 1.32-1.45), and ESRD (aHR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.67-3.88), while influenza was associated with a modestly increased risk of AKI (aHR: 1.24, 1.11-1.38) and had no impact on CKD (aHR: 1.03, 0.92-1.14), and ESRD (aHR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.55-1.29). Time-specific analyses indicated that while the HR for AKI declined from 0-180 days to 0-540 days, the HR for CKD and ESRD remained stable, with COVID-19s risk surpassing influenzas risk throughout follow-up. Exploratory analysis also found significant impacts of COVID-19 on glomerular diseases (aHR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50).

ConclusionIn this large real-world study, COVID-19 infections were associated with a 2.3-fold risk of developing AKI, a 1.4-fold risk of CKD, and a 4.7-fold risk of ESRD compared to influenza. Greater attention needs to be paid to kidney diseases in individuals after contracting COVID-19 to prevent future adverse health outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1721772525772

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1721772525772

They form superhelical structures around which DNA is wrapped. Recent studies have shown that some archaea and bacteria contain alternative histones that exhibit different DNA binding properties, in addition to highly divergent sequences. However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1721772525772
