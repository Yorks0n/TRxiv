These phenotypes persist through the night phases, suggesting a readiness for the daylight environment that is routinely experienced despite the intervening dark periods (Dupuis & Ojeda et al. 2025). Here, we investigate how prior acclimation impacts algal fitness upon a change in daylight intensity and how quickly Chlamydomonas can reprogram its photoprotective strategy in a diurnal context. We performed a systems analysis of synchronized populations acclimated to diurnal LL when subjected to HL days and of populations acclimated to diurnal HL when subjected to LL days. In the latter case, diurnal photoacclimation decreased fitness during the first day at a new light intensity: HL-acclimated cells barely increased in size over the first LL period, and they failed to complete a cell cycle. However, although LL-acclimated cells showed severe photodamage after 6 hours of HL, they recovered chloroplast form and function later that afternoon and successfully divided at nightfall. These cells rapidly altered their thylakoid membrane ultrastructure, increased their photoprotective quenching capacity, and decreased their inventory of photosystem and antenna proteins by the end of the first HL day. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed rapid induction of thousands of genes, including those encoding proteases, chaperones, and other proteins involved in the chloroplast unfolded protein response. These results show that the alga is highly flexible and competent to rapidly acclimate to changes in diurnal light intensity.","[{""name"":""Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006wxqw41"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GBMF9203;""},{""name"":""US Department of Energy Office of Science"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Office of Biological and Environmental Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0114b2m14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-AC05-76RL01830;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1S10OD025063;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756850839800

Hordeum erectifolium, a wild relative of barley (H. vulgare), is adapted to intermittent and prolonged drought and saline soils, making it an excellent model for stress-adaptation research. We assembled a chromosome-scale, annotated reference genome of H. erectifolium comprising 3.85 Gbp, and identified 71,475 genes supported by a tissue-specific gene expression atlas. Comparative morphological, physiological, and transcriptomic analyses under water limitation were conducted with cultivated and wild barley. H. erectifolium displayed a greater density of leaf veins and sclerenchyma cells, alongside rapid leaf rolling upon dehydration. Genomic comparisons revealed structural variations, independent transposon-driven evolution, and copy number expansions of desiccation-responsive gene families relative to barley. The transcriptional responses of H. erectifolium and barley to water limitation suggested contrasting drought-adaptation strategies: metabolic downregulation and survival prioritization in H. erectifolium versus maintenance of metabolic activity and competitiveness in barley. Our data suggest that H. erectifolium is genetically primed for survival under drought through anatomical adaptations, gene family expansion, efficient shutdown of growth-related metabolism, and rapid recovery upon rehydration.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101002085;949873;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""390686111;456082119;252965955;""},{""name"":""ERDF Programme Johannes Amos Comenius"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CZ.02.01.01/00/22_008/0004581;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756850839800

The role of this modification in epigenetics and gene regulation is relatively well understood, but our understanding of the extent and the role of lysine methylation of non-histone substrates remains fairly limited. Several lysine methyltransferases which methylate non-histone substrates are overexpressed in a number of cancers and are believed to be key drivers of cancer progression. There is great incentive to identify the lysine methylome, as this is a key step in identifying drug targets. While numerous computational models have been developed in the last decade to identify novel lysine methylation sites, the accuracy of these model has been modest, leaving much room for improvement. In this work, we leverage the most recent advancements in deep learning and present a transformer-based model for lysine methylation site prediction which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. In addition, we show that other post-translational modifications of lysine are informative and that multitask learning is an effective way to integrate this prior knowledge into our lysine methylation site predictor, MethylSight 2.0. Finally, we validate our model by means of mass spectrometry experiments and identify 68 novel lysine methylation sites.

Here, to overcome the limitations of acquisition speed, acquisition initiation, and data throughput, we present a smart microscopy method that uses confocal imaging as a monitoring method, runs real-time image analysis, and only applies MINFLUX data acquisition exactly where and when deemed necessary based on the analysis outcome. The method, event-triggered MINFLUX, is controlled through a custom-written and open source Python widget that automatically controls a commercial MINFLUX microscope. We apply this method to investigate molecular membrane dynamics and organization during three different cellular events: two-dimensional lipid dynamics at caveolae; three-dimensional membrane topography during dynamin-mediated endocytosis; and three-dimensional membrane fluidity and topography during budding site formation of HIV-1 proteins. Thanks to rapid event detection and minimal regions of interest the method provides data that would be unfeasible or impossible to acquire through manual control of the microscope.","[{""name"":""Swedish Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03zttf063"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-06139_VR;""},{""name"":""German Research Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INST 275_405_1;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""390713860;316213987;44711651;460889961;""},{""name"":""Photonics Research Germany"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""13N15713;13N15717;""},{""name"":""Free State of Thuringia"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FGI 0031;FGR 0054;""},{""name"":""Leibniz Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01n6r0e97"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K548/2023;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756850839800

These studies typically assume that blood-derived DNA faithfully reflects an individuals germline genome. However, this assumption is challenged by somatic mutations arising from processes like clonal hematopoiesis. Although standard bioinformatics pipelines employ variant allele frequency (VAF)-based filtering to mitigate such contamination, the efficacy of these approaches requires systematic evaluation. By systematically analyzing whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from large cohorts, including the UK Biobank, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the 1000 Genomes Project, we revealed critical limitations in current filtering methodologies. We found that the mutational spectrum of rare ""germline"" variants is highly similar to that of somatic mutations. Furthermore, we uncovered these variants show significant associations with phenotypes such as age, sex, and smoking status, established drivers of somatic mutagenesis. This persistent somatic contamination introduces substantial confounder effects, potentially generating spurious associations and reverse causality in genetic studies. Our work underscores the urgent reconsideration of two fundamental aspects of genomic research: (1) refinement of variant filtering strategies to better distinguish true germline variants from somatic contaminants, and (2) incorporation of somatic mutagenesis factors as essential covariates in study design. Our findings provide a basic framework for improving the accuracy and interpretability of large-scale genomic studies.","[{""name"":""National Natural Science Foundation of China"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h0zpd94"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""62025102;82470373;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756850839800

However, the efficacy of VERG varies across species. In this study, we tested two commonly used viral vectors, barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) and foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV), for their ability to induce virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and virus-mediated overexpression (VOX) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). While both vectors successfully altered gene expression in wheat (Triticum aestivum), they failed to do so in six rice cultivars from different subspecies, despite rigorous optimization of inoculation methods and environmental conditions. The BSMV vector carrying antisense phytoene desaturase (PDS) sequences did not induce the expected photobleaching phenotype, and FoMV-driven GFP expression was absent in rice. These findings contrast with previous reports of successful VERG in other monocots and suggest that intrinsic resistance mechanisms exist in rice which may inhibit or reduce viral vector efficacy. Our results highlight the species-specific limitations of VERG and underscore the need for alternative viral systems or novel vector designs for functional genomics research in rice. By sharing our unsuccessful attempts, we aim to prevent redundant efforts and encourage further exploration of VERG in Oryza species.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council of the United Kingdom (BBSRC)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X010953/1; BBS/E/RH/230003A;""},{""name"":""Institutional Internationalization Program (PRINT) from Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Rio Grande do Sul State Research Support Foundation (FAPERGS)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""22/2551-0000394-0/RITES;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756850839800

A central challenge is to program their dynamic behaviors using heritable genetic information, which would grant them the capacity to evolve. Here, we create transiently active RNA droplets by integrating sites for ribozyme catalysis directly into the sequence of self-assembling, four-arm RNA nanostars. To enable perfusion and observe the resulting dynamics over time, we develop a method for trapping individual droplets in hydrogel cages by targeted in situ photopolymerization. This enables us to quantify the sequence-programmable droplet dissolution and to control the degradation kinetics by choosing between fast (hammerhead) and slow (hairpin) ribozymes. Furthermore, we trigger the segregation of mixed droplet populations via the sequence-specific cleavage of a chimeric linker RNA. The droplet-encapsulated DNA templates code for the regrowth of new droplets, establishing the proof-of-principle for a minimal, genetically encoded cycle of dissolution and regrowth.

To explore this, we analyzed intracortical electrophysiological recordings during infusions of propofol, ketamine, and dexmedetomidine, using a rigorous method to estimate dynamical stability. We found that all three anesthetics, despite their molecular differences, similarly affect cortical states by destabilizing their dynamics. This destabilization matched the slower recovery from sensory perturbations and longer stimulus-induced autocorrelation times observed during the anesthetic infusions. The destabilization was also reflected predominantly in lower-frequency ranges, linking it to the well-known increase in low-frequency power during anesthesia. Finally, destabilization closely tracked real-time fluctuations in consciousness. Together, these findings suggest that cortical destabilization may be a shared neural correlate of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, offering a mechanistic explanation for low-frequency oscillations observed during anesthesia.","[{""name"":""Office of Naval Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rk2pe57"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MURI N00014-23-1-2768;MURI W911NF2410228;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R01MH131715-01;R01MH11559;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R21AG077275-01A1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756850839800

Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.

We evaluated ALD delivery of mosaic-8b [60-mer nanoparticles presenting 8 different SARS-like betacoronavirus (sarbecovirus) receptor-binding domains (RBDs)] that elicits broadly cross-reactive antibodies and protects against mismatched sarbecoviruses not represented by RBDs on mosaic-8b. Compared with conventional prime-boost immunizations, ALD-delivered mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles elicited antibodies in both naive and pre-vaccinated mice with improved mismatched binding and neutralization. Results of RBD epitope mapping of serum antibodies from ALD-delivered mosaic-8b were consistent with broader coverage of RBD epitopes compared to conventional immunizations, and systems serology revealed distinct IgG subclass and Fc{gamma}R-binding IgG distributions. These results suggest that ALD is a promising technology for use with mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticle vaccines to protect against future sarbecovirus spillovers and support applications for ALD vaccine delivery to elicit cross-reactive antibodies against rapidly mutating or diverse pathogens.","[{""name"":""Welcome Leap"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""N/A;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P01-AI165075;""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV-034638;INV-002149/INV-042180;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756850839800

Such stresses can emerge from structural incompatibilities, which arise from the juxtaposition of layers of tissue with different intrinsic lengths. Although growth of individual plant cells is driven by mechanical stresses, the impact and role of tissue-scale internal residual stresses on shape dynamics at the organ scale remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce a novel theoretical framework in which the organ, described as a set of connected, concentric morphoelastic cylindrical shells representing distinct tissues, grows axially in response to its local elastic strain. This approach allows to formulate analytical expressions relating tissue-level differences in elasticity and intrinsic growth to macroscopic characteristics such as organ axial growth rates, bending motions, and residual stress profiles. To demonstrate the framework, we analyze a minimal two-layer model representing the epidermis and inner tissues, and use it to explore the ""epidermal growth control"" hypothesis, which posits that the epidermis regulates expansion by mechanically limiting inner tissue elongation. Our analysis also reveals a form of mechanical memory and accounts for observed phenomena such as autotropism.","[{""name"":""Israel Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04sazxf24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2307/22;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101165101;""},{""name"":""Canada Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0517h6h17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRC-2024-00031;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GAT3395/PR4B;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756850839800

We aimed to map the production of scientific publications worldwide in terms of democracy and freedom of press ratings of countries. Democracy ratings used the Democracy Index in 2024 and in 2006 (when first released by the Economist Intelligence Unit) and Freedom of Press ratings used the 2024 index by Reports Without Borders. The Scopus database was used for publications from each country. Fractional counts were assigned for publications co-authored by authors from different countries. Full articles, reviews, conference papers, books and book chapters were included. In 2024, countries characterized as full democracies produced only 22% of the Scopus-indexed publications, versus 66% in 2006. There was no correlation between the ratio of publications indexed in 2024 versus 2006 and the absolute or relative change in Democracy Index between 2006 and 2024 (r=0.02 and r=0.00, respectively). 78% of publications in 2024 came from countries with problematic (including USA) or worse (including China) freedom of press. Proportions of publications originated from countries with problematic or worse situations were 81%, 91%, 61%, 62%, and 63% for political, economic, legislative, sociocultural, and safety/security dimensions, respectively. Results were similar when limited to articles published in 2024 in journals with continuous annual presence in Scopus during 2006-2024. In conclusion, most published science originates from countries struggling or suffering in democracy and/or freedom of press. The deeper causes and implications of this emerging landscape require further study.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756850839800

Here, we connect cell state dynamics of type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2) in cholangitis with site-specific{gamma}{delta} T17 responses in liver and draining lymph nodes (LN).

MethodsThe 0.1% Diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-Dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet was used to generate an immunobiliary DC- and{gamma}{delta} T-enriched mouse liver and LN single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas covering temporal disease dynamics, resolution and cDC2B depletion. cDC2 trajectories were inferred using VarID2 and{gamma}{delta} T cell transcription factor (TF) regulon activity was predicted by SCENIC. The human biliary niche was resolved by integrating human liver scRNA-seq data with available spatial transcriptomics data. Functional studies were conducted using Tcrd knockout, Il17a/f knockout and Tcrd reporter mice.

ResultsA disease trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B was identified connecting DC maturation, homing and the expression of Il17-inducing genes. Disease progression was associated with numeric exhaustion of mature cDC2B and recruitment of DC precursors.{gamma}{delta} T cells were the main Il17 producers and were subtyped into Il17ahigh Scart1+ V{gamma}6+ and Il17low Scart2+ V{gamma}4+ populations exhibiting cDC2-directed communication and divergent TF regulon activity. Spatial proximity and conserved molecular interactions of cDC2 and{gamma}{delta} T cells were confirmed in human cholangitis. Il17-deficiency resulted in reduced liver fibrosis in mice, while cDC2B depletion attenuated{gamma}{delta} T17 cell states.

ConclusionsIn cholangitis, a profibrogenic function of{gamma}{delta} T cells is contingent on the induction by peribiliary cDC2B, thereby highlighting relevant disease determinants within the immunobiliary and liver-draining LN niche.

Impact and ImplicationsThe immunobiliary niche contains rare immune cells such as conventional dendritic cells and unconventional T cells, however, the function of these cell types in liver inflammation remains poorly understood. Mirroring human biliary diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, we induced experimental cholangitis in a mouse model to generate a site-specific single-cell sequencing atlas resource resolving underexplored cell populations. Our data capture a profibrotic hepatic disease state trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B inducing a{gamma}{delta} T cell-specific Il17-response, which is attenuated upon cDC2B depletion and in DC precursors, which are characterized by reduced genomic accessibility of{gamma}{delta} T cell-interacting genes.

These results highlight the importance of portal niche residing underexplored immune cell populations and the necessity to further resolve immunobiliary niche responses and crosstalk in inflammatory settings such as in cholangitis.
