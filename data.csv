However, recent and heavily disputed debates on data quality have raised questions on the accuracy of demographic data at older ages. Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

The frequency and pace of these major genome structural changes are unknown, and it remains unclear whether or how they impact long-term genome evolution. Here, we compare whole chromosomal sequences of 3,631 genomes from 2,291 species spanning all major animal clades and show that animal karyotypes evolve primarily via karyotype contraction, associated with increased rates of chromosomal fusion-with-mixing and dispersion that largely obey chromosomal algebra1, or karyotype expansion, which breaks up ancestral linkage groups and forms new chromosomal elements via non-algebraic changes. We show that chromosomal changes can be associated with major extinction events. Using a multi-scale encoding of pan-animal genome homology and a manifold representation of genomic changes, we find that genome evolution is not only driven by changes at the chromosomal level, but that subchromosomal mixing and irreversibility define clade-specific evolution. Using this  evolutionary genome topology approach, we calculate extrema of irreversible genomic configurations and identify species that occupy intermediate manifold positions, providing evidence for distinct macro-evolutionary trajectories. We propose that investigation of mixed state accumulation around important gene loci (such as Hox) will be crucial in capturing and further study of clade-specific regulatory innovations.","NA","biorxiv",1726610906423

The unique insights from a genome-level perspective have revealed a striking pattern of conserved macrosynteny within chromosomes across huge evolutionary distances in animals, yet progress in many lineages has been hampered by the absence of genome-level data. Here, we show that the tectonics of genome evolution in clitellates, a clade composed of most freshwater and all terrestrial species of the phylum Annelida, is characterised by extensive genome-wide scrambling that resulted in a massive loss of macrosynteny between marine annelids and clitellates, to the point that ancient bilaterian linkage groups (ie, groups of genes inherited as a block in most bilaterian phyla) are fully disrupted. These massive rearrangements included the formation of putative neocentromeres with newly-acquired transposable elements, and preceded a further period of genome-wide reshaping events including whole-genome duplications and massive macrosyntenic reshuffling between clitellate lineages, potentially triggered by the loss of genes involved in genome stability or homeostasis of cell division. Notably, while these rearrangements broke short-range interactions observed between genes in marine annelids (including Hox), they were reformed as long-range interactions in clitellates. These genomic rearrangements gave rise to new genetic elements that may have facilitated the adaptation to freshwater and terrestrial environments in clitellates. Our findings provide evidence of a massive genomic reshaping through genome-wide chromosome scrambling in clitellates consistent with the punctuated equilibrium model, which sharply contrasts with the highly conserved chromosomal architecture observed in most animal taxa. Our study thus suggests that the genomic landscape of this animal lineage resulted from a rare burst of genomic changes that ended a long period of stability that persists across large evolutionary distances.","NA","biorxiv",1726610906423

We hypothesized that the numerous genomic rearrangements could reposition active enhancers near proto-oncogenes, leading to their aberrant expression. We developed pyjacker, a computational tool for the detection of enhancer hijacking events, and applied it to a cohort of 39 ckAML samples. Pyjacker identified motor neuron and pancreas homeobox 1 (MNX1), a gene aberrantly expressed in 1.4% of AML patients, often as a result of del(7)(q22q36) associated with hijacking of a CDK6 enhancer. MNX1-activated cases show significant co-occurrence with BCOR mutations and a gene signature shared with t(7;12)(q36;p13) pediatric AML. We demonstrated that MNX1 is a dependency gene, as its knockdown in a xenograft model reduces leukemia cell fitness. In conclusion, enhancer hijacking is a frequent mechanism for oncogene activation in AML.

Statement of significanceThis study examines the consequences of structural alterations and demonstrates that proto-oncogene activation by enhancer hijacking is an overlooked pathomechanism in AML. MNX1 overexpression demonstrates that deletions on chromosome 7q can not only lead to haploinsufficiency, but also to activation of oncogenes by enhancer hijacking, providing a novel leukemogenic mechanism.","NA","biorxiv",1726610906423

We aimed to examine if a diverse set of biomarkers in the REHAB-HF trial would predict improvement in physical function following a 12-week tailored physical therapy rehabilitation intervention compared to attention control. Methods: The study population consisted of participants [&ge;]60 years of age who were hospitalized with acute HF and randomized to a subsequent multidomain outpatient physical rehabilitation intervention vs. attention control with outcomes of 12-week functional change including the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and six-minute walk distance (6MWD). Blood was collected prior to randomization and at 12-weeks for cardiac, renal, and inflammatory biomarkers. Linear trends across progressively higher biomarker values versus improvement in functional outcomes based on treatment assignment were evaluated. Classification and regression trees (CART) were created to estimate optimal biomarker levels associated with differential improvement in the two functional outcomes. Results: A total of 242 of 349 participants (69%) had baseline biomarkers measured. In an adjusted regression model, higher baseline cardiac troponin (cTn) I and T were associated with greater gains in SPPB and 6MWD respectively with the rehabilitation intervention (P=0.04 and 0.03 for interaction) versus attention control. In the CART analysis of the physical rehabilitation and attention control participants, those with baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) [&ge;]9.9 mg/L and hs-cTnT [&ge;]36 ng/L receiving the rehabilitation intervention had a 129 m (95% CI 78-180m) greater 12-week 6MWD increase vs attention control. In contrast, for participants with CRP<9.9 mg/L there was no significant incremental 6MWD difference (30m, 95% CI -0.5m, 60.2m). For SPPB, a CRP [&ge;]9.9 mg/L and creatinine [&ge;]1.4 mg/dL optimally identified a differential improvement with the rehabilitation intervention versus attention control. The biomarkers (except for creatinine) decreased by 12 weeks post hospitalization but with no differences based on treatment assignment. Conclusion: Higher baseline levels of biomarkers of inflammation, cardiac injury, and renal dysfunction identified older adults after a HF hospitalization with the greatest differential improvement in physical function with a rehabilitation intervention. Biomarkers may help clinicians predict the benefits of this treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

In line with the age-related neural dedifferentiation hypothesis, we predicted that middle-aged adults show less distinct cortical representations of phonemes and acoustic-phonetic features relative to younger adults. In addition to an extensive audiological, auditory electrophysiological, and speech perceptual test battery, we measured electroencephalographic responses time-locked to phoneme instances (phoneme-related potential; PRP) in naturalistic, continuous speech and trained neural network classifiers to predict phonemes from these responses. Consistent with age-related neural dedifferentiation, phoneme predictions were less accurate, more uncertain, and involved a broader network for middle-aged adults compared with younger adults. Representational similarity analysis revealed that the featural relationship between phonemes was less robust in middle-age. Electrophysiological and behavioral measures revealed signatures of cochlear neural degeneration (CND) and speech perceptual deficits in middle-aged adults relative to younger adults. Consistent with prior work in animal models, signatures of CND were associated with greater cortical dedifferentiation, explaining nearly a third of the variance in PRP prediction accuracy together with measures of acoustic neural processing. Notably, even after controlling for CND signatures and acoustic processing abilities, age-group differences in PRP prediction accuracy remained. Overall, our results reveal ""fuzzier"" phonemic representations, suggesting that age-related cortical neural dedifferentiation can occur even in middle-age and may underlie speech perceptual challenges, despite a normal audiogram.","NA","biorxiv",1726610906423

This study aimed to estimate the extent to which genetic pathways that are direct (via child genotype) and indirect (e.g., via parental phenotype) explain the well-established association between parent and child emotional problems. We leveraged data from seven European cohort studies with a combined population of Ntrios=15,475. Polygenic scores were calculated for parental and offspring neuroticism, as it represents a dispositional trait underlying emotional problems. Emotional problems in offspring were measured using validated scales across various developmental stages from early childhood to adulthood. We used neuroticism polygenic scores within a structural equation modelling framework to distinguish between direct genetic pathways from parental genotype to offspring outcome (acting through offspring genotype), and indirect genetic pathways (acting through parental phenotype and associated environment). Standard errors for direct genetic, indirect genetic and total effects were bootstrapped and meta-analyses pooled effect estimates at three developmental stages (childhood: 3-4 years, adolescence: 11-13 years, adulthood: 18+ years). We found evidence suggesting an indirect genetic pathway between mothers and child emotional problems during early childhood (pooled estimate, mean difference in child emotional problems score per 1SD increase in maternal PGS for neuroticism=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07). This association attenuated over child development, while direct genetic pathways strengthened. High attrition rates, measurement error and low variance explained by polygenic scores may have altered precision of the estimates, influencing the interpretation of the results. However, we provide the first multi-cohort study to provide evidence for an indirect genetic pathway from maternal neuroticism to early child emotional problems. This suggests that there are likely processes other than direct genetic pathways involved in the intergenerational transmission of emotional problems, highlighting the importance of timely support to prevent and reduce emotional issues in mothers as a preventative strategy for emotional difficulties.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

One strategy to obtain high yielding strains is to enhance the expression level of the gene(s) responsible for production of the product by inserting multiple copies of the gene-expression cassette. Typically, this is achieved by transforming non-homologous end-joining proficient strains with large amounts of a DNA vector, which randomly integrates in multiple copies at different loci, or more often, into a single locus with copies arranged as mixed orientation repeats. The majority of strains produced in this manner are unstable and substantial screening is necessary to identify strains with high and stable production. Moreover, the randomness of the insertion processes makes it difficult to determine how and where the copies are positioned in the genome. To this end, we envisioned that the instability of gene clusters made by the classical method is mostly due to the presence of a mixture of directly and inverted repeats. In such clusters, hairpins formed by inverted repeats may cause frequent recombinogenic lesions during replication to induce gene-expression cassette copy-loss by direct-repeat recombination. It is therefore possible that strains with gene-expression cassette clusters made solely by direct repeats would be more stable. Using Aspergillus nidulans as a model, we tested this idea and developed RoCi, a simple and efficient method to facilitate integration of multiple directly repeated gene-expression cassettes into a defined genomic locus through rolling-circle replication without pre-engineering requirements for strain preparation. In addition, we demonstrate that RoCi can be performed without E. coli based cloning, making it compatible with medium-high throughput experiments. Analyzing strains produced by RoCi, we have constructed strains bearing up to 68 mRFP GECs and we show that an mRFP multi-copy gene-array supports high and stable mRFP production for at least [~]150 generations on solid medium. In liquid culture we observed a minor average copy loss at 1 L scale. This loss could be eliminated by extending the gene-expression cassette with a crippled selection marker. To demonstrate the strength of the method, we used it to produce stable and high yielding cell factories for production of the specialized metabolite cordycepin on solid medium and of the enzyme {beta}-glucuronidase in submerged culture. Finally, we show that RoCi can also be applied in the industrial workhorses A. niger and A. oryzae indicating that RoCi is generally applicable in fungi.","NA","biorxiv",1726610906423

The aging ovary assumes a fibro-inflammatory milieu which negatively impacts gamete quantity and quality as well as ovulation. Here we tested whether the systemic delivery of anti-inflammatory (Etanercept) or anti-fibrotic (Pirfenidone) drugs attenuates ovarian aging in mice. We first evaluated the ability of these drugs to decrease the expression of fibro-inflammatory genes in primary ovarian stromal cells. Whereas Etanercept did not block Tnf expression in ovarian stromal cells, Pirfenidone significantly reduced Col1a1 expression. We then tested Pirfenidone in vivo where the drug was delivered systemically via mini-osmotic pumps for 6-weeks. Pirfenidone mitigated the age-dependent increase in ovarian fibrosis without impacting overall health parameters. Ovarian function was improved in Pirfenidone-treated mice as evidenced by increased follicle and corpora lutea number, AMH levels, and improved estrous cyclicity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Pirfenidone treatment resulted in an upregulation of reproductive function-related genes at 8.5 months and a downregulation of inflammatory genes at 12 months of age. These findings demonstrate that reducing the fibroinflammatory ovarian microenvironment improves ovarian function, thereby supporting modulating the ovarian environment as a therapeutic avenue to extend reproductive longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1726610906423

We identify 88 differentially expressed proteins between the two groups and 208 proteins associated with cardiometabolic traits. We link genome-wide data to protein expression levels and construct the first protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) map in this population. We identify 399 independent associations with 346 (86.7%) cis-pQTLs and 53 (13.3%) trans-pQTLs. 16.7% of the cis-pQTLs and all of the trans-pQTLs have not been previously reported in African-ancestry individuals. Of these, 37 pQTLs have not been previously reported in any population. We find evidence for colocalization between a pQTL for SIRPA and T2D genetic risk. Mendelian randomization analysis identified 20 proteins causally associated with T2D. Our findings reveal proteins causally implicated in the pathogenesis of T2D, which may be leveraged for personalized medicine tailored to African-ancestry individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

Considerable disagreement exists in who is most at risk of developing Long COVID, driven in part by incomplete coding of a Long COVID diagnosis in medical records.

MethodsThis was a retrospective observational cohort study using an integrated primary and secondary care dataset from North West London, covering over 2.7 million patients. Patients with Long COVID were identified through clinical terms in their primary care record. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with having Long COVID diagnosis, while multivariate quantile regression was used to identify factors predicting the time a Long COVID diagnosis was recorded.

FindingsA total of 6078 patients were identified with a Long COVID clinical term in their primary care record, 0.33% of the total registered adult population. Women, those aged 41 to 70 years or of Asian ethnicity were more likely to have a recorded Long COVID diagnosis, alongside those with pre-existing anxiety, asthma, depressive disorder or eczema and those living outside of the most socioeconomically deprived areas. Men, those aged 41 to 70 years, or of black ethnicity were diagnosed earlier in the pandemic, while those with depressive disorder were diagnosed later.

InterpretationLong COVID is poorly coded in primary care records, and significant differences exist between patient groups in the likelihood of receiving a Long COVID diagnosis. Long COVID is more likely in those with pre-existing long-term conditions and is also associated with the frequent incidence of new long-term conditions. The experience of patients with Long COVID provides a crucial insight into inequities in access to timely care for complex multisystem conditions, and the importance of effective health informatics practices to provide robust, timely analytical support for front-line clinical services.

PINK1 is activated upon mitochondrial damage to phosphorylate Ubiquitin and Parkin to trigger removal of damaged mitochondria by autophagy (mitophagy). PINK1 also indirectly phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases including Rab8A. We have performed an siRNA screen targeting all human Ser/Thr kinases in HeLa cells and discovered that knockdown of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 1 (EIF2AK1), also known as heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase, a branch of the integrated stress response (ISR), selectively enhances mitochondrial depolarization-induced stabilization of PINK1 and increased phosphorylation of ubiquitin and Rab8A. We confirm our findings in multiple human cell lines, including SK-OV-3, U2OS and ARPE-19 cells. Knockdown of the upstream mitochondrial-cytosol relay component, DELE1, enhanced PINK1 stabilisation and activation similar to EIF2AK1 knockdown. Strikingly, we demonstrate that the small molecule ISR inhibitor, ISRIB, also enhances PINK1 activation and signaling under conditions of mitochondrial damage. Using the mito-QC mitophagy reporter in human cells, we observe that EIF2AK1 knockdown or ISRIB treatment significantly enhances PINK1-dependent mitophagy but does not alter deferiprone-induced mitophagy. Our findings indicate that the DELE1-EIF2AK1 ISR signaling relay is a negative regulator of PINK1-dependent mitophagy and suggest that inhibitors of DELE1-EIF2AK1 and/or ISRIB analogues could have therapeutic benefits in PD and related disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1726610906423

To effectively limit tumor growth, antitumoral T cells need to rapidly migrate to find and kill cancer cells. To investigate the upper limits of cell speed, we developed a new hybrid stochastic-mean field model of bleb-based cell motility. We first examined the potential for adhesion-free bleb-based migration and show that cells migrate inefficiently in the absence of adhesion-based forces, i.e., cell swimming. While no cortical contractility oscillations are needed for cells to swim in viscoelastic media, high-to-low cortical contractility oscillations are necessary for cell swimming in viscous media. This involves a high cortical contractility phase with multiple bleb nucleation events, followed by an intracellular pressure buildup recovery phase at low cortical tensions, resulting in modest net cell motion. However, our model suggests that cells can employ a hybrid bleb- and adhesion-based migration mechanism for rapid cell motility and identifies conditions for optimality. The model provides a momentum-conserving mechanism underlying rapid single-cell migration and identifies factors as design criteria for engineering T cell therapies to improve movement in mechanically complex environments.","NA","biorxiv",1726610906423

Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from ~0% to ~20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from ~0% to ~8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from ~2% to ~9% from ~5500 to ~3000 years ago before dropping to ~3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the Thrifty Gene hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1726610906423

While, those participants who refused to take a booster dose but consented to participate COVID-19 surveillance were included in a control group. Both participants receiving a booster dose or not were monitored for symptomatic COVID-19 during a six-month surveillance period. Results Between May 23, 2023, and August 28, 2023, 4089 eligible participants were equally randomized to receive a booster dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV through oral inhalation at 0.1mL (IH Ad5-nCoV, n=2039) or intramuscular injection of Ad5-nCoV at 0.5 mL (IM Ad5-nCoV, n=2050).

This systematic review aims to summarize the central nervous system manifestations linked to monkeypox virus infection. Methods: We conducted a systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines. Databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched up to September 2024. Inclusion criteria focused on monkeypox virus-positive patients with confirmed central nervous system inflammatory disorders, including encephalitis, meningitis, myelitis, and related neuroimmune diseases. Results: From 770 screened articles, 38 studies were included. Of the 20 reported monkeypox virus-infected cases with central nervous system involvement, the most common manifestations were encephalitis (40%), encephalomyelitis (30%), and meningoencephalitis (10%). Additional rarer presentations included Guillain-Barre syndrome (5%) and transverse myelitis (5%). The mean age of affected individuals was 27.9 years, and 75% were male. Fever, fatigue, and myalgia were the predominant systemic symptoms, with neurological complications often appearing within 4.6 days post-infection. Diagnoses were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Treatment strategies varied, with antivirals (e.g., tecovirimat) and immunomodulatory therapies (e.g., methylprednisolone, immunoglobulins, and rituximab) utilized. Conclusions: Monkeypox virus infection is associated with severe neuroinflammatory disorders, with varying outcomes from complete recovery to mortality. Increased awareness, comprehensive diagnostic approaches, and targeted therapeutic interventions are critical in managing these cases. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms of neuroinflammation in the monkeypox virus and establish standardized treatment protocols.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

Recent work has highlighted the role of circulating lipoproteins in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). We sought to triangulate human observational and genetic evidence to evaluate the role of Lp(a) in AAA. Methods: We tested the association between circulating levels of Lp(a) and clinically diagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysms while controlling for traditional AAA risk factors and levels of ApoB using logistic regression among 795 individuals with and 374,772 individuals without AAA in the UK Biobank (UKB). Multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) was used to test for putatively causal associations between Lp(a) and AAA controlling for ApoB. Genetic instruments for Lp(a) and ApoB were created from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Lp(a) and ApoB comprising 335,796 and 418,505 UKB participants, respectively. The instruments were tested for association with AAA using data from a GWAS of 39,221 individuals with and 1,086,107 without AAA. Results: Elevated Lp(a) levels were observationally associated with an increased risk of AAA (OR 1.04 per 10 nmol/L Lp(a); 95%CI 1.02-1.05; P<0.01). Clinically elevated Lp(a) levels (>150nmol/L) were likewise associated with an increased risk of AAA (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.15-1.88; P < 0.01) when compared to individuals with Lp(a) levels <150nmol/L. MVMR confirmed a significant, ApoB-independent association between increased Lp(a) and increased risk of AAA (OR 1.13 per SD increase in Lp(a); 95%CI 1.02-1.24; P<0.02). Conclusion: Both observational and genetic analyses support an association between increased Lp(a) and AAA risk that is independent of ApoB. These findings suggest that Lp(a) may be a therapeutic target for AAA and drive the inclusion of AAA as an outcome in clinical trials of Lp(a) antagonists.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

Menopausal hot flashes typically persist for years. For a sizeable minority of women, hot flashes are severe and substantially impairing. It is worthwhile to further investigate the genetic underpinnings of hot flashes.

MethodWe conducted the largest trans-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) of hot flashes available to date (N=149,560). We used self-assessment of hot flashes in the Nurses Health Study, Nurses Health Study II, Womens Health Initiative, and Queensland Institute of Medical Research samples (total n=42,489). In one sample (UK Biobank, n=107,071) direct assessment of hot flashes was not available, so menopausal hormone therapy was used as a proxy variable. We estimated the heritability of hot flashes and genetic correlations with psychiatric phenotypes using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSR).

ResultsIn component analyses and our trans-ancestry meta-analysis, the top locus was on chromosome 4 in the neurokinin 3 receptor gene (TACR3, position 104,556,732, trans-ancestry p=7.2x10-41). A second novel locus was identified (LINC02428, p=3.5x10-8). Gene results implicated TACR3, GRID1, NUDT4, and PHF21B. Using the hot flash GWAS meta-analysis (n=42,489; i.e., no proxy variable), SNP heritability was estimated: h2liab=.08 (h2SNP=.04, se=.02). Genetic correlations were statistically significant between hot flashes and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD, rg=0.25, p=0.01), schizophrenia (rg=0.17, p=0.02), and depression (rg=0.21, p=0.01).

DiscussionThese genomic findings are consistent with independent, robust basic science research which led to a novel treatment for hot flashes, namely, neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists. This new class of hot flash drugs blocks the receptor (neurokinin 3 receptor) coded for by the top locus for hot flashes (TACR3). This GWAS of hot flashes provides an uncommonly clear example of how GWAS findings can point to potent treatment targets for complex brain phenotypes. We also found that the proxy variable (menopausal hormone therapy) pointed to the same target (TACR3), and that exclusively intronic and intergenic variants signaled this target.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

In this updated systematic review, we evaluate new evidence since our 2019 systematic review on the effect of outdoor air pollution exposure on childhood and adolescent brain structure and function as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: Using PubMed and Web of Science, we conducted an updated literature search and systematic review of articles published through March 2024, using key terms for air pollution and functional and/or structural MRI. Two raters independently screened all articles using Covidence and implemented the risk of bias instrument for systematic reviews informing the World Health Organization Global Air Quality Guidelines. Results: We identified 222 relevant papers, and 14 new studies met our inclusion criteria. Including six studies from our 2019 review, the 20 publications to date include study populations from the United States, Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom. Studies investigated exposure periods spanning pregnancy through early adolescence, and estimated air pollutant exposure levels via personal monitoring, geospatial residential estimates, or school courtyard monitors. Brain MRI occurred when children were on average 6-14.7 years old; however, one study assessed newborns. Several MRI modalities were leveraged, including structural morphology, diffusion tensor imaging, restriction spectrum imaging, arterial spin labeling, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as resting-state and task-based functional MRI. Air pollutants were associated with widespread brain differences, although the magnitude and direction of findings are largely inconsistent, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions. Conclusion: Prenatal and childhood exposure to outdoor air pollution is associated with structural and functional brain variations. Compared to our initial 2019 review, publications doubled - an increase that testifies to the importance of this public health issue. Further research is needed to clarify the effects of developmental timing, along with the downstream implications of outdoor air pollution exposure on children's cognitive and mental health.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

The overall performance of this test in a cohort of 419 patients has recently been described [Balk et al., J Clin Med 2024, 13, 1194]. In this study we present results from a detailed stratification analysis in which SeptiCyte RAPID performance was evaluated in the same cohort across patient groups and subgroups encompassing different demographics, comorbidities and disease, sources and types of pathogens, interventional treatments, and clinically defined phenotypes. The aims were to identify variables that might affect the ability of SeptiCyte RAPID to discriminate between sepsis and SIRS, and to determine if any patient subgroups appeared to present a diagnostic challenge for the test.

Methods1) Subgroup analysis, with subgroups defined by individual demographic or clinical variables, using conventional statistical comparison tests. 2) Principal component analysis and k-means clustering analysis, to investigate phenotypic subgroups defined by unique combinations of demographic and clinical variables.

ResultsNo significant differences in SeptiCyte RAPID performance were observed between most groups and subgroups. One notable exception involved an enhanced SeptiCyte RAPID performance for a phenotypic subgroup defined by a combination of clinical variables suggesting a septic shock response.

ConclusionsWe conclude that for this patient cohort SeptiCyte RAPID performance was largely unaffected by key variables associated with heterogeneity in patients suspected of sepsis.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

However, SDOHs have often been studied in isolation.

ObjectiveTo identify distinct exposure profiles, estimate their associations with persistent distressing psychotic-like experiences (PLE), and evaluate whether involvement with physical activities partially explains this association.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis population-based study used data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Participants were recruited from 22 US sites between September 2016 and January 2022. Data from baseline and three follow-ups were included.

ExposuresArea-level geocoded variables spanning various domains of SDOH, including socioeconomic status (SES), education, crime, built environment, social context, and crime, were clustered using a self-organizing map method to identify exposure profiles.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresPersistent distressing PLE was derived from the Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief Child Version across four years. Generalized linear mixed modeling tested the association between exposure profiles and persistent distressing PLE as well as physical activities (i.e., team and individual sports), adjusting for individual-level covariates including age, sex, race/ethnicity, highest level of parent education, family-relatedness, and study sites.

ResultsAmong 8,145 participants (baseline mean [SD] age, 9.92 [0.63] years; 3,868 (47.5%) females; 5,566 (68.3%) White, 956 (11.7%) Black, 159 (2.0%) Asian, and 1,480 (18.4%) Hispanic participants), five exposure profiles were identified. Compared to the reference Profile 1 (suburban affluent areas, 2521 children, 30.9%), Profile 3 (rural areas with low walkability and high ozone; 1459 children, 17.9%; adjusted OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.09--1.64) and Profile 4 (urban areas with high SES deprivation, high crime, and high pollution; 715 children, 8.8%; adjusted OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.08--1.81), were associated with persistent distressing PLE. Team sports mediated 6.14% of the association for Profile 3.

Conclusion and RelevanceThis study found that neighborhoods characterized by rural areas with low walkability and urban areas with high socioeconomic deprivation, air pollutants, and crime were associated with persistent distressing PLE. Further research is needed to explore the pathways through which different environmental factors may impact the development of psychosis.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

However, the current gold standard of short-read, Illumina-based WGS is labor and time-intensive. In light of recent improvements in long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing, we sought to establish a low resource utilization approach capable of providing accurate WGS-based comparisons of HAI pathogens within a time frame allowing for infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions.

MethodsWGS was prospectively performed on antimicrobial-resistant pathogens at increased risk of potential healthcare transmission using the ONT MinION sequencer with R10.4.1 flow cells and Dorado basecalling algorithm. Potential transmission was assessed via Ridom SeqSphere+ for core genome multilocus sequence typing and MINTyper for reference-based core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms using previously published cut-off values. The accuracy of our ONT pipeline was determined relative to Illumina-based WGS data generated from the same genomic DNA sample.

ResultsOver a six-month period, 242 bacterial isolates from 216 patients were sequenced by a single operator. Compared to the Illumina gold-standard data, our ONT pipeline achieved a Q score of 60 for assembled genomes, even with a coverage rate of as low as 40X. The mean time from initiating DNA extraction to complete genetic analysis was 2 days (IQR 2-3.25 days). We identified five potential transmission clusters comprising 21 isolates (8.7% of all sequenced strains). Combining ONT WGS data with epidemiological data, >70% (15/21) of the isolates originated from patients with potential healthcare transmission links.

ConclusionsVia a stand-alone ONT pipeline, we detected potentially transmitted HAI pathogens rapidly and accurately, aligning closely with epidemiological data. Our low-resource method has the potential to assist in the efficient detection and deployment of preventative measures against HAI transmission.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

The fossil, known on the basis of two specimens, has been historically assigned to seamoths (Pegasidae), then to oarfish and relatives (Lampriformes). We describe its enigmatic skeletal anatomy in detail, and provide a new genus name. ""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1726610906423

Recent advances in wholemount immunolabelling and 3D imaging have provided insights into organ-specific heterogeneity of lymphatic structure and function. However, the visualisation of lymphatic vessels deep within an intact organ remains a challenge. We hypothesised that nanobodies, single-domain antibodies raised in camelid species, would result in improved labelling of lymphatics in intact mouse organs, without loss of information due to organ sectioning or inadequate penetration. We generated and characterised nanobody clones targeting lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE1), a marker of lymphatic capillaries. Nanobodies were superior at penetrating whole mouse organs and enhanced labelling of lymphatics compared with a conventional anti-LYVE1 polyclonal antibody. Utilising this new tool, we found that kidney lymphatics; an organ in which labelling of lymphatics is challenging, have spatially restricted LYVE1 expression compared with lymphatics of skin, heart, and lung. The timing of this LYVE1 spatial restriction coincides with the early postnatal period in mice. Our findings highlight an unexpected, organ-specific characteristic of kidney lymphatic vessels, whilst providing a novel experimental tool for characterisation, isolation, or perturbation of lymphatic vessels in health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1726610906423

Definitions of oscillatory slowing are imprecise, as they average across time and frequency bands, masking the finer structure in the signal and potential reliable biomarkers of the disease. Recent studies show that high averaged band power can result from transient increases in power, termed 'events' or 'bursts'. To better understand MEG oscillatory slowing in AD progression, we analyzed features of high-power oscillatory events and their relationship to cognitive decline. MEG resting-state oscillations were registered in age-matched patients with MCI who later convert (CONV, N=41) or do not convert (NOCONV, N=44) to AD, in a period of 2.5 years. To distinguish future CONV from NOCONV, we characterised the rate, duration, frequency span and power of transient high-power events in the alpha and beta band in anterior cingulate (ACC) and precuneus (PC). Results revealed event-like patterns in resting-state power in both the alpha and beta-bands, however only beta-band features were predictive of conversion to AD, particularly in PC. Specifically, compared to NOCONV, CONV had a lower number of beta events, along with lower power events and a trend toward shorter duration events in PC (p < 0.05). Beta event durations were also significantly shorter in ACC (p < 0.01). Further, this reduced expression of beta events in CONV predicted lower values of mean relative beta power, increased probability of AD conversion, and poorer cognitive performance. Our work paves the way for reinterpreting M/EEG slowing and examining beta event features as a new biomarker along the AD continuum, and a potential link to theories of inhibitory cognitive control in neurodegeneration. These results may bring us closer to understanding the neural mechanisms of the disease that help guide new therapies.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

Even when accounting for PBC effects, the corrected lipid diffusion coefficients often severely overshoot the experimental estimates. Here, we investigate the underlying reasons for the exaggerated dynamics, and suggest potential ways for improvement. To this end, we examine the diffusion of four lipid types in both bilayers and monolayers using the CHARMM36 force field. We account for PBC effects using the full hydrodynamic treatment: for bilayers we use non-equilibrium simulations to extract the interleaflet friction parameter used in the correction; whereas monolayer hydrodynamics are treated by setting this parameter to zero. Our results suggest that the dynamics of bilayers are too fast, even if interleaflet friction is accounted for. However, the change of the water model to OPC leads to an excellent agreement with experiments. For monolayers, the dynamics with the TIP3P water model agree well with experiments, whereas they are undershot with OPC. As OPC and TIP3P differ in both shear viscosity and surface tension, we develop two new mass-scaled water models to clarify the roles of the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the water model on lipid dynamics. Our results indicate that both of these quantities play a major role in lipid dynamics. Moreover, it seems that the accurate description of diffusion in both lipid bilayers and monolayers cannot be accounted for by changes in the water model alone, but likely also requires modifications in the lipid model.","NA","biorxiv",1726610906423

Through quantitative fluorescence microscopy techniques, we characterize lipid diffusion and mean molecular area in monolayers and bilayers composed of different lipids. Our results suggest that the observed decrease in bilayer lipid diffusion compared to monolayers depends on lipid identity. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that lipid acyl chain structure and spatial configuration at the bilayer may strongly influence interleaflet interactions and dynamics in bilayers.

Here we draw on drug checking results from around the United States to report a rapid shift in the illicit drug supply with important implications for public health. Bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl) sebacate, or ''BTMPS'' is a hindered amine light stabilizer with various industrial applications. Animal studies indicate multiple kinds of adverse health effects. Methods: Drug samples collected by community-based drug checking programs in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, along with drug residue samples from other jurisdictions in California, Delaware, Maryland, and Washington, were submitted to the National Institute on Standards and Technology. Samples were qualitatively tested with Direct Analysis in Real Time mass spectrometry, with reflex to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) for confirmatory testing. Quantitation - percent by mass - was performed using LCMS. At both sites where drug samples were collected, participants were asked to respond to a survey that included questions about what the substance was sold as and any unexpected effects. Results: Between June 1, 2024 and August 31, 2024, a total of 178 samples sold as fentanyl were tested. Of these, 43 (24%) contained BTMPS, with the proportion per month rising from 0% in June to more than a third in August. An additional 23 residue samples from sites doing residue testing contained BTMPS. Fentanyl samples with BTMPS also contained many other compounds, including local anesthetics and alpha-2 agonists. Average fentanyl purity was significantly lower in samples with BTMPS compared to samples without. Conclusions: The introduction of an industrial chemical to the illicit drug supply at this speed and scale is unprecedented and concerning. Further research is urgently needed to determine why it is present in the fentanyl supply and characterize effects on human health.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

In early 2020 most countries implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 NPIs disrupted the transmission of RSV on a global scale, and many locations did not experience widespread re-circulation until late 2020 or 2021. Here, we use a mechanistic transmission model informed by cellphone mobility data to determine which aspects of population behavior had the greatest influence on post-pandemic RSV rebound in Seattle, Washington. Methods: We used aggregated mobile device location data to characterize within-city mixing, visitor in-flows, and foot traffic to points of interest in Seattle. We fit an age-structured epidemiological model to data on weekly RSV hospitalizations, allowing for reductions in transmission due to declines in mobility during the pandemic. We compared model fits to observed data to assess which mobility behaviors best capture RSV dynamics during the first two post-pandemic waves in Seattle. Results: In Seattle, COVID-19 NPIs perturbed RSV seasonality from 2020 to 2022. Seattle experienced a small out-of-season outbreak in Summer 2021 and an atypically large and early wave in Fall 2022. RSV transmission models incorporating mobility network connectivity (measured as the average shortest path length between Seattle neighborhoods) or the inflow of visitors from outside of Seattle best captured the timing and magnitude of the first two post-pandemic waves. Models including foot traffic to schools or child daycares or within-neighborhood movement produced poor fits to observed data. Conclusions: Our results suggest that case importations from other regions and local spread between neighborhoods had the greatest influence on the timing of RSV reemergence in Seattle. These findings contribute to the understanding of behavioral factors underlying RSV epidemic spread and can inform the timing of preventative measures, such as the administration of immunoprophylaxis.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

Disrupting mitochondrial transport prevents ribosomes from reaching the dendrite, whereas ectopic re-localization of mitochondria results in a concomitant re-localization of ribosomes, demonstrating that mitochondria are required and sufficient for instructing ribosome distribution in dendrites. Endolysosomal organelles that are involved in mRNA transport and translation can associate with mitochondria and ribosomes but do not play a significant role in ribosome transport. These results reveal a mechanism for dendritic ribosome delivery, which is a critical upstream requirement for local protein synthesis.","NA","biorxiv",1726610906423

As the foundation for lifelong mental health is established during childhood and adolescence, early prevention and treatment of mental health problems, such as through psychotherapy, are crucial. In Germany, current outpatient psychotherapeutic care capacities appear inadequate, while systematic evaluations of the care situation are lacking. This study investigates the state of statutory health insurance-funded outpatient psychotherapeutic care for children and adolescents in Germany and evaluates various methodological approaches for its assessment. We conducted a scoping review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Publications from January 2018 to December 2023 were sourced from PubPsych, PubMed, APA PsycInfo, Google Scholar, and ProQuest. Included studies reported quantitative primary data on the mental health of community samples of children and adolescents in Germany or their outpatient psychotherapeutic care. We included 41 publications comprising epidemiological studies, administrative data, and psychotherapist and patient reports. A lack of systematic and standardized research approaches resulted in significant variance in data. Nonetheless, qualitative analysis revealed that approximately one four children and adolescents in Germany is affected by mental health problems, while one in six to seven children and adolescents requires psychotherapeutic treatment. Yet, only up to one in fifty receives guideline-based psychotherapy. Most requests for initial psychotherapeutic consultations are unmet, with waiting times for guideline-based psychotherapy exceeding six months for at least half of the patients. Overall, our findings suggest that outpatient psychotherapeutic care for children and adolescents in Germany is still insufficient. They advocate for a systematic, multimodal, and longitudinal assessment of statutory health insurance-funded outpatient psychotherapeutic care, along with an expansion of treatment capacities to enhance access for children and adolescents in Germany.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

Even when effective vaccines became available, many communities remained at high risk of surges in COVID-19-related hospitalizations due to waning immunity, low uptake of booster vaccinations, and the continual emergence of new variations of SARS-CoV-2. Some risk metrics, such as the CDCs Community Levels, were developed to predict the impact of COVID-19 on the community-level healthcare system based on routine surveillance data. However, they had limited utility as they were not routinely updated based on accumulating data and were not directly linked to specific outcomes, such as surges in COVID-19 hospitalizations beyond local capacities. Regression models could resolve these limitations, but they have limited interpretability and do not convey the reasoning behind their predictions. In this paper, we evaluated decision tree classifiers that were developed in ""real-time"" to predict surges in local hospitalizations due to COVID-19 between July 2020 and November 2022. These classifiers would have provided visually intuitive and interpretable decision rules for local decision-makers to understand and act upon, and by being updated weekly, would have responded to changes in the epidemic. We showed that these classifiers exhibit reasonable predictive ability with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) > 80%. These classifiers maintained their performance temporally (i.e, over the duration of the pandemic) and spatially (i.e., across US counties). We also showed that these classifiers outperformed the CDCs Community Levels for predicting high hospital occupancy.

Significance StatementA major concern during the COVID-19 pandemic was the risk of exceeding local healthcare capacity due to COVID-19-related hospitalizations. To assess this risk and inform mitigating strategies, several risk assessment tools were developed during the pandemic. Many of these tools, however, did not predict local outcomes, were not updated as the pandemic progressed, and/or were not interpretable by decision-makers. We propose an adaptive framework of decision tree classifiers to predict whether COVID-19-related hospital occupancy would exceed a given capacity threshold. This framework would provide interpretable classification rules to predict surges in local hospitalizations,and maintained its performance over time and across US counties, and outperformed the CDCs Community Level tool.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

Improved understanding of the molecular basis of these diseases is required to develop novel biomarkers and targeted treatments. Moreover, it is unclear whether shared or distinct pathogenic processes underpin the LVV spectrum. To address this, we performed plasma proteomic profiling, quantifying 184 plasma proteins using Olink immunoassays in two independent cohorts totalling 405 individuals. In Cohort 1, comparison of patients with TAK (N=96) and large vessel-GCA (LV-GCA) (N=35) versus healthy controls (HCs) (N=35) revealed 52 and 72 significant differentially abundant proteins, respectively. Correlation with disease activity status identified novel TAK and LV-GCA disease activity markers. Cohort 2 consisted of patients presenting acutely with possible cranial GCA (C-GCA); C-GCA was subsequently confirmed (n=150) or excluded (n=89). 31 proteins were associated with C-GCA. Analyses stratified by temporal artery biopsy results revealed enrichment of the proteomic signal in biopsy-proven GCA, suggesting the presence of distinct endotypes within C-GCA. Cross-disease comparison revealed that active TAK, LV-GCA and biopsy-proven C-GCA had highly similar plasma proteomic profiles. Twenty-six proteomic associations were shared across all three groups including IL6, monocyte/macrophage related proteins (CCL5, CCL7, CSF1), tissue remodelling proteins (VEGFA, TIMP1, TNC) and proteins not previously linked to LVV (TNFSF14, IL7R). We also observed disease-specific associations including increased CXCL9 in LV-GCA and C-GCA but not in TAK and decreases in the extracellular matrix protein COMP in TAK but not in LV-GCA or C-GCA. Evaluation of publicly available transcriptomic data from LV-GCA aortic tissue revealed that 47 of the 112 proteins significantly altered in [&ge;]1 LVV type had significantly altered mRNA expression in LVV aortic tissue. Similarities in LVV proteomic profiles suggest shared pathobiology involving innate immunity, particularly monocyte/macrophages, lymphocyte homeostasis and tissue remodelling processes. Our results highlight a signature of immune-stromal cross talk in LVV and identify potential novel therapeutic targets in this axis (e.g. TNFSF14). The correspondence of plasma signatures to tissue phenotype highlights the potential for non-invasive monitoring of arterial inflammation and injury.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

MR relies on a set of assumptions to obtain unbiased effect estimates, one of these assumptions is that there is no pathway from the genetic variants to the outcome that does not act through the exposure. Increasing genome-wide association study (GWAS) sample sizes for the exposure enables discovery of instrumental variables with smaller effect sizes. We illustrate through simulations how smaller effect sizes could arise from genetic variants that act through traits that have greater liability to confound an exposure-outcome relationship. When such genetic variants are selected as instruments this can bias the MR effect estimate obtained from that instrument in the same direction as the confounded observational association but with larger magnitude. Through simulation we illustrate how the total bias of the MR estimates increases across a range of standard MR estimation methods increases as the proportion of the genetic instruments that are associated with the confounder increases. However, if such heritable confounders are known and can be instrumented, the confounder free effect estimate can be obtained through applying a pre-estimation filtering to standard MR methods, removing instruments that explain more variation in that confounder than the exposure, or by estimating effects through multivariable MR. We highlight the potential for SNPs identified in GWAS to be associated with potential confounders through examination of a recent GWAS of C-Reactive Protein. Finally, we illustrate our approach through estimation of the causal effect of age at menarche on type 2 diabetes, hypothesising that the MR effect estimate may be biased by confounding due to the inclusion of genetic variants associated with early life adiposity as instruments.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

DesignRetrospective cross-sectional study.

Participants5,351 patients (9,564 eyes) who underwent macular OCT imaging and Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) tests (24-2 or 10-2 test patterns) at a university hospital from 2006 to 2023. The dataset included 47,653 paired OCT-VF data points, including various ocular conditions.

MethodsWe trained a segmentation-free 3DCNN model based on the EfficientNet3D-b0 architecture on a comprehensive OCT dataset to estimate VF. We evaluated the models performance using Pearsons correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. We assessed residual variability using a jackknife resampling approach and compared OCT-VF and HFA datasets using generalized estimating equations (GEE), adjusting the number of VF tests, follow-up duration, age, and clustering by eye and patient.

Main Outcome MeasuresCorrelations between estimated and measured VF thresholds and mean deviations (MDs), and residual variability of OCT-VF and HFA.

ResultsWe observed strong correlations between the estimated and measured VF parameters (Pearsons r: 24-2 thresholds 0.893, MD 0.932; 10-2 thresholds 0.902, MD 0.945; all p < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between the estimated and measured MD, with a slight proportional bias. GEE analysis demonstrated significantly lower residual variability for OCT-VF than for HFA (24-2 thresholds: 1.10 vs. 2.48 dB; 10-2 thresholds: 1.20 vs. 2.48 dB; all p < 0.001, Bonferroni-corrected), with lower variability across all test points, severities, and ages, thus highlighting the robustness of the segmentation-free 3DCNN approach in a heterogeneous clinical sample.

ConclusionsA segmentation-free 3DCNN model objectively estimated VF from OCT images with high accuracy and significantly lower residual variability than subjective HFA measurements in a heterogeneous clinical sample, including patients with glaucoma and individuals with other ocular diseases. The improved reliability, lower variability, and objective nature of OCT-VF highlight its value for enhancing VF assessment and monitoring of various ocular conditions, potentially facilitating earlier detection of progression and more efficient disease management.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of COVID-19 articles that had corrections made and reported in the NYT ""corrections page"". We categorized authors in a NYT COVID-19 article as a NYT reporter, NYT other, or independent author. We calculated the number and type of corrections by author type (NYT reporter, NYT other, and independent author) and number and percentage of corrections indicating an over- or under-statement of the COVID-19 situation.

ResultsThere were 576 total corrections for the included 486 articles. Forty-three percent (n=245) corrections specifically pertained to COVID-19. Compared to corrections not pertaining to COVID-19, corrections pertaining to COVID-19 were less likely to be about spelling (0% vs 23.6%), locations (1.2% vs 16.3%), or title/degree (0% vs 10.6%), and more likely to be about a vaccine/vaccination (21.2% vs 0.3%), incidence/cases of conditions (12.2% vs 0.3%), or disease testing (7.8% vs 0.3%; p<0.001).

Compared to corrections not pertaining to COVID-19, corrections pertaining to COVID-19 were less likely to result in an equivocal tone (16.7% vs 88.8%), but they were more likely to both overstate (54.7% vs 8.5%) and understate (23.7% vs 2.4%) the situation in the original text (p<0.001). Ten reporters (of 346) accounted for 24% of the corrections. The reporter with the single most corrections accounted for 7% of the corrections.

Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1726610906423

DWV infects bees at all life stages, but is most noticeable in adult bees, where clinical symptoms include shriveled, non-functional wings, and a drastically shortened lifespan. DWV is recorded in upwards of 90% of honey bee colonies worldwide, and has been linked to colony loss in symptomatic hives. DWV is primarily spread by Varroa destructor mites, who feed on the fat bodies of honey bee adults and pupae. There is currently no direct treatment or preventative for DWV, with the primary method of reduction being vector control using acaracides. In this study, we tested the effect that vaccinating honey bee queens using killed Paenibacillus larvae bacterin, the causative agent of the honey bee disease American Foulbrood, had on deformed wing virus load in honey bee colonies. We placed vaccinated queens in 200 honey bee colonies, and unvaccinated queens in 200 colonies, and measured quantities of DWV-B in both groups immediately before, and 4 months after vaccination. We found that levels of DWV-B were identical before vaccination, but were significantly reduced in colonies 4 months post vaccination. This change was found despite no difference in mite quantities between groups. Overall, these data provide evidence that vaccination of queens with P. larvae bacterin is an effective method for reduction of DWV-B quantities in honey bee colonies in a commercially relevant field setting.","NA","biorxiv",1726610906423

ME diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME patients low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1726610906423

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423

Persistently elevated autoantibodies have been found in some individuals with long COVID (LC). Using a >21,000 human protein array, we identified diverse AAB targets in LC patients that correlated with their symptoms. Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness. Our findings suggest that targeting AABs could benefit some LC patients.","NA","medrxiv",1726610906423
