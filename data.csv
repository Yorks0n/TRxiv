To facilitate comparative lipidomic research across brain-diseases we established a data commons named the Neurolipid Atlas, that we have pre-populated with novel human, mouse and isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived lipidomics data for different brain diseases. We show that iPSC-derived neurons, microglia and astrocytes display distinct lipid profiles that recapitulate in vivo lipotypes. Leveraging multiple datasets, we show that the AD risk gene ApoE4 drives cholesterol ester (CE) accumulation in human astrocytes recapitulating CE accumulation measured in the human AD brain. Multi-omic interrogation of iPSC-derived astrocytes revealed that cholesterol plays a major role in astrocyte interferon-dependent pathways such as the immunoproteasome and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I presentation. We show that through enhanced cholesterol esterification ApoE4 suppresses immune activation of astrocytes. Our novel data commons, available at neurolipidatlas.com, provides a user-friendly tool and knowledge base for a better understanding of lipid dyshomeostasis in neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Mobile integrons spread antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria, while the sedentary chromosomal integrons contain up to hundreds of cassettes of unknown function. Here, we show that many of these cassettes encode anti-phage defence systems. We found numerous streamlined variants of known systems, which have presumably evolved to fit the small size constraints of integron cassettes recombination and genesis. Intrigued by the rarity of known systems in the sedentary chromosomal integron of the Vibrio cholerae 7th cholera pandemic strain, we tested the presence of anti-phage functions in all its cassettes of unknown function. We found that at least 16 of the strain cassettes have an anti-phage activity in V. cholerae or E. coli. This represents 18% of the tested cassettes and almost 10% of all the integron cassettes, providing at long last a key adaptive role for a significant fraction of the sedentary integrons. Most of the newly discovered systems have little or no similarity to previously known ones and our experiments show that several mediate defence through cell lysis or growth arrest. One of these systems encodes a 64 amino acids protein, which represents the smallest known protein providing autonomous phage resistance. Given the thousands of uncharacterized integron cassette families, integrons could represent an untapped treasure trove of streamlined anti-phage systems.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

These oscillations have been linked to memory processes in electrophysiological studies, which were correlational in nature. In the current study, we used transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to externally modulate brain oscillations to examine its direct effects on memory performance. Participants received sham, theta (4 Hz), and gamma (50 Hz) tACS over frontoparietal regions while retrieving information in a source memory paradigm. Linear regression models were used to investigate the direct effects of oscillatory non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) on memory accuracy and confidence. Our results indicate that both theta and gamma tACS altered memory confidence. Specifically, theta tACS seemed to lower the threshold for confidence in retrieved information, while gamma tACS appeared to alter the memory confidence bias. Furthermore, the individual differences in tACS effects could be predicted from electroencephalogram (EEG) measures recorded prior to stimulation, suggesting that EEG could be a useful tool for predicting individual variability in the efficacy of NIBS.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Mobile Integrons (MI) are borne on plasmids, acting as a vehicle for hundreds of antimicrobial resistance genes among key pathogens. These elements also carry gene cassettes of unknown function (gcus) whose role and adaptive value remains unexplored. Recent years have witnessed the discovery of a myriad defence systems against bacteriophages, highlighting that viral infection is a major selective pressure for bacteria. We hence sought to explore if gcus could encode phage defence systems. Using the INTEGRALL database, we established a collection of 129 gcus in pMBA, a vector where cassettes are established as part of a class 1 integron. PADLOC and DefenseFinder predicted four phage defence systems in this collection, comprising Lamassu, CBASS and two ABI (abortive infection) systems. We experimentally challenged all cassettes with phages and found nine additional candidates that were not detected in silico. We have characterized in depth the 13 gcus against a panel of phages in Escherichia coli confirming their role as phage defence integron cassettes (PICs). We used recombination assays to verify that all systems are bona fide integron cassettes and are therefore mobile. We show that pics confer resistance in other clinically relevant species, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Several PICs also limit prophage activation, providing protection at the population-level. Given the stockpiling capacity of integrons, we explored the additivity of phenotypes and found that integrons with two PICs confer multiphage-resistance. Additionally, when combined with antimicrobial resistance genes, integrons confer simultaneously drug and phage resistance. Crucially, we also show that the position of a PIC in the array can strongly decrease its cost. Our results prove a role of integrons in phage defence, acting as highly mobile, low-cost defence islands. This has important implications in the spread of defence systems, and on the future of phage therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

However, this performance comes at the expense of simplicity because the ANN models typically have many hidden layers with many feature maps in each layer. Here we show that ANN models of V1 can be substantially simplified while retaining high predictive power. To demonstrate this, we first recorded a new dataset of over 29,000 neurons responding to up to 65,000 natural image presentations in mouse V1. We found that ANN models required only two convolutional layers for good performance, with a relatively small first layer. We further found that we could make the second layer small without loss of performance, by fitting a separate ""minimodel"" to each neuron. Similar simplifications applied for models of monkey V1 neurons. We show that these relatively simple models can nonetheless be useful for tasks such as object and visual texture recognition and we use the models to gain insight into how texture invariance arises in biological neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Here, we characterize the impact of the linkage disequilibria, which stabilizing selection generates on a rapid timescale, on the subsequent allele-frequency dynamics at individual loci, which proceed on a slower timescale. We obtain expressions for the expected per-generation change in minor-allele frequency at individual loci, as functions of the effect sizes at these loci, the strength of selection on the trait, its variance and heritability, and the linkage relations among loci. Using whole-genome simulations, we show that our expressions predict allele-frequency dynamics under stabilizing selection more accurately than the expressions that have previously been used for this purpose.

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1720130973126

We determine transcriptional and translational profiles of N6AMT1 and report that it is required for the cytosolic translation of TRMT10C (MRPP1) and PRORP (MRPP3), two subunits of the mitochondrial RNAse P enzyme. In the absence of N6AMT1, or when its catalytic activity is abolished, RNA processing within mitochondria is impaired, leading to the accumulation of unprocessed and double- stranded RNA, thus preventing mitochondrial protein synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation. Our work sheds light on the function of N6AMT1 in protein synthesis and highlights a cytosolic program required for proper mitochondrial biogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Aging-associated loss of stemness is posited to suppress tumorigenesis5,6, but this hypothesis has not been tested in vivo. Here, using physiologically aged autochthonous genetically engineered mouse models and primary cells7,8, we demonstrate aging suppresses lung cancer initiation and progression by degrading stemness of the alveolar cell of origin. This phenotype is underpinned by aging-associated induction of the transcription factor NUPR1 and its downstream target lipocalin-2 in the cell of origin in mice and humans, leading to a functional iron insufficiency in the aged cells. Genetic inactivation of the NUPR1--lipocalin-2 axis or iron supplementation rescue stemness and promote tumorigenic potential of aged alveolar cells. Conversely, targeting the NUPR1-- lipocalin-2 axis is detrimental to young alveolar cells via induction of ferroptosis. We find that aging-associated DNA hypomethylation at specific enhancer sites associates with elevated NUPR1 expression, which is recapitulated in young alveolar cells by inhibition of DNA methylation. We uncover that aging drives a functional iron insufficiency, which leads to loss of stemness and tumorigenesis, but promotes resistance to ferroptosis. These findings have significant implications for the therapeutic modulation of cellular iron homeostasis in regenerative medicine and in cancer prevention. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with a model whereby most human cancers initiate in young individuals, revealing a critical window for such cancer prevention efforts.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

TE invasions triggered by HT may be much more abundant than previously thought. For example, previous studies in Drosophila melanogaster found 11 TE invasions over 200 the past years. A major limitation of current approaches for detecting recent invasions is the necessity for a repeat-library, which is notoriously difficult to generate. To address this, we developed GenomeDelta, a novel approach for identifying sample-specific sequences, such as recently invading TEs, without prior knowledge of the sequence. It can thus be used with model and non-model organisms. As input, GenomeDelta requires a long-read assembly and short-read data. It will find sequences in the assembly that are not represented in the short read data. Beyond identifying recent TE invasions, GenomeDelta can detect sequences with spatially heterogeneous distributions, recent insertions of viral elements and recent lateral gene transfers. We thoroughly validated GenomeDelta with simulated and real data from extant and historical specimens. Finally, we demonstrate that GenomeDelta can reveal novel biological insights: we discovered the three most recent TE invasions in Drosophila melanogaster and a novel TE with a geographically heterogeneous distribution in Zymoseptoria tritici.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

The CKM binds to cMED through an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) in MED13 and HEAT repeats in MED12. The CKM inhibits transcription by allocating its MED13 IDR to occlude binding of Pol II and MED26 to cMED and further obstructing cMED-PIC assembly through steric hindrance with TFIIH and the +1 nucleosome.

To tackle this, we developed mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs)-based heterogeneous cultures and a limb organoid model, termed budoids, comprising cells with AER, surface ectoderm, and mesoderm properties. mESCs were first induced into heterogeneous cultures that self-organized into domes in 2D. Aggregating these cultures resulted in formation of limb bud-like structures in 3D, exhibiting chondrogenesis-based symmetry breaking and elongation. Using our organoids and quantitative in situ expression profiling, we uncovered that AER-like cells support nearby limb mesoderm and fibroblast identities while enhancing tissue polarization that permits distant cartilage formation. Together, our findings provide a powerful model to study aspects of limb morphogenesis, and reveal the ability of signaling center AER cells to concurrently modulate cell fate and spatial organization.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Among the diverse proteins secreted by the nematode, we were specifically interested in identifying proteases to pursue our goal of engineering decoy substrates that elicit an immune response when cleaved by an SCN protease. We identified a cysteine protease that we named Cysteine Protease 1 (CPR1), which was predicted to be a secreted effector based on transcriptomic data obtained from SCN esophageal gland cells, presence of a signal peptide, and lack of transmembrane domains. CPR1 is conserved in all isolates of SCN sequenced to date, suggesting it is critical for virulence. Transient expression of CPR1 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves suppressed cell death induced by a constitutively active nucleotide binding leucine-rich repeat protein, RPS5, indicating that CPR1 inhibits effector-triggered immunity. CPR1 localizes in part to the mitochondria when expressed in planta. Proximity-based labeling in transgenic soybean roots, co-immunoprecipitation, and cleavage assays identified a branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase from soybean (GmBCAT1) as a substrate of CPR1. Silencing of the CPR1 transcript in the nematode reduced penetration frequency in soybean roots while the expression of CPR1 in soybean roots enhanced susceptibility. Our data demonstrates that CPR1 is a conserved effector protease with a direct target in soybean roots, highlighting it as a promising candidate for decoy engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

What controls the dissociation of cells, and whether they break off singly or in small groups? Can this be determined by cell-cell adhesion or chemotactic cues given to cells? We develop a physical model for this question, based on experiments that mimic aspects of cancer cell invasion using microfluidic devices with microchannels of different widths. Experimentally, most dissociation events (""ruptures"") involve single cells breaking off, but we observe some ruptures of large groups ([~] 20 cells) in wider channels. The rupture probability is nearly independent of channel width. We recapitulate the experimental results with a phase field cell motility model by introducing three different cell states (follower, guided, and high-motility metabolically active leader cells) based on their spatial position. These leader cells may explain why single-cell rupture is the universal most probable outcome. Our simulation results show that cell-channel adhesion is necessary for cells in narrow channels to invade, and strong cell-cell adhesion leads to fewer but larger ruptures. Chemotaxis also influences the rupture behavior: Strong chemotaxis strength leads to larger and faster ruptures. Finally, we study the relationship between biological jamming transitions and cell dissociations. Our results suggest unjamming is necessary but not sufficient to create ruptures.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

We analyzed 519 diverse strains, including 12 newly sequenced with long-read technology, to reveal 20 distinct Starships that generate genomic heterogeneity over timescales impacting experimental reproducibility. Starship-mobilized genes encode diverse functions, including biofilm-related virulence factors and biosynthetic gene clusters, and many are differentially expressed during infection and antifungal exposure in a strain-specific manner. These findings support a new model of fungal pathogenesis wherein Starships mediate variation in virulence-related gene content and expression. Together, our results demonstrate that Starships are a foundational mechanism generating disease-relevant genotypic and, in turn, phenotypic heterogeneity in a major human fungal pathogen.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Here we demonstrate that plasmids can cause microindel mutations in the host genome. These mutations are driven by the production of single-stranded DNA molecules that invade replication forks at microhomologies and subsequently get integrated into the genome. Using the gammaproteobacterial model organism Acinetobacter baylyi, we show that carriage of broad host range plasmids from different incompatibility groups can cause microindel mutations directly or indirectly. The plasmid pQLICE belonging to the incompatibility group Q (IncQ) and replicating by a characteristic strand displacement mechanism can generate chromosomal microindel mutations directly with short stretches of DNA originating from pQLICE. In addition, the presence of plasmids can increase microindel mutation frequencies indirectly (i.e., with chromosomal ectopic DNA) as shown with the IncP plasmid vector pRK415 (theta replication mechanism), presumably through plasmid-chromosome interactions that lead to DNA damages. These results provide new mechanistic insights into the microindel mutation mechanism, suggesting that single-stranded DNA repair intermediates are the causing agents. By contrast, the IncN plasmid RN3 appears to suppress host microindel mutations. The suppression mechanism remains unknown. Other plasmids in this study confer ambiguous or no quantifiable mutagenic effects.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

In our study, we aimed to develop an openly accessible reference of cytokines in the airways and blood of healthy children spanning 1 to 16 years of age. We examined how cytokine concentration changes during childhood and assessed whether a core set of cytokine markers could be used to indirectly evaluate the response of a broad spectrum of inflammatory analytes. To develop our reference, a total of 78 unique analytes were measured in cell-free bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and plasma from 78 children. We showed that age profoundly impacts soluble immune analyte concentration in both sample types and identified a highly correlative core set of 10 analytes in BAL and 11 analytes in plasma capable of indirectly evaluating the response of up to 34 inflammatory mediators. This study addresses an urgent need to develop reference ranges for cytokines in healthy children to aid in diagnosis of disease, to determine eligibility for, and to monitor the effects of, cytokine-targeted monoclonal antibody therapy.","NA","medrxiv",1720130973126

Before movement begins, the frontal cortex and striatum exhibit ramping spiking activity, with variable ramp slopes anticipating movement onsets. This activity may function as an adjustable timer, triggering actions at the desired timing. However, because the frontal cortex and striatum share similar ramping dynamics and are both necessary for timing behaviors, distinguishing their individual roles in this timer function remains challenging. To address this, we conducted perturbation experiments combined with multi-regional electrophysiology in mice performing a lick-timing task. Following transient silencing of the frontal cortex, cortical and striatal activity swiftly returned to pre-silencing levels and resumed ramping, leading to a shift in lick timing close to the silencing duration. Conversely, briefly inhibiting the striatum caused a gradual decrease in ramping activity in both regions, with ramping resuming from post-inhibition levels, shifting lick timing beyond the inhibition duration. Thus, inhibiting the frontal cortex and striatum effectively paused and rewound the timer, respectively. Additionally, the frontal cortex, but not the striatum, encodes trial-history information guiding lick timing. These findings suggest specialized functional allocations within the forebrain: the striatum temporally integrates input from the frontal cortex to generate ramping activity that regulates motor timing.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

NLR homeostasis has to be tightly regulated to ensure proper defense without triggering autoimmunity. However, in contrast to singleton NLRs, the mechanisms controlling the paired NLRs complex homeostasis are less understood. The paired Arabidopsis RRS1/RPS4 immune receptor complex confers disease resistance through effector recognition mediated by the integrated WRKY domain of RRS1. Here, through proximity labelling, we reveal a ubiquitination-deubiquitination cycle that controls the homeostasis of the RRS1/RPS4 complex. E3 ligase RARE directly binds and ubiquitinates RRS1's WRKY domain to promote its proteasomal degradation, thereby destabilizing RPS4 indirectly and compromising the stability and function of the RRS1/RPS4 complex. Conversely, the deubiquitinating enzymes UBP12/UBP13 deubiquitinate RRS1's WRKY domain, counteracting RARE's effects. Interestingly, the abundance of WRKY transcription factors WRKY70 and WRKY41 is also regulated by RARE and UBP12/UBP13. Phylogenetic analysis suggests this regulation likely transferred from WRKY70/WRKY41 to RRS1 upon WRKY domain integration. Our findings improve our understanding of homeostatic regulation of paired NLR complex and uncover a new paradigm whereby domain integration can co-opt preexisting post-translational modification to regulate novel protein functions.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

In this study, we engineered FLIM biosensors capable of detecting ATP (adenosine triphosphate), cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate), citrate, and glucose by inserting each sensing domain into the mTurquoise2 fluorescent protein between Tyr-145 and Phe-146 using peptide linkers. Through efficient linker screening, we successfully developed FLIM biosensors exhibiting an effective dynamic range from 0.5 to 1.0 ns upon analyte binding. This demonstrates that the qmTQ2-ATP-0 backbone is a universal platform for developing mTQ2-based biosensors.

However, they are most often reported as case studies, lack integration and standardization across platforms, and are therefore hard to objectively compare. In this study, we established a streamlined and diverse toolbox for methods that predict amino acid probabilities inside the Rosetta software framework that allows for the side-by-side comparison of these models. Subsequently, existing protein fitness landscapes were used to benchmark novel self- supervised machine learning methods in realistic protein design settings. We focused on the traditional problems of protein sequence design: sampling and scoring. A major finding of our study is that novel ML approaches are better at purging the sampling space from deleterious mutations. Nevertheless, scoring resulting mutations without model fine-tuning showed no clear improvement over scoring with Rosetta. This study fills an important gap in the field and allows for the first time a comprehensive head-to-head comparison of different ML and biophysical methods. We conclude that ML currently acts as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, biophysical methods in protein design.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

However, for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a coccoid organism that most commonly exists as a diplococcus and that possesses genes coding for rod-based cell division systems, the relationship between cell geometry and division is unclear. Here, we characterized the organization of N. gonorrhoeae division using a combination of fluorescent probes, genetics, and time-lapse microscopy. We found that the planes of successive cell divisions are orthogonal and temporally overlapping, thereby maintaining diplococcal morphology. Division takes place perpendicular to a subtle long-axis in each coccus. In keeping with the ParABS and the MinCDE systems reading the long-axis of rod-shaped bacteria, in the coccoid N. gonorrhoeae, ParB segregates along this subtle long-axis and cells lacking minCDE have severe morphological consequences, including an inability to perform orthogonal division and aberrant assembly of the division plane at the cell poles. Taken together, this stresses the central role of even slight dimensional asymmetry as a general organizational principle in bacterial cell division.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

A central question in bacterial ecology is why some species engage in cooperative interactions, whereas others compete. But this question often neglects the role of the environment. Here, we use genome-scale metabolic networks from two different open-access collections (AGORA and CarveMe) to assess pairwise interactions of different microbes in varying environmental conditions (provision of different environmental compounds). By scanning thousands of environments for 10,000 pairs of bacteria from each collection, we found that most pairs were able to both compete and cooperate depending on the availability of environmental resources. This approach allowed us to determine commonalities between environments that could facilitate the potential for cooperation or competition between a pair of species. Namely, cooperative interactions, especially obligate, were most common in less diverse environments. Further, as compounds were removed from the environment, we found interactions tended to degrade towards obligacy. However, we also found that on average at least one compound could be removed from an environment to switch the interaction from competition to facultative cooperation or vice versa. Together our approach indicates a high degree of plasticity in microbial interactions to the availability of environmental resources.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Currently, overdose survival relies entirely on bystander intervention, requiring a nearby person to discover and identify the overdosed individual, and have immediate access to naloxone to administer. Government efforts have focused on providing naloxone in abundance but do not address the equally critical component for overdose rescue: a willing and informed bystander.

Genes central to a network are more likely to be both conserved and highly expressed, whereas genes that are able to evolve in response to selective pressures but expressed at lower levels are located on the periphery of the network. The stress response is likewise thought to be conserved, however, experimental evidence for these patterns is limited. We examined whether the transcriptomic response to two environmental stressors (heat, UV, and their combination) is related to PPI architecture in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. We show that stress response genes are situated more centrally in the PPI network. The transcriptomic response to heat was located in both central and peripheral positions, whereas UV response occupied central to intermediate positions. Across treatments, differentially expressed genes in different parts of the network affected identical phenotypes. Our results indicate that the zebrafish stress response has mostly conserved but also some stressor-specific aspects. These properties can aid in better understanding the organismal response to diverse and co-occurring stressors. Network position was further linked to the magnitude of fold changes of genes and types and number of linked phenotype components. Given the speed of contemporary changes in aquatic ecosystems, our approach can aid in identifying novel key regulators of the systemic response to specific stressors.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

NCBI database genome sequences and isolates from 1 cm3 riverbank soil samples were analyzed to provide insights at global and local geographical scales, respectively. Most prophages in wild B. subtilis isolates were related to mobile genetic elements previously identified in laboratory strains. Some large groups of prophages were closely related to completely uncharacterized yet functional Bacillus phages, or completely unknown. As certain prophage groups were unique to local isolates, we explored factors influencing prophages within a single genome. Phylogenetic relatedness was a slightly better predictor of host prophage repertoire than geographical origin. We show that cryptic phages can play a major role in acquisition and/or maintenance of other prophage elements both via strong antagonism or by co-dependence. Laboratory experiments showed that most predicted prophages may be cryptic, since they failed to induce under DNA-damaging stress conditions. Interestingly, the magnitude of stress responses remained proportional to the total number of prophage elements predicted, suggesting their importance in host physiology. This study highlights the diversity, integration patterns, and co-occurrence of prophages in B. subtilis and their potential impact on host evolution and physiology. Understanding these dynamics provides insight into bacterial genome evolution and prophage-host interactions, laying the groundwork for future experimental studies on the roles of phages in the ecology and evolution of this bacterial species.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

There is growing interest in determining if interventions that promote metabolic health can prevent or delay AD. Acarbose is an anti-diabetic drug that not only improves glucose homeostasis, but also extends the lifespan of wild-type mice. Here, we test the hypothesis that acarbose will not only preserve metabolic health, but also slow or prevent AD pathology and cognitive deficits in 3xTg mice, a model of AD, fed either a Control diet or a high-fat, high-sucrose Western diet (WD). We find that acarbose decreases the body weight and adiposity of WD-fed 3xTg mice, increasing energy expenditure while also stimulating food consumption, and improves glycemic control. Both male and female WD-fed 3xTg mice have worsened cognitive deficits than Control-fed mice, and these deficits are ameliorated by acarbose treatment. Molecular and histological analysis of tau and amyloid pathology identified sex-specific effects of acarbose which are uncoupled from the dramatic improvements in cognition, suggesting that the benefits of acarbose on AD are largely driven by improved metabolic health. In conclusion, our results suggest that acarbose may be a promising intervention to prevent, delay, or even treat AD, especially in individuals consuming a Western diet.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Despite case fatality rates (CFRs) of over 30% and the pandemic potential associated with betacoronaviruses, a safe and efficacious vaccine has not been developed for prevention of MERS in at-risk individuals. Here we report the design, in vitro characterization, and preclinical evaluation of MERS-CoV antigens. Our lead candidate comprises a stabilized spike ectodomain displayed on a self-assembling ferritin nanoparticle that can be produced from a high-expressing, stable cell pool. This vaccine elicits robust antibody titers in BALB/c mice as measured by MERS-CoV pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization assays. Immunization of non-human primates (NHPs) with a single dose of Alhydrogel-adjuvanted vaccine elicits >103 geometric mean titer (GMT) of pseudovirus neutralizing antibodies that can be boosted with a second dose. These antibody levels are durable, with GMTs that surpass the post-prime levels for more than 5 months post-boost. Importantly, sera from these NHPs exhibits broad cross-reactivity against lentiviruses pseudotyped with spike proteins from MERS-CoV clades A, B, and C as well as a more distant pangolin merbecovirus. In an established alpaca challenge model, immunization fully protects against viral infection. This protein-based MERS-CoV nanoparticle vaccine is a promising candidate for advancement to clinical development to protect at-risk individuals and for future use in a potential outbreak setting.

ObjectivesTo investigate whether Long COVID and its physio-affective phenome are linked to autoimmunity to the tight junction proteins, zonulin and occludin (ZOOC), and immune reactivity to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and whether the latter are associated with signs of human herpes virus-6 reactivation (HHV-6), autoimmunity directed against oligodendrocyte and neuronal proteins, including myelin basic protein (MBP).

MethodsIgA/IgM/IgG responses to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), HHV-6, ZOOC, and neuronal proteins, C-reactive protein (CRP) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), were measured in 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls. The physio-affective phenome was conceptualized as a factor extracted from physical and affective symptom domains.

ResultsNeural network identified IgA directed to LPS (IgA-LPS), IgG-ZOOC, IgG-LPS, and IgA-ZOOC as the most important variables associated with Long COVID diagnosis with an area under the ROC curve of 0.755. Partial Least Squares analysis showed that 40.9% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome was explained by CRP, IgA-MPB and IgG-MBP. A large part of the variances in both autoimmune responses to MBP (36.3-39.7%) was explained by autoimmunity (IgA and IgG) directed to ZOOC. The latter was strongly associated with indicants of HHV-6 reactivation, which in turn was associated with increased IgM-SARS-CoV-2.

ConclusionsAutoimmunity against components of the tight junctions and increased bacterial translocation may be involved in the pathophysiology of Long COVIDs physio-affective phenome.","NA","medrxiv",1720130973126

One approach to identifying functional areas and networks within individual brains is based on robust and extensively validated 'localizer' paradigms--contrasts of conditions that aim to isolate some mental process of interest. Here, we present a new version of a localizer for the fronto-temporal language-selective network. This localizer is similar to a commonly-used localizer based on the reading of sentences and nonword sequences (Fedorenko et al., 2010) but uses speeded presentation (200ms per word/nonword). Based on a direct comparison between the standard version (450ms per word/nonword) and the speeded versions of the language localizer in 24 participants, we show that a single run of the speeded localizer (3.5 min) is highly effective at identifying the language-selective areas: indeed, it is more effective than the standard localizer given that it leads to an increased response to the critical (sentence) condition and a decreased response to the control (nonwords) condition. This localizer may therefore become the version of choice for identifying the language network in neurotypical adults or special populations (as long as they are proficient readers), especially when time is of essence.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Here, we build a large-scale three-dimensional model of extracellular DA dynamics in the dorsal (DS) and ventral striatum (VS) based on experimentally determined biological parameters. The model predicts rapid dynamics in DS with little-to-no basal DA, whereas lower uptake capacity in VS slows signalling and enables build-up of a tonic DA level. Receptor binding simulations reveals that DA D1 receptor occupancy follows extracellular DA concentration with millisecond delay, while DA D2 receptors integrate DA signal over seconds. Our modelling further predicts that VS extracellular levels are highly sensitive to DA transporter (DAT) uptake capacity and posit prevalent nanoclustering of DAT in VS as a regulator of DA uptake. Our simulations substantiate regional differences in extracellular DA dynamics and challenge prevailing paradigms of striatal DA signalling.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Although polymicrobial infections are associated with poor treatment responses in CF, the effects of the ecological interactions between co-infecting pathogens on antibiotic sensitivity and treatment outcome are poorly characterized. To this end, we systematically quantified the impact of these effects on the antibiotic sensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa for nine antibiotics in the presence of thirteen secondary cystic fibrosis-associated bacterial and fungal pathogens through time-kill assays. We fitted pharmacodynamic models to these kill curves for each antibiotic-species combination and found that interspecies interactions changing the antibiotic sensitivity of P. aeruginosa are abundant. Interactions that lower antibiotic sensitivity are more common than those that increase it, with generally more substantial reductions than increases in sensitivity. For a selection of co-infecting species, we performed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling of P. aeruginosa treatment. We predicted that interspecies interactions can either improve or reduce treatment response to the extent that treatment is rendered ineffective from a previously effective antibiotic dosing schedule and vice versa. In summary, we show that quantifying the ecological interaction effects as pharmacodynamic parameters is necessary to determine the abundance and the extent to which these interactions affect antibiotic sensitivity in polymicrobial infections.

ImportanceIn cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, chronic respiratory tract infections are often polymicrobial, involving multiple pathogens simultaneously. Polymicrobial infections are difficult to treat as they often respond unexpectedly to antibiotic treatment, which might possibly be explained because co-infecting pathogens can influence each others antibiotic sensitivity, but it is unknown to what extent such effects occur. To investigate this, we systematically quantified the impact of co-infecting species on antibiotic sensitivity, focusing on P. aeruginosa, a common CF pathogen. We studied for a large set co-infecting species and antibiotics whether changes in antibiotic response occur. Based on these experiments, we used mathematical modeling to simulate P. aeruginosas response to colistin and tobramycin treatment in the presence of multiple pathogens. This study offers comprehensive data on altered antibiotic sensitivity of P. aeruginosa in polymicrobial infections, serves as a foundation for optimizing treatment of such infections, and consolidates the importance of considering co-infecting pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Here, we combine bulk and single cell genomics of human somatic NF1 mutant, IDH-wildtype glioblastomas with functional genomic analysis of cell lines and mouse intracranial tumor models to identify molecular subgroups within NF1 mutant glioblastomas and mechanisms underlying MEK inhibitor response. Targeted DNA sequencing showed homozygous deletion of the cell cycle regulator CDKN2A/B is a poor prognostic marker in somatic NF1 mutant, but not NF1 wildtype, tumors. DNA methylation array profiling revealed three epigenetic groups highlighted by distinct clinical features, co-mutation patterns, and reference methylation classifier identities. Genome-wide CRISPRi screens in glioblastoma cells revealed cell cycle regulators are conserved mediators of cell growth while response to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib converges on Ras/RAF/MEK pathway activation. Repression of the RAF regulator SHOC2 sensitizes glioblastomas to selumetinib in vitro and in vivo in mouse intracranial glioblastoma models. Single cell RNA-sequencing of mouse intracranial glioblastomas treated with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib reveals distinct responses between mesenchymal-like (MES-like) and non MES-like subpopulations suggesting non-MES like cells are intrinsically resistant to MEK inhibition. Finally, single nuclear RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) of human NF1 mutant, CDKN2A/B deleted glioblastomas reveals MES-like tumor cells are associated with selumetinib sensitivity signatures while non MES-like cells exhibit increased cell cycle progression and lack selumetinib sensitivity, further supporting the notion that MEK inhibition specifically targets MES-like tumor cell subpopulations. Taken together, our data underscores the heterogeneity between and within somatic NF1 mutant glioblastomas and delineates mechanisms of MEK inhibitor response across distinct tumor subpopulations, guiding the development of future therapeutic strategies that may synergize with MEK inhibition for NF1 mutant tumors.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Novel approaches to control the spread of arboviruses focus on harnessing the antiviral immune system of their primary vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito. In arthropods, genes of the Vago family are often presented as analogs of mammalian cytokines with potential antiviral functions, but the role of Vago genes upon virus infection in Ae. aegypti is largely unknown. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the Vago gene family in Diptera, which led us to focus on a Vago-like gene that we named VLG-1. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we generated a VLG-1 mutant line of Ae. aegypti that revealed a proviral effect of this gene upon DENV and ZIKV infection. In the absence of VLG-1, virus dissemination throughout the mosquito's body was impaired, albeit not altering virus transmission rates. A tissue-specific transcriptome analysis revealed that the loss of VLG-1 impacted numerous biological processes potentially linked to viral replication, such as the oxidative stress response. Our results challenge the conventional understanding of Vago-like genes as antiviral factors and underscores the need for further research to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying mosquito-arbovirus interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

They attract pollinators, possess antioxidant properties that scavenge free radicals during environmental stress, and provide protection against various stress conditions. Lignin, another secondary metabolite, plays crucial roles in providing mechanical support, facilitating water and solute transport, and protecting against pathogens. MYB transcription factors, particularly R2R3 MYBs, are key regulators of secondary metabolism, especially within the phenylpropanoid pathway. These factors act as both activators and repressors. The N-terminal region of R2R3-MYB repressors contains a conserved bHLH-binding domain, while the C-terminal domain is divergent and includes an EAR repressor domain. R2R3-MYB proteins notably target sequences such as the MYB-response element and AC elements. In this study, we identified and characterized the Nicotiana MYB transcription factor, NtMYB308, and explored its regulatory function in anthocyanin and lignin biosynthesis in tobacco. Our Virus Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) and Protein-DNA interaction studies suggest that NtMYB308 is a negative regulator of anthocyanin and lignin biosynthesis by binding to the promoters of genes involved in these pathways. To validate our findings, we developed CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout mutant plants of tobacco, NtMYB308CR, which showed up-regulation of anthocyanin and lignin biosynthesis. Conversely, NtMYB308 overexpression (NtMYB308OX) plants exhibited the opposite effect. Enhanced anthocyanin and lignin levels in NtMYB308CR plants provided tolerance against the fungus Alternaria solani, while NtMYB308OX lines were susceptible.

Here we show that prediction errors do not only occur in response to actual events - they also arise endogenously in response to merely imagined events. Specifically, we show that people acquire a preference for acquaintances as they imagine interacting with them in unexpectedly pleasant situations. This learning can best be accounted for by a computational model that calculates prediction errors based on these rewarding experiences. Using functional MRI, we show that the prediction error is mediated via striatal activity. This activity, in turn, seems to update preferences about the individuals by updating their cortical representations.

We show that upon onset of apoptosis, Apaf1 molecules accumulate into multiple foci per cell. Disassembly of the foci is linked to survival of the cell. Structurally, Apaf1 foci resemble organelle-sized, cloud-like assemblies. Foci form upon specific molecular interactions with cytochrome c and depending on procaspase-9. We propose that Apaf1 foci correspond to the apoptosome in cells. Transientness and ultrastructure of Apaf1 foci suggest that the spatiotemporal organisation of apoptotic factors regulates progression of apoptosis.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

The precise origins of such insights are unknown. Some evidence has shown that sleep facilitates insights, while other work has not found such a relationship. One recent suggestion that could explain this mixed evidence is that different sleep stages have differential effects on insight. In addition, computational work has suggested that neural variability and regularisation play a role in increasing the likelihood of insight. To investigate the link between insight and different sleep stages as well as regularisation, we conducted a preregistered study in which N=90 participants performed a perceptual insight task before and after a 20 minute daytime. Sleep EEG data showed that N2 sleep, but not N1 sleep, increases the likelihood of insight after a nap, suggesting a specific role of deeper sleep. Exploratory analyses of EEG power spectra showed that spectral slopes could predict insight beyond sleep stages, which is broadly in line with theoretical suggestions of a link between insight and regularisation. In combination, our findings point towards a role of N2 sleep and aperiodic, but not oscillatory, neural activity for insight.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

One strategy to negotiate this tradeoff is to perform local searches around the food but repeatedly return to feed. We studied this behavior in flies and used genetic tools to uncover the underlying mechanisms. Over time, flies gradually expand their search, shifting from primarily exploiting food sources to exploring the environment, a change that is likely driven by increases in satiety. We found that flies search patterns preserve these dynamics even as the overall scale of the search is modulated by starvation-induced changes in metabolic state. In contrast, search induced by optogenetic activation of sugar sensing neurons does not show these dynamics. We asked what navigational strategies underlie local search. Using a generative model, we found that a change in locomotor pattern after food consumption could account for repeated returns to the food, but failed to capture relatively direct, long return trajectories. Alternative strategies, such as path integration or sensory taxis could allow flies to return from larger distances. We tested this by individually silencing the flys head direction system, olfaction and hygrosensation, and found that the only substantial effect was from perturbing hygrosensation, which reduced the number of long exploratory trips. Our study illustrates that local search is composed of multiple behavioral features that evolve over time based on both internal and external factors, providing a path towards uncovering the underlying neural mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Although many competitive interactions have been characterized, molecular adaptations that can counter this antagonism and preserve or increase fitness remain underexplored. Here, we characterize the adaptation of Staphylococcus aureus to pyocyanin, a redox-active interspecies antimicrobial produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a co-infecting pathogen frequently isolated from wound and chronic lung infections with S. aureus. Using experimental evolution, we identified mutations in a conserved global transcriptional regulator, CodY, that confer tolerance to pyocyanin and thereby enhance survival of S. aureus. The transcriptional response of a pyocyanin tolerant CodY mutant to pyocyanin indicated a two-pronged defensive response compared to the wild type. Firstly, the CodY mutant strongly suppressed metabolism, by downregulating pathways associated with core metabolism, especially translation-associated genes, upon exposure to pyocyanin. Metabolic suppression via ATP depletion was sufficient to provide comparable protection against pyocyanin to the wild-type strain. Secondly, while both the wild-type and CodY mutant strains upregulated oxidative stress response pathways, the CodY mutant overexpressed multiple stress response genes compared to the wild type. We determined that catalase overexpression was critical to pyocyanin tolerance as its absence eliminated tolerance in the CodY mutant and overexpression of catalase was sufficient to impart tolerance to the wild-type strain. Together, these results suggest that both transcriptional responses likely contribute to pyocyanin tolerance in the CodY mutant. Our data thus provide new mechanistic insight into adaptation toward interbacterial antagonism via altered regulation that facilitates multifaceted protective cellular responses.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Design: Nationwide sibling-controlled cohort study of adolescents. Setting: Sweden. Participants: 1 124 049 men of which 477 453 were full siblings, who underwent mandatory military conscription examinations between 1972 and 1995 at a mean age of 18.3 years. Main outcome measures: Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of overall cancer diagnosis and cancer mortality, and 14 site-specific cancers (diagnosis or death), as recorded in the Swedish National Patient Register or Cause of Death Register until 31 December 2023, modeled using flexible parametric regression. Results: Participants were followed until a median (maximum) age of 55.9 (73.5) years, during which 98 410 were diagnosed with cancer and 16 789 had a cancer-related death (41 293 and 6908 among full siblings respectively). The most common cancers were non-melanoma skin (27 105 diagnoses & 227 deaths) and prostate cancer (24 211 diagnoses & 869 deaths). In cohort analysis, those in the highest quartile of cardiorespiratory fitness had a higher risk of prostate (adjusted HR 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.16) and skin cancer (e.g., non-melanoma HR 1.44; 1.37 to 1.50) compared to those in the lowest quartile, which led to a higher risk of any type of cancer diagnosis (HR 1.08; 1.06 to 1.11). However, those in the highest quartile had a lower risk of cancer mortality (HR 0.71; 0.67 to 0.76). When comparing full siblings, and thereby controlling for all behavioural, environmental, and genetic factors they share, the excess risk of prostate (HR 1.01; 0.90 to 1.13) and skin cancer (e.g., non-melanoma HR 1.09; 0.99 to 1.20) attenuated to the null. In contrast, the lower risk of overall cancer mortality was still statistically significant after control for such shared confounders (HR 0.78; 0.68 to 0.89). For other site-specific cancers, the influence of such confounding tended to vary, but none showed the same ex-cess risk as prostate and non-melanoma skin cancer. Conclusions: The association between high levels of adolescent cardiorespiratory fitness and excess risk of some cancers, such as prostate and non-melanoma skin cancer, appears to be fully explained by unobserved confounders shared between full siblings. However, the protective association with cancer mortality persists even after control for such confounding.","NA","medrxiv",1720130973126

Several members of the Lactobacillaceae (LAB) family are frequently isolated from the floral niche, mostly from bees and flowers. In some floral LAB species (henceforth referred to as bee-associated), distinctive genomic (e.g., genome reduction) and phenotypic (e.g., preference for fructose over glucose or fructophily) features were recently documented. These features are found across distantly related species, raising the hypothesis that specific genomic and phenotypic traits evolved convergently during adaptation to the floral environment. To test this hypothesis, we examined representative genomes of 369 species of bee-associated and non-bee-associated LAB. Phylogenomic analysis unveiled seven independent ecological shifts towards the floral niche in LAB. In these bee-associated LAB, we observed pervasive, significant reductions of genome size, gene repertoire, and GC content. Using machine leaning, we could distinguish bee-associated from non-bee-associated species with 94% accuracy, based on the absence of genes involved in metabolism, osmotic stress, or DNA repair. Moreover, we found that the most important genes for the machine learning classifier were seemingly lost, independently, in multiple bee-associated lineages. One of these genes, adhE, encodes a bifunctional aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase associated with the evolution of fructophily, a rare phenotypic trait that was recently identified in many floral LAB species. These results suggest that the independent evolution of distinctive phenotypes in bee-associated LAB has been largely driven by independent loss of the same set of genes.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

During aging, alterations in lipid metabolism lead to reduced content of very long-chain PUFAs (VLC-PUFAs) in the retina, and this decline is associated with normal age-related visual decline and pathological age-related macular degeneration (AMD). ELOVL2 (Elongation of very-long-chain fatty acids-like 2) encodes a transmembrane protein that produces precursors to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and VLC-PUFAs, and methylation level of its promoter is currently the best predictor of chronological age.

Intravitreal supplementation with the direct product of ELOVL2, 24:5n-3, in aged animals significantly improved visual function and reduced accumulation of ApoE, HTRA1 and complement proteins in sub-RPE deposits. At the molecular level, the gene expression pattern observed in retinas supplemented with 24:5n-3 exhibited a partial rejuvenation profile, including decreased expression of aging-related genes and a transcriptomic signature of younger retina. Finally, we present the first human genetic data showing significant association of several variants in the human ELOVL2 locus with the onset of intermediate AMD, underlying the translational significance of our findings. In sum, our study identifies novel therapeutic opportunities and defines ELOVL2 as a promising target for interventions aimed at preventing age-related vision loss.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Current methods for predicting and diagnosing tumor metastasis rely heavily on extensive examinations and subjective clinical judgments, introducing considerable uncertainty and inefficiency. Accurate prediction of tumor metastasis likelihood is crucial for guiding effective clinical interventions and extending patient survival. Additionally, identifying key genes that influence metastasis probability could provide valuable data for detecting tumor-specific biomarkers indicative of metastasis likelihood. Multi-omics datasets, which encompass diverse genomic information, offer a comprehensive understanding of cancer biology. Leveraging deep learning algorithms enhances the accuracy and predictive power in forecasting cancer metastasis, given their superior performance in complex prediction tasks. We developed a deep learning-based framework, MetaGXplore, which represents the first attempt to predict metastasis probability using pan-cancer multi-omic datasets and to explain the pivotal genes involved in the process. We trained the classification model using a K-fold cross-validation procedure and interpreted the predicted results with GNNExplainer. The effectiveness of MetaGXplore was demonstrated by evaluating the model, graph structure contribution, and multi-omics data. Finally, enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes and pathways was conducted to explore the biological functions of major differential genes and the relationships between key pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Environmental stressors are known to affect microbes, their fitness, and the ecosystem functions that they perform, yet understanding the causal mechanisms behind this influence has been difficult. We used leaf litter on soil surface as a model in situ system to assess changes in bacterial genomic traits and decomposition rates over 18 months with drought as a stressor. We hypothesized that genome-scale trade-offs due to investment in stress tolerance traits under drought reduce the capacity for bacterial populations to carry out decomposition; and that these population-level trade-offs scale up to impact emergent community traits thereby reducing decomposition rates. We observed drought tolerance mechanisms that were heightened in bacterial populations under drought, identified as higher gene copy numbers in metagenome-assembled genomes. A subset of populations under drought had reduced carbohydrate-active enzyme genes which suggested - as a trade-off - a decline in decomposition capabilities. These trade-offs were taxonomically structured as distinct patterns appeared in populations across families. We show that trait-tradeoffs in bacterial populations under drought could scale up to reduce overall decomposition capabilities and litter decay rates. Using a trait-based approach to assess the population ecology of soil bacteria, we demonstrate genome-level trade-offs in response to drought with consequences for decomposition rates.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

While this phenomenon has been the focus of much theoretical and empirical research, our understanding of evolutionary rescue in communities consisting of interacting species is still limited, especially in mutualistic communities, where evolutionary rescue is expected to be constrained by the less adaptable partner. Here, we explored empirically the likelihood, population dynamics, and genetic mechanisms underpinning evolutionary rescue in an obligate mutualism in which auxotrophic Escherichia coli strains exchanged essential amino acids reciprocally. We observed that >80% of the communities avoided extinction when exposed to two different types of lethal and abrupt stresses. Of note, only one of the strains survived in all cases. Genetic and phenotypic analyses show that this strain reverted to autonomy by metabolically bypassing the auxotrophy, but we found little evidence of specific adaptation to the stressors. Crucially, we found that the mutualistic partners were substantially more sensitive to both stresses than prototrophs, so that reversion to autonomy was sufficient to alleviate stress below lethal levels. We observed that increased sensitivity was common across several other stresses, suggesting that this may be a general property of obligate mutualisms mediated by amino acid exchange. Our results reveal that evolutionary rescue may depend critically on the specific genetic and physiological details of the interacting partners, adding rich layers of complexity to the endeavor of predicting the fate of microbial communities facing intense environmental deterioration.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

It is unknown whether broad-spectrum RAS inhibitors meet similar limitations. Here, we identify and categorize mechanisms of resistance to the broad-spectrum active-state RAS inhibitor RMC-7977 in colorectal cancer cell lines. We found that KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer cell lines are universally sensitive to RMC-7977, inhibiting the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK axis, halting proliferation and in some cases inducing apoptosis. To monitor KRAS downstream effector pathway activity, we developed a compartment-specific dual-color ERK activity reporter system. RMC-7977 treatment reduced reporter activity. However, long-term dose escalation with RMC-7977 revealed multiple patterns of reporter reactivation in emerging resistant cell populations that correlated with phosphorylation states of compartment-specific ERK targets. Cells sorted for high, low, or cytoplasmic reporter activity exhibited distinct patterns of genomic mutations, phospho-protein, and transcriptional activities. Notably, all resistant subpopulations showed dynamic ERK regulation in the presence of the RAS inhibitor, unlike the parental sensitive cell lines. High levels of RAS downstream activities were observed in cells characterized by a KRAS Y71H resistance mutation. In contrast, RAS inhibitor-resistant populations with low, or cytoplasmic ERK reporter reactivation displayed different genetic alterations, among them RAF1 S257L and S259P mutations. Colorectal cancer cells resistant to RMC-7977 and harboring the RAF1 mutation specifically exhibited synergistic sensitivity to concurrent RAS and RAF inhibition. Our findings endorse reporter-assisted screening together with single-cell analyses as a powerful approach for dissecting the complex landscape of therapy resistance.

However, their remodeling upon metabolic stress remains incompletely characterized, translating to unprecedented challenges to develop safe medications against the surge of metabolic diseases. Oxytocin (OXT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) are one of the key appetite-suppressing effectors within the melanocortin system. In this work, we report that metabolic stress in mice evokes spatiotemporally selective ATP release (Inflares) from PVH astrocytes, accompanied with the expression of hematopoietic lineage-specific ADP/ATP receptor P2Y12 on OXT (PVHOXT) neurons. Importantly, ""ectopic"" emergence of P2Y12 on OXT neurons of patients with diabetes mellitus suggests an evolutionary conserved purinergic response to metabolic stress. Strikingly, increased purinergic signaling leads to impaired responsiveness of PVHOXT neurons accompanied with hyperphagic obesity and insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, nasal administration of clinically approved doses of P2Y12 inhibitors counteracts diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice and spontaneous weight gain in monkeys, paving the way for their application in patients with metabolic disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

The capability to profile the landscape of antigen-binding affinity of a vast number of BCRs will provide a powerful tool to reveal novel insights at unprecedented levels and will yield powerful tools for translational development. However, current experimental approaches for profiling antibody-antigen interactions are costly and time-consuming, and can only achieve low-to-mid throughput. On the other hand, bioinformatics tools in the field of antibody informatics mostly focus on optimization of antibodies given known binding antigens, which is a very different research question and of limited scope. In this work, we developed an innovative Artificial Intelligence tool, Cmai, to address the prediction of the binding between antibodies and antigens that can be scaled to high-throughput sequencing data. Cmai achieved an AUROC of 0.91 in our validation cohort. We devised a biomarker metric based on the output from Cmai applied to high-throughput BCR sequencing data. We found that, during immune-related adverse events (irAEs) caused by immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment, the humoral immunity is preferentially responsive to intracellular antigens from the organs affected by the irAEs. In contrast, extracellular antigens on malignant tumor cells are inducing B cell infiltrations, and the infiltrating B cells have a greater tendency to co-localize with tumor cells expressing these antigens. We further found that the abundance of tumor antigen-targeting antibodies is predictive of ICI treatment response. Overall, Cmai and our biomarker approach filled in a gap that is not addressed by current antibody optimization works nor works such as AlphaFold3 that predict the structures of complexes of proteins that are known to bind.

One Sentence SummaryThis work introduces Cmai, an Artificial Intelligence tool that predicts antibody-antigen binding with high accuracy from massive sequencing data, which offers a potent means to elucidate the relevance of antigen-antibody interactions in various biomedical contexts and to advance antibody-centric translational development.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

These methods typically use gene sets as input data, and subsequently return overrepresented terms along with associated statistics describing their enrichment. This approach does not cater to analyses focused on a single gene-of-interest, particularly when the gene lacks prior functional characterization. To address this, we formulated GeneCOCOA, a method which utilizes context-specific gene co-expression and curated functional gene sets, but focuses on a user-supplied gene-of-interest. The co-expression between the gene-of-interest and subsets of genes from functional groups (e.g. pathways, GO terms) is derived using linear regression, and resulting root-mean-square error values are compared against background values obtained from randomly selected genes. The resulting p values provide a statistical ranking of functional gene sets from any collection, along with their associated terms, based on their co-expression with the gene of interest in a manner specific to the context and experiment. GeneCOCOA thereby provides biological insight into both gene function, and putative regulatory mechanisms by which the expression of the gene-of-interest is controlled. Despite its relative simplicity, GeneCOCOA outperforms similar methods in the accurate recall of known gene-disease associations. GeneCOCOA is formulated as an R package for ease-of-use, available at https://github.com/si-ze/geneCOCOA.

Author summaryUnderstanding the biological functions of different genes and their respective products is a key element of modern biological research. While one can examine the relative abundance of a gene product in transcriptomics data, this alone does not provide any clue to the biological relevance of the gene. Using a type of analysis called co-expression, it is possible to identify other genes which have similar patterns of regulation to a gene-of-interest, but again, this cannot tell you what a gene does. Genes whose function has previously been studied are often assembled into groups (e.g. pathways, ontologies), which can be used to annotate gene sets of interest. However, if a gene has not yet been characterized, it will not appear in these gene set enrichment analyses. Here, we propose a new method - GeneCOCOA - which uses co-expression of a single gene with genes in functional groups to identify which functional group a gene is most similar too, resulting in a putative function for the gene, even if it has not been studied before. We tested GeneCOCOA by using it to find gene-disease links which have already been scientifically studied, and showed that GeneCOCOA can do this more effectively than other available methods.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

We applied a single transcription factor (SOX10)-based protocol to accelerate oligodendrocyte differentiation from hiPSC-derived neural precursor cells, generating self-organizing forebrain organoids. These organoids include neurons, astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and hiPSC-derived microglia to achieve immunocompetence. Over 8 weeks, organoids reproducibly generated mature CNS cell types, exhibiting single-cell transcriptional profiles similar to the adult human brain. Exposed to inflamed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from MS patients, organoids properly mimic macroglia-microglia neuro-degenerative phenotypes and intercellular communication seen in chronic active MS. Oligodendrocyte vulnerability emerged by day 6 post-MS-CSF exposure, with nearly 50% reduction. Temporally-resolved organoid data support and expand on the role of soluble CSF mediators in sustaining downstream events leading to oligodendrocyte death and inflammatory neurodegeneration.

Studying amphibian biology through the genomics lens increases our understanding of the features of this animal class and that of other terrestrial vertebrates. The need for amphibian genomics resources is more urgent than ever due to the increasing threats to this group. Amphibians are one of the most imperiled taxonomic groups, with approximately 41% of species threatened with extinction due to habitat loss, changes in land use patterns, disease, climate change, and their synergistic effects. Amphibian genomics resources have provided a better understanding of ontogenetic diversity, tissue regeneration, diverse life history and reproductive modes, anti- predator strategies, and resilience and adaptive responses. They also serve as critical models for understanding widespread genomic characteristics, including evolutionary genome expansions and contractions given they have the largest range in genome sizes of any animal taxon and multiple mechanisms of genetic sex determination. Despite these features, genome sequencing of amphibians has significantly lagged behind that of other vertebrates, primarily due to the challenges of assembling their large, repeat-rich genomes and the relative lack of societal support. The advent of long-read sequencing technologies, along with computational techniques that enhance scaffolding capabilities and streamline computational workload is now enabling the ability to overcome some of these challenges. To promote and accelerate the production and use of amphibian genomics research through international coordination and collaboration, we launched the Amphibian Genomics Consortium (AGC) in early 2023. This burgeoning community already has more than 282 members from 41 countries (6 in Africa, 131 in the Americas, 27 in Asia, 29 in Australasia, and 89 in Europe). The AGC aims to leverage the diverse capabilities of its members to advance genomic resources for amphibians and bridge the implementation gap between biologists, bioinformaticians, and conservation practitioners.

We aimed to assess performance, safety, and tolerability of the EsoGuard (EG) assay on samples collected non-endoscopically with the EsoCheck (EC) device (EG/EC) for BE detection in the intended-use population, meeting American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guideline criteria (chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and 3+ additional risk factors).

MethodsWe performed a prospective, multicenter study (NCT04293458) to assess EG performance (primary endpoint) on cells collected with EC, for detection of BE and EAC using esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and biopsies as the comparator. Twenty-four sites across the U.S. and Spain participated. EC safety and usability were assessed as secondary endpoints.

Results180 male subjects aged >50 years with chronic GERD met eligibility criteria, of which 163 (90.6%) had EGD and successful EC administration. Mean age was 60.5yrs, 34.4% were obese, 56.7% had tobacco history, and 3.9% had a 1st degree relative with BE or EAC. Of 122 samples analyzed, 93 contributed to the primary endpoint analysis. About 9% of subjects in the Primary Analysis Population had BE on EGD, none with dysplasia. Sensitivity of EG for BE was 87.5% (95% CI 47.4-99.7), specificity was 81.2% (95% CI 71.2-88.8), positive predictive value was 30.4% (95% CI 13.2-52.9), and negative predictive value was 98.6% (95% CI 92.3-99.96). Mild esophageal abrasions were observed in 1.5%; no serious adverse events were reported.

This deep homology is reflected in ESCRT-III structure and function as demonstrated by the fact that ESCRT-IIIB assembles into parallel arrays on planar membranes to initiate membrane deformation, and is required to recruit ESCRT-IIIA to generate composite polymers. ESCRT-IIIA homopolymers can then remodel membranes into tubes, as a likely prelude to scission. Taken together, this analysis reveals a set of conserved principles governing ESCRT-III-dependent membrane remodelling that first emerged with the evolution of a two-component ESCRT-III system in the Asgard archaea, and which continue to underlie complex multi-component, ESCRT-III-dependent membrane remodelling in eukaryotes.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

For short-read, high-throughput sequencing data, mapping sequencing reads to a linear reference genome can bias population genetic inference due to mismatches in reads carrying non-reference alleles. In this study, we investigate the impact of mapping bias on allele frequency estimates from pseudohaploid data, commonly used in ultra-low coverage ancient DNA sequencing. To mitigate mapping bias, we propose an empirical adjustment to genotype likelihoods. Simulating ancient DNA data with realistic post-mortem damage, we compare widely used methods for estimating ancestry proportions under different scenarios, including reference genome selection, population divergence, and sequencing depth. Our findings reveal that mapping bias can lead to differences in estimated admixture proportion of up to 4% depending on the reference population. However, the choice of method has a much stronger impact, with some methods showing differences of 10%. qpAdm appears to perform best at estimating simulated ancestry proportions, but it is sensitive to mapping bias and its applicability may vary across species due to its requirement for additional populations beyond the sources and target population. Our adjusted genotype likelihood approach largely mitigates the effect of mapping bias on genome-wide ancestry estimates from genotype likelihood-based tools. However, it cannot account for the bias introduced by the method itself or the noise in individual site allele frequency estimates due to low sequencing depth. Overall, our study provides valuable insights for obtaining precise estimates of allele frequencies and ancestry proportions in empirical studies.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

This study aimed to comprehensively profile the gut microbiome among Ugandan COVID-19 patients and infer potential implications.

MethodsNasopharyngeal swabs, stool, clinical and demographic data were collected from COVID-19 confirmed cases at the COVID-19 isolation and treatment centers in Kampala and Entebbe, Uganda, during the first and second waves of the pandemic in Uganda (i.e., 2020 and 2021, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 presence in the swab samples was confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays. 16S rRNA metagenomic next-generation sequencing was performed on the DNA extracted from the stool samples, followed by bioinformatics analysis. Machine learning was used to determine microbes that were associated with disease severity.

ResultsWe observed varied gut microbial composition between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Klebsiella oxytoca, Salmonella enterica and Serratia marcescens had an increased presence in COVID-19 disease states, especially severe cases. Enrichment of opportunistic pathogens, such as Enterococcus species, and depletion of beneficial microbes, like Alphaproteobacteria, was observed between mild and severe cases. Machine learning identified age and microbes such as Ruminococcaceae, Bacilli, Enterobacteriales, porphyromonadaceae, and Prevotella copri as predictive of severity.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that the microbiome plays a role in the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in African patients. The shift in abundance of specific microbes can moderately predict severity of COVID-19 in this population. Their direct or indirect roles in determining severity should be investigated further for potential therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

We show that clock dysfunction aberrantly activates DREAM leading to simultaneous de-regulation of multiple cellular processes. The affected activities including translation, stress responses and OXPHOS are basic and ubiquitous, explaining pan-cellular decline induced by impaired clock and sleep. Accordingly, inhibition of DREAM restores healthy homeostasis and alleviates de-regulation of adaptive mechanisms in clock-impaired nematodes and human cells. This restorative effect occurs amid persisting clock dysfunction, suggesting that DREAM ablation uniquely uncouples circadian clock impairments from their negative effects on health.

This abnormality poses a hurdle for using pluripotent cell lines in biomedical applications and underscores the need to identify the causes of imprint instability in these cells. We show that nPSCs from inbred mouse strains exhibit pronounced strain-specific susceptibility to locus-specific deregulation of imprinting marks during reprogramming to pluripotency and upon culture with MAP kinase inhibitors, a common approach to maintain naive pluripotency. Analysis of genetically highly diverse nPSCs from the Diversity Outbred (DO) stock confirms that genetic variation is a major determinant of epigenome stability in pluripotent cells. We leverage the variable DNA hypomethylation in DO lines to identify several trans-acting quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that determine epigenome stability at either specific target loci or genome-wide. Candidate factors encoded by two multi-target QTLs on chromosomes 4 and 17 suggest specific transcriptional regulators that contribute to DNA methylation maintenance in nPSCs. We propose that genetic variants represent candidate biomarkers to identify pluripotent cell lines with desirable properties and might serve as entry points for the targeted engineering of nPSCs with stable epigenomes.

Its global production amounts to more than 50 million tons per year, and it constitutes an environmental pollutant of increasing concern. Although it is generally accepted that bacteria oxidize ethylene glycol to use it as growth substrate, the enzymes involved in this process are not well understood. Here we show that the soil bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans is able to assimilate ethylene glycol efficiently via NAD-dependent alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases. Using comparative proteome analysis, we identify a previously unknown gene cluster that is strongly expressed in the presence of ethylene glycol. We report the kinetic parameters and cryo-EM structures of EtgB and EtgA, the key enzymes encoded by this etg gene cluster. These novel biocatalysts pave the way for more efficient biotechnological conversion of ethylene glycol. We furthermore show that the transcriptional activator EtgR controls expression of the etg gene cluster. Directed evolution of P. denitrificans on ethylene glycol results in faster growing strains, which is enabled by increased activities of EtgB and EtgA. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that the etg gene cluster and variants thereof are widely distributed among Proteobacteria, suggesting a previously underappreciated role of NAD-dependent dehydrogenases in microbial ethylene glycol assimilation.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Memory consolidation occurs offline and often involves transfer of memories from one brain site to another. For many motor memories, consolidation is thought to involve early learning in cerebellar cortex that is subsequently transferred to the cerebellar nuclei. Here we report that in mice, engaging in locomotor activity during training in a classical conditioning task shifts the critical time window for memory consolidation, from just after training sessions, to between trials, within sessions. This temporal shift requires natural patterns of cerebellar granule cell activity during intertrial intervals and is accompanied by earlier involvement of the downstream cerebellar nucleus. These results reveal that the critical time window for cerebellar memory consolidation can be surprisingly brief, on a timescale from seconds to minutes, and that it is dynamically regulated by behavioral state.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Our method (1) lets users select any loss metric (i.e. false discovery rate) and assigns reliable functional probabilities for annotating genes of unknown function; (2) achieves state-of-the-art performance in enzyme classification without training new models; and (3) robustly and rapidly pre-filters proteins for computationally intensive structural alignment algorithms.

Here, we perform a comprehensive characterization of the mechanisms underlying the UV resistance of S17 (UV-resistome/UVres) through comparative genomics within the Exiguobacterium genus. Additionally, we describe the morphological and ultrastructural changes in the strain when exposed to different levels of UV.

UVres in Exiguobacterium species ranges from 112 to 132 genes, with a median of 117. While we anticipated Exiguobacterium sp. S17 to lead the non-HAAL UVres, it ranked eleventh with 113 genes. This larger UVres in Exiguobacterium spp. aligns with their known adaptation to extreme environments. Morphological and ultrastructural analyses using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) demonstrated significant changes in response to UV exposure in S17 cells. We observed the formation of nanotubes (NTs), a novel finding in Exiguobacterium spp., which increased with higher UV-B doses. These NTs, confirmed to be membranous structures through sensitivity studies and SEM/TEM imaging, suggest a role in cellular communication and environmental sensing. Genomic evidence supports the presence of essential NT biogenesis genes in S17, further elucidating its adaptive capabilities.

Our study highlights the complex interplay of genetic and phenotypic adaptations enabling Exiguobacterium sp. S17 to thrive in extreme UV environments. The novel discovery of NTs under UV stress presents a new avenue for understanding bacterial survival strategies in harsh conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Schizophrenia affects multiple networks across different brain regions. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is the region that connects the limbic system to cognitive areas such as the prefrontal cortex and represents a pivotal region for the etiology of schizophrenia; however, the molecular pathology, considering its cellular and anatomical complexity, is not well understood. Here, we performed an integrative analysis of spatial and single-nucleus transcriptomics of the postmortem ACC of people with schizophrenia, together with a thorough histological analysis. The data revealed major transcriptomics signatures altered in schizophrenia, pointing at the dysregulation of glial cells, primarily in astrocytes. We further discovered a decrease in the cellular density and abundance of processes of interlaminar astrocytes, a subpopulation of astrocytes specific to primates that localize in the layer 1 and influence the superficial cortical microenvironment across layer 1 and layers 2/3 of the cortex.

These subskills recruit brain structures, which begin to develop long before the skill manifests and exhibit rapid development during infancy. However, how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development in these structures supports long-term acquisition of literacy subskills and subsequent reading is unclear. Children underwent structural and diffusion MRI scanning at multiple timepoints between infancy and second grade and were tested for literacy subskills in preschool and decoding and word reading in early elementary school. We developed and implemented a reproducible pipeline to generate longitudinal trajectories of early brain development to examine associations between these trajectories and literacy (sub)skills. Furthermore, we examined whether familial risk of reading difficulty and a childs home literacy environment, two common literacy-related covariates, influenced those trajectories. Results showed that individual differences in curve features (e.g., intercepts and slopes) for longitudinal trajectories of volumetric, surface-based, and white matter organization measures in left-hemispheric reading-related regions and tracts were linked directly to phonological processing and indirectly to second-grade decoding and word reading skills via phonological processing. Altogether, these findings suggest that the brain bases of phonological processing, previously identified as the strongest behavioral predictor of reading and decoding skills, may already begin to develop early in infancy but undergo further refinement between birth and preschool.

Despite their significance, the factors regulating their spatial distribution on the PM remain elusive. Inspired by observations in cardiomyocytes, where ER-PM contact sites concentrate on tubular PM invaginations known as transverse tubules (T-tubules), we hypothesize that the PM curvature plays a role in ER-PM contact formation. Through precise control of PM invaginations, we show that PM curvatures locally induce the formation of ER-PM contacts in cardiomyocytes. Intriguingly, the junctophilin family of ER-PM tethering proteins, specifically expressed in excitable cells, is the key player in this process, while the ubiquitously expressed extended synaptotagmin 2 does not show a preference for PM curvature. At the mechanistic level, we find that the low complexity region (LCR) and the MORN motifs of junctophilins can independently bind to the PM, but both the LCR and MORN motifs are required for targeting PM curvatures. By examining the junctophilin interactome, we identify a family of curvature-sensing proteins, Eps15-homology domain containing proteins (EHDs), that interact with the MORN_LCR motifs and facilitate junctophilins preferential tethering to curved PM. These findings highlight the pivotal role of PM curvature in the formation of ER-PM contacts in cardiomyocytes and unveil a novel mechanism for the spatial regulation of ER-PM contacts through PM curvature modulation.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

However, the technology is limited by inherent biases and its inability to capture full-length transcripts. Long-read RNAseq overcomes these issues by providing reads that can span multiple exons, resolve complex repetitive regions and the capability to cover entire transcripts. Unfortunately, this technology is still prone to higher error rates. Noncoding RNA transcripts are highly specific to different cell types and tissues and remain underrepresented in current reference annotations. This problem is exacerbated by the dismissal of sequenced reads that align to genomic regions that do not contain annotated transcripts, resulting in approximately half of the expressed transcripts being overlooked in transcriptional studies.

ResultsWe have developed a pipeline, named HyDRA (Hybrid de novo RNA assembly), which combines the precision of short reads with the structural resolution of long reads, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of custom transcriptome assemblies. Deep, short- and long-read RNAseq data derived from ovarian and fallopian tube samples were used to develop, validate and assess the efficacy of HyDRA. We identified more than 50,000 high-confidence long noncoding RNAs, most of which have not been previously detected using traditional methods.

ConclusionsHyDRAs assembly performed more than 40% better than a similar assembly obtained with the top-ranked stand-alone de novo transcriptome short-read-only assembly tool and over 30% better than one obtained with the best-in-class multistep short-read-only approach. Although long-read sequencing is rapidly advancing, the vast availability of short-read RNAseq data will ensure that hybrid approaches like the one implemented in HyDRA continue to be relevant, allowing the discovery of high-confidence transcripts within specific cell types and tissues. As the practice of performing hybrid de novo transcriptome assemblies becomes commonplace, HyDRA will advance the annotation of coding and noncoding transcripts and expand our knowledge of the noncoding genome.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Here we present the Asian Immune Diversity Atlas (AIDA), a multi-national single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) healthy reference atlas of human immune cells. AIDA comprises 1,265,624 circulating immune cells from 619 healthy donors and 6 controls, spanning 7 population groups across 5 countries. AIDA is one of the largest healthy blood datasets in terms of number of cells, and also the most diverse in terms of number of population groups. Though population groups are frequently compared at the continental level, we identified a pervasive impact of sub-continental diversity on cellular and molecular properties of immune cells. These included cell populations and genes implicated in disease risk and pathogenesis as well as those relevant for diagnostics. We detected single-cell signatures of human diversity not apparent at the level of cell types, as well as modulation of the effects of age and sex by self-reported ethnicity. We discovered functional genetic variants influencing cell type-specific gene expression, including context-dependent effects, which were under-represented in analyses of non-Asian population groups, and which helped contextualise disease-associated variants. We validated our findings using multiple independent datasets and cohorts. AIDA provides fundamental insights into the relationships of human diversity with immune cell phenotypes, enables analyses of multi-ancestry disease datasets, and facilitates the development of precision medicine efforts in Asia and beyond.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Centromere fragility can drive tumorigenesis, but protective mechanisms preventing fragility are still not fully understood. The PBAF chromatin remodelling complex is frequently misregulated in cancer, but its role in cancer is still not fully characterized. Here, we identify PBAF as a protector of centromere and pericentromere structure with profound consequences for genome stability. A conserved feature of isogenic cell lines lacking PBRM1, a subunit of PBAF, is compromised centromere and pericentromere integrity. PBAF is present at these regions, and the binding pattern changes when PBRM1 is absent. PBRM1 loss creates a dependence on the spindle assembly checkpoint, which represents a therapeutic vulnerability. Importantly, we find that even in the absence of any perturbations, PBRM1 loss leads to centromere fragility, thus identifying a new player in centromere protection.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

To address the poor stability and inherent limitations of RNA agents, nanoparticle (NP) platforms have been developed to deliver functional mRNA or siRNA inside the cells. Recent studies have focused on either siRNA to knock down proteins causing drug resistance or mRNA technology to introduce tumor suppressors. However, complex diseases like cancer need multi-targeted approaches to selectively target multiple gene expressions/proteins. In this proof-of-concept study, we developed co-delivery nanoparticles containing Luc-mRNA and siRNA-GFP as model RNA agents ((M+S)-NPs) and assessed their effects in vitro and in vivo. Our studies show that NPs can effectively deliver both functional mRNA and siRNA together, simultaneously impacting the expression of two genes/proteins in vitro. Additionally, after in vivo administration, co-delivery NPs successfully knocked down GFP while introducing luciferase in a TNBC mouse model, indicating our NPs have the potential to develop RNA-based anticancer therapeutics. These studies pave the way to develop RNA-based, multitargeted, multi-delivery approaches for complex diseases like cancer.

The monoterpene indole alkaloids tabersonine and pseudo-tabersonine, found in the medicinal plant Tabernanthe iboga, are extensively modified by oxidative reactions. Here we developed a streamlined screening strategy to screen the activity of T. iboga CYP450s in Nicotiana benthamiana. Using multigene constructs encoding the biosynthesis of tabersonine and pseudo-tabersonine scaffolds, we set out to uncover the CYP450s responsible for oxidative transformations of these scaffolds. Our approach identified two T. iboga cytochrome P450 enzymes: pachysiphine synthase (PS) and 16-hydroxy-tabersonine synthase (T16H). These enzymes catalyze an epoxidation and site-specific hydroxylation of tabersonine to produce pachysiphine and 16-OH-tabersonine, respectively. We further demonstrated that these genes produced the expected products when expressed in Catharanthus roseus flowers. This work provides new insights into the biosynthetic pathways of MIAs and underscores the utility of N. benthamiana and C. roseus as platforms for the functional characterization of plant enzymes.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

These multicellular communities contain subpopulations of cells that display vast metabolic and transcriptional diversity along with high recalcitrance to antibiotics and host immune defenses. Investigating the complex heterogeneity within biofilm has been hindered by the lack of a sensitive and high-throughput method to assess stochastic transcriptional activity and regulation between bacterial subpopulations, which requires single-cell resolution. We have developed an optimized bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing method, BaSSSh-seq, to study Staphylococcus aureus diversity during biofilm growth and transcriptional adaptations following immune cell exposure. We validated the ability of BaSSSh-seq to capture extensive transcriptional heterogeneity during biofilm compared to planktonic growth. Application of new computational tools revealed transcriptional regulatory networks across the heterogeneous biofilm subpopulations and identification of gene sets that were associated with a trajectory from planktonic to biofilm growth. BaSSSh-seq also detected alterations in biofilm metabolism, stress response, and virulence that were tailored to distinct immune cell populations. This work provides an innovative platform to explore biofilm dynamics at single-cell resolution, unlocking the potential for identifying biofilm adaptations to environmental signals and immune pressure.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Epigenetic clocks attempt to quantify differential aging between individuals, but they typically summarize aging as a single measure, ignoring within-person heterogeneity. Our aim was to develop novel systems-based methylation clocks that, when assessed in blood, capture aging in distinct physiological systems. We combined supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to link DNA methylation, system-specific clinical chemistry and functional measures, and mortality risk. This yielded a panel of 11 system-specific scores- Heart, Lung, Kidney, Liver, Brain, Immune, Inflammatory, Blood, Musculoskeletal, Hormone, and Metabolic. Each system score predicted a wide variety of outcomes, aging phenotypes, and conditions specific to the respective system. We also combined the system scores into a composite Systems Age clock that is predictive of aging across physiological systems in an unbiased manner. Finally, we showed that the system scores clustered individuals into unique aging subtypes that had different patterns of age-related disease and decline. Overall, our biological systems based epigenetic framework captures aging in multiple physiological systems using a single blood draw and assay and may inform the development of more personalized clinical approaches for improving age-related quality of life.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Our study aims to assess the association between COVID-19 infections and subsequent kidney diseases, using influenza as a positive control and incorporating a negative control to establish clearer associations.

MethodsA large retrospective cohort study with strata matching was conducted using the MarketScan database with records from Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. We used the international classification of 10th revision (ICD-10) codes to identify individuals and build three cohorts, (1) COVID-19 group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of COVID-19; (2) Influenza but no COVID-19 (positive control) group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of Influenza; and (3) no COVID-19 / Influenza (negative control) group, with randomly assigned index dates between Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. The main outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To evaluate the association between COVID-19 and the new onset of kidney diseases relative to both control groups, we employed multivariable stratified Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.

ResultsThe study included 939,241 individuals with COVID-19, 1,878,482 individuals in the negative control group, and 199,071 individuals with influenza. After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and medication histories, COVID-19 was significantly associated with increased risks of AKI (adjusted hazards ratio, aHR: 2.74, 2.61-2.87), CKD (aHR: 1.38, 1.32-1.45), and ESRD (aHR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.67-3.88), while influenza was associated with a modestly increased risk of AKI (aHR: 1.24, 1.11-1.38) and had no impact on CKD (aHR: 1.03, 0.92-1.14), and ESRD (aHR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.55-1.29). Time-specific analyses indicated that while the HR for AKI declined from 0-180 days to 0-540 days, the HR for CKD and ESRD remained stable, with COVID-19s risk surpassing influenzas risk throughout follow-up. Exploratory analysis also found significant impacts of COVID-19 on glomerular diseases (aHR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50).

ConclusionIn this large real-world study, COVID-19 infections were associated with a 2.3-fold risk of developing AKI, a 1.4-fold risk of CKD, and a 4.7-fold risk of ESRD compared to influenza. Greater attention needs to be paid to kidney diseases in individuals after contracting COVID-19 to prevent future adverse health outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1720130973126

We divided the patients into three strata: patients with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD), patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) during the acute phase (within 28 days) of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and patients without pre-existing CKD or AKI. We defined a set of adverse kidney outcomes for each stratum and examined the outcomes within the post-acute and chronic phases after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In each stratum, compared with the non-infected group, patients with COVID-19 had a higher risk of adverse kidney outcomes. For patients without pre-existing CKD, there were increased risks of CKD stage 2+ (HR 1.20; 95% CI: 1.13-1.28) and CKD stage 3+ (HR 1.35; 95% CI: 1.15-1.59) during the post-acute phase (28 days to 365 days) after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Within the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, children and adolescents with pre-existing CKD and those who experienced AKI were at increased risk of progression to a composite outcome defined by at least 50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m2, End Stage Kidney Disease diagnosis, dialysis, or transplant.

Lay abstractThis study examined the impact of COVID-19 on kidney health in children and adolescents under 21 years old in the United States. Using data from the RECOVER program, we analyzed the health records of 1,864,637 young individuals from 19 hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and May 2023. The study focused on three groups: those with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD), those who experienced acute kidney injury (AKI) during the initial COVID-19 infection, and those without any prior kidney issues. The results showed that children and adolescents who had COVID-19 were at a higher risk of developing serious kidney problems later on, even if they had no previous kidney conditions. This research highlights the long-term effects of COVID-19 on kidney health in young people and underscores the importance of monitoring kidney function in pediatric COVID-19 patients.","NA","medrxiv",1720130973126

DNA repair is especially understudied in nondividing cells like neurons, which must withstand decades of DNA damage without replicating. This lack of knowledge limits the efficiency and precision of genome editing in clinically relevant cells. To address this, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neurons to examine how postmitotic human neurons repair Cas9-induced DNA damage. We discovered that neurons can take weeks to fully resolve this damage, compared to just days in isogenic iPSCs. Furthermore, Cas9-treated neurons upregulated unexpected DNA repair genes, including factors canonically associated with replication. Manipulating this response with chemical or genetic perturbations allowed us to direct neuronal repair toward desired editing outcomes. By studying DNA repair in postmitotic human cells, we uncovered unforeseen challenges and opportunities for precise therapeutic editing.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Classic ecological theory holds that these systems develop following a sequenced orderly process that generally proceeds from fast-growing to slow-growing taxa and depends on life-history trade-offs. However, it is also possible that this developmental order is simply the path with the least environmental resistance for survival of the component species and hence favored by probability alone. Here, we use theory and data to show that the order from fast-to slow-growing taxa is the most likely developmental path for diverse systems when local taxon interactions self-organize to minimize environmental resistance. First, we demonstrate theoretically that a sequenced development is more likely than a simultaneous one, at least until the number of iterations becomes so large as to be ecologically implausible. We then show that greater diversity of taxa and life histories improves the likelihood of a sequenced order from fast-to slow-growing taxa. Using data from bacterial and metazoan systems, we present empirical evidence that the developmental order of ecological systems moves along the paths of least environmental resistance. The capacity of simple principles to explain the trend in the developmental order of diverse ecological systems paves the way to an enhanced understanding of the collective features characterizing the diversity of life.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Here, we test this hypothesis by recording from individual neurons in the human hippocampus during a reading task. We found that cells that are selective to a particular noun are later reactivated by pronouns that refer to the cells preferred noun.

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

We determined the cryo-EM structure of one hit, SHPRH, with the nucleosome at 2.8 [A]. The structure confirms the predicted acidic patch interaction, reveals that the SHPRH ATPase engages a different nucleosomal DNA location than other SF2-type ATPases, and clarifies the roles of SHPRHs domains in nucleosome recognition.

The striped variety has attracted particular attention for its intricate and unpredictable patterns. A good understanding of the mechanism that drives the striped pattern formation of the broken tulips has been missing since the 17th century. It is known since 1928 that these patterned tulips suffer from a viral infection by the tulip breaking virus. Here, we present a mathematical model to understand how a virus infection of the petals can lead to stripes, thereby solving a 350 year old mystery. The model, which describes the viral inhibition of pigment expression (anthocyanins) and their interaction with viral reproduction, incorporates a pattern formation mechanism identified as an activator-substrate mechanism, similar to the well-known Turing instability, working together with a Wolperts positional information mechanism. The model is solved on a growing tulip petal shaped domain, whereby we introduce a new method to describe the tulip petal growth explicitly. This work contributes to the theory of pattern formation of reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains applied to the fields of virology and botany.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

However, genome engineering in bacteria is still a complex, multi-step process requiring a donor DNA template for homology-directed repair of DSBs. Prime editing circumvents this need as the repair template is provided within the prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA). Here, we developed make-or-break Prime Editing (mbPE) that allows for precise and effective genetic engineering in the opportunistic human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. In contrast to traditional prime editing in which a nicking Cas9 is employed, mbPE harnesses wild type Cas9 in combination with a pegRNA that destroys the seed region or protospacer adjacent motif. Since most bacteria poorly perform template-independent end joining, correctly genome-edited clones are selectively enriched during mbPE. We show that mbPE can be used to introduce point mutations, deletions and targeted insertions, including protein tags such as a split luciferase, at selection efficiencies of over 93%. mbPE enables sequential genome editing, is scalable, and can be used to generate pools of mutants in a high-throughput manner. The mbPE system and pegRNA design guidelines described here will ameliorate future bacterial genome editing endeavors.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Although a few natural products have been shown to protect bacteria from phage infection, the prevalence and diversity of chemical anti-phage defense remain largely unexplored. Here, we uncover a novel family of over 2000 lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters from Actinobacteria that participate in anti-phage defense, which we named lanthiphages. Lanthiphages colocalize with other anti-phage systems in defense islands. We demonstrate that native lanthiphage expression protects the model strain Streptomyces coelicolor against diverse phages. Heterologous expression of four additional lanthiphage pathways shows that the anti-phage function is conserved across this family of biosynthetic gene clusters. Finally, we demonstrate that lanthiphage expression leads to the production of a novel compound and alters phage transcription. Our findings highlight that biosynthetic gene clusters with anti-phage functions can be successfully identified through genomic analysis. This work paves the way for the systematic mining of anti-phage natural products, which could constitute a novel reservoir of antiviral drugs.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Most of these proteins are synthesized with N-terminal presequences which serve as mitochondrial targeting signals. Presequences consistently form amphipathic helices, but they considerably differ in respect to their primary structure and length. Here we show that presequences can be classified into seven different groups based on their specific features. Using a test set of different presequences, we observed that group A presequences endow precursor proteins with improved in vitro import characteristics. We developed IQ-Compete (for Import and de-Quenching Competition assay), a novel assay based on fluorescence de-quenching, to monitor the import efficiencies of mitochondrial precursors in vivo. With this assay, we confirmed the increased import competence of group A presequences. Using mass spectrometry, we found that the presequence of the group A protein Oxa1 specifically recruits the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) containing protein TOMM34 to the cytosolic precursor protein. TOMM34 apparently serves as a presequence-specific targeting factor which increases the import efficiency of a specific subset of mitochondrial precursor proteins. Our results suggest that presequences contain a protein-specific priority code that encrypts the targeting mechanism of individual mitochondrial precursor proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

We experimentally mapped distinct cortex sub-populations to different cortex layers across species. We found distinct cell-type-specific transcriptomic responses between species and treatments. Lineage-specific losses of stress responses were less prevalent but evolutionarily more favored than gains. In C. sativa, sub-genomes contributed equally to stress responses and homeologs with divergent stress responses typically did not exhibit high coding sequence or expression divergence.

Here, we present the identification and genomic characterization of a proposed third order of viruses within the class Pokkesviricetes that currently consists of poxviruses and asfuviruses8. Members of this newly identified order we provisionally named ""Egovirales"" are commonly in the digestive system of vertebrates worldwide and are abundant in >10% of livestock animals, >2% of humans, and wild animals. Egoviruses have linear genomes up to 467 kbp in length and likely form multilayered icosahedral capsids, similar to those of asfuviruses. However, phylogenetic analysis of conserved viral genes indicates that egoviruses are the sister group of poxviruses, with implications for capsid evolution. The diversity of egoviruses already far exceeds that of all known poxviruses and animal-associated asfuviruses. Phylogenetic analyses and patterns of virus distribution across vertebrates suggest that egoviruses can be either specialists or generalists associated with a single or multiple vertebrate species, respectively. Notably, one egovirus clade is human-specific, evolutionarily constrained, and spread across continents, demonstrating a long-term association between Egovirales and the human population on the global scale.

Examples are reiki, aromatherapy, and reflexology. Salaried practitioners are employed to deliver these therapies, which are provided as palliative care, although they lack evidence of effectiveness. Such practices seem to conflict with efforts to make health care evidence based.

AimTo estimate the extent of certain pseudoscientific practices in NHS Trusts, and to evaluate the rationale for such provision.

DesignRelevant documents were requested from NHS Trusts under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). Main outcome measures were: number of trusts offering pseudoscientific practices in cancer departments, time to full FOIA response, presence and content of practice governance documents, and presence and quality of evidence for practices.

Setting/ParticipantsCancer care departments in NHS hospitals in England. No patient participants were involved in the survey.

Results13.6% of eligible NHS trusts were offering pseudoscientific clinical practices. No trust provided a valid business case, or any robust evidence for the practices. The governance documents included claims about chakras, meridians, and invisible ""energy"". Ten trusts required that informed consent be obtained from patients. This could not have been obtained because information given was misleading.

ConclusionsPseudoscientific practices are embedded in the NHS in England, and governance documents show poor understanding of clinical evidence.","NA","medrxiv",1720130973126

This inferential task is notoriously challenging. The social networks of interest are generally not observed, but must be approximated from behavioural samples. Moreover, these data are highly dependent: the observed network edges correlate with one another, due to biological and sampling processes. Failing to account for the resulting uncertainty and biases can lead to dysfunctional statistical procedures, and thus to incorrect results. Here, we argue that these problems should be understood-- and addressed--as problems of causal inference. For this purpose, we introduce a Bayesian causal modelling framework that explicitly defines the links between the target interaction network, its causes, and the data. We illustrate the mechanics of our framework with simulation studies and an empirical example. First, we encode causal effects of individual-, dyad-, and group-level features on social interactions using Directed Acyclic Graphs and Structural Causal Models. These quantities are the objects of inquiry, our estimands. Second, we develop estimators for these effects-- namely, Bayesian multilevel extensions of the Social Relations Model. Third, we recover the structural parameters of interest, map statistical estimates to the underlying causal structures, and compute causal estimates from the joint posterior distribution. Throughout the manuscript, we develop models layer by layer, thereby illustrating an iterative workflow for causal inference in social networks. We conclude by summarising this workflow as a set of seven steps, and provide practical recommendations.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

However, the translational activity of single 80S ribosomes (monosomes) on mRNA is less well understood, even though these 80S monosomes represent the dominant ribosomal complexes in vivo. Here, we used cryo-EM to determine the translational activity of 80S monosomes across different tissues in Drosophila melanogaster. We discovered that while head and embryo 80S monosomes are highly translationally active, testis and ovary 80S monosomes are translationally inactive. RNA-Seq analysis of head monosome- and polysome-translated mRNAs, revealed that head 80S monosomes preferentially translate mRNAs with TOP motifs, short 5-UTRs, short ORFs and are enriched for uORFs. Overall, these findings highlight that regulation of translation initiation, and that protein synthesis is mostly performed by monosomes in head and embryo, whilst polysomes are the main source of protein production in testis and ovary.

Actinoporins are a family of -pore-forming proteins that bind specifically to sphingomyelin-containing lipid membranes, where they oligomerize and form transmembrane pores. The numerous contacts they form with the lipid membrane make them an exemplary object for studying the different roles that lipids play in the structure and function of membrane proteins. Through a comprehensive cryo-electron microscopic analysis of a pore formed by an actinoporin Fav from the coral Orbicella faveolata, we show that the octameric pore interacts with 112 lipids in the upper leaflet of the membrane. The structures of Fav pores formed on different lipid membranes reveal the different roles of lipids and demonstrate that the actinoporin surface is perfectly suited for binding multiple receptor sphingomyelin molecules. When cholesterol is present in the membrane, it forms nanodomains associated with the pore, leading to a tighter arrangement of lipids, which in turn increases the stability of the pores. Atomistic simulations support the structural data, show that the protein-bound lipids are not mobile, and reveal additional effects of the pore on the lipid membrane. Overall, these data reveal a complex network of protein-lipid and lipid-lipid interactions, and an underrated role of lipids in the structure and function of transmembrane protein complexes.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Here, we introduce the R package to the RTF approach, which has originally been implemented within the MATLAB-based Data2Dynamics modelling framework. The package enables modelling of time and dose dependencies and includes model reduction to minimize overfitting. It can be applied not only to experimental data but also to trajectories of ODE models, to characterize the dynamics or to identify major targets of experimental perturbations in the low-dimensional representations calculated by the package.

However, the genetic architecture of these AI endophenotypes remains largely unexplored in the context of human multi-organ system diseases. Using publicly available GWAS summary statistics from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we comprehensively depicted the genetic architecture of 2024 multi-organ AI endophenotypes (MAEs). Two AI- and imaging-derived subtypes1 showed lower polygenicity and weaker negative selection effects than schizophrenia disease diagnoses2, supporting the endophenotype hypothesis3. Genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization results demonstrate both within-organ connections and cross-organ talk. Bi-directional causal relationships were established between chronic human diseases and MAEs across multiple organ systems, including Alzheimers disease for the brain, diabetes for the metabolic system, asthma for the pulmonary system, and hypertension for the cardiovascular system. Finally, we derived the polygenic risk scores of the 2024 MAEs. Our findings underscore the promise of the MAEs as new instruments to ameliorate overall human health. All results are encapsulated into the MUTATE genetic atlas and are publicly available at https://labs-laboratory.com/mutate.

As such its measurement is crucial for understanding many aspects of animal behaviour, ecology and evolution, along with many more applications in fields ranging from optical physics, agriculture/plant sciences, human psychophysics, food science, architecture and materials sciences. The escalating threat of artificial light at night (ALAN) presents unique challenges for measuring the visual impact of light pollution, requiring measurement at low light levels across the human-visible and ultraviolet ranges, across all viewing angles, and often with high within-scene contrast.

Here I present a hyperspectral open-source imaging system (HOSI), an innovative and low-cost solution for collecting full-field hyperspectral data. The system uses a Hamamatsu C12880MA micro spectrometer to take single-point measurements, together with a motorised gimbal for spatial control. The hardware uses off-the-shelf components and 3D printed parts, costing around {pound}350 in total. The system can run directly from a computer or smartphone with a graphical user interface, making it highly portable and user-friendly.

The HOSI system can take panoramic hyperspectral images that meet the difficult requirements of ALAN research, sensitive to low light around 0.001 cd.m-2, across 320-880nm range with spectral resolution of [~]9nm (FWHM) and spatial resolution of [~]0.2 degrees. The independent exposure of each pixel also allows for an extremely wide dynamic range that can encompass typical natural and artificially illuminated scenes, with sample night-time scans achieving peak-to-peak dynamic ranges of >50,000:1.

This systems adaptability, cost-effectiveness, and open-source nature position it as a valuable tool for researchers investigating the complex relationships between light, environment, behaviour, ecology, and biodiversity, with further potential uses in many other fields.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

They speak a Niger-Congo language called Fulfulde or Pulaar and live in scattered locations across the Sahel/Savannah Belt, from the Atlantic Ocean to Lake Chad. According to historical records, their ancestors spread from Futa Toro in the Middle Senegal Valley to Futa-Jallon in Guinea, and then eastward into the Sahel belt over the past 1500 years. However, the earlier history of this traditionally pastoral population has not been well studied. To uncover the genetic structure and ancestry of this widespread population, we gathered genome-wide genotype data from 460 individuals across 18 local Fulani populations, along with comparative data from both modern and ancient worldwide populations. This represents the most geographically wide-scaled genome-wide study of the Fulani to date. We revealed a genetic component closely associated with all local Fulani populations, suggesting a shared ancestral component possibly linked to the beginning of African pastoralism in the Green Sahara. Comparison to ancient DNA results also identified the presence of an ancient Iberomaurusian associated component across all Fulani groups, providing novel insights into their deep genetic history. Additionally, our genetic data indicate a later Fulani expansion from the western to the eastern Sahel, characterized by a clinal pattern and admixture with several other African populations north of the equator.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Herein, we generated recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSVs) bearing spikes from divergent bat CoVs to investigate their cell entry mechanisms. Unexpectedly, the successful recovery of rVSVs bearing the spike from SHC014, a SARS-like bat CoV, was associated with the acquisition of a novel substitution in the S2 fusion peptide-proximal region (FPPR). This substitution enhanced viral entry in both VSV and coronavirus contexts by increasing the availability of the spike receptor-binding domain to recognize its cellular receptor, ACE2. A second substitution in the spike N-terminal domain, uncovered through forward-genetic selection, interacted epistatically with the FPPR substitution to synergistically enhance spike:ACE2 interaction and viral entry. Our findings identify genetic pathways for adaptation by bat CoVs during spillover and host-to-host transmission, fitness trade-offs inherent to these pathways, and potential Achilles heels that could be targeted with countermeasures.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024.

T2D is a multifaceted disease, its treatment requires a holistic approach, beyond single target medications with high efficacy. There is a dire need to explore and invent new and effective therapeutic modalities for T2D.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

In conclusion, our results suggest that consumption of combined CBD and probiotics could be used as a natural, practical, affordable, and safe alternative and complementary therapeutic modality to treat T2D.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973126

Cows milk is typically pasteurised to render it safe for human consumption, but the effectiveness of pasteurisation on influenza viruses in milk was uncertain. To assess this, we evaluated heat inactivation in milk for a panel of different influenza viruses. This included human and avian influenza A viruses (IAVs), an influenza D virus that naturally infects cattle, and recombinant IAVs carrying contemporary avian or bovine H5N1 glycoproteins. At pasteurisation temperatures, viral infectivity was rapidly lost and became undetectable before the times recommended for pasteurisation. We then showed that an H5N1 HPAIV in milk was effectively inactivated by a comparable treatment, even though its genetic material remained detectable. We conclude that industry standard pasteurisation conditions should effectively inactivate H5N1 HPAIV in cows milk, but that unpasteurised milk could carry infectious influenza viruses.","NA","medrxiv",1720130973127

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses.

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1720130973127

However, to be included in national NCS inventories, governments must first quantify the kelp-derived carbon stocks and fluxes leading to carbon sequestration. Here, we present a blueprint for assessing the national carbon sequestration capacity of kelp forests in which data synthesis and Bayesian hierarchical modelling enable estimates of kelp forest carbon production, storage, and export capacity from limited data. Applying this blueprint to Canadas extensive coastline, we find kelp forests store an estimated 1.4 Tg C in short-term biomass and produce 3.1 Tg C yr-1 with modest carbon fluxes to the deep ocean. Arctic kelps had the highest carbon stocks and production capacity, while Pacific kelps had greater carbon fluxes overall due to their higher productivity and export rates. Our transparent, reproducible blueprint represents an important step towards accurate carbon accounting for kelp forests.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973127

Human genetic studies established a causal role for protein assembly in neurodegeneration2. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown, which is limiting progress in developing clinical tools for these diseases. Recent advances in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled the structures of the protein filaments to be determined from patient brains1. All diseases studied to date have been characterised by the self-assembly of a single intracellular protein in homomeric amyloid filaments, including that of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) Types A and B3,4. Here, we used cryo-EM to determine filament structures from the brains of individuals with FTLD-TDP Type C, one of the most common forms of sporadic FTLD-TDP. Unexpectedly, the structures revealed that a second protein, annexin A11 (ANXA11), co-assembles with TDP-43 in heteromeric amyloid filaments. The ordered filament fold is formed by TDP-43 residues G282/284-N345 and ANXA11 residues L39-L74 from their respective low-complexity domains (LCDs). Regions of TDP-43 and ANXA11 previously implicated in protein-protein interactions form an extensive hydrophobic interface at the centre of the filament fold. Immunoblots of the filaments revealed that the majority of ANXA11 exists as a [~]22 kDa N-terminal fragment (NTF) lacking the annexin core domain. Immunohistochemistry of brain sections confirmed the co-localisation of ANXA11 and TDP-43 in inclusions, redefining the histopathology of FTLD-TDP Type C. This work establishes a central role for ANXA11 in FTLD-TDP Type C. The unprecedented formation of heteromeric amyloid filaments in human brain revises our understanding of amyloid assembly and may be of significance for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973127

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

Here, we report the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle herds across several states in the U.S. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory distress, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state. These results demonstrate the transmission of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus at a non-traditional interface and to a new and highly relevant livestock species, underscoring the ability of the virus to cross species barriers.","NA","biorxiv",1720130973127

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.
