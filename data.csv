In this study, we used MetaGPA--a method linking genotype to phenotype in metagenomic data--to identify deoxycytidine deaminases, a protein family highly associated with cytosine modifications in metaviromes. Unexpectedly, a subset of these deaminases exhibited a preference for 5-methylcytosine (5mC) over cytosine (C) in both mononucleotide and single-stranded DNA substrates. In a methylome sequencing workflow, preferential deamination of 5mC by these enzymes enabled direct conversion of methylated cytosine while completely eliminating any background deamination of unmodified cytosine. This direct conversion allows for precise identification of methylated sites at single-base resolution with unmatched sensitivity enabling broad applications for the simultaneous sequencing of genome and methylome.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

However, no regulatoryapproved blood tests are available for the early detection of lung cancer. We aimed to improve the classification of pulmonary nodules to identify malignant ones in a high prevalence patient group. Methods: A study involving 806 participants with undiagnosed nodules larger than 5 mm, identified via CT imaging, focused on assessing nucleosome levels and histone modifications in circulating blood. Nodules were classified as malignant or benign. A logistic regression analysis was performed. For model development, the data were randomly divided into training (n = 483) and validation (n = 121) datasets. The model's performance was then evaluated using a separate testing dataset (n = 202). Results: Among patients, 755 (93.7%) had a tissue diagnosis. The overall malignancy rate in the cohort was 80.4%. For all datasets, the AUCs were as follows: training, 0.74; validation, 0.86; and test, 0.79 (accuracy range: 0.80 to 0.88). Sensitivity showed consistent results across all datasets (0.91, 0.95, and 0.93, respectively), whereas specificity ranged from 0.37 to 0.64. For smaller nodules (5 to 10 mm), the model recorded accuracy values of 0.76, 0.88, and 0.85. Sensitivity values of 0.91, 1.00, and 0.94 further highlight the robust diagnostic capability of the model. The performance of the model across the RADS categories was evaluated, and it demonstrated consistent accuracy. Conclusion: Our EB panel detected non small cell lung cancer early in a high risk patient group with high sensitivity and accuracy. The EB model was particularly effective in identifying high risk lung nodules, including small, part solid, and non solid nodules, and provided further evidence for external validation.","NA","medrxiv",1733868603698

The challenge remains to efficiently apply precision breeding methods to plant gene regulation. Endogenous gene regulatory sequences are subject to complex transcriptional control, a bottleneck in altering gene expression patterns in a predictable way. Here we present the CRE.AI.TIVE platform, enabling upregulation of plant gene activity without a priori knowledge of individual cis-regulatory elements or their specific location. A predictive machine learning model underpinning the platform has been trained on a wide range of tissue specific transcriptomic and epigenomic coverage datasets from DNA sequence of 12 plant species, showing competitive performance on RNA-seq coverage prediction across all species. Our platform further combines in silico DNA sequence mutagenesis and a protoplast-based massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA). We demonstrate platform functionality by mutagenesis of a proximal promoter of the tomato gene SlbHLH96 which yields predictions of variant gene activity in silico. 2,000 sequence candidates with varying predicted gene expression strength were validated with MPRA in plant protoplasts, identifying variants with significantly upregulated gene activity. A portion of functional sequence variants were further individually evaluated with a fluorescence reporter assay and were observed to contain a new order of known cis-regulatory elements. The CRE.AI.TIVE platform offers a first-of-its-kind scalable method of gene upregulation in plants with native DNA sequences without the need for CRE cataloguing and rational promoter design.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

However, the resulting data is highly sparse with most data entries being zeros. As such, currently available computational methods for scATAC-seq feature a range of transformation procedures to extract meaningful information from the sparse data. Most notably, these transformations can be categorized into: 1) feature aggregation with known biological associations, 2) pseudo-bulking cells of similar biology, and 3) binarisation of count data. These strategies beg the question of whether or not scATAC-seq data actually has usable single-cell and single-region information as intended from the assay. If we can go beyond aggregated features and pooled cells, it opens up the possibility of more complex statistical tasks that require that degree of granularity. To reach the finest possible resolution of single-cell, single-region information there are inevitably many computational challenges to overcome. Here, we review the major data analysis challenges lying between raw data readout and biological discovery, and discuss the limitations of current data analysis approaches. Lastly, we conclude that chromatin accessibility profiling at true single-cell resolution is not yet achieved with current technology, but that it may be achieved with promising developments in optimising the efficiency of scATAC-seq assays.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Gene ontology analyses have repeatedly identified enrichment of proteins with annotated functions in gene expression regulation and neuronal communication. However, proteins are often pleiotropic and these annotations are inherently incomplete. Our recent autism functional genetics work has suggested that these genes may share a common mechanism at the cilium, a membrane-bound organelle critical for neurogenesis, brain patterning, and neuronal activity-all processes strongly implicated in autism. Moreover, autism commonly co-occurs with conditions that are known to involve ciliary-related pathologies, including congenital heart disease, hydrocephalus, and blindness. However, the role of autism genes at the cilium has not been systematically investigated. Here we demonstrate that autism proteins spanning disparate functional annotations converge in expression, localization, and function at cilia, and that patients with pathogenic variants in these genes have cilia-related co-occurring conditions and biomarkers of disrupted ciliary function. This degree of convergence among genes spanning diverse functional annotations strongly suggests that cilia are relevant to autism, as well as to commonly co-occurring conditions, and that this organelle should be explored further for therapeutic potential.

Retinal waves are crucial for refining visual maps in the brain's retinofugal targets and for the development of retinal circuits underlying feature detection, such as direction selectivity. Yet, how waves alter gene expression in immature RGCs is poorly understood, particularly at the level of the many distinct types of RGCs that underlie the retinas ability to encode diverse visual features. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on RGCs isolated at the end of the first postnatal week from wild-type (WT) mice and {beta}2KO mice, which lack the {beta}2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, leading to the disruption of cholinergic retinal waves. Statistical comparisons of RGC transcriptomes between the two conditions reveal a weak impact of retinal waves on RGC diversity, indicating that retinal waves do not influence the molecular programs that instruct RGC differentiation and maturation. Although wave-dependent gene expression changes are modest in the global sense, we identified ~238 genes that are significantly altered in select subsets of RGC types. We focused on one gene, Kcnk9, which encodes the two-pore domain leak channel potassium channel TASK3. Kcnk9, which is highly enriched in RGCs, was strongly downregulated in {beta}2KO. We validated this result using in situ hybridization and performed whole-cell recording to demonstrate a significant decrease in the leak conductance in {beta}2KO RGCs. Our dataset provides a useful resource for identifying potential targets of spontaneous activity-dependent regulation of neurodevelopment in the retina.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Multiple RV association tests are available to study the relationship between genotype and phenotype, but most are restricted to per-gene models and do not fully leverage the availability of variant-level functional annotations. We propose Genome-wide Rare Variant EnRichment Evaluation (gruyere), a Bayesian probabilistic model that complements existing methods by learning global, trait-specific weights for functional annotations to improve variant prioritization. We apply gruyere to WGS data from the Alzheimers Disease (AD) Sequencing Project, consisting of 7,966 cases and 13,412 controls, to identify AD-associated genes and annotations. Growing evidence suggests that disruption of microglial regulation is a key contributor to AD risk, yet existing methods have not had sufficient power to examine rare non-coding effects that incorporate such cell-type specific information. To address this gap, we 1) use predicted enhancer and promoter regions in microglia and other potentially relevant cell types (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons) to define per-gene non-coding RV test sets and 2) include cell-type specific variant effect predictions (VEPs) as functional annotations. gruyere identifies 15 significant genetic associations not detected by other RV methods and finds deep learning-based VEPs for splicing, transcription factor binding, and chromatin state are highly predictive of functional non-coding RVs. Our study establishes a novel and robust framework incorporating functional annotations, coding RVs, and cell-type associated non-coding RVs, to perform genome-wide association tests, uncovering AD-relevant genes and annotations.","NA","medrxiv",1733868603698

It is mediated by conserved ATG proteins, which coordinate autophagosome biogenesis and selective cargo degradation. Among these, the ubiquitin-like ATG8 protein plays a central role by linking cargo to the growing autophagosomes through interacting with selective autophagy receptors. Unlike most ATG proteins, the ATG8 gene family is significantly expanded in vascular plants, but its functional specialization remains poorly understood. Using transcriptional and translational reporters in Arabidopsis thaliana, we revealed that ATG8 isoforms are differentially expressed across tissues and form distinct autophagosomes within the same cell. To explore ATG8 specialization, we generated the nonuple {Delta}atg8 mutant lacking all nine ATG8 isoforms. The mutant displayed hypersensitivity to carbon and nitrogen starvation, coupled with defects in bulk and selective autophagy as shown by biochemical and ultrastructural analyses. Complementation experiments demonstrated that ATG8A could rescue both carbon and nitrogen starvation phenotypes, whereas ATG8H could only complement carbon starvation. Proximity labeling proteomics further identified isoform-specific interactors under nitrogen starvation, underscoring their functional divergence. These findings provide genetic evidence for functional specialization of ATG8 isoforms in plants and lay the foundation for investigating their roles in diverse cell types and stress conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Surprisingly, we found that the receptor-binding site of this H5N1 hemagglutinin was already occupied by an 2-3-linked sialic acid and that this glycan emanated from asparagine N169 of a neighboring protomer on hemagglutinin itself. This structure thus highlights recognition by influenza hemagglutinin of an auto 2-3-linked sialic acid from N169, an N-linked glycan conserved in 95% of H5 strains, and adds auto-glycan recognition to the complexities surrounding H5N1 zoonosis.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

This is more likely to arise when the two SNPs are in relatively close proximity, so while true epistasis between nearby variants could be commonplace, in practice there is no reliable way of telling apart true epistatic signals from false positives. By considering the causes of phantom epistasis from a genealogy-based perspective, we leverage the rich information contained within reconstructed genealogies (in the form of ancestral recombination graphs) to address this problem. We propose a novel method for explicitly quantifying how likely it is that a given pairwise interaction is the result of phantom epistasis, which can be applied to pairs of SNPs regardless of the genetic distance between them. Our method uses only publicly-available data and so does not require access to the phenotypes and genotypes used for detecting interactions. Using simulations, we show that the method has good sensitivity at even low genetic distances (around 0.5cM), and demonstrate its power to detect phantom epistasis using real data from previous studies. This opens up the exciting possibility of distinguishing spurious interactions in cis from those reflecting real biological effects.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

However, despite improvements in genome assembly, genome annotation (i.e. the identification of protein-coding genes) remains challenging, particularly for eukaryotic genomes: it requires combining several approaches (typically ab initio, transcriptomics, and homology search), each with its own pros and cons. Deciding which gene models to retain in a consensus is far from trivial, and automated approaches tend to lag behind laborious manual curation efforts in accuracy. Results Here, we present OMAnnotator, a novel approach to building a consensus annotation. OMAnnotator repurposes the OMA algorithm, originally designed to elucidate evolutionary relationships among genes across species, to integrate predictions from different annotation sources, using evolutionary information as a tie-breaker. We validated OMAnnotator by reannotating the Drosophila melanogaster reference genome and comparing it with the expert-curated reference and results from the automated pipelines BRAKER2 and EvidenceModeller. OMAnnotator produced a consensus annotation that outperformed each individual input and surpassed the existing pipelines. Finally, when applied to three recently published genomes, OMAnnotator gave substantial improvements in two cases, and mixed results in the third, which had already benefited from extensive expert curation. Conclusion We introduce an original, flexible, and effective approach to annotating genomes by integrating multiple lines of evidence. The method's robustness is underlined by its successful implementation in re-annotating recently published genomes, opening up new avenues in eukaryotic genome annotation.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

With no known effective FDA-approved treatments for either condition, patient-reported outcomes of treatments are invaluable for guiding management strategies in patient care and generating new avenues for research. Here, we present the results of an ME/CFS and Long COVID treatment survey with responses from 3,925 patients. We assessed the experiences of these patients with more than 150 treatments, as well as their demographics, symptoms, and comorbidities. Patients with each condition who participated in the study shared similar symptom profiles, including all the core symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g., 89.7% of ME/CFS and 79.4% of Long COVID reported post-exertional malaise (PEM). Treatments with the greatest perceived benefits were identified, which had varied effects on different core symptoms. In addition, treatment responses were significantly correlated (R{superscript 2} = 0.68) between the two patient groups. Patient subgroups with distinct profiles of symptoms and comorbidities showed varied responses to treatments, e.g., a POTS-dominant cluster benefiting from autonomic modulators and a cognitive-dysfunction cluster from CNS stimulants. This study underscores the symptomatic and therapeutic similarities between ME/CFS and Long COVID and highlights the commonalities and nuanced complexities of infection-associated chronic diseases and related conditions.

Our study reveals that, among these resources, SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the oxysterol-binding protein 1 (OSBP1) transporter to exploit the Golgi-bound phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) pool. This leads to a depletion of Golgi-resident PI4P, triggering the activation of the ATM DNA Damage Response (DDR) kinase in the cytoplasm. As such, ATM, typically anchored to PI4P at the Golgi in an inactive state, undergoes auto-phosphorylation and cytoplasmic release upon SARS-CoV-2-induced PI4P depletion. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of ATM auto-phosphorylation, which stabilizes its interaction with PI4P, significantly impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication. The requirement for PI4P and impact of ATM inhibition might be conserved across coronaviruses, as similar effects were observed with HCoV-229E. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-induced, cytoplasmic ATM pre-activation primes cells for an accelerated response to DNA damage, which might contribute to the severe outcomes of COVID-19 observed in cancer patients undergoing chemo- or radiotherapy. Therefore, this study uncovers a DNA damage-independent mode of ATM activation and highlights the potential of ATM inhibitors as therapeutic agents against COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Research gathered from model species, particularly Arabidopsis thaliana, has revealed that the nuclear auxin pathway controls many of these processes through transcriptional regulation. Recently, a non-transcriptional pathway based on rapid phosphorylation mediated by kinases has been described, complementing the understanding of the complexity of auxin-regulated processes. Phylogenetic inferences of both pathways indicate that only some of the components are conserved beyond land plants. This raises fundamental questions about the evolutionary origin of auxin responses and whether algal sisters share mechanistic features with land plants. Here we explore auxin responses in the unicellular streptophyte alga Penium margaritaceum. By assessing physiological, transcriptomic and cellular responses we found that auxin triggers cell proliferation, gene regulation and acceleration of cytoplasmic streaming. Notably, all these responses are also triggered by the structurally related tryptophan. These results identify shared auxin response features among land plants and algae, and suggest that less chemically specific responses preceded the emergence of auxin-specific regulatory networks in land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

While some broad gene categories are highly conserved with little divergence over time, others undergo continuous selection pressure and are highly divergent. Here, we combine single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) with evolutionary genomics to understand whether certain cell types exhibit faster evolutionary divergence (using their characteristic genes), than other types of cells. Merging scRNAseq with population genomic data, we show that cell types differ in the rate at which their characteristic genes evolve, as measured by allele frequency divergence among many populations (FST) and between species (dN/dS ratios). Neutrophils, B cells, and fibroblasts exhibit elevated FST at characteristic genes, while eosinophils in the intestine and thrombocytes in the head kidney exhibit lower FST than the average for 1000 random genes. Gene network centrality also differed between immune- and non-immune-associated genes, and closeness centrality was positively related to gene FST.

A key determinant of P. aeruginosa virulence is the regulated synthesis and release of extracellular products, which is controlled by a cell density-dependent signaling system known as quorum sensing (QS). P. aeruginosa uses a complex QS network, including two systems that rely on diffusible N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) signal molecules. The LuxR-type receptor RhlR is unique in that it requires the accessory protein PqsE to maximally bind to promoter DNA and to initiate transcription. Our group demonstrated that PqsE physically interacts with RhlR, enhancing its affinity for target promoters across the P. aeruginosa genome. Although LuxR-type receptors (RhlR homologs) are widespread in Gram-negative bacteria and important for pathogenesis, PqsE orthologs are restricted to Pseudomonas and Burkholderia species. This study explored the conservation of PqsE across species and examined PqsE ortholog structure-function across different species. Our results show that PqsE in Pseudomonas retain their functional interactions with RhlR homologs, unlike PqsE orthologs in Burkholderia spp., which do not interact with their respective LuxR-type receptors. Additionally, we assessed the AHL preferences of different receptors and hypothesized that the PqsE-RhlR interaction evolved to stabilize the inherently unstable RhlR, preventing its degradation. In a {Delta}pqsE background, we observe higher rates of RhlR protein turnover compared to WT, which can be rescued in a strain of P. aeruginosa lacking the Lon protease.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Here, we examined early signalling responses to single and combined BRAF and MAPK inhibition in a BRAFV600E, drug-sensitive melanoma cell line and a drug-resistant ARID1A-knockout (KO) derivative. ARID1A, frequently mutated in melanoma, is associated with resistance and immune evasion. Using an innovative systems biology approach that integrates transcriptomics, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and functional kinomics through matrix factorization and network analysis, we identified key signalling alterations and resistance mechanisms. We found that ARID1A-KO cells exhibited transcriptional rewiring, sustaining MAPK1/3 and JNK activity post-treatment, bypassing feedback sensitivity observed in parental cells. This rewiring suppressed PRKD1 activation, increased JUN activity - a central resistance network node - and disrupted PKC dynamics through elevated basal RTKs (e.g., EGFR, ROS1) and Ephrin receptor activity post-treatment. ARID1A mutations also reduced HLA-related protein expression and enriched extracellular matrix components, potentially limiting immune infiltration and reducing immunotherapy efficacy. Our graph-theoretical multi-omics approach uncovered novel resistance-associated signalling pathways, identifying PRKD1, JUN, and NCK1 as critical nodes. While receptor activation redundancies complicate single-target therapies, they also present opportunities for combination strategies. This study highlights ARID1A's role in reshaping signalling and immune interactions, offering new insights into melanoma resistance mechanisms. By identifying actionable targets, including JUN and immune pathways, we provide a foundation for developing integrated therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance in BRAF/MAPK inhibitor-treated melanoma.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

During development, DNA content remains constant but cell size evolves, necessitating a mechanism that scales chromosome compaction with cell size. In this study, we examined chromatin compaction in the developing Drosophila nervous system by analyzing the large neuronal stem cells and their smaller progeny, the ganglion mother cells. Using super-resolution 3D Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy and quantitative time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, we observed that nanoscale chromatin density during interphase scales with nuclear volume according to a power law. This scaling relationship is disrupted by inhibiting histone deacetylase activity, indicating that molecular cues rather than mechanical constraints primarily regulate chromatin compaction. Notably, this power law dependency is maintained into mitosis but the scaling exponent decreases, suggesting phase separation of chromatin events during mitotic compaction. We propose that the scaling of mitotic chromosome size relative to cell size depends on the power law behaviour of interphase chromatin volume, and that scaling of mitotic chromatin compaction is an emergent property of linear polymers undergoing phase separation with their solvent.

Statement of SignificanceUnderstanding how chromatin compaction changes with cell size is essential for understanding the mechanisms ensuring accurate genome segregation during cell division. In this study, we combine Voronoi tessellation analysis of Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy and image processing methods based on fluorescence intensity spectrum analysis of live confocal images to measure chromatin volume in interphase and mitosis in cells of different sizes. This work reveals that chromatin density in Drosophila neuronal cells follows a power law relationship with nuclear volume from interphase through mitosis, suggesting a fundamental principle underlying chromosome scaling across different cell sizes. We show that this scaling is regulated by molecular cues, such as histone deacetylase activity, and is conserved through a potential phase separation during mitosis, providing new insights into the biophysical processes that govern chromatin organization. This work broadens our understanding of chromosome biology and will have implications for understanding size-dependent chromatin dynamics in other organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Many movie-watching studies measure inter-subject correlation (ISC), which refers to the correlation between participants neural activation time series. Previous research has focused on explaining ISC differences during movie-watching based on individual states and traits, such as social distance, personality, and political orientation. For example, friends show higher ISC than strangers while watching movies.

However, movies are not natural categories but cultural artifacts that evoke varying levels of ISC depending on content, directing style, or editing methods. This raises questions about how much trait- or state-like differences in ISC depend on the specific movies chosen, potentially limiting the generalizability of findings across different movies.

Here, we used an fMRI dataset of 112 participants watching eight animated movies to (a) quantify between-movie variability in ISC across the brain and (b) assess the implications for the generalizability of trait- or state-like effects on ISC. We found substantial between-movie variability in ISC, with this variability differing across brain regions. Crucially, brain regions with the highest ISC exhibited the greatest variability, indicating that trait- or state-like differences in ISC from one movie may not generalize to others.

We conclude that variability between movies limits the generalizability of trait- or state-like ISC differences. Using a specific movie in neuroscience should be treated similarly to using a particular task, requiring a comparable characterization of the constituent cognitive elements. Broad generalizations about ""naturalistic imaging"" or ""movie watching"" are not warranted.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Recent analytical breakthroughs and theoretical developments rely on phase maintenance of oscillatory signals without considering whether or not this assumption is met. Lagged (auto)coherence, the coherence between a signal and itself at increasing temporal delays, has been proposed as a way to quantify the rhythmicity, or periodicity, of a signal. However, current Fourier-based lagged autocoherence algorithms suffer from poor spectral accuracy and resolution, aliasing effects that become more pronounced at higher frequencies, and conflation with amplitude covariation, especially in frequency ranges in which the signal power is low. We introduce a continuous lagged autocoherence metric, lagged Hilbert autocoherence, that addresses these shortcomings by using multiplication in the frequency domain for precise bandpass filtering, instantaneous analytic signals via the Hilbert transform, and thresholding using the amplitude covariation of surrogate data generated by an autoregressive model. We show that this version of lagged coherence yields vastly higher spectral accuracy and resolution than lagged Fourier autocoherence, and that this unlocks additional, increasingly fine grained applications. This includes examination of: 1) frequency-specific differences in rhythmicity between conditions, 2) changes in signal rhythmicity during learning, and 3) the relationship between frequency-specific rhythmicity and behavior, trial-by-trial. Lagged Hilbert autocoherence thus offers a significant toolset advancement for analysis of neurophysiological rhythmicity.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Due to their variable gene content and order, reference-free methods offer more sensitive detection of genetic differences, especially among closely related samples found in outbreaks. However, across longer genetic distances, frequent recombination can make calculation and interpretation of these differences more challenging, requiring significant bioinformatic expertise and manual intervention during the analysis process. Here we present a Population analysis PIPEline (PopPIPE) which combines rapid reference-free genome analysis methods to analyse bacterial genomes across these two scales, splitting whole populations into subclusters and detecting plausible transmission events within closely related clusters. We use k-mer sketching to split populations into strains, followed by split k-mer analysis and recombination removal to create alignments and subclusters within these strains. We first show that this approach creates high quality subclusters on a population-wide dataset of Streptococcus pneumoniae. When applied to nosocomial vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium samples, PopPIPE finds transmission clusters which are more epidemiologically plausible than core genome or MLST-based approaches.

While invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer high communication bandwidth to assist and rehabilitate these patients, their invasiveness limits broader adoption.

MethodsWe developed a minimally invasive BCI system that balances safety and communication bandwidth to restore hand functions of tetraplegia patients. This system enables real-time, precise control of hand movements and hand function rehabilitation. A complete spinal cord injury (SCI) patient with deficit hand functions was recruited in this study.

ResultsThe system required less than 10 minutes of calibration time and maintained an average grasping detection F1-score of 0.91 over a 9-month period of home use. With the assistance of the brain-computer interface, the patient can achieve a 100% success rate in object transfer tests, and successfully perform daily tasks involving hand functions. Additionally, the patient showed substantial neurological recovery through consecutive BCI training, regaining the ability to hold objects without BCI assistance. The patient exhibited a 5-point improvement in upper limb motor scores and a 27-point increase in the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT). Improvements in electrophysiological assessments point to a considerable recovery in impaired neural circuits.

ConclusionsIn a tetraplegia patient with complete spinal cord injury, an epidural minimally invasive BCI assisted the patients hand grasping to perform daily tasks, and 9-month consecutive BCI use significantly improved the hand functions.","NA","medrxiv",1733868603698

Flagellins with strong agonism bind TLR5 at their D1 and D0 domains, while poor agonist silent flagellins bind with D1 only. However, D0-TLR5 interactions insufficiently explain the silent phenotype. Here, we characterize the D1 domain binding kinetics of the silent flagellin RhFlaB compared to the strong canonical agonist StFliC. Using Surface Plasmon Resonance, we show that the RhFlaB-D1 binds more strongly than StFliC-D1, but forms shorter-lived complexes. Cryo-EM analysis of RhFlaB showed its D1 primary interface (PI) contains two distinct hydrophobic pockets, which should facilitate rapid association, while its D1 secondary interface (SI) is dominated by negatively charged residues, which likely impede residue-residue interactions. Comparisons with an existing StFliC-D1 structure suggest that strong agonism requires strong binding at both the PI and SI of the D1, and silent flagellins evade detection partly through weaker SI interactions. These findings offer a foundation for designing targeted interventions that can modulate TLR5 activity to influence immunity, inflammation, or even gut microbiome composition","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Pathogens secrete cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) to facilitate plant colonisation, but damaged, infected cells are often a source of cell wall-derived oligosaccharides that trigger host immunity. The mechanisms by which pathogens minimize the release of cell wall-derived oligosaccharides while colonizing the host remain to be elucidated. We combined biochemical, molecular genetics and transcriptomic analyses to functionally characterize a glycoside hydrolase (ZtGH45) from the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. ZtGH45 gene is expressed during the necrotrophic phase of the fungus, coinciding with an accumulation of wheat {beta}-1,3/1,4-mixed-linked glucan (MLG)-derived oligosaccharides. We show that overexpression of ZtGH45 enhances {beta}-1,3/1,4-glucan hydrolysis and the derived oligosaccharides trigger an immune response in wheat, which hinders Z. tritici virulence. The results demonstrate that tight regulation of ZtGH45 is critical for the infection process to prevent early accumulation of MLG oligosaccharides that would prematurely induce host immunity counterbalancing fungal virulence. We suggest that the balance between plant cell wall degradation by fungal CWDE and the release of immunogenic wall-derived oligosaccharides governs the outcome of host invasion by pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

A key functional role of any connectome is to constrain inter-neuronal signaling and to sculpt the flow of activity across the nervous system. Connectomes therefore play a central role in the rapid tranmission of information about an organisms environment from sensory neurons to higher-order neurons for action planning and ultimately to effectors. Here, we use a parsimonious model of activity spread to investigate the connectomes role in shaping putative sensory cascades. Our model allows us to simulate the signaling pathways from sensors to the rest of brain, mapping the similarity of these pathways between different sensory modalities and identifying convergence zones-neurons that are activated simultaneously by different sensory modalities. Further, we considered two multisensory integration scenarios - a cooperative case where different sensory modalities interacted to ""speed up"" (reduce) neurons activation times and a competitive ""winner take all"" case, where different sensory streams vied for the same neural territory. Finally, we use a data-driven algorithm to partition neurons into different classes based on their behavior during the cascade simulations. Our work helps underscore the role of ""simple"" models for enriching connectome data, while offering a data-driven classification of neurons based on their joint connectional/dynamical properties.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

However, limited sample sizes have hindered the discovery of variants for uncommon and rare diseases. Here, we introduce KGWAS, a novel geometric deep learning method that leverages a massive functional knowledge graph across variants and genes to improve detection power in small-cohort GWASs significantly. KGWAS assesses the strength of a variants association to disease based on the aggregate GWAS evidence across molecular elements interacting with the variant within the knowledge graph. Comprehensive simulations and replication experiments showed that, for small sample sizes (N=1-10K), KGWAS identified up to 100% more statistically significant associations than state-of-the-art GWAS methods and achieved the same statistical power with up to 2.67x fewer samples. We applied KGWAS to 554 uncommon UK Biobank diseases (Ncase <5K) and identified 183 more associations (46.9% improvement) than the original GWAS, where the gain further increases to 79.8% for 141 rare diseases (Ncase <300). The KGWAS-only discoveries are supported by abundant functional evidence, such as rs2155219 (on 11q13) associated with ulcerative colitis potentially via regulating LRRC32 expression in CD4+ regulatory T cells, and rs7312765 (on 12q12) associated with the rare disease myasthenia gravis potentially via regulating PPHLN1 expression in neuron-related cell types. Furthermore, KGWAS consistently improves downstream analyses such as identifying disease-specific network links for interpreting GWAS variants, identifying disease-associated genes, and identifying disease-relevant cell populations. Overall, KGWAS is a flexible and powerful AI model that integrates growing functional genomics data to discover novel variants, genes, cells, and networks, especially valuable for small cohort diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1733868603698

Its low cost and accessibility have extended its use across biological topics, from symbiosis to biogeography, and ecology. A successful metabarcoding application depends on accurate and comprehensive reference databases for proper taxonomic assignment. The 18S rRNA gene is the primary genetic marker used for general/broad eukaryotic metabarcoding due to its combination of conserved and hypervariable regions, and the availability of extensive taxonomically-informed reference databases like PR2 and SILVA. Despite its advantages, 18S rRNA has certain limitations at lower taxonomic levels, depending on the lineage. Alternative fast-evolving molecular markers, such as the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, have been adopted as widely used ""barcoding genes"" for eukaryotes due to their resolution to the species level. However, the COI gene lacks a curated taxonomically-informed database covering all eukaryotes, including protists, comparable to those available for 18S rRNA. To address this gap, we introduce eKOI, a curated COI gene database aimed at enhancing the taxonomic annotation and primer design for COI-based metabarcoding at the community level. This database integrates COI gene data from GenBank and mitochondrial genomes that are publicly available, followed by rigorous manual curation to eliminate redundancies and contaminants and to correct taxonomic annotations. We validate using the eKOI database for taxonomic annotation of protists by re-annotating several COI-based metabarcoding studies, revealing previously unidentified biodiversity. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the accuracy of the taxonomic annotations, highlighting the potential of eKOI to uncover new biodiversity in various eukaryotic lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

One approach to distinguishing between alternative mechanisms is to study species that reproduce at very young ages, as competing hypotheses make different predictions about patterns of mutation in these organisms. Here, we study the germline mutation rate in the gray short-tailed opossum, Monodelphis domestica, a laboratory model species that becomes reproductively mature at less than six months of age. Whole-genome sequencing of 22 trios reveals the lowest mutation rate per generation found in mammals thus far (0.26 x 10-8 per base pair per generation at an average parental age of 313 days), which is expected given their early reproduction. We also examine the mutation spectrum and find fewer mutations at CpG sites in opossums than in humans, consistent with the lower CpG content in the opossum genome. We observe that two-thirds of mutations are inherited from the male parent in opossums, slightly lower than the degree of male bias observed in organisms that reproduce at much older ages. Nevertheless, the very young age at reproduction in opossums suggests that ongoing spermatogonial divisions in males after puberty are not the primary driver of the observed male mutation bias. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that the differences between male and female germline mutation may arise from mechanisms other than cell division post-puberty.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

To obtain the iron required for growth, many bacterial pathogens encode transporters capable of extracting the iron-containing cofactor heme directly from host proteins. Pathogenic E. coli and Shigella spp. produce the outer membrane transporter ChuA, which binds host hemoglobin and extracts its heme cofactor, before importing heme into the cell. Heme extraction by ChuA is a dynamic process, with the transporter capable of rapidly extracting heme from hemoglobin in the absence of an external energy source, without forming a stable ChuA-hemoglobin complex. In this work, we utilise a combination of structural modelling, Cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, mutagenesis, and phenotypic analysis to understand the mechanistic detail of this process. Based on this understanding we utilise artificial intelligence-based protein design to create binders capable of inhibiting E. coli growth by blocking hemoglobin binding to ChuA. By screening a limited number of these designs, we identify several binders that inhibit E. coli growth at low nanomolar concentrations, without experimental optimisation. We determine the structure of a subset of these binders, alone and in complex with ChuA, demonstrating that they closely match the computational design. This work demonstrates the utility of de novo-designed proteins for inhibiting bacterial nutrient uptake and uses a workflow that could be applied to integral membrane proteins in other organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) seeks to prioritize chromosomally normal embryos for transfer based on genetic analysis of a biopsy of approximately five trophectoderm cells from blastocyst-stage in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos. While modern PGT-A platforms classify these biopsies as aneuploid, euploid, or mosaic (possessing a mixture of normal and aneuploid cells), the underlying incidences of aneuploid, euploid, and mosaic embryos and the rates of meiotic and mitotic error that produced them remain largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we paired a recent method for embryo simulation with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to infer rates of meiotic and mitotic error that best explain published PGT-A data. By simulating from these posterior distributions, we also evaluated the chromosomal status of entire embryos. For a published clinical sample, we estimated a 39-43% probability of meiotic error per meiosis, as well as a 1.0-3.0% probability of mitotic error per mitosis, depending on assumptions about spatial clustering of aneuploid cells within mosaic embryos. In addition, our analyses suggest that less than 1% of blastocysts are fully euploid, and that many embryos possess low-level mosaic clones that are not captured during biopsy. These broad conclusions were relatively insensitive to potential misclassification of mosaic biopsies. Together, our work helps overcome the limitations of embryo biopsies to estimate the fundamental rates of cell division errors that are the main causes of human pregnancy loss.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

In this study, we characterized the electrophysiological and transcriptomic effects of GBP on primary sensory neurons derived from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of ethically consented human donors. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we demonstrated that GBP treatment reduced neuronal excitability, with more pronounced effects in multi-firing vs. single-firing neuronal subtypes. Notably, significant donor-specific variability was observed in electrophysiological responsiveness to GBP treatment in vitro. RNA sequencing of DRG tissue from the GBP-responsive donor revealed differences in the transcriptome-wide expression of genes associated with ion transport, synaptic transmission, inflammation, and immune response relative to non-responsive donors. Cross-transcriptomic analyses further showed that GBP treatment counteracted these altered processes, rescuing aberrant gene expression at the pathway level and for several key genes. This study provides a comprehensive electrophysiological and transcriptomic profile of the effects of GBP on human DRG neurons. These findings enhance our understanding of GBPs mechanistic actions on peripheral sensory neurons and could help optimize its clinical use for neuropathic pain management.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

To investigate that, we integrated technological data of blades and bladelets from eastern African contexts (Marine Isotope Stages 5-1) with large-scale paleoclimatic reconstructions. A principal component analysis (PCA) finds the first component (reflecting artifacts' dimensions) significantly correlating with time. This highlights a progressive reduction in size over time, a trend that has already been suggested for the MSA-LSA transition. The second principal component reflects artifact shape and shows a significant correlation with seasonality.

Five TRAAK mutations that cause epilepsy or the neurodevelopmental syndrome FHEIG (facial dysmorphism, hypertrichosis, epilepsy, intellectual/developmental delay, and gingival overgrowth) retain sensitivity to cannabinoid inhibition. A cryo-EM structure reveals CBD binds in the intracellular cavity of TREK-1 to sterically block ion conduction. These results show that cannabinoids and endogenous lipids compete for a common binding site to inhibit channel activity, identify mechanosensitive K2Ps as potential physiological targets of CBD, and suggest cannabinoids could counter gain-of-function in TRAAK channelopathies.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

We find that in mice and humans, intratumoral lymphatic vessel density negatively correlates with productive cytotoxic immune responses and identify IFN{gamma} as an intrinsic inhibitor of lymphangiogenesis. Specific deletion of the Ifngr1 in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) greatly expanded the intratumoral lymphatic network and drove the emergence of a tip-like endothelial state, promoting lymph node metastasis but not dendritic cell migration. IFN{gamma} inhibits oxidative phosphorylation, which is required for proliferation and acquisition of the pathologic transcriptional state.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying chitin-induced systemic effects in plants remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of soil amendment with crab chitin flakes (hereafter chitin) on pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and systemic disease resistance in various plant species. We found that soil amendment with chitin potentiates PTI and disease resistance against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 in lettuce, tomato, and Arabidopsis as well as against the fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis causing powdery mildew in wheat. Using micrografting in Arabidopsis, we demonstrated that this systemic effect is dependent on active chitin perception in the roots. We also showed that induced systemic resistance (ISR) and pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs)/co-receptors, but not systemic acquired resistance (SAR), are involved in the systemic effects triggered by chitin soil amendment. This systemic effect correlated with the transcriptional up-regulation of key PTI components in distal leaves upon chitin soil amendment. Notably, chitin-triggered systemic immunity was independent of microbes present in soil or chitin flakes. Together, these findings contribute to a better understanding of chitin-triggered systemic immunity, from active chitin perception in roots to the potentiation of PTI in the leaves, ultimately priming plants to mount enhanced defense responses against pathogen attacks. Our study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of chitin soil amendment and resulting induced immunity, and highlights its potential use for sustainable crop protection strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

More recently, AlphaFold2 (AF2) has been adapted for the prediction of multiple structural conformations in addition to single-state structures. This novel avenue of research has focused on proteins (typically 50 residues in length or greater), while multi-conformation prediction of shorter peptides has not yet been explored in this context. Here, we report AF2-based structural conformation prediction of a total of 557 peptides (ranging in length from 10 to 40 residues) for a benchmark dataset with corresponding nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-determined conformational ensembles. De novo structure predictions were accompanied by structural comparison analyses to assess prediction accuracy. We found that the prediction of conformational ensembles for peptides with AF2 varied in accuracy versus NMR data, with average root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) among structured regions under 2.5 [A] and average root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) differences under 1.5 [A].

In recent years, a growing number of archaeal viruses have been described, revealing a stunningly diverse range of morphologies that appear unique to archaea. Detailed structural studies are paramount to fully understand how archaeal viruses infect their hosts. However, no complete atomic models of archaeal viruses are available to date. Using electron cryo-microscopy, we investigated the structure of the archaeal virus Haloferax tailed virus 1 (HFTV1), which infects the halophile Haloferax gibbonsii LR2-5 originating from the Senegalese salt lake Retba. Through single particle analysis, we achieved near-atomic resolution for the entire set of HFTV1's structural proteins, enabling the building of a full atomic model of the virion. Comparing the structures of DNA-filled and empty capsids, we visualise structural changes occurring upon DNA ejection. By investigating the double-stranded DNA inside the capsid, we elucidate how the genome is spooled upon loading. Furthermore, our structure reveals putative cell-surface receptor-binding and catalytic roles of capsid turret, baseplate, and tail fibre proteins. Together, our data provide new insights into the mechanisms of HFTV1 assembly and infection, unveiling new perspectives on general rules of host-virus interactions in archaea and their evolutionary links to bacterial and eukaryotic viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Here we have repeated our analysis with updated versions of the three reference coding gene sets. Superficially, little appears to have changed. Although there are slightly fewer genes predicted as coding overall, the three groups still disagree on the status of 2,606 annotated genes. However, a comparison without read-through genes and immunoglobulin fragments shows that the three reference sets have merged or reclassified more than 700 genes since the last analysis and that just 0.6% of Ensembl/GENCODE coding genes are not also annotated by the other two reference sets. We used eight features indicative of non-coding genes to examine the 21,873 coding genes annotated across the three reference sets.

Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in rats (Rattus norvegicus) have been established as an ideal model for studying emotional expression because they reflect internal emotional states. Since the discovery of USVs in rats, it has gradually been revealed that two types of adult rats' USVs with distinct acoustic features (high-short and low-long) are closely linked to positive and negative affect, respectively. Thus, for many years, most studies have grouped USVs into dichotomous categories: 50-kHz (positive) USVs and 22-kHz (negative) USVs, using these numbers as labels rather than measured values. However, the diversity of rats' USVs may have been overlooked due to this 50- / 22-kHz dichotomous framework, as several recent studies claim to have found new categories in USVs outside the framework. Here, through a systematic survey of descriptions of rats' USVs in the past literature, we confirmed a non-negligible number of reports on USVs that are outside the dichotomous framework. Our results support the abundance of diverse USVs beyond the dichotomy. This extends the traditional association between acoustic features and emotional states, highlighting the importance of research on diverse vocalizations that might reflect complex affective states beyond the simple distinction between positive and negative.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Systemic acute inflammation resulting in cytokine storm, hypercoagulability and endothelial damage is thought to be a central mechanism for severe morbidity and mortality in acute COVID-19. Anti-inflammatory medications taken routinely for chronic conditions prior to contracting COVID-19 (""background medications"") may modulate acute COVID-19 outcomes.

MethodsUsing data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) enclave, we estimated effects of six classes of background medications on acute COVID outcomes. Medication classes included aspirin, celecoxib, other NSAIDS, steroids, immune suppressants, and antidepressants. Acute COVID outcomes included probability of hospital admission, inpatient mortality, and mortality among diagnosed COVID patients. Each medication class was compared to benzodiazepines (excluding midazolam) which served as a comparator/control. Only adult COVID patients with pre-existing osteoarthritis and without any diagnosed autoimmune disease were included in the analyses. Random effects logistic regression models were used to adjust for covariates and data contributing organization. Medication effects also were estimated for COVID-negative cases.

ResultsNon-aspirin NSAIDS were associated with lower mortality among diagnosed COVID-19 patients: adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR)=0.32 (p=.032) for celecoxib; aOR=0.51 (p<.001) for NSAIDS other than aspirin and celecoxib. For inpatient mortality: aOR=0.34 (p=.060) for celecoxib and aOR=0.74 (p=.200) for other non-aspirin NSAIDS. Similar effects were observed for COVID-negative cases, including for inpatient mortality: aOR=0.21 (p<.001) for celecoxib and aOR=0.34 (p<.001) for other non-aspirin NSAIDS. Secondary analyses examined alternative explanations for results.

DiscussionProtective effects were observed for non-aspirin NSAIDS, especially celecoxib. However, those estimated effects implicitly assume the medication classes did not differ on the probability a true COVID-19 case was diagnosed. The similarity of COVID-positive and COVID-negative results suggest possible missing covariates. However, such similarity plausibly could stem from a medication having both ""direct"" and ""indirect"" effects on COVID outcomes. Adjudicating among the alternative interpretations would require data beyond those available. However, the effects observed for non-aspirin NSAIDS, while possibly biased, rationalize further investigation using study designs constructed to overcome the limitations of existing datasets.","NA","medrxiv",1733868603698

However, controversy has emerged regarding how many functional miRNAs are encoded in the genome, and to what extent non-regulatory products of RNA degradation have been mis-identified as miRNAs. Central to miRNA function is their capacity to associate with an Argonaute (AGO) protein and form an RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC), which mediates target mRNA suppression. We report that numerous miRNAs previously reported in EMT and cancer contexts, are not incorporated into RISC and are not capable of endogenously silencing target genes, despite the fact that hundreds of publications in the cancer field describe their roles. Apparent function can be driven through the expression of artificial miRNA mimics which is not necessarily reflective of any endogenous gene regulatory function.

A prominent principle promoted over the last century is that brain activity consists of electrical field potentials that oscillate at different frequency bands. However, this principle has been challenged on several grounds. Specifically, increasing evidence suggests that in some cases brain oscillations are manifested as transient bursts rather than sustained rhythms. In this paper, we examine the hypothesis that rhythmicity (sustained vs. bursty) is an additional dimension in the organization of brain function. To test this hypothesis, we segmented the neurophysiological spectrum of 859 participants encompassing a dozen datasets across species, recording techniques, ages 18-88, brain regions, and cognitive states in both health and disease, according to a novel measure of rhythmicity. Together with computer simulations and brain stimulation, we found a universal spectral architecture divisible into two categories: high-rhythmicity bands associated with sustained oscillations and novel low-rhythmicity bands dominated by brief oscillatory bursts. This universal architecture reveals stable features of the brains mode of operation: sustained bands signify maintenance of ongoing activity, whereas transient bands signify the brains response to change. Rhythmicity specifies a powerful, replicable, and accessible feature-set for neuro-technology and diagnosis, as well as cross-species comparisons.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

At the same time, these new capabilities are creating potential biosecurity challenges by providing new pathways to intentional or accidental synthesis of genes that encode hazardous proteins. The synthesis of nucleic acids is a key choke point in the AI-assisted protein engineering pipeline as it is where digital designs are transformed into physical instructions that can produce potentially harmful proteins. Thus, one focus for efforts to enhance biosecurity in the face of new AI-enabled capabilities is on bolstering the screening of orders by nucleic acid synthesis providers. We describe a multistakeholder, cross-sector effort to address biosecurity challenges with uses of AI-powered biological design tools to reformulate naturally occurring proteins of concern to create synthetic homologs that have low sequence identity to the wild-type proteins. We evaluated the abilities of traditional nucleic acid biosecurity screening tools to detect these synthetic homologs and found that, of tools tested, not all could previously detect such AI-redesigned sequences reliably. However, as we report, patches were built and deployed to improve detection rates over the course of the project, resulting in a final mean detection rate over tools of 97% of the synthetic homologs that were determined, using in-silico metrics, to be more likely to retain wild-type-like function. Finally, we make recommendations on approaches for studying and addressing the rising risk of adversarial AI-assisted protein engineering attacks like the one we identified and worked to mitigate.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

This process happens through the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) which is composed of glomerular endothelial cells, podocytes, and glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Damage to any component of GFB results in failure of the barrier's function, causing proteinuria that can lead to end-stage kidney failure. There is a high need for reliable in vitro models of the GFB to study pathological conditions and to test potential novel therapeutic options. We established an artificial GBM generated by electrospinning of poly-L-lactic acid fibers that were coated with polydopamine and gelatin and seeded with human glomerular endothelial cells and podocytes onto different sides. The orientation of fibers in the artificial GBM, their surface chemistry and effects on glomerular cells were characterized in depth. Glomerular endothelial cells and podocytes, including hiPSC-derived podocytes formed monolayers on the artificial GBM and revealed cell type-specific marker expression and morphology. Cell-cell communication was possible between podocytes and glomerular endothelial cells in both directions though the artificial membrane. Different molecular dextrans showed size selective permeability of the ex vivo GFB model. Introduction of shear stress by applying flow with a 3D printed micro-bioreactor improved cellular ultrastructure with formation of glomerular endothelial cell fenestrae-like structures and long podocyte foot process-like protrusions that both are usually absent in other in vitro models. Personalized hiPSC-derived podocytes within our model will allow to study the role of patient-specific podocyte mutations or individual treatment response ex vivo in the future.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Here, using immune cells as a model system for studying the relationship between aging and glycocalyx remodeling, we show that 2,6-linked sialic acid -- a terminal glycan epitope typically associated with inhibitory signaling -- becomes downregulated in T cells from older animals. This downregulation is tightly correlated with age-associated accumulation of effector T cells, which are decorated with little to no 2,6-linked sialic acids. T cell aging renders older individuals more vulnerable to infections and cancers. To understand the role of 2,6-linked sialic acids in T cell physiology, we generated a mouse model with T cell-specific deletion of the sialyltransferase gene St6gal1. The chronic depletion of 2,6-linked sialic acids led to naive T (TN) cells expansion in the periphery and premature T cell exhaustion. As a result, these mice were less able to control acute Listeria infection and chronic tumor growth. Blockade of the PD-1 pathway can partially restore the ability of St6gal1-deficient T cells to control tumor growth. Together, these data suggest that 2,6-linked sialic acids are critical for maintaining long-term T cell responsiveness, and the loss of 2,6-linked sialic acids may directly contribute to age-related T cell exhaustion.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Here we use pooled overexpression screens with a library of 11338 sORFs to overcome the challenge of elucidating which of the thousands of putative translated sORFs are biologically functional. As a proof-of-concept, we performed a phenotypic screen to identify sORFs protecting cells from treatment with the nucleotide analogue 6-thioguanine. With this approach, we identified two cytoprotective microproteins: altDDIT3 and PIPPI. PIPPI is encoded as part of the LC16a core duplicon/Morpheus gene cluster, a highly duplicated region of the human genome, which is undergoing rapid positive selection in primates. Our data show that PIPPI interacts with proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum, including protein disulfide isomerase ERp44.

Qualitatively, BioEmu samples many functionally relevant conformational changes, ranging from formation of cryptic pockets, over unfolding of specific protein regions, to large-scale domain rearrangements. Quantitatively, BioEmu samples protein conformations with relative free energy errors around 1 kcal/mol, as validated against millisecond-timescale MD simulation and experimentally-measured protein stabilities.

MethodsUsing a population-based panel study of 9,820 adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large, integrated healthcare system, we compared survey-defined ME/CFS-like illness with presence of an ME/CFS diagnosis in the electronic health record (EHR) to evaluate ME/CFS underdiagnosis.

ResultsOf those with survey-defined ME/CFS-like illness, an estimated 97.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 97.1%-98.4%) did not have an ME/CFS diagnosis in the EHR. The group without EHR diagnosis was younger, less likely to identify as white non-Hispanic, and more likely to have developed fatigue in the past three years than the EHR diagnosed group. Both diagnosed and undiagnosed ME/CFS-like illness groups had significantly impaired physical, cognitive, and social functioning, and significantly worse mental health and anxiety than those without ME/CFS-like illness.

ConclusionME/CFS is underdiagnosed in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California healthcare system. Enhanced syndromic surveillance that characterizes patients with ME/CFS who have not been diagnosed has the potential to increase timely recognition of ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1733868603698

In Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, male gametogenesis mitosis is exceptionally rapid and divergent. Within 8 minutes, the haploid male gametocyte genome undergoes three replication cycles (1N to 8N), while maintaining an intact NE. Axonemes assemble in the cytoplasm and connect to a bipartite MTOC-containing nuclear pole and cytoplasmic basal body, producing eight flagellated gametes. The mechanisms coordinating NE remodelling, MTOC dynamics, and flagellum assembly remain poorly understood.

Here, we identify the SUN1-ALLAN complex as a novel mediator of NE remodelling and bipartite MTOC coordination during Plasmodium male gametogenesis. SUN1, a conserved NE protein, localizes to dynamic loops and focal points near nuclear spindle poles. ALLAN, a divergent Allantoicase-like protein, has a location like that of SUN1 at nuclear MTOCs. SUN1 and ALLAN form a unique complex, detected by live-cell imaging, ultrastructural expansion microscopy, and interactomics. Deletion of either SUN1 or ALLAN gene disrupts nuclear MTOC organization, leading to basal body mis-segregation, defective spindle assembly, and impaired kinetochore attachment, but axoneme formation remains intact. Ultrastructural analysis revealed nuclear and cytoplasmic MTOC miscoordination, producing aberrant flagellated gametes lacking nuclear material. Sun1 deletion also alters parasite lipid composition, underscoring its role in NE homeostasis. These defects block parasite development in the mosquito and transmission, highlighting the essential functions of this complex.

This study reveals a bipartite MTOC and a highly divergent mechanism of NE remodelling during Plasmodium male gametogenesis. The SUN1-ALLAN complex is an unusual adaptation of the LINC complex, in absence of canonical KASH-domain proteins in Plasmodium, providing new insights into the evolution of closed mitosis and highlighting potential targets for blocking malaria transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Cryptosporidium is an intracellular parasite of intestinal epithelial cells, and a leading cause of diarrheal death and disease in infants worldwide. Despite this, very little is known about the cell biology of infection of this eukaryotic pathogen. Here, we designed and implemented a unique microscopy-based arrayed CRISPR-Cas9 screen to interrogate the effects of the loss of every protein-coding human gene on a Cryptosporidium infection. As the experimental readout is image-based, we extracted multiple phenotypic features of infection, including parasite growth, progression of the parasite to its sexual life stage, and recruitment of host actin to  pedestals beneath the parasite vacuole. Using this dataset, we discovered a tipping point in the host cholesterol biosynthesis pathway that controls Cryptosporidium infection. Parasite growth can either be inhibited or promoted by the intermediary metabolite squalene. A build-up of squalene in epithelial cells creates a reducing environment, with more reduced host glutathione available for uptake by the parasite. Because Cryptosporidium has lost the ability to synthesise glutathione, this uptake from the host cell is required for growth and progression through its life cycle. We demonstrate that this dependency can be leveraged for treatment with the abandoned drug lapaquistat, an inhibitor of host squalene synthase that has efficacy against Cryptosporidium in vitro and in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Some people in their eighties have cognitive abilities similar to many 30-year-olds, while others experience significant cognitive decline at a much younger age. The variation in age-related cognitive decline is not arbitrary. Several non-modifiable (e.g. genetic) and potentially modifiable (e.g. high blood pressure, smoking, and hearing loss) risk factors are associated with faster cognitive aging. Beyond these individual-level risk factors, a growing body of evidence has identified associations between cognitive impairment and social, economic, and environmental factors. These associations are even more pronounced in developing countries, notably because of greater disparities in education and socioeconomic status. However, people from these countries are rarely studied in scientific research: a citizen of a high-income country is 37 times more likely to appear in a study in top medical journals than a citizen of a low-income country. Here, we examine the association between sociodemographic factors and cognitive aging trajectories among 715,295 participants in 46 countries. Cognition is assessed using Sea Hero Quest, a spatial navigation video game that predicts spatial ability in the real world. We find that the social, economic, and environmental well-being of older adults, as measured by the Global AgeWatch Index (GAWI), is negatively associated with age-related decline in spatial ability. In particular, the GAWI Health and Environment subscores are strongly correlated with the effect of age on wayfinding performance. We also found that gender differences in spatial navigation skills increase with age, and even more so in countries with greater gender inequality, as estimated by the Gender Inequality Index. Our results show that cognitive aging must be understood as a dynamic, heterogeneous process that is strongly linked to potentially modifiable environmental and social factors.","NA","medrxiv",1733868603698

It is widely accepted that the spread of this language family across Europe from the 5th millennium BP correlates with the expansion and diversification of steppe-related genetic ancestry from the onset of the Bronze Age6,7. However, multiple steppe-derived populations co-existed in Europe during this period, and it remains unclear how these populations diverged and which provided the demographic channels for the ancestral forms of the Italic, Celtic, Greek, and Armenian languages8,9. To investigate the ancestral histories of Indo-European-speaking groups in Southern Europe, we sequenced genomes from 314 ancient individuals from the Mediterranean and surrounding regions, spanning from 5,200 BP to 2,100 BP, and co-analysed these with published genome data. We additionally conducted strontium isotope analyses on 224 of these individuals. We find a deep east-west divide of steppe ancestry in Southern Europe during the Bronze Age. Specifically, we show that the arrival of steppe ancestry in Spain, France, and Italy was mediated by Bell Beaker (BB) populations of Western Europe, likely contributing to the emergence of the Italic and Celtic languages. In contrast, Armenian and Greek populations acquired steppe ancestry directly from Yamnaya groups of Eastern Europe. These results are consistent with the linguistic Italo-Celtic10,11 and Graeco-Armenian1,12,13 hypotheses accounting for the origins of most Mediterranean Indo-European languages of Classical Antiquity. Our findings thus align with specific linguistic divergence models for the Indo-European language family while contradicting others. This underlines the power of ancient DNA in uncovering prehistoric diversifications of human populations and language communities.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

This chaperone function is critically important to proteostasis, conserved across all kingdoms of life, and associated with various protein misfolding diseases in humans4,5. Mechanistic insights into how sHSPs sequester destabilized clients have been limited due to the extreme molecular plasticity and client-induced polydispersity of sHSP/client complexes6-8. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the sHSP from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (mjHSP16.5) in both the apo-state and in an ensemble of client-bound states. The ensemble not only reveals key molecular mechanisms by which sHSPs respond to and sequester client proteins, but also provides insights into the cooperative nature of chaperone-client interactions. Engagement with destabilized client induces a polarization of stability across the mjHSP16.5 scaffold, proposed to facilitate higher-order assembly and enhance client sequestration capacity. Some higher-order sHSP oligomers appear to form through simple insertion of dimeric subunits into new geometrical features, while other higher-order states suggest multiple sHSP/client assembly pathways. Together, these results provide long-sought insights into the chaperone function of sHSPs and highlight the relationship between polydispersity and client sequestration under stress conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Using a novel analytic method to annotate natural speech recordings, we identify a low-frequency rate of IUs across the sample, with a peak at 0.6 Hz, and little variation between sexes or across the life span. We find that IU rate is only weakly related to speech rate quantified at the syllable level (SR), and crucially, that cross-linguistic variation in IU rate is smaller than cross-linguistic variation in SR. Since SR was shown to be inversely related to information density quantified at the syllable level, we suggest that across languages, IUs are more balanced than syllables in their information content.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

The analysis of the resulting data poses significant challenges due to their sparsity and large volume, and proper statistical methods are required to analyze and extract information from scRNA-Seq datasets. Sample classification based on gene expression data has proven effective and valuable for precision medicine applications. However, standard classification schemas are often not suitable for scRNA-Seq due to its unique characteristics, and new algorithms are required to effectively analyze and classify samples at the single-cell level. In this article, we introduce singleDeep, an end-to-end pipeline that streamlines the analysis of scRNA-Seq data training deep neural networks, enabling robust prediction and characterization of sample phenotypes.

To validate the effectiveness of singleDeep, we applied it to make predictions on scRNA-Seq datasets from different conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus and Alzheimers disease. Our results demonstrate strong diagnostic performance, validated both internally and externally. Moreover, compared with traditional machine learning methods applied to pseudobulk data, singleDeep consistently outperformed these approaches. In addition to prediction accuracy, singleDeep provides valuable insights into cell types and gene importance estimation for phenotypic characterization. This functionality provided additional and valuable information in our use cases. For instance, we corroborated that some interferon signature genes are consistently relevant for autoimmunity across all immune cell types in lupus. On the other hand, we discovered that genes linked to dementia have relevant roles in specific brain cell populations, such as APOE in astrocytes.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

In this study, we present a high-resolution structure of the CP in the ciliary tip of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila and identify several tip proteins that bind and form unique patterns on both microtubules of the tip CP. Two of those proteins that contain tubulin polymerization-promoting protein (TPPP)-like domains, TLP1 and TLP2, bind to high curvature regions of the microtubule. TLP2, which contains two TPPP-like domains, is an unusually long protein that wraps laterally around half a microtubule and forms the bridge between the two microtubules. Moreover, we found that the conserved protein SPEF1 binds to both microtubule seams. In vitro, human SPEF1 not only binds to the microtubule seam but also crosslinks two parallel microtubules. Single-molecule microtubule dynamics assays indicate that SPEF1 stabilizes microtubules in vitro. Together, these data show that the proteins in the tip CP maintain stable microtubule structure and probably play important roles in maintaining the integrity of the axoneme.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Tokenvizz is a novel tool for genomic analysis that enhances data discovery and visualization by combining GraphRAG-inspired tokenization with graph-based modeling. In Tokenvizz, genomic sequences are represented as graphs, where sequence k-mers (tokens) serve as nodes and attention scores as edge weights, enabling researchers to visually interpret complex, non-linear relationships within DNA sequences. Through a web-based visualization interface, researchers can interactively explore these genomic relationships and extract biologically meaningful insights about regulatory patterns and functional elements. Applied to promoter-enhancer interaction prediction tasks, Tokenvizz outperformed traditional sequential models while providing interpretable insights into genomic features, demonstrating the advantage of graph-based representations for biological discovery.

Here we report that KP.2 MV boosters elicit robust neutralizing antibody titers in a cohort of 16 healthy adult participants against all tested variants in pseudovirus neutralization assays. The highest post-boost geometric mean titers were against older variants D614G (17,293) and BA.5 (14,358), suggestive of immune imprinting, but the post-boost titers against currently dominant or growing viruses KP.3.1.1 (1,698) and XEC (1,721) were still robust. Fold-changes in titers were highest against recent JN.1 subvariants, including JN.1, KP.2, KP.3, KP.3.1.1, and XEC, (5.8-to-7.8-fold), compared to older variants D614G and BA.5 (1.6- and 2.5-fold), which suggests that KP.2 MV boosters have at least partially mitigated immune imprinting.

To evaluate MCSPACE's capabilities, we generated the largest longitudinal microbiome co-localization dataset to date, profiling spatial relationships of microbes in the guts of mice subjected to serial dietary perturbations over 76 days. Analyses of these data and an existing human longitudinal dataset demonstrated superior benchmarking performance of MCSPACE over existing methods, and moreover yielded insights into spatiotemporal structuring of the gut microbiome, including identifying temporally persistent and dynamic microbial assemblages in the human gut, and shifts in assemblages in the murine gut induced by specific dietary components.

In eukaryotes, building whole custom genomes is still many years away, but work in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast is closing-in on the first synthetic eukaryotic genome with genome-wide design changes. A key design change throughout the synthetic yeast genome is the introduction of LoxPsym site sequences. These enable inducible genomic rearrangements in vivo via expression of Cre recombinase via SCRaMbLE (Synthetic Chromosome Recombination and Modification by LoxPsym-mediated Evolution). When paired with selection, SCRaMbLE can quickly generate strains with phenotype improvements by diversifying gene arrangement and content in LoxPsym-containing regions. Here, we demonstrate how iterative cycles of SCRaMbLE can be used to reorganise synthetic genome modules and synthetic chromosomes for improved functional performance under selection. To achieve this, we developed SCOUT (SCRaMbLE Continuous Output and Universal Tracker), a reporter system that allows SCRaMbLEd cells to be sorted into a high diversity pool. When coupled with long-read sequencing, SCOUT enables high-throughput mapping of genotype abundance and correlation of gene content and arrangement with growth-related phenotypes. Iterative SCRaMbLE was applied here to yeast strains with a full synthetic chromosome, and to strains with synthetic genome modules encoding the gene set for histidine biosynthesis. Five synthetic designs for HIS modules were constructed and tested, and we investigated how SCRaMbLE reorganised the poorest performing design to give improved growth under selection. The results of iterative SCRaMbLE serve as a quick route to identify genome module designs with optimised function in a selected condition and offer a powerful tool to generate datasets that can inform the design of modular genomes in the future.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Still, managing beneficial microbes is challenging because the impact of microbial dormancy on community assembly across the soil, rhizosphere, and endosphere is poorly understood. We address this gap with the first documented use of Biorthogonal Non-Canonical Amino Acid Tagging (BONCAT) to probe active microbes in the soil-to-root gradient. Using nodule-forming legume Trifolium incarnatum, we confirmed that BONCAT is suitable for labeling endospheric microbes with microscopy. Next, we coupled BONCAT to Flow Cytometer Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to probe patterns of microbial activity and the structure of the active microbial community across the soil, rhizosphere, root, and nodule with a native soil microbial community. As expected, we found x10 higher microbial activity in the endosphere than in the rhizosphere or bulk soil, likely due to increased plant resources. Finally, we revealed that microbial activity in the rhizosphere was significantly associated with successful endosphere colonization, more so than microbial abundance alone. This last finding has implications for the development of microbial inoculants, suggesting colonizing plant roots is linked to a microbes ability to overcome dormancy once deployed in the soil.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Strong interactions between trophic levels facilitated transmission of bacterial genera from soil and roots to higher trophic levels. Pig slurry- derived microbes were found in all compartments, but their low prevalence suggests an indirect effect of fertilisation, primarily due to changes in nutrient availability. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering both individual compartments and trophic interactions in ecosystems to fully understand the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on environmental and human health.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

We investigate these challenges and evaluate UDE performance on realistic biological scenarios, providing a systematic training pipeline. Our results demonstrate the versatility of UDEs in systems biology and reveal that noise and limited data significantly degrade performance, but regularisation can improve accuracy and interpretability.

Here, we describe an additional layer to this process, essential when pathogen-derived signals alone cannot directly achieve full DC activation. Immunisation with sporozoites from Plasmodium leads to CD8 T cell priming in a complex response that is initiated by conventional type 1 DC (cDC1). We unveil a pivotal initiating role for V{gamma}1+ {gamma}{delta} T cells, as they directly supply IL-4 to DC and CD8 T cells. IL-4 synergises with a CD4 T cell-derived CD40L signal to induce IL-12 production by cDC1. Both IL-12 and IL-4 then directly signal CD8 T cells, with synergy between these cytokines then driving enhanced IL-12 receptor expression and expansion of responding CD8 T cells. This study reveals a key role for V{gamma}l+ {gamma}{delta} T cells in initiating CD8 T cell immunity to Plasmodium. More broadly, it shows that responses to some pathogens require help from innate-like T cells to pass the initiation threshold and further amplify the response in a process underscored by IL-4 production.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Pseudomonas bacteria isolated from diseased liverworts in the wild successfully re-infected M. polymorpha in pure culture conditions, producing high in planta bacterial densities and causing prominent tissue maceration. Comparative genomic analysis of Marchantia-associated P. viridiflava identified core virulence machinery like the type-III secretion system (T3SS) and conserved effectors (AvrE and HopM1) that were essential for liverwort infection. Disease assays performed in Nicotiana benthamiana further confirmed that liverwort-associated P. viridiflava infect flowering plants in an effector-dependent manner.

Such fibrinaloid microclots are also relatively resistant to fibrinolysis. The proteins that the amyloid microclots contained differed markedly both from the soluble proteome of typical plasma and that of normal clots, and also between the disease studies (an acute syndrome in the form of sepsis in an ITU and a chronic disease represented by Long COVID). Many proteins in the amyloid microclots were low in concentration in plasma and were effectively accumulated into the fibres, whereas many other abundant plasma proteins were excluded. The proteins found in the microclots associated with the diseases also tended to be themselves amyloidogenic. We here ask effectively the inverse question. This is: can the clot proteome tell us whether the clots associated with a particular disease contained proteins that are observed uniquely (or are highly over-represented) in known amyloid clots relative to normal clots, and thus were in fact amyloid in nature? The answer is in the affirmative in a variety of major coagulopathies, viz. venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, various cardiac issues, and ischaemic stroke. Galectin-3-binding protein and thrombospondin-1 seem to be especially widely associated with amyloid-type clots, and the latter has indeed been shown to be incorporated into growing fibrin fibres. These may consequently provide useful biomarkers with a mechanistic basis.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

TE mobility can be mutagenic and is thought to contribute to genome evolution by altering genome structure and diversification. In C. elegans elevated temperature leads to desilencing of TEs in the germline, suggesting that environmental conditions could impact the integrity of inheritable genomes. Here, we show that dysfunction of the AFD thermosensory neurons leads to desilencing of TEs in the germline. The TE activity results in de novo insertions and mutagenesis.

To counteract this, cells deploy dedicated silencing factors, such as the E3 ligase SIFI that terminates the mitochondrial stress response. How a single enzyme can sense stress across cells and elicit timely stress response inactivation is poorly understood. Here, we report the structure of human SIFI, which revealed how this 1.3MDa complex can target hundreds of proteins for accurate stress response silencing. SIFI attaches the first ubiquitin to substrates using flexible domains within an easily accessible scaffold, yet builds linkage-specific ubiquitin chains at distinct, sterically restricted elongation modules in its periphery. Ubiquitin handover via a ubiquitin-like domain couples versatile substrate modification to precise chain elongation. Stress response silencing therefore exploits a catalytic mechanism that is geared to process many diverse proteins and hence allows a single enzyme to monitor and, if appropriate, modulate a complex cellular state.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603698

Besides the commonly used Agrobacterium strains, Rhizobium rhizogenes can also introduce foreign DNA into host plants for gene expression. While many R. rhizogenes strains have been known for inducing hairy root symptoms, their use for transient expression has not been fully explored. Here, we showed that R. rhizogenes A4 outperformed all other tested agrobacterial strains in agroinfiltration experiments on leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana and other solanaceous plants. By conducting an agroinfiltration screening in N. benthamiana leaves using various agrobacterial strains carrying the RUBY reporter gene cassette, we discovered that A4 mediates the strongest and fastest transient expression. Utilizing the genomic information, we developed a collection of disarmed and modified strains derived from A4. By performing vacuum infiltration assays, we demonstrated that these A4-derived strains efficiently transiently transform 6-week-old N. benthamiana leaves, showing less sensitivity to the age of plants compared to the laboratory strain GV3101. Furthermore, we performed agroinfiltration using AS109, an A4-derived disarmed strain, on the leaves of tomato, pepper, and eggplant. Remarkably, AS109 mediated transient gene expression on tested solanaceous plants more effectively than all the tested commonly used agrobacterial strains.

We present LRGE, a novel tool that uses read-to-read overlap information to estimate genome size in a reference-free manner. LRGE calculates per-read genome size estimates by analysing the expected number of overlaps for each read, considering read lengths and a minimum overlap threshold. The final size is taken as the median of these estimates, ensuring robustness to outliers such as reads with no overlaps. Additionally, LRGE provides an expected confidence range for the estimate. LRGE outperforms k-mer-based methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency and produces genome size estimates comparable to those from assembly-based approaches, like Raven, while using significantly less computational resources. We validate LRGE on a large, diverse bacterial dataset and confirm it generalises to eukaryotic datasets.

It is commonly assumed that cells respond to these gradients by migrating directionally towards the regions of highest ligand density. In contrast with this view, here we show that cells exposed to micropatterned fibronectin gradients exhibit a complex repertoire of trajectories, including directed haptotactic migration up the gradient but also linear oscillations and circles with extended periods of migration down the gradient. To explain this behavior, we developed a biophysical model of haptotactic cell migration based on a coarse-grained molecular clutch model coupled to persistent stochastic polarity dynamics. While initial haptotactic migration is explained by the differential friction at the front and back of the cell, the observed complex trajectories over longer time scales arise from the interplay between differential friction, persistence, and physical confinement. Overall, our study reveals that confinement and persistence modulate the ability of cells to sense and respond to haptotactic cues and provides a framework to understand how cells navigate complex environments.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603699

This escape has been attributed to mutations in critical neutralizing antibody epitopes mainly in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. Here we show that this notion is incomplete. We found that several broadly neutralizing human antibodies isolated over the past years retain an almost undiminished capacity for inhibitory targeting of RBDs of recent highly immunoevasive SARS-CoV-2 strains. Likewise, human sera collected during the pre-Omicron era from persons immunized with original Wuhan-based vaccines were found to contain abundant neutralizing activity targeted against the RBDs of modern Omicron variants. However, this unexpected neutralization sensitivity was observed only when these RBDs were incorporated into a mismatched spike protein backbone, whereas the corresponding native Omicron spike proteins were highly resistant against the same panel of antibodies and human sera. We conclude that changes occurring outside of the RBD and leading to altered conformational dynamics of the spike protein have played a key part in the viral evolution enabling SARS-CoV-2 to escape from neutralizing antibodies that target highly conserved cryptic RBD epitopes.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603699

Traditionally linked to genomic imprinting, these effects are believed to have evolved from parental conflict over resource allocation to offspring, which results in opposing parental genetic influences. Despite their potential importance, POEs remain heavily understudied in complex traits, largely due to the lack of parental genomes.

Here, we present a multi-step approach to infer the parent-of-origin of alleles without parental genomes, leveraging inter-chromosomal phasing, mitochondrial and chromosome X data, and sibling-based crossover inference. Applied to the UK Biobank (discovery cohort) and Estonian Biobank (replication cohort), this scalable approach enabled parent-of-origin inference for up to 221,062 individuals, representing the largest dataset of its kind.

GWAS scans for more than 60 complex traits and over 2,400 protein levels contrasting maternal and paternal effects identified over 30 novel POEs and confirmed more than 50% of testable known associations. Notably, approximately half of our POEs exhibited a bipolar pattern, where maternal and paternal alleles exert conflicting effects. These effects were particularly prevalent for traits related to growth (e.g., IGF-1, height, fat-free mass) and metabolism (e.g., type 2 diabetes, triglycerides, glucose). Replication in the Estonian Biobank validated over 70% of testable associations.

Overall, our findings shed new light on the influence of POEs on diverse complex traits and align with the parental conflict hypothesis, providing compelling evidence for this understudied evolutionary phenomenon.","NA","medrxiv",1733868603699

Regrettably, this was accomplished only for individual, tissue-dissociated cells. High-plex spatial biology has begun to recover the x, y, and z-coordinates of single-cells, but typically at the expense of far less than whole transcriptome coverage. To solve this problem, Bruker Spatial Biology has accomplished a commercial-grade panel (CosMx(R) Spatial Molecular Imager Whole Transcriptome Panel (WTx)), using 37,872 imaging barcodes, capable of sub-cellular imaging of the entire human protein-coding transcriptome. The imaging barcodes are encoded with 156 bits of information (4 on-cycles and 35 dark-cycles per code), at a Hamming Distance of 4 from each other to achieve a very low false-code detection. Key to achieving this high-plex capability was the ability to manufacture imaging barcodes that require no in-tissue amplification (every barcode is manufactured under GMP to contain exactly 30 fluorescent dyes) and uniform, size-exclusion purified, extremely small imaging barcodes ([~] 20 nm). A detailed study of six different human FFPE tissue types was performed (Colon, Pancreas, Hippocampus, Skin, Breast, Kidney), yielding over 5.4 billion transcripts from 2.7 million cells. We counted over 1,550 transcripts-per-cell on average and observed 900 unique genes per cell (measured as the median). Single fixed-cells containing well over 10,000 subcellularly imaged transcripts were accomplished. Advancing single-cell imaging to the whole transcriptome level opens a single unified approach to accomplish essentially all single-cell experiments, both imaging and non-imaging.

However, the inability to read XNAs in a direct, high-throughput manner has been a significant limitation for xenobiology. Here we demonstrate that XNA-containing templates can be directly and robustly sequenced (>2.3 million reads/flowcell, similar to DNA controls) on a MinION sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies to obtain signal data that is significantly distinct from DNA controls (median fold-change >6x). To enable training of machine learning models that deconvolve these signals and basecall XNAs along with natural bases, we developed a framework to synthesize a complex pool of 1,024 UB-containing oligonucleotides with diverse 6-mer sequence contexts and high XNA purity (>90% UB-insertion on average). Bootstrapped models to enable data preparation, and data augmentation with spliced XNA reads to provide high context diversity, enabled learning of a generalizable model to call natural as well as unnatural bases with high accuracy (>80%) and specificity (99%). These results highlight the versatility of nanopore sequencing as a platform for interrogating nucleic acids for xenobiology applications, and the potential to transform the study of genetic material beyond those that use canonical bases.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603699

The recent approval of TCR-gene-edited T cells for cancer therapy demonstrates the therapeutic advantage of using pMHC recognition to eliminate cancer. However, identification and selection of TCRs from patient material is complex and influenced by the TCR repertoire of the donors used. To overcome these limitations, we here present a rapid and robust de novo binder design platform leveraging state-of-the-art generative models, including RFdiffusion, ProteinMPNN, and AlphaFold2, to engineer minibinders (miBds) targeting the cancer-associated pMHC complex, NY-ESO-1(157-165)/HLA-A*02:01. By incorporating in silico cross-panning and molecular dynamics simulations, we enhanced specificity screening to minimise off-target interactions. We identified a miBd that exhibited high specificity for the NY-ESO-1-derived peptide SLLMWITQC in complex with HLA-A*02:01 and minimal cross-reactivity in mammalian display assays. We further demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this miBd by integrating it into a chimeric antigen receptor, as de novo Binders for Immune-mediated Killing Engagers (BIKEs). BIKE-transduced T cells selectively and effectively killed NY-ESO-1+ melanoma cells compared to non-transduced controls, demonstrating the promise of this approach in precision cancer immunotherapy. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of generative protein design for accelerating the discovery of high-specificity pMHC-targeting therapeutics.

The relative importance of standing genetic variation vs. de novo mutations in adaptation remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. Selection during domestication has been long used as a model to understand evolutionary processes, providing information not only on the phenotypes selected but also, in many cases, an understanding of the causal loci. Of the multiple causal loci that have been identified in maize, the selected allele can be found segregating in natural populations, consistent with their origin as standing genetic variation. The sole exception to this pattern is the well-characterized domestication locus tga1, which has long been thought to be an example of selection on a de novo mutation. Here, we use a large dataset of maize and teosinte genomes to reconstruct the origin and evolutionary history of tga1. We first estimated the age of tga1-maize using a genealogy-based method, finding that the allele arose approximately 41,000-49,000 years ago, predating the beginning of maize domestication. We also identify, for the first time, tga1-maize in teosinte populations, indicating the allele can survive in the wild. Finally, we compare observed patterns of haplotype structure and mutational age distributions near tga1 with simulations, finding that patterns near tga1 in maize better resemble those generated under simulated selective sweeps on standing variation. These multiple lines of evidence suggest that maize domestication likely drew upon standing genetic variation at tga1 and cement the importance of standing variation in driving adaptation during domestication.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603699

Recently, a wealth of public single-cell RNA sequencing data as well as rapid scaling of self-supervised learning methods have provided new avenues to address this longstanding challenge. However, rapid parameter scaling has been essential to the success of large language models in text and images, while similar scaling has not been attempted with Transformer architectures for cellular modeling. To produce accurate, transferable, and biologically meaningful representations of cellular systems, we develop AIDO.Cell, a pretrained module for representing gene expression and cellular systems in an AI-driven Digital Organism [1]. AIDO.Cell contains a series of 3M, 10M, 100M, and 650M parameter encoder-only dense Transformer models pre-trained on 50 million human cells from diverse tissues using a read-depth-aware masked gene expression pretraining objective. Unlike previous models, AIDO.Cell is capable of handling the entire human transcriptome as input without truncation or sampling tricks, thus learning accurate and general representations of the human cells entire transcriptional context. This pretraining with a longer context was enabled through FlashAttention-2, mixed precision, and large-scale distributed systems training. AIDO.Cell (100M) achieves state-of-the-art results in tasks such as zero-shot clustering, cell-type classification, and perturbation modeling. Our findings reveal interesting loss scaling behaviors as we increase AIDO.Cells parameters from 3M to 650M, providing insights for future directions in single-cell modeling.

These three loci, Teosinte crossing barrier 1 (Tcb1), Gametophytic factor 1 (Ga1), and Ga2, each play a key role in preventing hybridization between populations and are proposed to maintain the barrier between domesticated and wild subspecies. Each locus encodes a matching pair of silk- and pollen-active pectin methylesterases (PMEs). To investigate the diversity and molecular evolution of these gametophytic factor loci, we identified existing and improved models of the responsible genes in a new genome assembly which contains active versions of all three loci. We then examined fifty-two assembled genomes from seventeen species to classify haplotype diversity and identify sites under diversifying selection during the evolution of the causal genes. We show that Ga2, the oldest of these three loci, was duplicated to form Ga1 at least 12 million years ago. Tcb1, the youngest locus, arose as a duplicate of Ga1 before or around the time of diversification of the Zea genus. We find evidence of positive selection during evolution of the functional genes at an active site in the pollen-expressed PME and predicted surface sites in both the silk- and pollen-expressed PMEs. The most common allele at the Ga1 locus is a conserved ga1 allele (ga1-O), which is non-coding due to conserved stop codons in full-length gene copies that are between 610 thousand and 1.5 million years old. We show that the ga1-O allele is associated with and likely generates 24-nt siRNAs in developing pollen-producing tissue, and these siRNAs map to functional Ga1 alleles. In previously-published crosses, the ga1-O allele associates with reduced function of the typically dominant functional alleles for the Ga1 and Tcb1 barriers. Taken together, this seems to be an example of a type of epigenetic trans-homolog silencing known as paramutation functioning at a locus controlling a reproductive barrier.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603699

C. elegans possesses an expanded repertoire of at least 19 AGOs functioning in an intricate gene regulatory network. Despite their crucial roles, little is known about the regulation of AGOs, and whether their expression levels, tissue specificity, and functions change in response to genetic perturbations or environmental triggers. Here, we report that PALS-22, a member of an unusually expanded protein family in C. elegans, acts as a negative regulator of antiviral RNAi involving the RIG-I homolog. The loss of pals-22 leads to enhanced silencing of transgenes and endogenous dsRNAs. We found that PALS-22 normally suppresses the expression of two AGOs, VSRA-1 and SAGO-2, which are activated by bZIP transcription factor ZIP-1. When pals-22 is eliminated, vsra-1 and sago-2 are upregulated. These AGOs in turn play key roles in defense against foreign genetic elements and intracellular pathogens, respectively. Surprisingly, while in pals-22 mutants immune genes functioning in the intracellular pathogen response (IPR) are upregulated, removing SAGO-2 or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RRF-3 in these mutants leads to the downregulation of these genes. This observation contrasts with the typical gene-silencing role of siRNAs. Finally, by analyzing C. elegans wild isolates and lab reference strains, we demonstrate that PALS-22 regulates the expression of several germline AGOs, affecting germline mortality and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In summary, PALS-22 is a key genetic node that balances the trade-off between immunity and germline health by modulating the functions of different AGOs, thereby shaping the outputs of the RNAi machinery and the dynamics of epigenetic inheritance.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603699

Moreover, genetically divergent versions of N2 have arisen over decades of research and hindered reproducibility of C. elegans genetics and genomics. Here we provide a 106.4 Mb gap-free, telomere-to-telomere genome assembly of C. elegans, generated from CGC1, an isogenic derivative of the N2 strain. We used improved long-read sequencing and manual assembly of 43 recalcitrant genomic regions to overcome deficiencies of prior N2 and VC2010 assemblies, and to assemble tandem repeat loci including a 772-kb sequence for the 45S rRNA genes. While many differences from earlier assemblies came from repeat regions, unique additions to the genome were also found. Of 19,972 protein-coding genes in the N2 assembly, 19,790 (99.1%) encode products that are unchanged in the CGC1 assembly.

SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to multisystem deficits, including those affecting the nervous system. Here, we investigated whether a SARS-CoV-2 infection alone increases the susceptibility to develop parkinsonian phenotypes in C57BL/6J mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor, or in addition to two well-known toxin exposures, MPTP and paraquat. Additionally, we examined mice carrying a G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene. We also examined if vaccination with either an mRNA- or protein-based vaccine can alter any observed neuropathology. We find that the infection with the WA-1/2020 (alpha) or omicron B1.1.529 strains in ACE2 and G2019S LRRK2 mice both synergize with a subtoxic exposure to the mitochondrial toxin MPTP to induce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra. This synergy appears toxin-dependent since we do not observe this following exposure to the direct redox-inducing compound paraquat. This synergistic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is rescued in WT mice that were vaccinated using either mRNA- and protein- based vaccines directed against the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, in the G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice, we find that only the protein-based vaccine but not the mRNA- based vaccine resulted in a rescue of the SARS-CoV-2 mediated neuropathology.

Not only do TF concentrations fluctuate in time and from cell to cell, in each cell the actual binding and unbinding of TFs to promoters is also stochastic. However, how this  noise propagation from TFs to their targets determines the expression fluctuations in target genes of the same TF has so far not been quantitatively characterized. Here we use fluorescence time-lapse microscopy in combination with microfluidics and automated image analysis to quantitatively track the single-cell growth and gene expression dynamics of different target promoters of the LexA SOS response regulator in E. coli under mild DNA damage induced by the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP).

We find that, at the single-cell level, LexA target promoters exhibit stochastic bursts in protein production with specific quantitative characteristics. First, the durations of protein production bursts are short, identical for all promoters, and independent of CIP levels. Second, the heights of the production peaks are exponentially distributed for each promoter, and independent of CIP level, but with different average heights for different promoters. Third, the frequency of the production bursts increases with CIP level for all promoters, but differs across promoters.

Importantly, we show that these observations are inconsistent with popular  equilibrium models of bacterial gene regulation that assume that the dynamics of binding and unbinding of TFs is fast relative to the time-scale of TF concentration fluctuations. Instead, all observations can be quantitatively fit by a relatively simple model in which DNA damage events lead to short transient dips in LexA concentration, and an expression burst occurs in a cell whenever LexA unbinds from the target promoter during such a short dip in LexA concentration. Moreover, because these transient dips in LexA concentration occur on the same time-scale as the stochastic unbinding of LexA from promoters, the response of a target promoter to an individual DNA damage event is stochastic and depends in a complex manner on the strengths of its LexA binding sites and the duration of the event. Consequently, the expression levels of different LexA target genes in a given cell reflect distinct statistics of the frequency and durations of DNA damage events in the recent history of that cell.

Our results show that, even in the simple scenario where a single TF is induced, different target promoters can exhibit distinct stochastic responses that depend on the precise kinetics of the induction events.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603699

In the case of ligand-gated ion channels, agonist binding triggers rapid transition through a series of intermediate states leading to a transient open-pore conformation. These transitions are usually framed in terms of a mechanism where agonist binding and channel activation are separate events. Here, we collect cryo-EM images over a range of agonist concentrations to define structures of the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in unliganded, mono-liganded, and di-liganded states. We show that agonist binding to a single agonist site stabilizes an intermediate state where an entire principal agonist-binding subunit has transitioned to an active-like conformation, while the other unoccupied principal subunit remains inactive, albeit poised for activation. Binding of agonist to the second agonist site fully activates the remaining subunits leading to hydration of the ion pore. Uniting this cryo-EM derived intermediate structure with single-channel recordings leads to a model where individual acetylcholine receptor subunits asynchronously undergo conformational transitions, and thus a sequential activation mechanism that has implications for the entire superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603699

However, the underlying cis-regulatory genetic factors that contribute to heterogeneity in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and their impact on clinical phenotypes remain enigmatic. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to quantify genetic contributions to cis-regulatory variation in 361,119 peripheral blood mononuclear cells across 63 COVID-19 patients during acute infection, 39 samples collected in the convalescent phase, and 106 healthy controls. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping across cell types within each disease state group revealed thousands of cis-associated variants, of which hundreds were detected exclusively in immune cells derived from acute COVID-19 patients. Patient-specific genetic effects dissipated as infection resolved, suggesting that distinct gene regulatory networks are at play in the active infection state. Further, 17.2% of tested loci demonstrated significant cell state interactions with genotype, with pathways related to interferon responses and oxidative phosphorylation showing pronounced cell state-dependent variation, predominantly in CD14+ monocytes. Overall, we estimate that 25.6% of tested genes exhibit gene-environment interaction effects, highlighting the importance of environmental modifiers in the transcriptional regulation of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings underscore the importance of expanding the study of regulatory variation to relevant cell types and disease contexts and argue for the existence of extensive gene-environment effects among patients responding to an infection.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603699

Here, using experimental evolution, we show that the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae can adapt to freeze-thaw stress in a stereotyped manner, with survival increasing nearly two orders of magnitude from {approx}2% to {approx}70% in about 25 cycles of stress exposure. Adapted cells exhibit reduced membrane damage, smaller sizes, higher mass densities, and a lower prevalence of budding. Rheological measurements show that the adapted cells are stiffer and exhibit lower particle mobilities within the cytoplasm. Whole genome sequencing indicates that increased survival is not accompanied by specific (unique) genetic changes, but rather is associated with multiple, distinct genotypes. Concomitant with mechanical changes in the adapted cells, the basal intracellular level of trehalose, a sugar speculated to play a physical role in maintaining membrane and cytoplasmic integrity, exhibits a three-fold increase. Together, these cellular attributes strongly correlate with the entry of cells into a quiescence-like state. A quantitative model that incorporates selection based on cellular quiescence recapitulates the adaptation dynamics, i.e. increase in survival and trehalose levels, seen in experiments. Finally, we find that the evolved mechano-chemical phenotypes are similar even when we use qualitatively different freeze-thaw selection protocols for the evolution, hinting at a convergent adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603699

With the advance of population genomics, studies in diverse organisms revealed supergenes associated with a myriad of complex traits, ranging from morphology to sexual behavior, from butterfly wing patterns to floral morphs. Two supergenes have been described on non-homologous ""social chromosomes"" in two ant lineages, Solenopsis and Formica, that diverged more than 90 million years ago. In both lineages, the supergene is associated with social polymorphism, where some colonies are headed by a single queen (monogyne) while others harbor multiple queens (polygyne). We discovered a new supergene associated with similar social polymorphism in the desert ant Cataglyphis niger. Although Cataglyphis is more closely related to Formica than to Solenopsis, the social chromosome in C. niger is homologous to the Solenopsis social chromosome, with conservation of synteny in gene content as well as gene order. Therefore, this is an ancient chromosome dating back to the common ancestor of Solenopsis and Cataglyphis, at least 90 million years ago. Previous work dated the Solenopsis supergene to be only one million years old, therefore, we propose that the two supergenes have evolved independently in the two diverged lineages on this ancient social chromosome. We surveyed hymenopteran genomes to discover a bee chromosome homologous to the ants social chromosome. The conservation of the gene set on these homologous chromosomes in ants and bees suggests that this chromosome plays an important role in social behavior across social Hymenoptera. We hypothesize that the conserved gene set in the social chromosome was repeatedly used as a pre-adapted toolkit for the evolution of social traits in general and specifically in the evolution of polygyne social structure in ants.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603699

We find that {beta} cell ablation impedes PDAC development in mice, arguing that the endocrine pancreas is critical for exocrine tumorigenesis.

Using zebrafish oocytes, eggs and embryos as a model system, we discovered PITHD1 as an endogenous inhibitor of the 26S proteasome. Our high-resolution cryoEM structure reveals that PITHD1 simultaneously blocks three crucial functional sites on the 19S regulatory particle which are required for ubiquitin recognition, processing, and substrate translocation. This triple-lock mechanism effectively prevents protein degradation in dormant cells. Given PITHD1s evolutionary conservation across species, this mechanism likely represents a general strategy for reversible proteasome regulation during cellular dormancy. Our findings establish a new paradigm for controlling proteostasis in quiescent states.","NA","biorxiv",1733868603699

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty. We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit. Based on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still undeniably demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1733868603699

PREVENT-19 (NCT04611802/2019nCoV-301), a pivotal phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated robust efficacy of a primary, 2-dose series of NVX-CoV2373 against COVID-19.

MethodsProtocol expansions to PREVENT-19 included enrollment of adolescents (aged 12 to <18 years) and administration of 3rd and 4th doses of NVX-CoV2373 to adults and adolescents. Participants randomized 2:1 received NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 21 days apart; 3rd and 4th doses were administered [&ge;]6 months after the preceding dose. Secondary and additional assessments included post-3rd- and 4th-dose immune responses (neutralizing antibody [nAb], anti-rS IgG, human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-receptor binding inhibition [hACE2-RBI]) and response durability (post-3rd dose) to ancestral virus; cross-reactivity to Omicron subvariants; safety; and reactogenicity.

ResultsImmune responses were observed against ancestral virus after two doses of NVX-CoV2373 but not after placebo. In both adults and adolescents, additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 increased nAb titers, anti-rS IgG levels, and hACE2-RBI; durable responses were recorded 8 months post 3rd dose. nAb responses post 3rd dose were noninferior to those post primary series. Cross-reactivity to BA.5 and BQ.1.1 variants was also observed, with anti-rS IgG levels post 3rd or 4th dose exceeding previously reported correlates of protection. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated, with no new safety signals.

ConclusionsNVX-CoV2373 elicited robust and durable humoral immune responses to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 as a 3rd and 4th dose after the primary series in adults and adolescents. Cross-reactivity to relevant variants provides insight into potential protection against antigenically related, but shifted, viral strains. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated with no new safety signals. These results support the utility of this vaccine platform and continued updates, based on currently circulating strains, to help effectively combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

From 2022, the national vaccination programme has been run twice per year, prioritising older age groups or those classified as clinically vulnerable. Here we assess the trends in COVID-19 outcomes between September 2023 and April 2024, using national-level data held by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

MethodsData linkage of national-level COVID-19 episode data, NHS emergency and hospital attendance data, and death registrations were used to analyse COVID-19 outcomes. Outcomes were defined as COVID-19 associated A&E attendances, hospital admissions, severe hospitalisations, and deaths.

The number and rate of each COVID-19 outcome category between September 2023 and April 2024 was calculated, stratified by clinical risk status and age and sex.

ResultsThe most common COVID-19 outcomes during this time-period were A&E attendance and hospital admission, with the rates highest among those aged 75 and over. Among this age group, all outcomes disproportionately affect those who have been identified as at clinical risk and those who were immunosuppressed.

High rates of A&E attendance and hospital admission were also observed among infants (under 6 months old) but were lower for more severe outcomes.

DiscussionGroups that were most affected by COVID-19 outcomes were currently prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination in England, which will help protect against more severe outcomes including admission to intensive care and death.

Immunity has been acquired through natural infection, primary and booster vaccination, while protection has been lost through waning immunity and viral mutation. During the height of the pandemic in England, the main aim was to rapidly protect the population and large supplies of vaccine were pre-purchased, eliminating the need for cost-effective calculations. As we move to an era where for the majority of the population SARS-CoV-2 infections cause relatively mild disease, and vaccine stocks need to be re-purchased, it is important we consider the cost-effectiveness and economic value of COVID-19 vaccination programmes.

MethodsHere using data from 2023 and 2024 in England on COVID-19 hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths, coupled with bespoke health economic costs, we consider the willingness to pay threshold for COVID-19 vaccines in different age and risk groups. We partition the population into sixteen 5-year age-groups and three risk groups (no-risk, at-risk and immunosuppressed) and calculate the health savings, in terms of costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), per vaccine dose. We adopt three different methodological approaches to estimate the level of vaccine protection leading to five different estimates of efficacy.

FindingsWillingness to pay thresholds vary from less than {pound}1 for younger age-groups without any risk factors, to over {pound}100 for older age-groups with comorbidities that place them at risk. This extreme non-linear dependence on age, means that despite the different method of estimating vaccine efficacy, there is considerable qualitative agreement on the willingness to pay threshold, and therefore which ages it is cost-effective to vaccinate. For pre-purchased vaccine, where the only cost is administration ({approx}{pound}10), a twice-yearly universal booster offer to all those aged 70 and over is cost-effective (the benefits outweigh the administration costs), while for the at-risk group this could be extended to those over 65. When the vaccine cost is included, the cost-effective ages reduce, such that at a total cost of {pound}30 (for vaccine and administration) universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 75; while at {pound}60 universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 80.

InterpretationThe historic offer of COVID-19 vaccination to those 65 and over for the autumn 2023 programme and those over 75 for the spring 2023 programme, aligns with our cost-effective threshold for pre-purchased vaccine when the only cost was administration. However, for future programmes, when vaccine costs are included, the age-thresholds slowly increase thereby demonstrating the continued importance of protecting the eldest and most vulnerable in the population.","NA","medrxiv",1733868603699
