In contrast, using within-family variation in DNA sharing is robust to most confounding factors including shared environmental effects and population stratification. Yet, accurate estimates for most traits are not available using this design, and none for non-European ancestry populations. Here, we analyse approximately 500,000 sibling pairs with diverse ancestries and obtain robust and precise heritability estimates for 14 phenotypes, including two well-studied model traits (height and BMI), five behavioural phenotypes and two common diseases. We find substantial heritability for smoking initiation (0.34, standard error (s.e.) 0.05), alcohol consumption (0.18, s.e. 0.04), number of children (0.27, s.e. 0.11) and personality (""talk versus listen"", 0.48, s.e. 0.13). In addition, we estimated large heritability for two common diseases, type 2 diabetes (T2D: 0.43, s.e. 0.06) and asthma (0.34, s.e. 0.06), whose risk factors include behavioural traits. Overall, we show concordant estimates across ancestry groups and highlight a significant contribution of shared environmental effects for behaviour and T2D risk, which may have inflated between-family estimates. Altogether, our results demonstrate that substantial genetic variation underlies complex traits, common disease and exposures, that estimates are concordant across ancestries and that they are larger than has been accounted for by GWAS to date.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758492546400

Here, we show that an increase in mechanical loading induces muscle fiber growth through two distinct mechanisms. Radial growth, reflected by an increase in fiber cross-sectional area, is mediated through an mTORC1-dependent signaling pathway, whereas longitudinal growth, marked by the in-series addition of sarcomeres, is mediated through an mTORC1-independent signaling pathway. To gain further insight into the events that drive longitudinal growth, we combined BONCAT-based labeling of newly synthesized proteins with high-resolution imaging and determined that the in-series addition of sarcomeres is mediated by a process that involves transverse splitting at the Z-lines of pre-existing sarcomeres. Collectively, our findings not only challenge the long-standing view that mechanically induced growth is uniformly governed by mTORC1, but they also lay the framework for a new understanding of the molecular and structural events that drive this process.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AR082816;R01AR074932;R56AR057347;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

While culture systems for chicken PGCs have been well established for nearly two decades, efforts to propagate PGCs from other avian species have proved exceptionally challenging, limiting the broader application of artificial reproductive technologies in birds. Here we report the first successful derivation and long-term culture of PGCs from the rock dove, or common pigeon (Columba livia). Guided by transcriptomic profiling of PGCs, we developed a species-specific medium that supports PGC maintenance and expansion. We identify insulin signaling as essential for survival and demonstrate that retinoic acid receptor inhibition, while maintaining vitamin A, is necessary for propagation. Supplementation with BMP4, LIF, GDNF, and pleiotrophin further enhances PGC proliferation. Cultured cells express canonical germline markers and migrate to the gonads following injection into both rock dove and chicken embryos, confirming functional competency. These findings establish a platform for germline manipulation and biobanking in Columbidae, broadening the applicability of reproductive technologies to conservation efforts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

However, the robustness of this control strategy across the wide genetic diversity of DENV remains unknown. Here, we systematically tested two commonly used Wolbachia strains (wAlbB and wMelM) for their ability to inhibit 60 genetically diverse DENV isolates spanning all four serotypes. We found stronger inhibition by wMelM (median relative dissemination: 0.04) than wAlbB (median relative dissemination: 0.19). Furthermore, while we found substantial heterogeneity in inhibition across DENV isolates, we found that more DENV-3 isolates were weakly inhibited (median relative dissemination: 0.47 for wAlbB and 0.39 for wMelM) compared to the other serotypes (median relative disseminations: 0.10-0.18 for wAlbB and 0-0.11 for wMelM). Using transmission dynamic models, we further showed that differential Wolbachia inhibition results in increased probability of reemergence, particularly in high transmission intensity settings, with strong selection for DENV strains that have higher relative dissemination in mosquitoes. Our work highlights the importance of considering DENV genetic diversity, including the long-term risk of selection, in Wolbachia-based control interventions.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

Whether chromatin assembly on newly replicated strands is also asymmetric remains unknown, as visualizing this short-lived state in cells is impossible. To circumvent this limitation, we combine in vitro reconstitution of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA and chromatin replication machineries with replication-aware single-molecule chromatin footprinting, to study how chromatin is re-assembled on replicated DNA. Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid. These pathways have implications for essential chromatin-templated processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and gene silencing at replication forks.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""851564;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04jsz6e67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Vidi.233.038;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2-HG012442;""},{""name"":""W.

Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we show that L-type pyocins bind a surface-exposed region of BamA and deploy a C-terminal peptide that competitively inhibits the BAM complex, demonstrating that cell entry is not required for antibiotic activity. We combine genetics, multi-omics and cryo-electron tomography to show that BAM complex inhibition by L-type pyocins or the peptide antibiotic darobactin triggers a multifaceted transcriptomic, proteomic and morphological response. Despite this, BAM inhibition ultimately leads to a catastrophic loss of membrane integrity and cell death.

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

To this end, large-scale CRISPR screens have been conducted to perturb thousands of candidate enhancers. Using these data, predictive models have been developed that aim to generalize such findings to predict which enhancers regulate which genes across the genome. However, existing CRISPR methods and large-scale datasets have limitations in power, scale, or selection bias, with the potential to skew our understanding of the properties of distal regulatory elements and confound our ability to evaluate predictive models. Here, we develop a new framework for highly powered, unbiased CRISPR screens, including an optimized experimental method (Direct-Capture Targeted Perturb-seq (DC-TAP-seq)), a random design strategy, and a comprehensive analytical pipeline that accounts for statistical power. We applied this framework to survey 1,425 randomly selected candidate regulatory elements across two human cell lines. Our results reveal fundamental properties of distal regulatory elements in the human genome. Most element-gene regulatory interactions are estimated to have small effect sizes (<10%), which previous experiments were not powered to detect. Most cis-regulatory interactions occur over short genomic distances (<100 kb). A large fraction of the discovered regulatory elements bind CTCF but do not show chromatin marks typical of classical enhancers. Housekeeping genes have similar frequencies of distal regulatory elements compared to other genes, but with 2-fold weaker effect sizes. Comparisons to the predictions of the ENCODE-rE2G model suggest that, while performance is similar across two cell types, new models will be needed to detect elements with weaker effect sizes, regulatory effects of CTCF sites, and enhancers for housekeeping genes. Overall, this study describes the first unbiased, perturbation-based survey of thousands of distal regulatory element-gene connections, and provides a framework for expanding such efforts to build more complete maps of distal regulation in the human genome.","[{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Genomic Mechanisms of Disease"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF21SA0072102;""},{""name"":""NHGRI Impact of Genomic Variation on Consortium"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UM1HG011972;""},{""name"":""NHLBI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HL159176;""},{""name"":""NHGRI Genomic Innovator Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35HG011324;""},{""name"":""NSF Graduate Research Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DGE-1656518;""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG011664;""},{""name"":""AHA Postdoctoral Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""821920 and 23POSTCHF1019753;""},{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DMS-2113072 and NSF DMS-2310654.;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

Our approach enables MSI data acquisition directly from EM grids that were previously analyzed using cryo-ET, and allows unambiguous identification and classification of cell species and type. The method can be used on any eukaryotic single-cell cryo-ET sample without prior modification and takes less than 36 h for the entire workflow per grid, with significant potential for parallelization. We anticipate that this approach will transform the way that structural biologists approach cellular heterogeneity in cryo-ET, as cells can be identified and classified reliably post acquisition.","[{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALT 836-2020;""},{""name"":""Peter und Traudl Engelhorn Stiftung"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Max Planck Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01hhn8329"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

Yet it remains a major bottleneck, as the current gold standard relies on manual counting by multiple blinded observers. This process is slow, labor intensive, and prone to variability. While some software can measure total neurite length, they aren't made to specifically measure new growth in complicated images from real-life injury models, like the thoracic crush and pyramidotomy model. Existing software can measure total neurite length in culture, but it is not designed to capture new growth in complex images from injury models, such as thoracic crush or pyramidotomy. Crucially, these tools lack the ability to selectively analyze growth within user-defined regions, a key requirement for injury paradigms. To address this need, we developed the Deep Neurite Analysis Tool (DeNAT), an accessible deep-learning based platform that automatically measures neurite outgrowth after injury. DeNAT allows users to define regions of interest to specifically quantify sprouting in images from common spinal cord injury paradigms. We benchmarked its performance against manual scoring and conventional automated approaches. DeNAT achieved 87 percent accuracy in detecting neurite sprouts relative to manual counts, while reducing variability and labor. By combining user-guided region selection with automated deep learning analysis, DeNAT offers an accurate, reproducible, and efficient solution for measuring neurite outgrowth in injury models.","[{""name"":""Council of Scientific and Industrial Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021wm7p51"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Department of Biotechnology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03tjsyq23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Science and Engineering Research Board"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03ffdsr55"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

Objectives: We characterized airway and circulating immune cells in patients with and without PLC. Methods: Participants were recruited and allocated into two groups: 1) PLC, defined by a St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score of >10 at least three months following an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection with self-reported new or worsening symptoms, and 2) controls, defined by SGRQ =<10 with or without a prior history of COVID. We performed research bronchoscopy and obtained bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in seven PLC patients and seven age- and sex-matched control subjects. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) was performed on the BAL cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cryopreserved in 30 participants (17 PLC, 13 controls) for proteomic analysis. Serum was submitted for microarray detection of auto-IgG antibodies. Methods: We annotated 105,836 cells using scRNAseq and found that CD4+ T-cells were credibly increased in participants with PLC. scRNAseq also revealed up-regulation of anti-viral pathways including those related to interferon signaling in T-cells as well as antigen presenting cells. In PBMCs, T-cells expressing both CD4 and CD8 were elevated in PLC participants. Autoantibodies targeting genomic DNA, collagen II, and TIF-gamma were significantly increased in PLC patients. Conclusions: PLC is associated with dysregulation of T-cell mediated immunity, which may be related to autoimmunity. These cells represent potential novel therapeutic targets in patients suffering from PLC.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758492546400

PKD patients exhibit significant heterogeneity in disease progression, largely due to genetic and environmental modifiers. Like patients, mouse models of PKD also exhibit significant heterogeneity with regards to the gene mutated, age of disease onset, and rate of disease progression. To elucidate the cellular and molecular consequences of these variables, we constructed an integrated single-cell and spatial transcriptomics atlas across mouse models of PKD, mapping changes in cell type composition, gene expression, and intercellular signaling networks across the whole atlas and within individual models. Consistently across models, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data revealed increased Spp1 (osteopontin) expression and signaling from PKD-enriched clusters to Ly6clo monocytes. Global deletion of Spp1 in Pkd1RC/RC mice resulted in reduced cyst severity, improved kidney function, and reduced Ly6clo monocyte numbers, suggesting that SPP1 signaling to Ly6clo monocytes promotes PKD progression. We also created a freely available, searchable website (https://bmblx.bmi.osumc.edu/scPKD/) that can be used to identify cross- and intra-model specific changes in gene expression, guiding researchers to new therapeutic targets for treating PKD.","[{""name"":""Polycystic Kidney Disease Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05g0xkn45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""826369;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K01DK119375;R01DK115752;R01DK129255-01A1;1R21DK140693-01;P30-DK079337;P30-AR048311;P30-AI27667;1S10OD028479-01;""},{""name"":""Presbyterian Health Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01nbasn20"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Seed grant;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""220895/Z/20/Z;314710/Z/24/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

Unexpectedly, cells are extremely sensitive to RPB1 dosage, with a mere 30% reduction sufficient to perturb cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and global transcription. Importantly, alterations in RPB1 abundance trigger hierarchical gene expression changes that are highly organized rather than stochastic.

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

While sex chromosome aneuploidies are well-tolerated due to dedicated allelic dosage compensation mechanisms, the existence of similar regulatory processes for autosomes remains debated. Here, we investigate transcriptional responses to autosomal aneuploidies and find evidence for global dosage compensation across aneuploid chromosomes. Using high-sensitivity, allele-resolved single-cell RNA-seq on monoclonal cell expansions with varying ploidies and degrees of autosomal aneuploidy, we uncover consistent transcriptional compensation upon chromosome losses via increased burst frequency from the remaining allele. This operates in a region-specific manner across both complete and segmental aneuploidies, revealing a previously underappreciated flexibility of dosage response. Complementary proteomics analyses demonstrate additional dosage buffering at the protein level, resulting in near-stoichiometric rebalancing across autosomal aneuploid chromosomes. Analyses of cancer transcriptomes confirms that compensatory mechanisms are active in primary tumours. Our findings reveal extensive dosage compensation as a genome-wide, dynamic, response to gene product imbalance. This mechanism extends beyond sex chromosomes, supports transcriptional homeostasis, and represents a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved mode of transcriptional regulation active across species and in aneuploid cancer cells.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

Whether individuals with comorbidities experience a greater functional impact of long COVID is unknown. We evaluated the functional impact of long COVID among healthcare workers (HCWs) with chronic cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, obesity, or a history of depression, and compared it with that of HCWs without comorbidities. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in Quebec, Canada. We compared self-reported long COVID cases to COVID-19-infected controls without long COVID on work ability, work functioning, health-related absenteeism, dyspnea-associated impairment, and psychological distress. We used inverse probability of exposure and robust Poisson regressions to estimate adjusted prevalence differences (aPD) and prevalence ratios. Comorbidity data were obtained from the Quebec integrated chronic disease surveillance system. Results: A total of 3,754 and 8,439 HCWs with and without comorbidities, respectively, were included. Among HCWs with comorbidities, long COVID was associated with lower work ability, lower work functioning, more health-related long-term absenteeism, more dyspnea-associated impairment, and higher psychological distress (aPDs between 8% (95%CI: 5%-11%) for long-term absenteeism and 27% (95%CI: 22%-31%) for low work functioning). aPDs were greater among HCWs with comorbidities than among those without for low work ability (p=0.01 for interaction), for low work functioning (p=0.03), and for dyspnea-associated impairment (p<0.01).

While behavior in sequential decision-making tasks often reflects a mixture of both, the neural basis of individual differences in their expression remains unclear. To investigate this, we conducted a large-scale fMRI study with 179 participants performing a variant of the two-step task. Using both cluster-defined subgroups and computational parameter estimates, we found that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex encodes model-based and model-free value signals differently depending on individual strategy use. Model-based value signals were strongly linked to the degree of model-based behavioral reliance, whereas model-free signals appeared regardless of model-free behavioral influence. Leveraging the large sample, we also addressed a longstanding debate about whether model-based knowledge is incorporated into reward prediction errors or if such signals are purely model-free. Surprisingly, ventral striatum prediction error activity was better explained by model-based computations, while a middle caudate error signal was more aligned with model-free learning. Moreover, individuals lacking both model-based behavior and model-based neural signals exhibited impaired state prediction errors, suggesting a difficulty in building or updating their internal model of the environment. These findings indicate that model-free signals are ubiquitous across individuals, even in those not behaviorally relying on model-free strategies, while model-based representations appear only in those individuals utilizing such a strategy at the behavioral level, the absence of which may depend in part on underlying difficulties in forming accurate model-based predictions.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01MH121089;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

Conversely, slice selection using ZOnally-magnified Oblique Multi-slice (ZOOM) (i.e. tilting the excitation relative to the refocusing RF-pulse) is an alternative for reducing FOV while shortening TE. We hypothesized that ZOOM, with appropriate choices for the RF-pulse tilt angle and thickness, can be reliably used as an alternative to ZOOMit for cardiac Diffusion Tensor Imaging (cDTI). Methods: We scanned phantoms using full FOV and ZOOM with various parameters chosen from a 2-dimensional grid of angles and thicknesses. We identified a subset of 5 ZOOM parameters for in vivo cDTI experiments. We performed cDTI on healthy volunteers on a Siemens Prisma (6 subjects) and a Connectom (6 subjects) MR system using the 5 identified ZOOM settings, as well as ZOOMit (Prisma only) and no ZOOM (Connectom only). We compared mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), and secondary eigenvector angle (|E2A|) between scans. Results: Average MD, and standard deviation of MD and FA, were significantly reduced by ZOOM compared to no ZOOM on Connectom. We found no significant differences in any averaged diffusion measures between ZOOMit and ZOOM on Prisma. Conclusion: Combining ZOOM with cardiac diffusion weighted imaging allows for TE to be considerably shortened (from 79ms to 67ms) while reducing FOV to avoid aliasing artifacts.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219536/Z/19/Z;096646/Z/11/Z;104943/Z/14/Z;""},{""name"":""EPSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""British Heart Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02wdwnk04"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PG/19/1/34076;""},{""name"":""Swedish Cancer Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0527jb766"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""22 0592 JIA;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/W031566/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

Predictive models, called epigenetic clocks, are being built across the tree of life, including humans, other mammals and vertebrates and, recently, invertebrates. However, it always involves cross-fertilizing organisms, thus presenting a high level of genetic diversity. To decipher the exact role of epigenetics in adaptation and evolution, distinguishing true epigenetic variation from changes that reflect genetic variation is essential. Results: Here, we used the mangrove rivulus, the only self-fertilizing vertebrate, to study epigenetic aging in the brain and construct an epigenetic clock. We generated a reduced representation bisulfite sequencing dataset of 90 brain tissues from individuals aged 60-1100 days to construct a highly accurate age predictor using 40 CpG sites (R squared > 0.96, mean absolute error of 28.7 days). We associated the CpG sites with their respective closest genes and explored their biological functions. Genes relevant to aging include lamin-A (responsible for several age-related processes), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (whose absence causes premature aging) and several genes associated with Alzheimer's disease identified in human studies. We also propose several methods to improve classic epigenetic clock regression. Conclusions: This study is the first construction of an epigenetic clock in a self-fertilizing species, demonstrating that DNA methylation patterns undergo consistent changes across the lifespan of isogenic individuals. These findings emphasize putative changes in DNA methylation related to functional changes across aging in the brain.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

For example, someone talking about their hand is not referring to the other speakers hand, but the word hand still carries speaker-general information (e.g., having five fingers). These two requirements impose a cross-speaker generalization / differentiation dilemma that is not well addressed by existing theories. We hypothesized that the brain resolves the dilemma by use of a vectorial semantic code that blends collinear and orthogonal coding subspaces. To test this hypothesis, we examined semantic encoding in populations of hippocampal single neurons recorded during conversations between epilepsy patients and healthy partners in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU). We found clear semantic encoding for both spoken and heard words, with strongest encoding just around the time of utterance for production, and just after it for reception. Crucially, hippocampal neurons codes for word meaning were poised between orthogonalized and collinearized. Moreover, different semantic categories were orthogonalized to different degrees; body parts and names were most differentiated between speakers; function words and verbs were least differentiated. Finally, the hippocampus used the same coding principle to separate different partners in three-person conversations, with greater orthogonalization between self and other than between two others. Together, these results suggest a new solution to the problem of binding word meanings with speaker identity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

Reconstruction of metastatic phylogenies in mouse models and patients suggests that LN and distant organ metastases are often seeded by independent clones, yet no genetic alterations have bene found to account for this divergent seeding. Here, we discover opposing roles for interferon signaling in metastasis to LNs and distant organs. We uncover that exposure to leukocyte-derived type I interferon promotes LN metastasis while impairing spread to distant organs by inducing interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Further, while LN metastases have previously been demonstrated to disrupt anti-tumor immunity, we find that ISG expression induced during LN metastasis sensitizes tumors to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). By mimicking the phenotype of LN metastases through delivery of type I interferon, ICB refractory primary tumors and distant metastases can be sensitized to ICB. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the immune system conditions tumors for LN metastasis through type I interferon secretion while impairing distant spread and that this axis can be exploited to render immunotherapy resistant tumors sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""S10RR025518-01;DP2 AI177915;R01 AI51321;F31 CA301857;""},{""name"":""Stanford Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/014qe3j22"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""The Mark Foundation for Cancer Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00v7th354"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0184qbg02"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

These interactions require the plant to distinguish beneficial from pathogenic organisms and trigger the plant's innate immune system. We identified mutants in the Medicago truncatula SOBIR1 gene, known to be involved in innate immune response in multiple plants. We examined nodulation with multiple strains and species of Sinorhizobium and examined mycorrhizal interactions with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus versiforme (recently renamed Diversispora epigaea). Plants containing mutations in SOBIR1 exhibit normal nodulation with strains of S. meliloti, but fewer nodules when inoculated with S. medicae strains. The S. medicae nodules show evidence of accumulation of polyphenolic compounds, and abnormal arrangement of the rhizobia within the nodules. In contrast, when inoculated with Glomus versiforme. M. truncatula sobir1 mutant plants have increased mycorrhizal colonization and arbuscule number compared to the wild type. We localized a tagged SOBIR1 protein to the periarbuscular membrane interface.

To address this knowledge gap, we integrated phylogenetic, transcriptomic, and genome-wide in vitro binding strategies with quantitative shoot architecture phenotyping of a panel of cucumber TILLING mutants of each CsPLT homolog. We determined that CsPLT3/7 and CsPLT are expressed in complementary domains in the cucumber shoot apex. DAP-seq data indicated that both transcription factors recognised an ANT-like consensus motif and bound to SAM organising genes. We identified strong phenotypic defects in multiple Csplt3/7 mutants. In mature seeds, Csplt3/7 mutants formed a flat apex instead of a shoot apical meristem, from which secondary meristems emerged during subsequent seedling development. Mature Csplt3/7 shoots exhibited defects in internode length regularity, stem architecture, flower morphology, and axillary organ initiation. Moreover, phyllotactic patterns were slightly shifted from a spiral towards a distichous orientation.

Determining these networks is crucial in understanding how gene dysregulation can lead to phenotypic variation and perturbation responses. We present a novel biophysically-motivated neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) model framework with a biologically interpretable deep learning architecture that leverages dynamic single-cell data: in-CAHOOTTS (gene regulatory network Inference with Context Aware Hybrid neural-ODEs on Transcriptional Time-series Systems). Our approach combines accurate prediction with mechanistic interpretability, decomposing gene expression dynamics into fundamental biophysical processes (mRNA transcription and degradation) while inferring regulatory network structure. We validate in-CAHOOTTS by learning the Saccharomyces cerevisiae response to rapamycin treatment, and learning the dynamic cell cycle progression. The trained model accurately predicts gene expression trajectories and identifies biologically relevant rapamycin response regulators. The framework achieves stable long-term predictions with time frames extending 30x beyond training data, maintaining realistic oscillatory dynamics for over 40 hours in cell cycle modeling, demonstrating that neural ODEs can capture true biological attractors rather than merely fitting data. We argue that interpretable neural ODEs can successfully model complex biological dynamics while revealing mechanistic insights essential for understanding living systems. By bridging extensible machine learning frameworks and mechanistic biology, in-CAHOOTTS represents a significant advance toward deep learning systems that both predict biological outcomes and explain the mechanisms driving them.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

Heterologous expression in E. coli confirms that LjMLO4 facilitates Ca2+ transport, while genetic and physiological assays demonstrate its contribution to LjRALF34-triggered root growth responses and Ca2+ signalling.

Outcomes were new diagnoses of dyslipidaemia, defined by laboratory thresholds for total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol, and abnormal BMI (BMI-for-age [&ge;]95th percentile at ages 2-19 years or BMI [&ge;]30 kg/m2 at ages 19-21 years). Adjusted relative risks (aRRs) were estimated using propensity score-stratified Poisson regression. Sensitivity analyses included empirical calibration with negative control outcomes and stratification by baseline obesity. Interpretation: Children and adolescents with documented COVID-19 were associated with higher risks of new-onset dyslipidaemia and abnormal BMI in the post-acute period compared with COVID-19-negative peers. Associations were consistent across lipid fractions, remained after empirical calibration, and were similar after accounting for baseline obesity.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758492546400

Availability of large scale longitudinal MRI datasets enables us to probe brain changes in health and disease, and derive longitudinal trajectories of brain morphometry based measures to estimate brain atrophy and other disease-related abnormalities. In contrast to their cross-sectional counterparts, image processing pipelines that have been designed for longitudinal data can reduce noise in the derived measurements by disentangling the within and between subject variabilities, improving the sensitivity of the downstream models in detecting more subtle longitudinal changes. Here we present PELICAN, our open source multi-contrast longitudinal image processing pipeline, that has been designed and extensively validated for use in longitudinal settings and populations with neurodegenerative disorders. PELICAN can use population specific average templates as intermediate targets to derive accurate nonlinear registrations for cases with substantial levels of atrophy, which commonly used pipelines struggle to process. We evaluated PELICAN's performance across over 34,000 MRIs from multiple aging and neurodegenerative disorder cohorts, and compared its reliability and failure rates against FreeSurfer as a widely used image processing tool, showing superior performance of PELICAN compared to FreeSurfer, both in terms of failure rate and reliability. Our results demonstrate that PELICAN can be used to accurately process MRIs of individuals with neurodegenerative disease who present with greater levels of atrophy and white matter lesion burden.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

In this study we aimed to discover genetic mechanisms underlying fibromyalgia. We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of fibromyalgia in subjects of European (EUR), African (AFR) and Latin American (AMR) ancestries, combining data from several samples (total N, 85,139 cases; 1,642,433 controls). We also conducted a multi-trait analysis of GWAS (MTAG), leveraging pain summary statistics to achieve enhanced power for fibromyalgia analyses. We then applied a series of post-GWAS methods to analyze the genetic association between fibromyalgia and a variety of psychological and physiological phenotypes. We found 10 genome-wide significant (GWS) loci associated with fibromyalgia in EUR, 1 in AFR, 12 cross-ancestry, and 45 in the EUR MTAG. Most of these loci were previously associated with pain, cognitive function, autoimmune response, or general health measures like BMI and blood pressure. Genetic correlation analysis revealed a moderate negative correlation with physical activity, and strong genetic correlations with chronic pain, PTSD and depression (rg [&ge;] 0.69). Genomic structural equation modeling helped to place fibromyalgia in the context of a set of psychiatric, medical, and lifestyle traits. Additional findings regarding local genetic correlations and genetic causality point to genetic mechanisms that provide a strong basis for some of the main characteristics of fibromyalgia and its comorbidities.

Seed phenotyping in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana poses a significant challenge due to the large number of tiny seeds produced by individual plants, which are difficult to manually separate and count. Manual counting methods are time-consuming and prone to user bias, particularly for subtle phenotypic changes. To address these limitations, we developed Samplify, a scalable, automated pipeline for seed segmentation and classification. By integrating classical image processing techniques with Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM), Samplify effectively segments Arabidopsis seeds, even in dense clusters where conventional methods fail. To demonstrate its versatility, we quantified the seed abortion occurring in interploidy crossings in Arabidopsis, often referred to as ""triploid block"". Samplify includes a Random Forest classifier trained on a set of computed seed shape features that enables the categorization of seeds into normal, partially aborted, and fully aborted seeds, automating the manual classification process. The tool, designed as a command-line application, significantly reduces manual annotation workload. Our validation across multiple datasets demonstrates high segmentation and classification reliability, making Samplify a valuable resource for the plant research community.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

Understanding genomic adaptations during antimicrobial therapy in patients infected with this pathogen is crucial for preventing therapeutic failure. Here we investigated the population diversity and evolution of P. aeruginosa collected longitudinally from six patients who evolved MDR infections. Serial P. aeruginosa clinical isolates (n=63) and culture-enriched metagenomic populations (n=39) were collected and subjected to whole-genome sequencing. The resulting data were used to characterize and compare the species composition, multi-locus sequence types (STs), and resistance-associated mutations present within each sample type. Single-isolate sequencing showed that each patient was infected with a single P. aeruginosa strain that accumulated mutations and became increasingly antibiotic-resistant over time. Mutations in genes associated with {beta}-lactam resistance, including ampC, ftsI, and oprD, arose over time and corresponded with changes in antimicrobial susceptibility in single isolates. Species profiling of culture-enriched metagenomic populations revealed that all samples contained P. aeruginosa, but several also contained additional Gram-negative pathogens. Metagenomic analysis of culture-enriched populations identified resistance-associated mutations at variable frequencies, many of which were not identified in single isolates from the same sample. In some cases, resistance-associated mutations initially detected at low frequency rose to fixation after antimicrobial treatment. Overall, this study shows that population-based metagenomic sequencing effectively captures within-patient genomic diversity of P. aeruginosa during antimicrobial therapy, and could aid in the detection and interpretation of resistance-associated mutations in this pathogen.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

Quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa is a model to study cooperative behaviors in populations. Several studies of cooperation have been conducted using strain PAO1. Wildtype PAO1 harbors a mutation in mexS, which encodes a negative regulator of the transcription factor MexT, which in turn activates many genes, including the efflux pump MexEF-OprN. We hypothesized that the PAO1 mexS mutation might affect cooperative behaviors. When P. aeruginosa is passaged daily on casein as a sole carbon source, quorum sensing is required to induce synthesis of the extracellular proteases needed to acquire carbon and energy. During growth on casein, individuals with inactivating mutations in the quorum sensing regulator LasR are reproducibly enriched in the population. These LasR mutants are cheaters that benefit from cooperatively-produced proteases and have a fitness advantage over cooperators. We passaged wildtype PAO1, PAO1 with a gene-corrected version of mexS, or PAO1 with a null mutation of mexT on casein as the sole carbon and energy source. We found that correcting the mexS mutation resulted in unstable cooperation: bacterial cultures failed to propagate after about 15 days, whereas the wildtype propagated for the duration of our 30-day experiment. The MexS-corrected and MexT-deficient populations also reproducibly exhibited emergence of a particular quorum sensing variant, LasR-V226I. This variant activated a subset of quorum-sensing regulated genes, suggesting an evolutionary pathway to alter P. aeruginosa quorum sensing regulons.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 GM152107;R35 GM136218;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/043z4tv69"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 AI177575;""},{""name"":""Cystic Fibrosis Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00ax59295"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""KOSTYL20G0;""},{""name"":""Gilead Sciences (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/056546b03"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""A161091;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

Although ""correlation does not imply causation"" has become a cliche, leveraging correlations effectively--and understanding their inferential pitfalls--remains a nuanced challenge. Correlation-based analyses are typically not able to yield causal conclusions, yet they are frequently used to underpin causal narratives in neuroscience research and especially in clinical contexts, which represent a problematic case of overinterpretation. Using causal inference reasoning, simulations and analytic methods, we address three critical questions when performing resting-state fMRI: (1) How reliable are correlation estimates for capturing cross-regional synchrony? (2) What are the consequences of inaccuracies in estimated correlations? (3) To what extent do estimated correlations reflect causal neural interactions? We identify two principal pitfalls. First, correlation estimates are systematically distorted by diverse noise sources, including variability in neurovascular coupling, which can generate spurious, suppressed, or even reversed effects. Second, graph-based approaches lack causal interpretability, meaning that even large samples and strong statistical evidence may obscure fundamental ambiguities in what the correlations represent. In light of these challenges, we advocate for three priorities: (1) cautious interpretation that avoids causal overreach, (2) multimodal validation to cross-check findings against independent measures, and (3) enhanced methodological rigor, particularly in biomarker discovery and clinical trials, to ensure that resting-state fMRI provides meaningful insights.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ZICMH002888;ZIAMH002783;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

However, it remains unclear how the nutrients released during cell lysis affect the growth dynamics of the remaining bacterial population. Addressing this gap, we built a controlled system consisting of two Escherichia coli lysogenic strains: one carrying a wild-type {lambda} prophage and the other a temperature-inducible variant that can be induced to lyse at 38 {degrees}C. Using this system, we selectively induced phage lysis in a defined fraction of the population and quantified both total biomass and the biomass of surviving, non-lysed cells. We observed that the biomass loss was consistently smaller than expected based on the fraction of lysed cells, supporting the idea that some of the released biomass is rapidly recycled by the non-lysed population. To formalize the observed dynamics and obtain quantitative insight, we developed a mathematical model showing that nutrients released during lysis can transiently enhance the growth rate of the surviving, non-lysed cells. This effect emerges on a short timescale of minutes, consistent with the rapid onset of biomass compensation observed experimentally. The growth rate increase was confirmed in single-cell experiments using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, where we cultured wild-type lysogens in lysate-containing culture supernatants. In summary, the results suggest that nutrients released through lysis are rapidly consumed, leading to an acceleration in the growth rate of non-lysed cells. The consequent partial compensation for cell loss can substantially influence the population dynamics, highlighting phage lysis as a direct modulator of bacterial growth. Overall, our findings provide quantitative insights into how phage-mediated lysis affects the physiology of non-lysed bacterial cells, extending beyond its well-established role in biomass recycling.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""180575;225148;188642;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

In this study, we explore the nature of genomic divergence between two sympatric marine stickleback ecotypes from Atlantic Canada, ""whites"" and ""commons"". Males of each ecotype exhibit distinct nuptial colorations, nesting habits, and parental care strategies. Using population genomic analyses of SNPs and copy number variants (CNVs; deletions and duplications) we show that whites and commons consistently form distinct populations. We uncover genomic differentiation in the white ecotype characteristic of an incipient species, showing extremely low genome-wide differentiation (FST) and very recent divergence (~1 kya). Demographic analysis detected very low levels of ongoing gene flow between populations. Our results and prior genomic studies suggest that reproductive isolation is being maintained between ecotypes despite recent evidence that hybridization in nature does occur. Contrary to other systems, we found many small, but dispersed regions of high differentiation throughout the genome rather than explicitly within chromosomal inversions or the sex chromosomes. On chromosomes VII and XVI, we identified CNVs overlapping genes enriched for olfaction, which may play a role in differences in reproductive strategies between ecotypes. Ultimately, our results demonstrate that genome-wide rather than localized differences can underlie the early stages of divergence, and that this pattern is corroborated by both SNPs and CNVs.","[{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""214459;""},{""name"":""NIGMS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R35GM139597;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

The worldwide pest Drosophila suzukii, which oviposits in ripe rather than overripe fruits, provides a powerful model to study these mechanisms and their behavioral consequences. Here, we show that this shift is linked to functional remodeling in four olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs): ab2B, ab3A, ab4B, and ab10A. While ab3A and ab10A exhibit tuning changes shared with the non-pest relative D. biarmipes, ab2B and ab4B display species-specific adaptations in D. suzukii. These changes result not only from receptor sequence divergence but also from novel innovations: receptor co-expression in ab3A and partitioned expression of Or67a paralogs in ab2B and ab10A. Together, these findings show how genomic plasticity in chemosensory gene families enables rapid sensory adaptation and niche transition.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04mhx6838"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K01DC020145;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

It is crucial to develop efficient data structures and computational methods that handle sequencing information. These challenges impact bioinformatics studies, including de novo genome assembly which serves as the foundation of genomics. Issues like read errors or limitations of heuristic decisions in assembly algorithms lead to genome misassemblies and inaccurate genomic representations, compromising the quality of downstream analyses. Hence, de novo assemblies can benefit from misassembly detection and correction, to produce a more optimal assembly. Results: We present Stash, a novel hash-based data structure designed for storing and querying large sequencing data. For an input sequence, Stash uses sliding windows of spaced seed patterns to extract and hash k-mers. The hash values combined with the sequence ID determine the value stored in Stash. A filled Stash can be used to query whether two genomic regions are covered by the same set of reads. This can be used in genome misassembly detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Stash in detecting misassemblies in human genome assemblies generated by Flye and Shasta, using Pacbio HiFi reads from the human cell line NA24385. We observed that scaffolding Stash-cut assemblies reduces 7.6% and 3.4% of misassemblies in the Flye and Shasta assemblies, respectively. This is accomplished in 310 minutes utilizing 8 GB of memory. Stash is comparable to alternative long read misassembly correction methods and can result in superior assemblies compared to the baseline.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

However, the mechanisms underlying rearrangements of L1 retrotransposition intermediates are poorly understood. To address this gap, we developed GFP-based recombination reporter assays to study the formation of L1 retrotransposition-mediated rearrangements. Using these reporters combined with long-read sequencing approaches, we find that L1 retrotransposition intermediates can recombine with distal DNA breaks to generate chromosomal rearrangements. We also find that two distinct L1 insertion intermediates can recombine with each other to generate chromosomal rearrangements. Both types of rearrangements depend on L1-encoded ORF2p endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities. Using these reporters, we discover that L1 retrotransposition-mediated rearrangements are robustly induced when the recombining sequences share homology and that their formation requires the homologous recombination factor BRCA1. Given the repetitive nature of our genome, these findings highlight the risk of L1 insertion intermediates becoming substrates for aberrant recombination and promoting genome instability.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01CA240816;R01CA276112;R01CA289390;""},{""name"":""American Cancer Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02e463172"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""C.-T.L. is supported by an American Cancer Society Postdoctoral Fellowship Award;""},{""name"":""Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04yhme281"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""C.M.-D. is a fellow of The Jane Coffin Childs Fund for Medical Research;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3NS132127;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

We hypothesized that well-aerated soils would oxidize CH4, and the oxidation rate will increase with more organic matter.

Preventive therapies are lacking, and Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are a promising intervention due to their broad cardiometabolic benefits. Therefore, this study was designed to determine whether GLP-1 RA exposure is associated with reduced risk for developing PH. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Veterans Health Administration. Patients with diabetes and an echocardiogram without PH who initiated a GLP-1 RA or Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2021 were included in the study. We used the active comparator, new user design to emulate a pragmatic clinical trial and employed inverse probability weighting (IPW) to adjust for confounding. GLP-1 RA new users were compared to DPP-4i new users. Patients were followed from first prescription date (baseline) until PH diagnosis, death, or medication cessation (latest date April 30, 2022). The primary outcome was development of PH, defined by an echocardiographic estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 35 mmHg or greater. Results: We identified 4,109 GLP-1 RA users and 7,384 DPP-4i users without PH at baseline. In comparison to DPP4i users, GLP-1 RA users were younger (median [Q1-Q3], 69 [63-73] vs 70 [65-74]) and similar in sex distribution (94.6% vs 95.6% male). Unadjusted incidence rates of PH for GLP-1 RA compared to DPP-4i were 54.8 vs 69.7 cases per 1000 person-years. IPW achieved covariate balance between groups (all standardized mean differences <0.10). In Cox regression models on the IPW cohort, GLP-1 RA exposure compared to DPP-4i exposure was associated with a 28% reduced risk of developing PH (HR, 0.72; 95%CI 0.61-0.84). Reduced risk of PH associated with GLP-1 RA use was consistent across sensitivity and subgroup analyses, including when stratified by obesity and diabetes severity. Conclusions: GLP-1 RA use was associated with a reduced risk of developing PH. This finding supports the need for clinical trials and mechanistic studies to evaluate the potential role of GLP-1 RA therapy in the prevention of PH.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758492546400

In individuals living with obesity, adipose tissue (AT) enters a state of metabolic inertia, reducing its capacity to store excess lipids and promoting ectopic lipid accumulation in non-adipose tissues - thereby contributing to cardiometabolic complications. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate lipid storage and mobilization in adipocytes - and how these are disrupted in obesity - is critical for addressing these complications. Generalized lipodystrophy, the most severe form of primary adipocyte dysfunction, is caused in approximately 50% of cases by mutations in the BSCL2 gene encoding Seipin, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein essential for lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis and maintenance. Seipin also localizes to ER/mitochondria contact sites (MAM), where it regulates calcium exchange and mitochondrial function. This study aimed to determine whether Seipin s recruitment to MAM and ER/LD contact sites overlaps and to assess the consequences of Seipin dysfunction on membrane contact site (MCS) dynamics and adipocyte metabolism. Using in situ proximity ligation assays (PLA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we observed altered MCS involving the ER, LDs, and mitochondria in Seipin-deficient models. Functional assays revealed that Seipin knockdown impairs triglyceride transfer to LDs, an effect that was rescued by the MAM-reinforcing synthetic peptide, the Linker-ER-Mi. Further, we investigated how MCS remodeling influences adipocyte metabolic flexibility. Using TEM and PLA in both mouse AT and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, here, we show that lipid loading increases contacts involving the lipid droplet (LD), specifically ER/LD and mitochondria/LD (Mi/LD) contacts. However, lipid loading exerts opposite effects on MAM subtypes: oleic acid increases the MAM involving mitochondria in close contact with the LD, the MAM-LD, while decreasing the MAM involving cytosolic mitochondria, the classical MAM-CM contacts. Notably, this adaptive MCS remodeling was blunted in the AT of diet-induced obese mice. Genetic disruption of MCS in 3T3-L1 adipocytes led to altered lipid flux, impaired lipolysis, and reduced insulin signaling. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that MAM-LD contacts are central to adipocyte metabolic flexibility and lipid handling, and that their dysregulation in obesity may underlie the metabolic inflexibility characteristic of this condition.","[{""name"":""ANR"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-21-CE14-0024 MAMA;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

Here we directly tested whether the ""mismatch"" neural responses in sensory cortex are due to a spatial or a temporal internal model. We adopted two common paradigms to study predictive coding: one based on virtual-reality and one based on static images. After training mice with repeated visual stimulation for several days, we performed multiple manipulations, including: 1) we introduced a novel stimulus, 2) we replaced a stimulus with a novel gray wall, 3) we duplicated a trained stimulus, or 4) we altered the order of the stimuli. The first two manipulations induced a substantial mismatch response in neural populations of up to 20,000 neurons recorded across primary and higher-order visual cortex, while the third and fourth ones did not.

It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

Comparisons with external datasets showed that our Shanghai-based MAG catalog is representative of pet dogs worldwide (median read mapping of >90%). Moreover, we recovered circular extrachromosomal elements, including those linked to antimicrobial resistance, which were also detected in external dog gut datasets.

We modified an automated patch-clamp system with a multispectral light source and a custom light path to enable high-throughput electrophysiological measurements of opsin functional properties. Using this approach, we screened over 1,750 opsins from a range of families. We discovered that the F240A mutation of the light-gated potassium channel WiChR abolished potassium selectivity, turning it into a sensitive excitatory channel that we dubbed ""WAChR"". We systematically mutated WAChR and identified variants that expand the frontier of speed-sensitivity tradeoffs. Multiple WAChR variants produced large inward currents in response to indoor ambient office light, and responded to irradiances as low as 15 nW/mm2, something that we did not observe with other ultra-sensitive opsins. In vivo recording from the mouse cortex confirmed that WAChRs exhibit enhanced sensitivity in neurons. These ambient-light sensitive channels should be broadly useful for neuroscience research and vision restoration therapies.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546400

Although limited zoonotic cases have resulted from the current epizootic outbreak, the wide diversity of influenza viruses in avian hosts means the emergence of new strains that could transmit to humans more readily cannot be ruled out. There is therefore a need to anticipate zoonotic potential before spillover occurs.

Here, we develop a novel zoonotic prediction model for avian influenza viruses, building upon ""host-predictor"" machine learning methods that estimate host potential given only a viral genome sequence. We construct a machine learning framework combining individual sub-models of influenza genome segments, each trained on many genomic and proteomic traits (e.g., k-mer composition, codon biases, protein physicochemistry).

To prevent over-fitting to heavily sampled lineages and ensure models generalise to phylogenetically distant viruses, we pre-process training data by considering clusters of shared sequence identity. Curated training sets cover [~]4,000 representative, complete genome sequences of avian influenza from 120 subtypes including 9 containing known zoonotic viruses.

We combine best-performing models into a single ensemble that can distinguish zoonotic capability of sequences held out from training with strong performance (AUROC = 0.95, F1 score = 0.90), including sequences of rarely-sampled subtypes, e.g., H10N8. Interrogating ensemble model decisions also allows us to identify influential genomic motifs most associated with human infection.

These findings suggest specific genomic traits that are key to understanding and monitoring evolution of influenza viruses that circulate within bird populations. Our ensemble model can estimate zoonotic potential for new sequence inputs, offering a means to quickly risk-assess emerging avian influenza strains as soon as a sequence becomes available.","[{""name"":""Seqirus (United Kingdom)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022 – 2027 Framework Research Collaboration Agreement Influenza Research Partnership collaboration plan 002;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546401

While this bias is thought to reflect a right-hemisphere dominance when allocating spatial attention, the contribution of subcortical structures remains poorly understood. Although lesion and neuroimaging studies in clinical populations have implicated asymmetries in the basal ganglia and thalamus to dysfunction in spatial attention, it remains unclear whether naturally occurring subcortical asymmetries in healthy individuals predict behavioural biases in spatial attention. In this study, we investigated whether volumetric asymmetries in subcortical structures are associated with biases in spatial attention in a non-clinical population. This was achieved by using the landmark task to assess spatial biases, alongside acquiring T1-weighted MRI data from 44 healthy participants. The subcortical regions were segmented using the FIRST algorithm to estimate the volumetric asymmetry of specific regions. We found that variability in pseudoneglect was predicted by the degree of leftward lateralisation of putamen volume, indicating that the putamen contributes to the magnitude of spatial attention biases. This also suggests that the left putamen may support right-hemisphere neocortical dominance through the indirect pathway. These findings bridge anatomical and behavioural measures, highlighting the functional relevance of subcortical asymmetry in shaping attentional processes in the healthy brain. Our findings pave the way for early diagnosis of neurological disorders associated with subcortical atrophies including Parkinson's Disease and dementia.","[{""name"":""NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR203316;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""227420;203139/Z/16/Z;581203139/A/16/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546401

Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions. We envision that this method will further lower the molecular weight limit of single-particle cryo-EM, enabling its application to important drug-binding complexes that are below 50 kDa.","[{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546401

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) represent a promising solution to enhance risk stratification in intermediate-risk groups by identifying individuals with high genetic risk; however, observed differences in performance across ancestry groups may cause health disparities. The emerging field of algorithmic fairness offers a principled framework to assess equity in model performance among relevant subgroups, but have rarely been applied to clinical risk tools and PRS. Objectives: To evaluate the fairness of incorporating PRS in CVD risk prediction, both as a standalone risk factor and as a risk-enhancing factor for individuals at intermediate risk (recommended in current clinical consensus statements). Methods: Using data from the UK Biobank (N = 327,923), we calculated 10-year CVD risk using QRISK3 (a guideline-endorsed prediction model) and quantified genetic risk using a validated PRS. We assessed fairness among population characteristics relevant for health equity (age, sex, ethnicity, and area-level deprivation) using four algorithmic fairness metrics relevant for prevention (accuracy equality, equal opportunity, conditional use accuracy equality, and treatment equality). Results: PRS, when used as a stand-alone risk factor, demonstrated fairness levels similar to or better than traditional clinical predictors (age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol). Some variation in fairness was observed across ethnic groups, especially at extreme risk thresholds. When integrated as a risk-enhancing factor for reclassifying intermediate-risk individuals into high-risk categories, PRS improved sensitivity of CVD risk prediction with minimal impact on fairness metrics across demographic groups. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that PRS, when incorporated into existing risk prediction frameworks, are unlikely to meaningfully exacerbate disparities in CVD risk stratification. Applying algorithmic fairness metrics provides insight into the equitable implementation of PRS and supports current recommendations for their use in risk-stratification for intermediate-risk individuals.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758492546401

While mechanobiology has primarily focused on factors such as cell-generated contractility and mechanical properties of extracellular matrix (ECM), a novel mechanobiological paradigm highlights the role of osmotic and mechanical pressures in shaping epithelial tissues. In our study, we developed an in vitro model of cell coated micro-sized hydrogel spheres (MHSs) which allows to decipher the interplay between cellular activities and tissue mechanics. Drastic, isotropic MHS compressions were observed once the epithelia reached confluence. Further studies revealed that the compression was a process independent of cell contractility but rather regulated by active transepithelial fluid flow. Compressive stresses of about 7 kPa are generated by such an active hydraulic mechanism. Tissue homeostasis is then maintained by a fine balance between cell proliferation and extrusion. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of fluid transport in generating mechanical forces within epithelial tissues. Supported by a theoretical mechano-hydraulic model, a mechanistic framework for understanding the intricate interplay between cellular processes and tissue mechanics was established. These results challenge traditional views of epithelial tissue mechanics, emphasizing the pivotal influence of osmotic and mechanical pressures in shaping tissues. We anticipate that this study will advance the understanding of epithelial tissue development, the maintenance of homeostasis, and the mechanisms underlying pathological conditions.

Significance StatementEpithelial tissues are vital for many bodily functions, but their mechanics remain poorly understood. Our study uncovers a novel mechanism by which epithelial cells generate mechanical stress, not through traditional cell contractility, but by actively pumping ions and water across their membranes. Using a model of micro-sized hydrogel spheres (MHSs) coated with epithelial cells, we demonstrate that epithelial cells actively transport fluid across the tissue to compress the MHSs. This facilitates the establishment of tissue homeostasis, which is further maintained by a balanced cell proliferation and extrusion rate. Supported by a theoretical model, our findings highlight the overlooked role of fluid transport in tissue mechanics, offering new insights into how epithelial tissues develop, maintain stability, and respond to disease.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Adv-101019835;""},{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0071;DFG-ANR-22-CE92-0048;ANR-10-INBS-04;""},{""name"":""Institut National Du Cancer"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03m8vkq32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INCa_16712;INCa_18429;""},{""name"":""Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012kf4317"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Alexander von Humboldt Professorship;""},{""name"":""La Ligue Contre le Cancer"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rkrv905"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Equipe labellisee 2029;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546401

WGD is sensed indirectly due to the presence of extra centrosomes, which activate the PIDDosome to induce a p53-dependent G1-arrest. Here we uncouple WGD from centrosome amplification and show that p53 still arrests tetraploid cells, but via the mitotic stopwatch; a p53/53BP1/USP28-dependent pathway that causes G1-arrest following an extended mitotic delay. Mitotic timing is unaffected by WGD, but the threshold mitotic delay needed to invoke a G1-arrest is reduced. This sensitivity to the stopwatch mechanism is not associated with altered levels of mitotic stopwatch components, but instead, is associated with enhanced p21 concentrations prior to mitosis. Similar effects are observed in diploid cells treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors to double their size, implicating G1 delays and cell size as key determinants of stopwatch sensitivity. This ability of the mitotic stopwatch to arrest proliferation after increases to genome or cell size has important implications for the progression and treatment of cancer. It also demonstrates that the stopwatch pathway can sense more than just mitotic delays.","[{""name"":""Cancer Research UK"",""id"":""https://ror.org/054225q67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""C4730/A21229;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""222494/Z/21/Z;""},{""name"":""Tenovus Scotland"",""id"":""https://ror.org/037866t57"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T22-23;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546401

Understanding the evolutionary history of virulence elements requires genomes sampled in commensalism in healthy hosts, as genomes from bacterial infections are biased towards higher pathogenicity. Here, using a rare collection of human commensal Escherichia coli sampled in France from 1980 to 2020, we inferred the evolutionary history of the High Pathogenicity Island (HPI), a key virulence factor of E. coli with an uncertain evolutionary origin. We showed that the HPI was horizontally transferred from Yersinia pestis to E. coli and other Enterobacterales approximatively 4,800 years ago, coinciding with a period of high prevalence of the plague in the Neolithic. The element subsequently spread in the whole species and in Klebsiella pneumoniae, with signs of positive epistasis with phylogroups B2 and F, and was positively selected in the last 100 years. Our work sheds light on the history and mode of evolution of virulence in an important opportunistic pathogen. It suggests the Neolithic period may have favored not only the emergence of zoonotic pathogens but also gene transfer between bacterial species, enriching the gene repertoire of major pathogens with potentially important implications on public health nowadays.","[{""name"":""CNRS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Momemtum;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546401

While mechanistic investigations have uncovered many facets of GATA1 biology, how GATA1 co-regulates divergent cell fates remains only partially characterized. We previously described that loss of Stag2, a member of the cohesin complex and a recurrent mutational target in myelodysplastic syndrome and Down Syndrome associated acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, results in altered chromatin accessibility, transcription factor function, and cell differentiation. Hence, we hypothesized that chromatin accessibility facilitates lineage specificity of GATA1, thereby permitting efficient cellular differentiation. To understand the connection between chromatin accessibility and GATA1, we performed comprehensive studies of erythropoiesis in Stag2{triangleup} mice. Defects in Stag2-deficient hematopoiesis included reduced numbers of erythroid progenitors (EryPs), impaired terminal erythroid maturation, increased number of MkPs, and increased megakaryocytes. RNA- and ATAC-sequencing of EryPs revealed altered patterns of Gata1 target gene expression with altered accessibility in conjunction with loss of expression of erythroid targets and gain of megakaryocyte targets. Gata1 occupancy was lost at erythroid targets, while occupancy increased at megakaryocyte targets. Functionally, we observed that Stag2-deficient EryPs have diminished erythroid output and augmented megakaryocyte output in orthogonal differentiation assays.

Collectively, this study advances the understanding of the interplay between TF function and chromatin accessibility.

VirScan revealed unique viral exposure histories for each individual. At the antibody level, we observed strong protein-level immunodominance, with viral surface proteins consistently recognized across individuals, but striking variability at the epitope level, even within immunodominant proteins. At the functional level, differential protein expression analysis showed that prior infection with HSV-1, HSV-2, or norovirus was associated with elevated production of CCL4, MCP-2, and TNF, respectively, following TLR7/8 stimulation, indicating virus-specific imprints on innate immune responses. Together, these findings suggest that both chronic and acute viral infections are major drivers of immune variation and can leave lasting signatures on innate function.

This can significantly increase the data acquisition time required to reach a desired resolution or even make it impossible to obtain a reconstruction altogether. Here, we show that preferred orientation can be overcome by continuously exciting the sample with ultrasonic waves during vitrification. Our experiments suggest that mechanical oscillations induced in the sample support continuously shake proteins loose form the air-water interface, thereby scrambling their orientations. The simple, physical nature of this mechanism should make it applicable to a wide range of proteins. Since our method can be easily implemented in existing vitrification devices, it should find widespread adoption.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546401

Using double-serial retrocuing (DSR) with simultaneous EEG recording, we investigated how single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) to right intraparietal sulcus impacts neural representations of unprioritized memory items (UMI), relative to irrelevant memory items (IMI) that are no longer needed for the trial. Twelve human participants (8 female) performed DSR plus a single-retrocue task, while spTMS was delivered during delay periods. Multivariate pattern analysis revealed that spTMS restored decodability of the UMI concurrent with stimulation, and that of the IMI several timesteps later, after the evoked effects of spTMS were no longer present in the EEG signal. This effect was carried by the alpha and low-beta frequency bands. Analyses of the EEG showed two effects selective to the UMI: both the retrocue designating the UMI and spTMS produced phase shifts in the low-beta band. These results were mirrored by representational geometry analyses, which revealed larger cue-related and spTMS-related rotations of the UMI-representing subspace, compared to the prioritized subspace spTMS. These findings demonstrate that deprioritization involves active neural mechanisms distinct from the processing of the IMI, and that these are supported by low-beta oscillatory dynamics in parietal cortex. We hypothesize that the mechanism underlying spTMS-triggered involuntary retrieval of the UMI is the disruption of the encoding of priority status, which may depend on oscillatory dynamics in the low-beta band.

Significance StatementThis study provides key insights into how the brain maintains information at different levels of priority in working memory. Importantly, it shows how deprioritizing information in working memory is different from simply ""dropping"" it. By combining transcranial magnetic stimulation with high temporal resolution measurement of neural signals (with EEG), we replicate previous findings that spTMS triggers the involuntary retrieval of previously unprioritized information and provide new insight into how it does this. At the level of EEG dynamics, it uniquely alters oscillations in the low-beta band. At the level of representational geometry, it triggers larger transformations than are seen with the prioritized item, and qualitatively different transformations than are seen with the ""dropped"" item.","[{""name"":""Foundation for the National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k86s890"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MH131678;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546401

Nucleosome remodeling complexes hydrolyze ATP to translocate DNA and thereby mobilize histone proteins. While nucleosome remodeling complexes have been extensively studied for their roles in regulating nucleosome positioning and accessibility, their contributions to higher-order chromatin architecture remain less well understood. Here, we investigate the roles of two key nucleosome remodelers, esBAF and INO80C, in shaping 3D genome organization in mouse embryonic stem cells. Using Hi-C, we find that loss of either remodeler has minimal effects on global compartment or TAD structures. In contrast, subcompartment organization is notably altered, suggesting that esBAF and INO80C contribute to finer-scale chromatin topology. To overcome the limited resolution of Hi-C for detecting regulatory loops, we employed promoter capture Micro-C (PCMC), which revealed that the loss of esBAF or INO80C alters a subset of promoter anchored looping interactions. Although these changes occur at distinct genomic loci for each remodeler, the affected sites are commonly enriched for bivalent chromatin regions bound by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG (OSN), as well as BRG1 and INO80 themselves. Together, our findings reveal that esBAF and INO80C selectively influence subcompartment identity and enhancer-promoter communication at key regulatory loci, highlighting a previously underappreciated role for nucleosome remodelers in higher-order chromatin organization.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 GM133732;HD072122;HG003143;DK107980;HG011536;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546401

Human participants learned sequences of environments in immersive virtual reality. They then learned novel environment transitions connecting previously separate sequences. During subsequent fMRI, participants predicted multiple steps into the future in both the newly connected sequence and control sequences that remained separate. The hippocampus integrated representations of the connected sequence, such that activity patterns became more similar across trials for the connected sequence vs. the unconnected sequences.

This study identified more than 421 million single-nucleotide variants and indels and more than 600 million copy-number and structural variants. Small variants had 756 million molecular effects annotated. Of 7.7 million polymorphic variants having an allele frequency (AF) of more than 5% in EGP, 1,348 have a predicted deleterious effect on a protein. Characterization with respect to global variation shows that EGP represents a genetic continuum encompassing the range of African, Asian, and European populations. It is best described by two Arabian, an Eurasian, and an African component, with the predominant Arabian component linked to mitochondrial haplogroups J and T that are commonly attributed to the Middle East. Various aneuploidies of sex chromosomes were detected in 93 individuals overall, and aneuploidy of chromosome 21 was identified in 41 individuals. Median inbreeding coefficient and cumulative runs of homozygosity (ROHs) lengths were increased due to extensive consanguinity, were largest in the groups with Arabian main ancestry components, and were higher than reported for Qatar. Families were identified based on genetic relatedness and classified into 264 families with unrelated parents and 247 families with third- and fourth-degree consanguineous parents. Representative consanguineous pedigrees of families in EGP were outlined. Cumulative ROHs were affected by the main ancestry component and significantly increased in offspring of consanguineous parents, with a pronounced difference between 3rd and 4th-degree relatedness. Investigation of cumulative AFs of variants causing Mendelian diseases highlighted genes related to alpha- and beta-thalassemia (HBB, HBA2) and showed a high burden of variants causing severe recessive diseases, metabolic and retinal disorders, and hearing loss. In summary, EGP represents a landmark effort in characterizing the genetic diversity of the Emirati population, leveraging the largest Middle Eastern cohort reported to date.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758492546401

Primary sensory cortices receive topographically segregated information from first-order thalamic nuclei, which process distinct sensory modalities. In contrast, higher-order cortical regions integrate information from multiple information channels. While such hierarchical processing and integration of information is the foundation for neural computations in the mammalian cortex, the fundamental principles of thalamocortical computations in non-mammalian vertebrates remains unexplored. The zebrafish pallium, located in the dorsal telencephalon, is regarded as the homolog of the mammalian cortex. However, it remains unclear how the zebrafish pallium receives and processes sensory information, and how the architecture and function of these processes compare to the thalamocortical circuits in other vertebrates. Using anatomical tracing, electrophysiological circuit mapping, and in vivo Ca2+ imaging, we revealed a thalamocortical-like pathway in the zebrafish brain. We found that the preglomerular nucleus (PG) is the primary source of visual and mechano-vibrational information to the zebrafish pallium. We demonstrated that PG neurons and their pallial projections exhibit sensory-specific and topographically organized responses. In contrast, the sensory responses of pallial neurons display multiple layers of topographically organized hierarchies, ranging from simple sensory-specific responses to multimodal and coincidence-detecting nonlinear responses. Notably, we observed a progressive increase in the complexity of sensory computations, which is organized topographically along the posterior-anterior axis of the zebrafish pallium. Collectively, our results suggest that hierarchical sensory processing across topographically organized pallial regions is a conserved functional feature of the vertebrate pallium.","[{""name"":""JSPS KAKENHI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JP24K02008;""},{""name"":""European Horizon Marie-Curie individual postdoctoral fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101066743;""},{""name"":""NFR FRIPRO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""239973;314212;""},{""name"":""RCN Centres of Excellence scheme"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""332640;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546401

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546401

Hippocampus and visual cortex activity during encoding predicted later memory success. Crucially, spontaneous reinstatement in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during post-encoding rest also predicted memory. In a second sample (N = 32, agemean = 12.86 years) with early adversity, differential recruitment of the precuneus and visual cortex during encoding, and angular gyrus during reinstatement, was observed. These findings suggest that hippocampus and mPFC contribute to developmental memory stabilization in ways consistent with mature function, while differences in memory accessibility across developmental experiences arise from broader network adaptations.","[{""name"":""New York State Psychiatric Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04aqjf708"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1F32HD114417;""},{""name"":""Brain & Behavior Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03a63f080"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NARSAD Young Investigator Grant (24739);""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546401

Due to its unique position in the phylogenetic tree and distinctive spectral properties, it serves as an important model for elucidating rhodopsin evolution and for engineering optogenetic tools with enhanced performance, but its structure and function remain poorly understood. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of ChR024 in detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs at resolutions of 3.22 and 2.45 [A], respectively. The structures reveal an architecture strikingly similar to that of ion-pumping rhodopsins, even more so than other pump-like channelrhodopsins such as ChRmine. Structural, theoretical, and spectroscopic analyses uncover a unique color-tuning mechanism, in which charged residues close and distant from the retinal chromophore cooperatively modulate the pKa of the Schiff base counterion and thereby determine the absorption maximum wavelength. Finally, comparative structural analysis of channel- and pump-type rhodopsins, combined with electrophysiology, provides insights into the molecular boundary between these two functional classes and demonstrates the conversion of an outward proton pump into a light-gated channel. Together, these findings illuminate diverse mechanisms of color tuning and functional specification within the rhodopsin family, paving the way for the rational engineering of next-generation optogenetic tools.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546401

In a pre-registered fMRI experiment, 12 humans (12 scanner-hours each) performed a visual WM task with varying memory load (0-4 items). We replicated a localized, load-dependent increase in univariate BOLD activity in parietal cortex. However, we also observed both systematic increases and decreases in univariate activity with load across the visual hierarchy. Importantly, multivariate activation patterns encoded WM load regardless of the direction of the univariate effect, arguing against a restricted locus of load signals in parietal cortex. Finally, we observed representational drift in activity patterns encoding memory load across scanning sessions. Our results suggest a distributed code for memory load that may be continually refined over time to support more efficient information storage.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EY025872;MH087214;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2104630;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546401

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mating-type switching is a central feature of the life cycle that enables homothallism, i.e., mating between mitotic descendants of the same haploid cell. Yet heterothallic isolates that have lost this ability are found across diverse niches, indicating that this trait is polymorphic. Here we experimentally characterized loss of mating-type switching in a representative panel of strains. Analysis of 117 telomere- to-telomere genome assemblies revealed multiple independent loss-of-function mutations in the Ho endonuclease gene and structural variants in the silent HML and HMR cassettes, the three loci essential for switching. We estimated that at least 13 independent transitions from homothallism to heterothallism have occurred in the species history. Analysis of the HO genotype of 2,915 strains show that at least 27% are heterothallic. We found that heterothallism is strongly associated with polyploidy and elevated genome-wide heterozygosity, although the strength of these associations varies between populations. Heterothallic isolates are most prevalent in domesticated and clinical clades, consistent with an origin linked to human-associated environments. However, they are also found, though less frequently, in natural niches. Signatures of recombination in HO sequences suggest that outcrossing contributed to the ecological and geographical distribution of the trait. Our findings reveal that mating-type switching has undergone repeated losses in S. cerevisiae evolution, with major consequences for genome architecture and ecological diversification.

Significance StatementMating-type switching evolved multiple times in yeasts, enabling haploid selfing, which became a key feature of their life cycles. We show that this trait has been lost repeatedly in the history of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, producing heterothallic isolates that cannot switch mating type. Analysis of thousands of genomes reveals that these losses involve multiple mutations in the Ho endonuclease and structural changes in the silent mating-type cassettes. Heterothallism is associated with polyploidy and increased genome-wide heterozygosity. It is more frequent in domesticated and clinical lineages, but also occurs in natural ecological niches. Our findings illustrate how repeated changes in a single life-history trait can reshape genome architecture and highlight the dynamic interplay between genetics, environment, and evolution in a model eukaryote.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE12-0020;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546401

In most organisms, cilia form dense arrays of thousands of filaments that coordinate their motion into persistent, temporally synchronized patterns known as metachronal waves. Despite their ubiquity, the dynamics of these patterns and their role in tuning propulsion remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate how metachronal coordination shapes the navigation of Didinium nasutum, a highly agile unicellular predator with two circumferential ciliary bands. Using high-speed imaging of freely swimming cells, we capture and quantify the dynamics of metachronal wave coordination and track their evolution across different swimming states and transitions. Combining these measurements with a hydrodynamic model, we uncover how dynamic changes in coordination directly regulate propulsion and maneuverability. We show that stable metachronal waves support persistent directed swimming, local inhomogeneities in coordination give rise to curved trajectories, and global wave reversals accommodate rapid evasion-like reorientations. Our findings reveal that transitions between coordination modes allow Didinium to access a diverse swimming repertoire, highlighting dynamic ciliary patterning as a key mechanism to encode complex microscale navigation strategies. More broadly, they provide mechanistic insights into how metachronal coordination shapes fluid flows generated by dense ciliary arrays found in unicellular protists and airway epithelia alike, ultimately influencing swimming and transport in biological systems.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Project Grant 315230_215678;""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UPenn MRSEC DMR- 2309043;""},{""name"":""Charles E.

We developed highly efficient, in vivo RNA electroporation-based single-cell gene editing to investigate neuronal responses to loss of fast inhibition. Using CRISPR-Cas9 components delivered as RNA, we knocked out GABA-A receptor {beta} subunits in individual layer 2/3 cortical neurons in mouse visual cortex, eliminating fast inhibition. In vivo patch-clamp recordings revealed that cortical neurons adapted to inhibition loss through two sequential mechanisms: a transient reduction of excitatory synaptic input, followed by intrinsic membrane property changes that decreased input resistance. This sequential adaptation program ultimately prevented target neurons from contributing spikes to the cortical network. Our RNA-based single-cell gene editing approach enables investigation of cellular responses independent of network effects, providing new insights into neuronal homeostasis and gene function in individual cells in vivo.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546401

This protein complex generates a depolarizing sodium leak in various tissues and contributes to respiratory and circadian rhythms, locomotion, and sleep. De novo and inherited variants of NALCN can lead to severe developmental syndromes called  contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay (CLIFAHDD) and  infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 1 (IHPRF1), respectively. Although variants of uncertain significance (VUS) or presumed pathogenic variants have been studied in heterologous expression systems before, there is no generally accepted framework on how to assess or predict variant pathogenicity. We set out use the functional and computational characterization of 19 VUS detected in CLIFAHDD and IHPRF1 patients to establish a robust analysis to classify suspected disease-causing variants. Specifically, we employ a combination of multiple parameters derived from two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology recordings and predicted protein stability and conservation scores. We show that this approach is capable of distinguishing benign common variants from both gain- and loss-of-function (GoF/LoF) variants. Additionally, our work provides mechanistic insight into the molecular mechanism underlying specific variants and provides insight into the unusual propensity of NALCN missense variants to result in GoF phenotypes. We anticipate that this experimental and computational framework will aid assessment of variant pathogenicity of NALCN and other components of the channelosome in the future.","[{""name"":""Carlsberg Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01kpjmx04"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CF16-0504;""},{""name"":""Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05svhj534"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""7025-00097A;""},{""name"":""Lundbeck Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03hz8wd80"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R252-2017-1671; SAP;R272-2017-4528; AS;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758492546401

Using electrophysiological recordings of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) located in a target region of the primary visual cortex, we identified striatal modules that process basic visual features. SPNs from the direct and indirect pathways exhibited high orientation selectivity in the absence of behavioral contingencies. SPNs population activity reliably predicted different visual features. Pathway-specific silencing of SPNs revealed that high orientation selectivity depends on intra-striatal connectivity. Thus, specialized striatal modules are active participants in visual feature extraction.

However, explaining how these insular subregions interact to support behaviors is elusive. Using direct recordings from humans performing a spatial episodic memory task, we show that traveling waves within the insula modulate neuronal interactions across insula subregions, by propagating in distinct spatial patterns during specific phases of memory. In addition to traveling plane waves, insula waves also propagated in complex, heterogenous spatial patterns across task conditions. Insular traveling waves correlated with memory success, highlighting the critical role of insular traveling waves in orchestrating memory performance.

At cGVHD onset, in addition to changes in the myeloid compartment, two distinct populations of CD8+T cells with a TEXEF phenotype were prevalent: an inflammatory CD8T cell cluster (CD8T_4) expressing CCL4, CD69, and TNFSF9, and an exhausted CD8T cell cluster (CD8T_5) characterized by the expression of CXCL13, HIF1A, and HLA-DRA, both correlated with clinical disease severity.
