Here we report a novel messenger RNA vaccine that directly encodes for a nanoparticle displaying 60 head domains of the Nipah virus G (NiV G) glycoprotein that acts as a highly effective antigen. A vaccine encoding for the NiV G nanoparticle elicits high antibody titers against NiV G and a robust neutralizing antibody response with a pseudotyped Nipah virus system. We ultimately find that the proposed mRNA NiV G nanoparticle (mRNA NiV G-NP) provides a flexible platform for the development of vaccines that will likely be of great value in combatting future Nipah virus outbreaks.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986672

EsoGuard (EG) is a DNA assay used with EsoCheck, a non-endoscopic cell collection device for detection of BE, which can be utilized as a triage to esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in patients meeting screening criteria. In doing so, EG may serve to enrich the population undergoing EGD, resulting in more BE diagnoses while potentially reducing utilization of already-limited endoscopy resources.

AimTo test the hypothesis that BE detection in EGDs performed on EG positive patients will be significantly higher than the positive predictive value (PPV) of screening EGD alone.

MethodsReal-world data was retrospectively collected from EG positive patients for whom EGD diagnoses were available. Baseline patient characteristics, risk factors, and EGD results were obtained from the treating physicians. PPV of screening EGDs was the comparator and estimated by literature-established disease prevalence of BE, which in the U.S gastroesophageal reflux disease population is [~]10.6%. The hypothesis was tested using t-tests for single proportions at a one-sided 5% significance level.

ResultsData from 209 patients found 60 (28.7%) subjects with salmon-colored mucosa on EGD and specialized intestinal metaplasia on histopathology. However, 10 (4.8%) had < 1cm of disease on visual inspection, therefore, did not meet the American College of Gastroenterology definition of BE so was excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 199 patients, 50 (25.1%) had BE on EGD. In the cohort of patients meeting ACG screening criteria, 28.9% (33/114) had BE. Overall, a 2.4-fold increase in BE detection was observed compared to the PPV of screening EGD, and in the ACG cohort this increase was 2.7-fold. Among ACG patients [&ge;]65 years old, the increase was nearly 2.5-fold (25.9% detection rate).

ConclusionsOur data suggests EG and EC used as a triage test enriches the population undergoing EGD for BE, and compared to screening EGD alone, can help direct more efficient use of endoscopy resources to unburden the system without reducing the number of eligible patients screened and diagnosed.","NA","medrxiv",1722981986672

In aged mice, partial reprogramming, characterized by pulsed expression of reprogramming factors, has shown promise in improving function in various tissues, but its impact on the aging brain remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the impact of in vivo partial reprogramming on mature neurons in the dentate gyrus of young and aged mice. Using two different approaches - a neuron-specific transgenic reprogrammable mouse model and neuron-specific targeted lentiviral delivery of OSKM reprogramming factors - we demonstrated that in vivo partial reprogramming of mature neurons in the dentate gyrus, a neurogenic niche in the adult mouse brain, can influence animal behavior, and ameliorate age-related decline in memory and learning. These findings underscore the potential of in vivo partial reprogramming as an important therapeutic intervention to rejuvenate the neurogenic niche and ameliorate cognitive decline associated with aging or neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986672

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1722981986672

This study investigates virological factors contributing to the reemergence of Oropouche fever in Brazil between 2023 and 2024.

MethodsIn this study, we combined OROV genomic, molecular, and serological data from Brazil from 1 January 2015 to 29 June 2024, along with in vitro and in vivo characterization. Molecular screening data included 93 patients with febrile illness between January 2023 and February 2024 from the Amazonas State. Genomic data comprised two genomic OROV sequences from patients. Serological data were obtained from neutralizing antibody tests comparing the prototype OROV strain BeAn 19991 and the 2024 epidemic strain. Epidemiological data included aggregated cases reported to the Brazilian Ministry of Health from 1 January 2014 to 29 June 2024.

FindingsIn 2024, autochthonous OROV infections were detected in previously non-endemic areas across all five Brazilian regions. Cases were reported in 19 of 27 federal units, with 83.2% (6,895 of 8,284) of infections in Northern Brazil and a nearly 200-fold increase in incidence compared to reported cases over the last decade. We detected OROV RNA in 10.8% (10 of 93) of patients with febrile illness between December 2023 and May 2024 in Amazonas. We demonstrate that the 2023-2024 epidemic was caused by a novel OROV reassortant that replicated approximately 100-fold higher titers in mammalian cells compared to the prototype strain. The 2023-2024 OROV reassortant displayed plaques earlier than the prototype, produced 1.7 times more plaques, and plaque sizes were 2.5 larger compared to the prototype. Furthermore, serum collected in 2016 from previously OROV-infected individuals showed at least a 32-fold reduction in neutralizing capacity against the reassortment strain compared to the prototype.

InterpretationThese findings provide a comprehensive assessment of Oropouche fever in Brazil and contribute to a better understanding of the 2023-2024 OROV reemergence. The recent increased incidence may be related to a higher replication efficiency of a new reassortant virus that also evades previous immunity.","NA","medrxiv",1722981986672

Currently, holocephalian diversity is concentrated in deep-sea species, suggesting this lineage might contain relictual diversity that persisted in the ocean depths. Yet, the relationships of living holocephalians to their extinct relatives and the timescale of diversification of living species remains unclear. Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of holocephalians using comprehensive morphological and DNA sequence datasets. Our results suggest that living holocephalians entered and diversified in deep (>1000 m) ocean waters after the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction, contrasting with the hypothesis that this ecosystem has acted as a refugium of ancient cartilaginous fishes. These invasions were decoupled from the evolution of key features of the holocephalian body plan, including crushing dentition, a single frontal clasper, and holostylic jaw suspension, in the Paleozoic Era, and considerably postdated the appearance of the living familes by 150 million years ago during a major period of biotic turnover in oceans termed the Mesozoic Marine Revolution. These results clarify the origins of living holocephalians as the recent diversification of a single surviving clade among numerous Paleozoic lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986672

Identifying and controlling dose-dependent transgenes require tools for precisely titrating expression. To this end, we developed a highly modular, extensible framework called DIAL for building editable promoters that allow for fine-scale, heritable changes in transgene expression. Using DIAL, we increase expression by recombinase-mediated excision of spacers between the binding sites of a synthetic zinc finger transcription factor and the core promoter. By nesting varying numbers and lengths of spacers, DIAL generates a tunable range of unimodal setpoints from a single promoter. Through small-molecule control of transcription factors and recombinases, DIAL supports temporally defined, user-guided control of transgene expression that is extensible to additional transcription factors. Lentiviral delivery of DIAL generates multiple setpoints in primary cells and iPSCs. As promoter editing generates stable states, DIAL setpoints are heritable, facilitating mapping of transgene levels to phenotypes. The DIAL framework opens new opportunities for tailoring transgene expression and improving the predictability and performance of gene circuits across diverse applications.

HighlightsPromoter editing generates unimodal setpoints from a single synthetic promoter

DIAL setpoints are tuned by the length of an excisable spacer within the promoter

DIAL setpoints are uniform and robust to varying levels of the transcription factor

DIAL transmits transient inputs into heritable promoter states

The TET-DIAL system enables small-molecule activation at defined setpoints

However, it remains unclear whether migrating cells can retain a memory of their past morphological states, which could potentially enhance their navigation through confined spaces. By combining cell migration assays on standardized microsystems with biophysical modeling and biochemical perturbations, we demonstrate that local geometry governs these morphological switches, thereby facilitating cell passage through long and narrow gaps. We uncovered a long-term memory of past confinement events in migrating cells, with morphological states correlated across transitions through actin cortex remodeling. These findings suggest that mechanical memory in migrating cells plays an active role in their migratory potential in confined environments.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986672

In healthy controls (HC) regulation of CBF is complex and involves multiple mechanisms including cardiac output (CO), cerebral perfusion pressure, PO2 and PCO2, flow-metabolism coupling, and innervation of cerebral vessels. In ME/CFS multiple other mechanisms have also been identified.

Aim of the studyWe previously found that both CBF and CO were reduced in ME/CFS patients during tilt testing, and we hypothesized that the relation between CBF and CO is abnormal and different from HC. In this retrospective study we analyzed this relation in a large group of patients. To compare the patient data with those of HC, we focused on patients with a normal heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) response to upright tilt. Also, the influence of clinical data was analyzed.

MethodsA total of 534 ME/CFS patients and 49 HC underwent tilt testing with measurements of HR, BP, CBF, and CO. In 46 (9%) patients CO and CBF changes were in the normal range of HC, and in 488 (91%) an abnormal CO and CBF reduction was found.

Resultspatients with a CO and CBF reduction in the range of HC had less severe disease and were more likely to be male. In patients with an abnormal CO and CBF reduction the slope of the regression line of CO versus CBF reduction was almost 1. A multiple regression analysis of the latter group, including patients with PetCO2 measurements (440/488: 90%) showed that the CO reduction for the major part predicted the CBF reduction, with a limited role for the PetCO2 reduction and the tilt duration. Other data did not add to the model.

ConclusionsTwo different patient groups with a normal HR and BP response during the tilt were identified: those with a CO and CBF in the normal range of HC and those with an abnormal CO and CBF reduction during the tilt (91% of patients). The former group had milder disease and included more men. In the largest group of patients there was an almost 1:1 relation between the CO and CBF reduction, suggesting absence of compensatory vasodilation in the cerebral vasculature. This may be an appropriate target for clinical and therapeutic interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1722981986672

We show that proseLM benefits from the scaling trends of underlying language models, and that the addition of non-protein context - nucleic acids, ligands, and ions - improves recovery of native residues during design by 4-5% across model scales. These improvements are most pronounced for residues that directly interface with non-protein context, which are faithfully recovered at rates >70% by the most capable proseLM models. We experimentally validated proseLM by optimizing the editing efficiency of genome editors in human cells, achieving a 50% increase in base editing activity, and by redesigning therapeutic antibodies, resulting in a PD-1 binder with 2.2 nM affinity.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986672

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort.

Despite recent advances, their specificity remains incompletely understood. Here, we address this by contrasting two TFs, NGN2 and MyoD1, which recognize ubiquitous E-box motifs yet instigate distinct cell fates--neurons and muscles, respectively. Following controlled induction in embryonic stem cells, we monitor binding across differentiation trajectories, employing an interpretable machine-learning approach integrating pre-existing DNA accessibility data. This reveals a chromatin-dependent motif syntax, delineating both common and factor-specific binding and predicting genome engagement with high precision. Shared binding sites reside in open chromatin, locally influenced by nucleosomes. In contrast, factor-specific binding in closed chromatin involves NGN2 and MyoD1 acting as pioneer-factors, influenced by multi-motifs, rotational spacing, flanking sequences, and specific interaction partners, accounting for subsequent lineage divergence. Extending our methodology to other models demonstrates how such combination of opportunistic-binding and context-specific chromatin opening underpin transcription factor specificity driving differentiation trajectories.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986672

Here, we sequenced and analyzed 382 full-length OROV genomes from human samples collected between 2022 and 2024 from all four states, aiming to trace the origin and genetic evolution of OROV leading to the current outbreak. Genomic analyses revealed that the recent upsurge of OROV cases in the Brazilian Amazon region coincides with the emergence of a novel reassortant viral lineage containing the M segment of viruses detected in the eastern Amazon region from 2009 to 2018 and the L and S segments of viruses detected in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador from 2008 to 2021. The novel reassortant OROV lineage likely emerged in the Central region of the AM state between 2010 and 2014 and displayed a long-range silent dispersion during the second half of the 2010s. The 2022-2024 OROV epidemic was spatially segregated into three major subpopulations located in RR, AMACRO (a bordering region between AC, RO, and AM-Southern region), and AM-Central (which includes the Amazonas capital, Manaus) regions. The peak of OROV transmissions in all regions occurred during the rainy season in the Amazon basin. Furthermore, our phylodynamics reconstructions showed that OROV spread was driven mainly by short-range (< 2 km) movements, with an average dispersal rate [&le;] 1.2 km/day, consistent with the pattern of an active flight of infected vectors. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion (22%) of long-range (> 10 km) OROV migrations were also detected, consistent with viral dispersion via human activities. Our data provides an unprecedented view of the real-time spread and evolution of a neglected emergent human pathogen. Moreover, our results emphasize the need for widespread, long-term genomic surveillance to better understand the real burden of OROV within and beyond the Amazon region.","NA","medrxiv",1722981986672

Accumulation of the Arabidopsis NADPH oxidase RBOHD is regulated by phosphorylation of a conserved C-terminal residue (T912) leading to ubiquitination by the RING E3 ligase PIRE. Arabidopsis PIRE knockouts exhibit enhanced ROS production and resistance to the foliar pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Here, we identified 170 PIRE homologs, which emerged in Tracheophytes and expanded in Angiosperms. We investigated the role of Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) PIRE homologs in regulating ROS production, RBOH stability, and disease resistance. Mutational analyses of residues corresponding to T912 in the tomato RBOHD ortholog, SlRBOHB, affected protein accumulation and ROS production in a PIRE-dependent manner. Using CRISPR-cas9, we generated mutants in two S. lycopersicum PIRE homologs (SlPIRE). SlPIRE1 edited lines (Slpire1) in the tomato cultivar M82 displayed enhanced ROS production upon treatment with flg22, an immunogenic epitope of flagellin. Furthermore, Slpire1 exhibited decreased disease symptoms and bacterial accumulation when inoculated with foliar bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas campestris. However, Slpire1 exhibited similar levels of colonization as wild type upon inoculation with diverse soilborne pathogens. These results indicate that phosphorylation and ubiquitination crosstalk regulate RBOHs in multiple plant species, and PIRE is a promising target for foliar disease control. This study also highlights the pathogen-specific role of PIRE, indicating its potential for targeted manipulation to enhance foliar disease resistance without affecting root-associated interactions, positioning PIRE as a promising target for improving overall plant health.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986672

We show that posterolateral higher visual areas (plHVAs) are crucial for learning to suppress escapes from innate visual threats through a top-down pathway involving the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN). plHVAs are no longer necessary after learning: instead, the learnt behavior relies on plasticity within vLGN populations that exert inhibitory control over fear responses. vLGN neurons receiving input from plHVAs enhance their responses to visual threat stimuli during learning through endocannabinoid-mediated long-term suppression of their inhibitory inputs. We thus reveal the detailed circuit, cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying experience-dependent suppression of fear responses through a novel corticofugal pathway.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986672

During stress, these hubs are remodeled into translationally repressed mesoscale bodies containing messenger, ribosomal, and double-stranded RNA.

Current theoretical frameworks rely on the separation of the cortical architecture into layers. Recently, methodological advancements have allowed to test layer specific frameworks on the role of oscillations in cortical computations in healthy human participants. Using EEG-fMRI, we have investigated for the first time both, stimulus feature specificity (line orientation) and the relationship between the laminar BOLD activity and  and{gamma} band oscillations. We find{gamma} oscillations to be positively correlated with feature-specific signals in superficial layers as predicted by the literature, but we found a deep layer contribution as well. Furthermore we found a layer (and frequency) dissociation within the  band for general, feature unspecific, processes and a feature related process. The power of the -band correlated negatively with feature unspecific neural activity in all cortical layers. We further found that high frequency  oscillations were specifically related to stimulus feature specific BOLD signal in deep and superficial layers. More interestingly, we also observed a general modulation effect for negative BOLD signal deflections in line with the inhibitory role of  during visual attention in superficial layers. Those findings support the association of{gamma} band oscillations with visual feature processing and further point towards the involvement of multiple  oscillations in more general and feature related processes.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986672

However, the algorithms used to detect changes in pitch, or pitch motion, are incompletely understood. Here, using psychophysics, computational modeling, functional neuroimaging, and analysis of recorded speech, we ask if humans detect pitch motion using computations analogous to those used by the visual system. We adapted stimuli from studies of vision to create novel auditory correlated noise stimuli that elicited robust pitch motion percepts. Crucially, these stimuli possess no persistent features across frequency or time, but do possess positive or negative local spectrotemporal correlations in intensity. In psychophysical experiments, we found clear evidence that humans judge pitch direction based on both positive and negative spectrotemporal correlations. The observed sensitivity to negative correlations is a direct analogue of illusory ""reverse-phi"" motion in vision, and thus constitutes a new auditory illusion. Our behavioral results and computational modeling led us to hypothesize that human auditory processing employs pitch direction opponency. fMRI measurements in auditory cortex supported this hypothesis. To link our psychophysical findings to real-world pitch perception, we analyzed recordings of English and Mandarin speech and discovered that pitch direction was robustly signaled by the same positive and negative spectrotemporal correlations used in our psychophysical tests, suggesting that sensitivity to both positive and negative correlations confers ecological benefits. Overall, this work reveals that motion detection algorithms sensitive to local correlations are deployed by the central nervous system across disparate modalities (vision and audition) and dimensions (space and frequency).","NA","biorxiv",1722981986672

Non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1), the first viral protein produced during coronaviral infections, inhibits host protein synthesis and induces mRNA degradation to enhance viral proliferation. However, the interconnection between the two processes and whether host mRNA degradation depends on the active translation of targeted mRNAs remains enigmatic. Here, intrigued by the observation that Nsp1 does not stimulate ribosome collisions, we use a human cell-free translation system to decouple the main Nsp1 activities, showing that Nsp1 can induce mRNA degradation independently of translation inhibition. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binding to the ribosome is sufficient to trigger host mRNA degradation without requiring ribosome scanning or translation elongation, stimulating degradation at the 5'end of the transcript. Interestingly, for MERS-CoV, Nsp1 causes translation inhibition without triggering mRNA degradation. Using Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2, MERS and Bat-Hp coronaviruses, we observe 5'UTR-specific protection of viral mRNAs, indicating a co-evolutionary adaptation mechanism of the two viral features.

While this framework is well-suited for hypothesis testing approaches, achieving the modern goal of precision medicine requires a different framework that is predictive in nature and that focuses on maximizing the predictive power of models and evaluating their ability to generalize beyond the data that were used to train them. However, few tools exist to support the development and evaluation of predictive models in the context of neuroimaging or lesion-behavior research, creating an obstacle to the widespread adoption of predictive modeling approaches in the field. Further, existing tools for lesion-behavior analysis are often unable to accommodate categorical outcome variables and often impose restrictions on the predictor data. Researchers therefore often must use different software packages and analytical approaches depending on whether they are addressing a classification vs. regression problem and on whether their predictor data correspond to binary lesion images, continuous lesion-network images, connectivity matrices, or other data modalities. To address these limitations, we have developed a MATLAB software toolkit that supports both inferential and predictive modeling frameworks, accommodates both classification and regression problems, and does not impose restrictions on the modality of the predictor data. The toolkit features both a graphical user interface and scripting interface, includes implementations of multiple mass-univariate, multivariate, and machine learning models, features built-in and customizable routines for hyper-parameter optimization, cross-validation, model stacking, and significance testing, and automatically generates text-based descriptions of key methodological details and modeling results to improve reproducibility and minimize errors in the reporting of methods and results. Here, we provide an overview and discussion of the toolkits features and demonstrate its functionality by applying it to the question of how expressive and receptive language impairments relate to lesion location, structural disconnection, and functional network disruption in a large sample of patients with left hemispheric brain lesions. We find that impairments in expressive vs. receptive language are most strongly associated with left lateral prefrontal and left posterior temporal/parietal damage, respectively. We also find that impairments in expressive vs. receptive language are associated with partially overlapping patterns of fronto-temporal structural disconnection, and that the associated functional networks are also similar. Importantly, we find that lesion location and lesion-derived network measures are highly predictive of both types of impairment, with predictions from models trained on these measures explaining [~]30-40% of the variance on average when applied to data from patients not used to train the models. We have made the toolkit publicly available, and we have included a comprehensive set of tutorial notebooks to support new users in applying the toolkit in their studies.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986672

A commonly adopted approach to reconstruct complex demographic dynamics is the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework. It exploits coalescent simulations to generate the expected level of variation under different evolutionary scenarios. Demographic inference is then performed by comparing the simulated data with the genotypes called in the sampled individuals. Low sequencing coverage drastically affects the ability to reliably call genotypes, thus making low-coverage data unsuitable for such powerful inferential approaches. Here, we present Low-ABC, a new ABC approach to infer past population processes using low-coverage whole-genome data. Under this framework, both observed and simulated genetic variation are not directly compared using called genotypes, but rather obtained using genotype likelihoods to consider the uncertainty caused by the low sequencing coverage. We first evaluated the inferential power of this procedure in distinguishing among different demographic models and in inferring model parameters under different experimental conditions, including a wide spectrum of sequencing coverage (1x to 30x), number of individuals, number, and size of genetic loci. We showed that the use of genotype likelihoods integrated into an ABC framework provides a reliable inference of past population dynamics, thus making possible the application of model-based inference also for low-coverage data. We then applied Low-ABC to shed light on the relationship between Mesolithic and Early Neolithic European populations.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

Quantitation is often done using a colorimetric assay such as the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay in which a change in the color of the BCA reagent is related to protein concentration. Extracted protein samples are compared to a standard curve made with dilutions of a protein standard such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) to determine their concentrations. A series of experiments was designed to determine the most reproducible and accurate method for quantifying protein concentrations of samples in an experimental series over time. The effect of freezing on diluted standards was investigated. Standards were frozen at -20{degrees}C or -80{degrees}C and serially thawed and refrozen up to three times prior to their use in a BCA assay. Thawing and refreezing the standards had no significant effect on protein concentration and the resulting standard curves. Inter-person and intra-person variability in the preparation of standards was also investigated. Protein concentration differences due to inter-person and intra-person variability were greater than protein concentration variability resulting from freezing and thawing, regardless of the freezing temperature. The most reproducible and accurate method for determining the protein concentration of extracted samples in an experimental series over time is diluting a large batch of BSA standards and freezing them at either -20{degrees}C or -80{degrees}C.

However, disruption of domain structure often results in mild gene dysregulation and thus predicting the impact of boundary rearrangements on animal development remains challenging. Here, we tested whether structural perturbation of a chromatin domain with multiple developmental regulators can result in more acute gene dysregulation and severe developmental phenotypes. We targeted clusters of CTCF motifs in a domain of the mouse genome containing three FGF ligand genes--Fgf3, Fgf4, and Fgf15--that regulate several developmental processes. Deletion of the 23.9kb cluster that defines the centromeric boundary of this domain resulted in ectopic interactions of the FGF genes with enhancers located across the deleted boundary that are active in the developing brain. This caused strong induction of FGF expression and perinatal lethality with encephalocele and orofacial cleft phenotypes. Heterozygous boundary deletion was sufficient to cause these fully penetrant phenotypes, and strikingly, loss of a single CTCF motif within the cluster also recapitulated ectopic FGF expression and caused encephalocele. However, such phenotypic sensitivity to perturbation of domain structure did not extend to all CTCF clusters of this domain, nor to all developmental processes controlled by these three FGF genes--for example, the ability to undergo lineage specification in the blastocyst and pre-implantation development were not affected. By tracing the impact of different chromosomal rearrangements throughout mouse development, we start to uncover the determinants of phenotypic robustness and sensitivity to perturbation of chromatin boundaries. Our data show how small sequence variants at certain domain boundaries can have a surprisingly outsized effect and must be considered as potential sources of gene dysregulation during development and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

The message is that brain activity is what differentiates subjects, or in other words, what makes a neural fingerprint ""unique"". In EEG- and MEG-derived FC fingerprinting, the activity recorded at the sensors is projected back into cortical sources by means of an inverse model containing the shape of the head and its conductivity, and further averaged to obtain time series of regional activity, used to compute FC. In this study we investigated the role of the head model in fingerprinting. Through a set of experiments aimed to decouple recorded activity and head model for each subject, we found that the head model has a strong influence on the fingerprinting performance, according to two different sets of metrics.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

The process involved a near hierarchical increase in complexity from life forms with few cell types to organisms with many hundreds of cell-types. However, neither genome size nor number of protein-coding genes can explain these differences and their biological basis remains elusive. Yet, recent studies have suggested that the evolution of complexity is closely linked to the acquisition of a class of protein coding gene-regulators called microRNAs.

In a regressive approach, to investigate the association between loss of organismal complexity and microRNAs, we here studied Syndermata, an invertebrate group including free-living rotifers (Monogononta, Bdelloidea), the epibiotic Seisonidea and the endoparasitic Acanthocephala. Genomic, transcriptomic and morphological characterization and comparisons across 25 syndermatan species revealed a strong correlation between loss of microRNAs, loss of protein-coding genes and decreasing morphological complexity. The near hierarchical loss extends to [~]85% loss of microRNAs and a [~]50% loss of BUSCO genes in the endoparasitic Acanthocephala, the most reduced group we studied.

Together, the loss of [~]400 protein-coding genes and [~]10 metazoan core gene losses went along with one microRNA family loss. Furthermore, the loss of [~]4 microRNA families or [~]34 metazoan core genes associated with one lost morphological feature. These are the first quantitative insights into the regulatory impact of microRNAs on organismic complexity as a predictable consequence in regressive evolution of parasites.

Specifically, we enter n variations of k pattern classes (n*k patterns) onto a cortex-like balanced inhibitory-excitatory network with heterogeneous neurons, and let the pattern spread within the recurrent network. We show that we can identify high mutual-information (MI) neurons as major information-bearing elements within each pattern representation. We employ a simple one-shot adaptive (learning) process focusing on high MI neurons and inhibition. Such  localist plasticity has high efficiency, because it requires only few adaptations for each pattern. Specifically, we store k=10 patterns of size s=400 in a 1000/1200 neuron network. We stimulate high MI neurons and in this way recall patterns, such that the whole network represents this pattern. We assess the quality of the representation (a) before learning, when entering the pattern into a naive network and (b) after learning, on the adapted network, during recall. The recalled patterns could be easily recognized by a trained classifier. The pattern  unfolds over the recurrent network with high similarity, albeit compressed, with respect to the original input pattern. We discuss the distribution of neuron properties in the network, and find that an initial Gaussian or uniform distribution changes into a more heavy-tailed, lognormal distribution during the adaptation process. The remarkable result is that we are able to achieve reliable pattern recall by stimulating only high information neurons. This work has interesting technical applications, and provides a biologically-inspired model of cortical memory.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

Here, we used a custom hippocampal microperiscope and two-photon calcium imaging to track CA1 pyramidal neurons in female mice over multiple cycles. Estrous cycle stage had a potent effect on spine dynamics, with heightened density during periods of greater estradiol (proestrus). These morphological changes were accompanied by greater somatodendritic coupling and increased infiltration of back-propagating action potentials into the apical dendrite. Finally, tracking CA1 response properties during navigation revealed enhanced place field stability during proestrus, evident at the single-cell and population level.

Epigenetic clocks have been trained almost exclusively using blood-based tissues but there is growing interest in estimating epigenetic age using less-invasive oral-based tissues (i.e., buccal or saliva) in both research and commercial settings. However, differentiated cell types across body tissues exhibit unique DNA methylation landscapes and age-related alterations to the DNA methylome. Applying epigenetic clocks derived from blood-based tissues to estimate epigenetic age of oral-based tissues may introduce biases. We tested the within-person comparability of common epigenetic clocks across five tissue types: buccal epithelial, saliva, dry blood spots, buffy coat (i.e., leukocytes), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We tested 284 distinct tissue samples from 83 individuals aged 9-70 years. Overall, there were significant within-person differences in epigenetic clock estimates from oral-based versus blood-based tissues, with average differences of almost 30 years observed in some age clocks. In addition, most epigenetic clock estimates of blood-based tissues exhibited low correlation with estimates from oral-based tissues despite controlling for cellular proportions and other technical factors. Our findings indicate that application of blood-derived epigenetic clocks in oral-based tissues may not yield comparable estimates of epigenetic age, highlighting the need for careful consideration of tissue type when estimating epigenetic age.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

Hearing loss is one such early indicator linked to many comorbidities later in life. However, current clinical tests fail to capture hearing difficulties for ~10% of middle-aged adults seeking help at hearing clinics. Cochlear neural degeneration (CND) could play a role in these hearing deficits, but our current understanding is limited by the lack of objective diagnostics and uncertainty regarding its perceptual consequences. Here, using a cross-species approach, we measured envelope following responses (EFRs) - neural ensemble responses to sound originating from the peripheral auditory pathway - in young and middle-aged adults with normal audiometric thresholds, and compared these responses to young and middle-aged Mongolian gerbils, where CND was histologically confirmed. We observed near identical changes in EFRs across species that were associated with CND. Perceptual effects measured as behavioral readouts showed deficits in the most challenging listening conditions and were associated with CND. Additionally, pupil-indexed listening effort increased even at moderate task difficulties where behavioral outcomes were matched. Our results reveal perceptual deficits in middle-aged adults driven by CND and increases in listening effort, which may result in increased listening fatigue and conversational disengagement.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

Measuring 21,958 perturbations showed that CRISPRa activated targets within physiological ranges, that epigenetic features predicted activatable genes, and that the protospacer seed region drove an off-target effect. Perturbations recapitulated in vivo fibroblast states, including universal and inflammatory states, and identified KLF4 and KLF5 as key regulators of the universal state. Inducing the universal state suppressed disease-associated states, highlighting its therapeutic potential. Our findings cement CRISPRa as a tool for perturbing differentiated cells and indicate that in vivo states can be elicited via perturbation, enabling studies of clinically relevant states ex vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

Pairing this powerful model organism with cutting-edge technology can significantly expand the range of experiments that can be performed. Recently, the CRISPR-Cas13d system has been successfully adapted for use in zebrafish, medaka, killifish, and mouse embryos to achieve targeted gene expression knockdown. Despite its success in other animal models, no prior study has explored the potential of CRISPR-Cas13d in the chick. Here, we present an adaptation of the CRISPR-Cas13d system to achieve targeted gene expression knockdown in the chick embryo. As proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the knockdown of PAX7, an early neural crest marker. Application of this adapted CRISPR-Cas13d technique resulted in effective knockdown of PAX7 expression and function, comparable to knockdown achieved by translation-blocking morpholino. CRISPR-Cas13d complements preexisting knockdown tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 and morpholinos, thereby expanding the experimental potential and versatility of the chick model system.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

Although most of the EMCV proteins are obtained via proteolytic cleavage of a long polyprotein, 2B* is expressed from a short overlapping open reading frame via an unusual protein-stimulated temporally dependent ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. The function of 2B* has not yet been characterised, though mutant viruses that are unable to express 2B* have a small plaque phenotype. Here we show that 2B* binds all seven members of the 14-3-3 protein family during virus infection. Binding is dependent on the 2B* C-terminal sequence RRNSS. IFN-{beta} and IL-6 signalling are impeded following overexpression of 2B* but not a truncated version lacking the RRNSS residues, thus suggesting a 14-3-3-dependent role for 2B* in inhibiting MAVS signalling. We also find that this function is distinct from the effect of 2B* on plaque size, as a virus in which 2B* was similarly truncated exhibited near-wildtype plaque size, thus indicating that 2B* also harbours additional functions. This work provides the first identification of a role of 2B* in innate immune antagonism and expands our knowledge of the protein complement of this important model virus.

IMPORTANCEEncephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infects a range of species, causing economically important reproductive disorders in pigs and encephalitis and myocarditis in rodents. Due to its wide host range, it is an important model pathogen for investigating virus-host interactions. EMCV expresses an accessory protein, 2B*, from an overlapping open reading frame via an unusual ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. Although the frameshifting mechanism has been established, the function of the 2B* protein had not previously been explored. Here, we determined the host proteins to which 2B* binds and found that it specifically binds to the entire 14-3-3 protein family which, among other roles, contribute to the innate immune response to viral infection in mammalian cells. This interaction requires a specific stretch of amino acids at the end of 2B*. By interacting with the 14-3-3 proteins, 2B* blocks immune response activation. Thus, 2B* is a novel antagonist of innate immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

However, the complexity of the data and the need for advanced computational skills limit their accessibility. To address this, we introduce C-COMPASS, an open-source software featuring a user-friendly interface that utilizes a neural network-based regression model to predict the spatial distribution of proteins across cellular compartments. C-COMPASS manages complex multilocalization patterns and integrates protein abundance information to model organelle composition changes under various biological conditions. Using C-COMPASS, we mapped the organelle proteomic landscapes of humanized liver mice in different metabolic states and modeled changes in organelle composition to provide insights into cellular adaptations. Additionally, we extended cellular maps to the lipid level by co-generating protein and lipid profiles. C-COMPASS trains neural networks with marker protein profiles to predict lipid localizations, enabling parallel mapping of lipid and protein localization. This approach overcomes the lack of knowledge of organelle-specific lipid markers and identifies previously unknown organelle-specific lipid species. C-COMPASS offers a comprehensive solution for studying organelle dynamics at the multi-omics level, designed to be accessible without requiring extensive computational expertise or specialized high-performance computing equipment.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

However, it is less clear if the same stimuli can induce both the protective and detrimental effects of innate immune memory. We previously showed that weight loss induces innate immune memory in adipose macrophages that correlates with worsened diabetes risk after weight regain. In this study, we investigated the effect of weight loss on macrophage cytokine production and overall survival in a mouse model of infection. Male C57Bl/6J mice were put on high-fat or low-fat diets over 18 weeks to induce weight gain or weight loss. Lean mice served as controls. All mice were then infected IV with 2.5x10^6 CFU Staphylococcus aureus. Tissues were collected from 10 mice/group at day 3 and the remaining animals were followed for survival. Weight gain mice had the highest blood neutrophils and the highest bacterial burden in the kidney. However, there was no significant difference in survival. The weight loss group had the highest plasma TNF- and a significant reduction in bacterial burden in the adipose tissue that correlated with increased adipose macrophage cytokine production. Thus, weight loss-induced adipose macrophage memory may both improve local S.aureus clearance and worsen diabetes risk upon weight regain. Collectively, these findings support the notion that innate immune memory is an evolutionarily protective mechanism that also contributes to the development of cardiometabolic diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

While it has been observed that some cell types are far more evolutionarily conserved than others, the factors driving these differences in evolutionary rate remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that highly abundant neuronal cell types may be under greater selective constraint than rarer neuronal types, leading to variation in their rates of evolution. To test this, we leveraged recently published cross-species single-nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets from three distinct regions of the mammalian neocortex. We found a strikingly consistent relationship where more abundant neuronal subtypes show greater gene expression conservation between species, which replicated across three independent datasets covering >106 neurons from six species. Based on this principle, we discovered that the most abundant type of neocortical neurons--layer 2/3 intratelencephalic excitatory neurons--has evolved exceptionally quickly in the human lineage compared to other apes. Surprisingly, this accelerated evolution was accompanied by the dramatic down-regulation of autism-associated genes, which was likely driven by polygenic positive selection specific to the human lineage. In sum, we introduce a general principle governing neuronal evolution and suggest that the exceptionally high prevalence of autism in humans may be a direct result of natural selection for lower expression of a suite of genes that conferred a fitness benefit to our ancestors while also rendering an abundant class of neurons more sensitive to perturbation.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

We show protrudin acts at ER-endosome contacts to promote ETF and endosome-to-Golgi traffic. Protrudin-mediated ETF required its ability to interact with ER-localised VAP proteins, endosomal phosphoinositides and KIF5. These properties also regulated the distance between protrudin and endosomal tubules. The defective ETF phenotype of increased endosomal tubulation in cells lacking protrudin was phenocopied by depletion of KIF5, but not FYCO1, a motor protein adaptor implicated in protrudin-dependent late endosome motility. It also required intact microtubules and dynein, consistent with a model where protrudin facilitates a tug-of-war between KIF5 and dynein to fission tubules. In addition to its direct role, protrudin links many other machineries involved in ETF, thus our findings elucidate how ETF is co-ordinated. These machineries are enriched for proteins implicated in hereditary motor neuron disorders, and protrudin or KIF5 depletion caused defective ETF in human neurons.

SummaryProtrudin binds ER-localised VAPs and endosomal phosphoinositides to form ER-endosome contacts that promote endosomal tubule fission and endosome-to-Golgi traffic. Protrudin recruits KIF5 to provide a FYCO1-independent force to fission endosomal tubules in neurons and non-polarised cells.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

However, since late 2022, OROV has been reported in northern Brazil as well as urban centers in Bolivia, Colombia, Cuba, and Peru. Herein, we describe the doubling of publicly available full genomes by generating 133 new entries. We show how the virus evolved via genome component reassortment and how it rapidly spread across multiple states in Brazil, causing the largest outbreak ever recorded outside the Amazon basin including the first ever detected deaths. This work highlights the need for heightened epidemiological and genomic surveillance and the implementation of adequate measures in order to mitigate transmission and the impacts on the population. Background: Oropouche virus was first identified in 1955 in Trinidad and Tobago and later found in Brazil in 1960. Historically, it has been reported to have caused around 30 outbreaks, mostly within the Amazon Basin, where it circulates among forest animals, but also in urban areas where it is known to be transmitted by the midge Culicoides paraensis. Recently, Brazil has seen a surge in cases, with more than 7000 reported by mid-2024 alone. Methods: In a collaboration with Central Public Health Laboratories across Brazilian regions, we integrated epidemiological metadata with genomic analyses of recently sampled cases. This initiative resulted in the generation of 133 whole genome sequences from the three genomic segments (L, M, and S) of the virus, including the first genomes obtained from regions outside the Amazon and from the first ever recorded fatal cases. Findings: All of the 2024 genomes form a monophyletic group in the phylogenetic tree with sequences from the Amazon Basin sampled since 2022. Our analyses revealed a rapid north-to-south viral movement from the Amazon Basin into historically non-endemic regions. We identified 21 reassortment events, although it remains unclear if genomic evolution of the virus enabled the virus to adapt to local ecological conditions and evolve new phenotypes of public health importance. Interpretation: Both the recent rapid spatial expansion and the first reported fatalities associated with Oropouche (and other outcomes under investigation) underscore the importance of enhancing surveillance for this evolving pathogen across the Region. Without any obvious changes in the human population over the past 2 years, it is possible that viral adaptation, deforestation and recent climate change, either alone or in combination, have propelled Oropouche virus beyond the Amazon Basin.","NA","medrxiv",1722981986673

One of the greatest barriers to developing treatments for IRDs is the heterogeneity of these disorders, with causative mutations identified in over 280 genes. It is therefore a priority to find therapies applicable to a broad range of genetic causes. To do so requires a greater understanding of the common or overlapping molecular pathways that lead to photoreceptor death in IRDs and the molecular processes through which they converge. Here, we characterise the contribution of different cell death mechanisms to photoreceptor degeneration and loss throughout disease progression in humanised mouse models of IRDs. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we identify common transcriptional signatures in degenerating photoreceptors. Further, we show that in genetically and functionally distinct IRD models, common early defects in autophagy and mitochondrial damage exist, triggering photoreceptor cell death by necroptosis in later disease stages. These results suggest that, regardless of the underlying genetic cause, these pathways likely contribute to cell death in IRDs. These insights provide potential therapeutic targets for novel, gene-agnostic treatments for IRDs applicable to the majority of patients.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

However, the sequence codes and mechanisms underpinning post-transcriptional regulation remain incompletely understood. Here, we revisit the finding from a prior massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) that AU-rich (U-rich) elements in 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) can drive upregulation or downregulation of mRNA expression depending on 3' UTR context. We unexpectedly discover that this variable regulation arises from widespread cryptic splicing, predominately from an unannotated splice donor in the coding sequence of GFP to diverse acceptor sites in reporter 3' UTRs. Splicing is activated by U-rich sequences, which function as potent position-dependent regulators of 5' and 3' splice site choice and overall splicing efficiency. Splicing has diverse impacts on reporter expression, causing both increases and decreases in reporter expression via multiple mechanisms. We further provide evidence that cryptic splicing impacts between 10 to 50% of measurements made by other published 3' UTR MPRAs.

Nutrient enrichment positively correlates with microbial aggregation. This correlation is largely attributed to the overgrowth of microalgae and the overproduction of agglomerating exopolysaccharides (EPS). However, recent studies highlight the significant contribution of bacterial EPS to algal-bacterial aggregation. Here, using controlled laboratory experiments and environmental metatranscriptomic analysis, we investigate the impact of nutrient enrichment on bacterial EPS production, while bacteria are in the context of their algal hosts. Our findings demonstrate a marked increase in bacterial EPS production in response to an increase of inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen levels, both in the lab and in the environment. These results highlight the interplay between nutrient regimes, bacterial physiology, and microbial aggregation in marine ecosystems and emphasize gaps in our understanding regarding the bacterial role in environmental processes that involve microbial aggregation.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

Their identification is critical to study the transcriptional regulation of genes controlling key traits that govern plant growth and development. They are also crucial components for the delineation of gene regulatory networks, which represent regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes. In maize, CREs have been profiled using different computational and experimental methods, but the extent to which these methods complement each other in identifying functional CREs is unclear. Here, we report the data-driven integration of different maize CRE profiling methods to optimize the capture of experimentally-confirmed TF binding sites, resulting in maps of integrated CREs (iCREs) showing increased levels of completeness and precision. We combined the iCREs with a wide diversity of gene expression data under drought conditions to perform motif enrichment and infer drought-specific GRNs. Mining these organ-specific GRNs revealed previously characterized and novel candidate regulators of maize drought response. Furthermore, by studying the transposable elements (TEs) overlapping with iCREs, we identified few TE superfamilies displaying typical epigenetic features of regulatory DNA that are potentially involved in wiring specific TF-target gene regulatory interactions. Overall, our study showcases the integration of different omics data sources to generate a high-quality collection of CREs, together with their applicability to better characterize gene regulation in the complex maize genome.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

In the current study, we characterized the effects of short-term (3-days) social isolation on the vocal and non-vocal social behaviors of adult prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) during same-sex and opposite-sex social interactions. Our experiments revealed that short-term isolation did not affect rates of ultrasonic vocalizations or time spent in non-aggressive social behaviors and huddling. In contrast, short-term isolation affected aggression in a sex- and context-specific manner during male-male interactions. Our findings highlight the importance of comparative work across species and the consideration of social context to understand the diverse ways in which social isolation can impact social behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

However, the gene regulatory networks that govern these decisions in ASCs and how they respond to challenges such as infection are often not fully understood. We use the Intestinal Stem Cells (ISCs) that maintain the adult Drosophila intestine or midgut as a model to study how transcriptional regulators govern ASC behaviour. We identify a novel role for the transcription factor (TF) Chronophage (Cph) in ISC proliferation and entero-endocrine (EE) cell differentiation. Cph is a Z2H2 zinc TF orthologous to mammalian BCL11A/B and recent work in Drosophila has demonstrated a role in regulating differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs). We show here that Cph is expressed in ISCs and EEs in the Drosophila intestine. Increased levels of Cph correlates with increased ISC proliferation and EE differentiation. cph loss-of-function leads to impaired ISC proliferation. Cph levels are elevated during tumourigenesis as well as in ageing and infection conditions. Knockdown of Cph in a Notch-mutant tumour model reduces tumour size and incidence and extends lifespan. Mechanistically, Cph overexpression leads to an increase in enteroendocrine (EE) cells and DamID DNA-binding and qRT-PCR analysis reveals that Cph directly regulates the levels of key EE regulatory genes such as Prospero (pros) and Phyllopod (phyl). In addition, Cph directly regulates core cell cycle regulators such as E2F1 as well as the TF Nerfin-1 that controls ISC proliferation and maintenance. Together, these data support a role for Cph in finetuning the balance between differentiation and proliferation during entero-endocrine differentiation.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

Parallel RNA-seq and LC-MS/MS of microdissections identified over 15,000 mRNA transcripts and 10,000 proteins, revealing thousands with local enrichment such as classes of glutamate receptors and voltage-gated potassium channels, myelin-associated molecules, and adhesion molecules. Synaptosome analysis further identified specific enrichment of molecules from collagen, ribosome, solute carrier, and receptor families at different synapses formed along CA1 neurons. By integrating mRNA and protein data, we defined clusters of co-regulated molecules such as adhesion and neurofilament proteins and transporter mRNAs, and found subsets of mRNA-protein pairs with strong correlation and anti-correlation in their abundance variation.

Recently, several tools have been reported for predicting natural product bioactivities from the sequence of the biosynthetic gene clusters that produce them. These tools have the potential to accelerate the rate of natural product drug discovery by enabling the prioritization of novel biosynthetic gene clusters that are more likely to produce compounds with therapeutically relevant bioactivities. However, these tools are severely limited by a lack of training data, specifically data pairing biosynthetic gene clusters with activity labels for their products. There are many reports of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters and bioactivities in the literature that are not included in existing databases. Manual curation of these data is time consuming and inefficient. Recent developments in large language models and the chatbot interfaces built on top of them have enabled automatic data extraction from text, including scientific publications. We investigated how accurate ChatGPT is at extracting the necessary data for training models that predict natural product activity from biosynthetic gene clusters. We found that ChatGPT did well at determining if a paper described discovery of a natural product and extracting information about the products bioactivity. ChatGPT did not perform as well at extracting accession numbers for the biosynthetic gene cluster or producers genome although using an altered prompt improved accuracy.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

ModelWe propose bootstrap evaluation of association matrices (BEAM), which integrates multiple omics profiles with multiple clinical endpoints. BEAM associates a set omic features with clinical endpoints via regression models and then uses bootstrap resampling to determine statistical significance of the set. Unlike existing methods, BEAM uniquely accommodates an arbitrary number of omic profiles and endpoints.

ResultsIn simulations, BEAM performed similarly to the theoretically best simple test and outperformed other integrated analysis methods. In an example pediatric leukemia application, BEAM identified several genes with biological relevance established by a CRISPR assay that had been missed by univariate screens and other integrated analysis methods. Thus, BEAM is a powerful, flexible, and robust tool to identify genes for further laboratory and/or clinical research evaluation.

We used Riff-Diff to scaffold a catalytic tetrad capable of efficiently catalyzing the retro-aldol reaction. Functional designs exhibit a high fold diversity, with substrate pockets similar to natural enzymes. Some of the thus generated de novo enzymes show activities rivaling those optimized by in-vitro evolution.

To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Warm White Light-Emitting Diode (LED), Cool White LED, Blue LED, and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic Puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation, and husbandry programs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic Puffin strandings remains to be the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine if aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

Logistic regression models assessed the classification accuracies of individual or combined plasma biomarkers for binarized outcomes, and Spearman correlations evaluated continuous relationships between individual plasma biomarkers and continuous outcomes.

ResultsMeasures of plasma p-tau217, either individually or in combination with other plasma biomarkers, had the strongest relationships with all AD outcomes.

DiscussionThis study identified the plasma biomarker analytes and assays that most accurately classified amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1722981986673

This oversight neglects a critical aspect of global biodiversity and potentially key players in tree health and forest ecosystem functions. Here we illuminate the microbiome inhabiting and adapted to wood, and further specialized to individual host species. We demonstrate that a single tree can host approximately a trillion microbes in its aboveground internal tissues, with microbial communities partitioned between heartwood and sapwood, each maintaining a distinct microbiome with minimal similarity to other plant tissues or nearby ecosystem components. Notably, the heartwood microbiome emerges as a unique ecological niche, distinguished in part by endemic archaea and anaerobic bacteria that drive consequential biogeochemical processes. Our research supports the emerging idea of a plant as a ""holobiont""3,4--a single ecological unit comprising host and associated microorganisms--and parallels human microbiome research in its implications for host health, disease, and functionality5. By mapping the structure, composition, and potential sources and functions of the tree internal microbiome, our findings pave the way for novel insights into tree physiology and forest ecology, and establish a new frontier in environmental microbiology.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

The ionizable lipid component within LNPs is critical to the efficient delivery of mRNA. Ionizable lipids can also trigger innate immune activation, which is beneficial for vaccine efficacy but may contribute to adverse inflammatory reactions. Engineering ionizable lipids for rapid biodegradation is a promising, yet underexplored, strategy to dampen inflammation. Here, we report the rational design and optimization of biodegradable ionizable lipids for intramuscular mRNA vaccines in mice. We show that in vivo biodegradability is enhanced by controlling lipid hydrolysis kinetics and that protein output is maximized by tuning the LNP apparent pKa. In an influenza vaccine model, the lead lipid ({delta}O3) generates equivalent neutralizing antibodies and stronger antigen-specific T cell responses compared to a benchmark lipid (SM-102) used in approved mRNA vaccines. Furthermore, by comparing ionizable lipid analogs with similar potency but opposing biodegradation kinetics, we find that faster lipid clearance from tissues coincides with a lower inflammatory response while preserving strong vaccine immunogenicity. These findings demonstrate that fast-degrading ionizable lipids can balance the efficacy and tolerability of mRNA vaccines, with implications for addressing side effects and patient acceptance of new vaccine applications.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

We examined the effect of combining antibiotics on within-patient resistance development across various bacterial pathogens and antibiotics.

We searched CENTRAL, EMBASE and PubMed for (quasi)-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published from database inception to November 24th, 2022. Trials comparing antibiotic treatments with different numbers of antibiotics were included. A patient was considered to have acquired resistance if, at the follow-up culture, a resistant bacterium (as defined by the study authors) was detected that had not been present in the baseline culture. We combined results using a random effects model and performed meta-regression and stratified analyses. The trials risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool.

42 trials were eligible and 29, including 5054 patients, were qualified for statistical analysis. In most trials, resistance development was not the primary outcome and studies lacked power. The combined odds ratio (OR) for the acquisition of resistance comparing the group with the higher number of antibiotics with the comparison group was 1.23 (95% CI 0.68-2.25), with substantial between-study heterogeneity (I2 =77%). We identified tentative evidence for potential beneficial or detrimental effects of antibiotic combination therapy for specific pathogens or medical conditions.

The evidence for combining a higher number of antibiotics compared to fewer from RCTs is scarce and overall, is compatible with both benefit or harm. Trials powered to detect differences in resistance development or well-designed observational studies are required to clarify the impact of combination therapy on resistance.","NA","medrxiv",1722981986673

Querying 1,375 genomes of the species-rich Malawi cichlid fish radiation, we discovered five large inversions segregating in the benthic subradiation that each suppress recombination over more than half a chromosome. Two inversions were transferred from deepwater pelagic Diplotaxodon via admixture, while the others established early in the deep benthics. Introgression of haplotypes from lineages inside and outside the Malawi radiation coincided with bursts of species diversification. Inversions show evidence for transient sex linkage and a striking excess of protein changing substitutions pointing towards selection on sensory, behavioural and reproductive genes. We conclude that repeated interplay between depth adaptation and sex-specific selection on large inversions has been central to the evolution of this iconic system.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

For transfer plasmids used in making AAV vectors, which are widely used in gene therapy, about 40% carried mutations in ITR regions due to their inherent instability, which is influenced by flanking GC content. We also list genes difficult to clone into plasmid or package into virus due to their toxicity.

However, this notion has recently been challenged. Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role. Our data show that the clonal dynamics of blood are consistent with a set of remarkably simple evolutionary rules which strike a balance between chance and determinism.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673

This shortcoming increases the rate of false positives and false negatives, giving rise to a potentially misleading scientific record. To address this shortcoming, many researchers now use point-and-click software to run sample size calculations.

ObjectiveWe aimed to (1) estimate how many published articles report using the G*Power sample size calculation software; (2) assess whether these calculations are reproducible and (3) error-free; and (4) assess how often these calculations use G*Powers default option for mixed-design ANOVAs--which can be misleading and output sample sizes that are too small for a researchers intended purpose.

MethodWe randomly sampled open access articles from PubMed Central published between 2017 and 2022 and used a coding form to manually assess 95 sample size calculations for reproducibility and errors.

ResultsWe estimate that more than 48,000 articles published between 2017 and 2022 and indexed in PubMed Central or PubMed report using G*Power (i.e., 0.65% [95% CI: 0.62% - 0.67%] of articles). We could reproduce 2% (2/95) of the sample size calculations without making any assumptions, and likely reproduce another 28% (27/95) after making assumptions. Many calculations were not reported transparently enough to assess whether an error was present (75%; 71/95) or whether the sample size calculation was for a statistical test that appeared in the results section of the publication (48%; 46/95). Few articles that performed a calculation for a mixed-design ANOVA unambiguously selected the non-default option (8%; 3/36).

ConclusionPublished sample size calculations that use G*Power are not transparently reported and may not be well-informed. Given the popularity of software packages like G*Power, they present an intervention point to increase the prevalence of informative sample size calculations.","NA","medrxiv",1722981986673

This review examines trends in SCD among pilots from a global perspective, analyzing evidence from 2011 to 2023, with a focus on its growing impact as a global crisis and recent findings pointing to a potential rise in incidence, particularly after 2019.

ObjectivesTo analyze the prevalence, risk factors, and prevention strategies for SCD in pilots, particularly post-COVID-19.

MethodsThe PRISMA guidelines for systematic meta-analysis was used, a search of peer-reviewed literature for international aviation databases, and pilot associations was conducted to identify relevant data. The analysis focused on trends in SCD prevalence, risk factors, prevention strategies, and recent findings, including the potential impact of COVID-19, the role of vaccination, and important biomarkers to screen for predisposition. Eligibility criteria included studies reporting SCD incidence, risk factors, or prevention strategies in pilots. Data were extracted, and meta-analyses conducted.

ResultsRecent studies suggest a potential increase in SCD incidence among pilots following the COVID-19 pandemic. Cardiovascular complications, increased stress, disruptions in healthcare, and changes in lifestyle may contribute to this potential rise. Identified risk factors include age, male gender, and cardiovascular comorbidities.

Biomarkers such as troponin, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) have been identified as potential indicators of increased SCD risk in pilots. Preventive measures include regular cardiovascular assessments and lifestyle modifications.

ConclusionSCD remains a significant and rising threat to pilots, posing a global crisis that requires immediate attention. Through a comprehensive approach that includes risk assessment, preventive measures, emergency response, and preventive protocols, the aviation industry can mitigate this risk and safeguard the lives of pilots and passengers.

This review also suggests standardized examination protocol for pilots includes regular cardiovascular risk assessment, biomarker screening, monitoring of COVID-19 and vaccination status, lifestyle modifications, and a standardized reporting system. The adoption of a standardized protocol by aviation regulatory bodies and airlines worldwide is crucial to address the growing threat of SCD among pilots and ensure the highest standards of aviation safety.","NA","medrxiv",1722981986673

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1722981986673
