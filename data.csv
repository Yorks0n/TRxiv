While infection is known to impair mitochondrial function and enhance glycolysis, the role of viral accessory proteins in these alterations remains unclear. Here, we investigate the metabolic impact of the accessory protein ORF7a. Lentiviral expression of ORF7a in human lung epithelial (A549) and monocytic (THP1) cells, coupled with integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, revealed profound dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. ORF7a impaired oxidative phosphorylation, reducing basal and maximal respiration, inducing mitochondrial depolarization, and increasing reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, ORF7a upregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), promoting pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex phosphorylation and suppressing pyruvate oxidation. However, pharmacological PDK4 inhibition did not restore respiration. High-resolution respirometry in frozen samples revealed impaired complex I function, while Blue Native-PAGE demonstrated defective respiratory supercomplex assembly. By linking enzymatic inhibition with structural destabilization, our study uncovers a functional vulnerability of the mitochondrial respiratory chain to viral manipulation. These findings establish ORF7a as a key modulator of host metabolic reprogramming and highlight mitochondrial pathways as potential therapeutic targets in COVID-19.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

Here, we present a spatially resolved, multi-omics framework that integrates whole-organ 3D imaging at cellular resolution with targeted proteomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic profiling to detect and characterize microscopic tubal lesions. Using this platform, we identified a total of 99 STICs and their presumed precursors that harbor TP53 mutations in morphologically unremarkable tubal epithelium in all five specimens obtained from cancer-free organ donors with average-risk of developing ovarian cancer. Although these lesions comprised only 0.2% of the epithelial compartment, they displayed geographic diversity, immune exclusion, metabolic rewiring, and DNA copy number changes among lesions and normal fallopian tube epithelium discovered alterations in STIC-associated genes and the pathways they control. In sum, this platform provides a comprehensive 3D atlas of early neoplastic transformation, yielding mechanistic insights into tumor initiation and informing clinical screening strategies for detecting cancer precursors in whole organs at cellular resolution.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U54CA268083;RO1CA300052;UG3CA275681;P50CA228991;R01GM149976;U01AI167892;5R01NS111039;R21NS125395;U54 HL165443;U54 DK 134301;R01 HL170107;U2CCA271891;""},{""name"":""Sloan research fellow award, a CZI Scialog award, and UCSD Startup funds"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Johns Hopkins University and Instituto Superior Técnico student exchange program (HOPTEC and FLAD)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Richard W.

However, scaffolds that recruit kinases to subcellular locations and promote signal transduction have only been described in few species. Notably, no scaffold was thought necessary for the MAPK cascade promoting sexual differentiation in fission yeast. Here, we identify the hemi-arrestin protein Sms1 as a structurally novel scaffold of this MAPK cascade. Interactions with PIP2 and the pheromone receptor-coupled G subunit target Sms1 to plasma membrane patches, where it assembles the active cascade by binding each MAP kinase. These interactions are essential for signal transduction and local signal interpretation for polarised growth. Phosphorylation, including by the MAPK itself, antagonises Sms1 membrane translocation, establishing a negative feedback that underlies polarity patch turnover and prevents untimely mating attempts. Thus, Sms1 is a MAPK scaffold with canonical functions despite its distinct structural fold, highlighting convergent evolution of MAPK scaffolds across eukaryotes.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""176396;191990;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SexYeast;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

The mechanisms that facilitate immunostimulatory ligand release from microbes during infection are largely undefined. Using the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, we describe wall teichoic acid (WTA) as a critical mediator of DNA release from bacterial cells during infection. Mechanistically, we found that the -glycosylated form of WTA, generated by the enzyme TarM, is the primary mediator of bacterial DNA release within macrophages. This process is antagonized by the enzyme O-acetyltransferase, which prevents WTA attachment to peptidoglycan. This competition among peptidoglycan modifying enzymes determines activation of cytosolic DNA receptors AIM2 and cGAS. WTA therefore operates as a meta-regulator of inflammation, by controlling the availability of microbial ligands that stimulate innate immunity.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/043z4tv69"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AI167993;R37AI116550;T32AI7061;K08AI193234;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-123-24;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00adh9b73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DK34854;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (esr1+) as well as from local esr1- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

Aged lysosomes in brain, heart, muscle and adipose accumulate glycerophosphodiesters and cystine, metabolites that are causally linked to juvenile lysosomal storage disorders like Batten disease. Levels of these metabolites increase linearly with age, preceding organismal decline. Caloric restriction, a lifespan-extending intervention, mitigates these changes in the heart but not the brain.

Mechanotransduction feedback loops convert mechanical forces into gene-expression changes that, in turn, regulate cell behaviors such as growth and extracellular matrix (ECM) production. How these loops are coupled to developmental programs to ensure robust morphogenetic outcomes remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Yap-dependent mechanotransduction establishes a self-limiting positive feedback loop that drives the successful formation of semicircular canals in zebrafish. These canals form through reproducible steps of bud initiation, extension, and fusion within the otic epithelium. Local swelling of a hyaluronan-rich ECM initiates bud formation. We demonstrate that this ECM expansion activates Yap in a spatially patterned manner within the bud. Activated Yap induces its target, ccn1l1, which drives further ECM production, establishing a positive feedback loop. The ensuing rapid ECM expansion sustains bud extension. Graded perturbations to the mechanotransduction loop reduced extension, with bud fusion remaining robust at lower levels of disruption but blocked at the highest dose. Critically, the loop contains its own termination mechanism: when buds fuse, the PKA-CREB signaling is activated by the adhesion GPCR Gpr126 to suppress ccn1l1, preventing overgrowth. These findings reveal how mechanotransduction-driven positive feedback loops can be coupled to their own termination, providing developmental control through the integration of mechanical forces with transcriptional responses and morphogenetic outcomes.","[{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R00HD098918;DP2115157;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006zn3t30"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AR083346;""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Uehara Memorial Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00gc20a07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of 'partial remapping'. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus' ability to support high-capacity memory storage.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

While this crisis has been widely discussed in other fields, its impact on physical therapy research has received little attention. Objective: This study aimed to provide an overview of the current state of physical therapy research practices that could suggest low replicability. Methods: We assessed the research practices in all original research articles published in official journals of national physical therapy associations in the USA (Physical Therapy), Canada (Physiotherapy Canada), the UK (Physiotherapy), and Australia (Journal of Physiotherapy) between 2022 and 2024. Results: A total of 465 original research articles were identified. Of these, 28% were preregistered, 0% were replication studies or registered reports, and 12% provided open data. Sample size justification was reported in 37% of quantitative studies and 23% of qualitative studies. Despite an average time from submission to publication of 400 days, only 1% of manuscripts were preprinted. Among quantitative studies, 33% stated a hypothesis, while 63% relied on significance testing. Of the reported significant p-values, 39% fell within the fragile range (.01[&le;] p<.05), substantially exceeding the expected 26% under 80% power and suggesting questionable research practices. Hypotheses were supported in 83% of cases, indicating an unreasonably high rate of positive results. A marked difference in the number of p-values just above and just below the significance threshold suggested publication bias. Conclusion: These results suggest shortcomings in the reproducibility, replicability, and transparency of the physical therapy literature. Addressing these issues requires the adoption of best practices, including registered reports, justifying sample sizes, publishing negative results, and sharing data and code. Delays in implementing these practices risk exacerbating bias in the literature and undermining the scientific credibility of physical therapy research.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758924528252

Here, we systematically investigate how physiological fluctuations in the concentrations of the pluripotency TFs OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG impact their genomic binding profiles in mouse embryonic stem cells. We uncover distinct concentration-dependent binding behaviors for each TF. NANOG occupancy increased monotonously with its concentration, even though a common set of regions made accessible by OCT4 and SOX2 are highly and uniformly bound at all NANOG concentrations.

However, their inherent low concentration in biological fluids poses significant detection challenges. Although traditional methods like real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) are highly sensitive, they require thermal cycling, limiting their application in point-of-care testing (POCT). Here, we present an isothermal amplification-based miRNA detection system integrating Three-Way Junction (TWJ) formation, Multistep Low-Temperature Amplification (L-TEAM), and CRISPR-Cas3-mediated signal amplification. The integration of the Multistep L-TEAM with the TWJ method achieves high sensitivity, detecting miRNA at concentrations as low as 10 femtomolar within 50 minutes, and effectively distinguishes single-nucleotide mismatches. When CRISPR-Cas3-mediated reaction was integrated, it still proved effective for confirming the presence of the target, but its quantitative reliability requires further optimization. We developed a predictive model using machine learning to facilitate rational optimization of experimental conditions through contribution analysis and to establish a methodology for designing more favorable sequences. The modular nature of our method permits adaptation to diverse miRNA targets without modifications to the fundamental amplification mechanism.","[{""name"":""AIZOTH Inc."",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the UTokyo Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

Using polymer simulations and high-resolution live-cell microscopy, we identify rare but long-lived chromatin encounters arising from cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. These events occur when cohesin loads near the midpoint between two loci and extrudes them through a defined spatial radius, producing encounter durations that exceed those of random collisions. We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors.

We present Spacelink, a unified framework that models spatial variability of a gene at both whole-tissue and cell-type resolution using an adaptive mixture of data-driven spatial kernels and summarizes it using an Effective Spatial Variability (ESV) metric. Spacelink achieved up to 3.2x higher detection power over eight existing global SVG and cell-type SVG methods while showing consistently superior FDR control across 34 different simulation settings and also showed superior cross-platform concordance in matched tissue Visium and CosMx datasets. Applied to 3 healthy CosMx human tissues (brain cortex, lymph node, liver), Spacelink revealed that SVGs are highly informative for 113 complex traits and diseases (average N = 340,406). Spacelink showed up to 2.2x higher disease informativeness over competing methods in tissue-relevant complex diseases and traits, conditional on putative non-spatial expression-level confounders. Applied to a mouse organogenesis Stereo-seq atlas (8 developmental stages), Spacelink identified 145 genes with stage-associated ESV within brain independent of mean expression, that are enriched in pathways like Wnt signaling and Rap1 signaling characterizing early and late development, respectively. Integration with in vivo Perturb-seq targeting 35 de novo ASD risk genes revealed that perturbations in excitatory neurons and astrocytes preferentially altered spatially structured downstream gene programs (1.7-2.2x higher average ESV across stages than other cell types), many of which were enriched for polygenic autism GWAS loci. In neurodegeneration, analysis of 32 Visium dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples spanning Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology stages identified 334 genes with decreasing ESV along amyloid burden (enriched for glycolysis) and 216 genes with decreasing ESV along tau tangle accumulation (enriched for apoptotic pathways). Several AD risk genes (PKM, CLU, GPI) showed conserved reductions in spatial variability with AD pathology in both human and 5xFAD mouse, with PKM linking to a colocalized splicing QTL and amyloid burden QTL variant. These results highlight the utility of Spacelink in decoding spatially variable gene programs that connect tissue architecture to disease genetics.","[{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R00HG012203;R01HG014008;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30CA008748;""},{""name"":""Amazon (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04mv4n011"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02yrq0923"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Alzheimer's Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0375f4d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ADSF-21-816675;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30AG10161;P30AG72975;""},{""name"":""National Institute on Aging"",""id"":""https://ror.org/049v75w11"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AG17917;R01AG015819;U01AG072572;U01AG046152;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

How its chromosome is dynamically reorganized across these contrasting states remains unclear. Here, we used synchronized predatory infections combined with time-resolved RNA-seq, Hi-C, ChIP-seq, and quantitative microscopy to map transcriptional activity and chromosome architecture across seven key stages of the predatory lifecycle. We uncover a dramatic shift in nucleoid organization - from an ultra-compact, transcriptionally restricted state in attack-phase cells to a progressively decompacted, ori-centered conformation during intracellular replication. Notably, distinct transcriptional and chromosome folding states not only mark the canonical attack and growth phases, but also critical transitions such as prey invasion, replication onset, and predator division. Temporal gene expression profiles reflect the coordinated regulation of core cellular functions across the predatory cycle. Furthermore, spatial localization of RNA polymerase, ribosomes, DNA-binding proteins, and freely diffusing proteins highlight the tight, cell cycle-dependent coupling between nucleoid compaction, chromosome accessibility, and transcriptional activity. Altogether, our findings reveal the intricate dynamics and coordination of genome folding and gene expression in a complex bacterial cell cycle driven by prey-predator interactions.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PREDATOR STG #802331;VAMPIRE COG #101171143;""},{""name"":""F.R.S.-FNRS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Crédit de Recherche &#34;PREDATOR NUCLEOID&#34;;""},{""name"":""Conseil Interuniversitaire de la Communauté Française de Belgique"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Actions de Recherche Concertées &#34;PACHIDERM&#34;;""},{""name"":""WEL Research Institute"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""WELBIO Starting Grant &#34;ARSENAL&#34;;""},{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-23-CHBS-0002;""},{""name"":""France Génomique"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-10-INBS-09;""},{""name"":""Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03356n642"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Fellowship;""},{""name"":""Institute Strategic Program Harnessing Biosynthesis for Sustainable Food and Health"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X01097X/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

Despite pioneering techniques to parameterize rhythmic and arrhythmic neural components based on power spectra, the methodology for quantifying rhythmic activity remains in its infancy. Variation in analytical choices for isolating brain rhythms from background arrhythmic activity makes interpreting findings across studies difficult. Whether current approaches can accurately recover the independent contribution of these neural signal elements remains to be established. Here, using simulation and parameter recovery approaches, we show that standard analytic methods for quantifying rhythmic activity conflate these two neurophysiological components, yielding spurious correlations between spectral model parameters. We propose an alternative approach to overcome these limitations and demonstrate effective separation of rhythmic and arrhythmic components in simulated neural time series. We validate these methods using resting-state recordings from a large cohort. Our recommendations for spectral parameterization enable the robust independent quantification of rhythmic and arrhythmic signal components for cognitive neuroscience.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

This was first made possible by fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (Fucci) technology, which distinguishes specific cell cycle phases through the reciprocal degradation of fluorescently tagged, truncated forms of human CDT1 and GMNN proteins. Fucci genetic systems have been successfully implemented in transgenic mice, zebrafish, and axolotls. To date, no viable, stably expressing Fucci line has been developed in an avian species. Although a range of continuously improving Fucci constructs have been developed in recent years, existing in vivo Fucci models remain limited because they rely on older reporter technology that fails to distinguish cells in S, G2, and M phases or to label cells in early G1. As a result, these models can be challenging to interpret and their utility for continuous cell tracking and precise analysis of cell-cycle dynamics is limited. Here, we introduce FuChi, a multicistronic Fucci-expressing chicken line incorporating a newly optimised reporter construct comprising of an mCerulean-tagged Histone H1.0 linker protein fused via a self-cleaving 2A peptide to the tandem Fucci(CA) cell cycle biosensor, with additional epitope tags included for detection in fixed tissues. We show that this system accurately discriminates and tracks cells in G1, S, G2, and M phases both in vitro and in vivo, enabling faithful visualisation of cell cycle status in intact tissues and organs. Using FuChi embryos, we mapped proliferation dynamics across developing tissues, analysed cell cycle states of migrating cells, and performed live imaging of early embryos. These latter experiments revealed that transition from S phase may be a key morphogenetic event during gastrulation as mesendoderm cells egress from the primitive streak to form embryonic structures including the prechordal plate. Pairing this advanced reporter with the intrinsic experimental advantages of the chicken embryo, positions FuChi as a premier in vivo system for studying cell-cycle kinetics in development, delivering clear technological improvements over current Fucci models. FuChi chickens provide a powerful new resource for studying embryonic development, organ growth, tissue homeostasis, disease processes, and infection responses.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BBS/E/D/10002071;BBS/E/RL/230001C;""},{""name"":""National Centre for the Replacement Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02w0kg036"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NC/T002328/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

Whilst there are known K. pneumoniae ciprofloxacin resistance determinants, there is a lack of systematic data on the effect of determinants, alone and in combination, and there are no publicly accessible tools for predicting resistance from whole genome sequence data. METHODS The KlebNET-GSP AMR Genotype-Phenotype Group aggregated a matched genotype-phenotype dataset of n=12,167 K. pneumoniae species complex (KpSC) isolates from 27 countries between 2001-2021. We developed a rules-based classifier to predict ciprofloxacin resistance by categorizing the number of quinolone resistance determining regions mutations in gyrA and parC, the number of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, and the presence/absence of aac(6')-Ib-cr (which can acetylate ciprofloxacin). Predictive performance was assessed using the discovery dataset, for which we re-phenotyped discrepant isolates; and validated using externally contributed datasets (n=7,030 KpSC isolates). RESULTS The rules-based classifier predicted R vs S/I with categorical agreement, sensitivity, and specificity >96%, and major/very major error rates <4%. Performance was similar across diverse KpSC sources (human, animal, other), species, and intra-species lineages. External validation of the classifier yielded overall 93.12% categorical agreement [95% confidence interval (CI), 92.50-93.74%], 8.65% major errors [95% CI, 7.34-9.97%], and 6.20% very major errors [95% CI, 5.51-6.90%]. We implemented the classifier in Kleborate, a command-line tool that is integrated into the Pathogenwatch web platform. Using this to assess the global distribution of ciprofloxacin resistance determinants in KpSC genomes available in Pathogenwatch (n=31,319, from 109 countries between years 2000-2023), we observed a significant positive association between national quinolone consumption rates and predicted ciprofloxacin resistance (R2=0.20, p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS Ciprofloxacin resistance phenotypes can be reasonably predicted from genotypes, which is sufficient for informing surveillance. However, unexplained resistance remains and accuracy is insufficient for clinical applications. We demonstrate the value of aggregating genotype-phenotype data to explore resistance mechanisms and develop predictors, but highlight complexities in combining phenotype data from different assays and standards.","[{""name"":""Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV025280, INV077266;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""226432/Z/22/Z;""},{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""773830;""},{""name"":""Trond Mohn Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TMF2019TMT03;""},{""name"":""SARA project (Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance in Africa, through a grant from the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs within the Fonds de solidarité pour les projets innovants (FSPI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Academy of Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00c489v88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Health Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""UK Vietnam MRC Newton Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/N029399/1 RG83380;""},{""name"":""National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR207397;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

We analyzed 4,101 strains, representing 70 species, collected from grapevine- and oak-associated substrates at 17 vineyard and 20 non-vineyard sites in the USA and Slovenia. Species frequency varied with geography and substrate, but the majority of species commonly present in vineyards were also found in non-vineyard arboreal environments, representing a potential source for vineyard colonization and exploitation of sugar from grapes.

B-ALL is a malignant disease displaying considerable phenotypical and functional heterogeneity, yet the underlying cellular organization remains largely elusive. This study aims to investigate the hierarchical landscape of B-ALL by combining barcoding and multiome single cell data to unveil the differentiation architecture and temporal dynamics of leukemic differentiation at clonal and single cell resolution in vivo.

Single-cell transcriptome and AbSeq analysis of lentiviral barcoded and transplanted patient-derived B-ALL cells revealed interconnected subpopulations, which could be prospectively isolated via surface markers and exhibited distinct leukemogenicity. Barcode tracking demonstrated the ability of cells to differentiate from a source cluster into differentiated progeny. Using machine learning we identified expression patterns predicting their differentiation potential of each barcoded cell within the immature cell compartment. To determine the dynamical properties of clones, we have designed a mathematical model that simulates the development of these subpopulations from a clonally diverse stem cell compartment. The model confirmed the most likely cluster of origin, supporting our functional data, and revealed the variability in dynamical properties between clones, while largely excluding plasticity. Hence, our work demonstrates a unidirectional differentiation in B-ALL with an immature population exhibiting a high leukemogenic potential.

Key pointsO_LIA differentiation hierarchy with distinct leukemogenesis potential in B-ALL is demonstrated via clonal tracing and mathematical modeling.

Previous simulation studies have shown that early treatment initiation is critical to maximize the therapeutic response in antiviral treatment in an acute viral infection such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. A recent experimental study demonstrated that late therapy initiation can lead to diminished antiviral potency. However, most VD model simulations with varying treatment initiation time accounted only for the effect of initiation condition (i.e., state of different cell populations when the therapy started), the loss of drug potency has been under-investigated. This may overestimate the antiviral effect, potentially resulting in suboptimal dose selection. To this end, we aimed to characterize relationship between the drug potency (EC50) and the timing of drug addition, using nirmatrelvir and GS-441524 against SARS-CoV-2 as an example. Viral load data were obtained from in vitro experiments with various drug concentrations and treatment initiated between 0 to 3 days post infection. EC50 values were fitted for each treatment initiation group and were found to vary with the timing of treatment initiation in both drugs. Also, a VD model with time-varying EC50 provided better fits than a constant EC50 model (BIC = 1667.90 vs. 1677.84). Further simulations also indicated that a constant EC50 model overestimated the antiviral efficacy when treatment started late. These findings highlighted the importance of considering EC50 shift when optimizing dosage regimens for patients presenting late.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

We evaluated the accuracy, including plasmid reconstruction, of Nanopore long-read only genome assemblies of Enterobacterales.

We sequenced 92 genomes from clinical Enterobacterales isolates, collected in England under a national surveillance program, with long-read Nanopore (R10.4.1, Dorado v5.0.0 super-high-accuracy basecalled) and short-read Illumina (NovaSeq) sequencing approaches. Genomes were assembled using three long-read only (Flye; Hybracter long; Autocycler), and three hybrid assemblers (Hybracter hybrid; Unicycler normal; bold). Three polishing modalities (Medaka v2 with subsampled or un-subsampled long-reads; Polypolish + Pypolca with short-reads) were investigated.

Autocycler circularised the most chromosomes (87/92 [95%]). Plasmid sequence reconstruction was comparable between all assemblers except Flye, all recovering 90-96% of plasmids, although the  ground truth was uncertain. Flye performed worse than other assemblers on almost all metrics. Autocycler + Medaka (un-subsampled long-reads) was the most accurate long-read only assembler/polisher combination, comparable to hybrid assemblies (median 0 [IQR:0-0] SNPs and 0 [IQR:0-1] indels per genome; quality value/Q score, 100 [IQR: 64-100]), with only 4/92 genome sequences having >10 SNPs/indels. Medaka polishing with un-subsampled long-reads resulted in small improvements in indels but not SNPs for both Flye and Autocycler assemblies. Seven-locus MLST, antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and stress gene annotation was equivalent across assembler/polisher combinations.

Nanopore long-read only bacterial genome assembly with Autocycler combined with Medaka polishing (using un-subsampled reads) is similarly accurate and possibly more complete than hybrid assemblies, representing a viable alternative for incorporating high-quality genomic data, including plasmids, into Enterobacterales surveillance.

Impact StatementNanopore long-reads have historically been too error-prone to use alone for accurate bacterial genome assembly, necessitating additional Illumina short-reads to achieve structurally complete and accurate  hybrid genome assemblies for public health surveillance. This increases cost and complexity. Previous studies have shown that recent improvements in Nanopore chemistry (R10.4.1 flowcell) and basecalling (super-high accuracy) allow high-quality long-read only assemblies on a small number of laboratory reference strains. This is the first evaluation, to our knowledge, to assess Nanopore long-read only genome assembly compared with hybrid assembly on a large number of clinical isolates. In addition, this is the first large-scale evaluation of the recently released automated consensus long-read assembly tool, Autocycler.

We show that Autocycler long-read only assemblies are more structurally complete for chromosomal sequences, while reconstructing a similar number of plasmids to other long-read and hybrid assemblers. Most long-read polished, Autocycler-assembled genome sequences have 0 errors (median: 0 SNPs/indels) relative to a short-read polished (hybrid) Autocycler assemblies, enabling accurate annotation of key genes.","[{""name"":""National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR207397;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

Here, we characterized the sole annotated P-type calcium ATPase in Solibacillus silvestris, which was previously shown to be upregulated under MICP conditions. We named the protein YloB based on homology to the Bacillus subtilis protein. Structural modeling confirmed that YloB possesses the conserved domains and motifs typical of calcium binding P-type ATPases. Deletion of yloB did not affect growth under elevated calcium levels nor did it reduce MICP yields, indicating that YloB is dispensable for calcium detoxification and biomineralization. In contrast, {triangleup}yloB cells produced only partially dehydrated spores with severely reduced heat resistance, a defect rescued by complementation. A YloB-mNeonGreen fluorescent fusion localized specifically to the cell membrane surrounding the forespore during early engulfment, and was retained at this site throughout the remainder of sporulation. A transcriptional PyloB-msfGFP reporter demonstrated that yloB transcription was induced in the early stages of sporulation, but did not respond to a calcium stimulus. These results show that YloB does not act to detoxify calcium from the cytoplasm of S. silvestris, but rather functions to pump calcium into the forespore, enabling Ca-dipicolinic acid accumulation and proper spore maturation. Our study reveals a specialized role for a bacterial calcium ATPase in sporulation, distinguishing calcium transport for endospore development from biomineralization and global calcium homeostasis.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

The repressed var genes have a distinct genome organization where they localize as a cluster near the nuclear periphery and are bound by PfHP1 (P. falciparum Heterochromatin Protein 1). However, the mode of regulation of var genes by PfHP1 remains unclear. In this study, we show that PfHP1 undergoes phase separation in vitro in an RNA and DNA-dependent manner. Single-molecule DNA tethering experiments further revealed that AT-rich DNA sequences act as nucleation sites for the assembly and compaction of PfHP1-mediated heterochromatinization. We have also identified point mutations in the IDRs (intrinsically disordered regions) of PfHP1 that disrupt its phase separation as well as DNA compaction in vitro. To assess the dynamic properties of PfHP1 condensates in vivo, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in GFP tagged PfHP1 parasites, which revealed rapid fluorescence recovery, supporting their fluidity and phase separation behaviour. Ectopic expression of PfHP1 phase separation and DNA compaction mutants led to dispersed nuclear localization of PfHP1, in contrast to the punctate appearance of the wild-type protein and altered chromatin binding at var genes. These results were corroborated with DiCre/loxP-based conditional expression of the same PfHP1 mutants, which also led to the de-repression of multiple var genes (as many as 54 out of 60 var genes), mimicking the phenotype of PfHP1 depletion mutants. Hi-C sequencing of PfHP1 mutants revealed loss of interactions in the heterochromatic regions, indicating that PfHP1 phase separation is an essential mechanism for repressive cluster formation. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the role of PfHP1-mediated phase separation in heterochromatin formation and var gene silencing; unveiling a fundamental mechanism that drives antigenic variation in P. falciparum.","[{""name"":""Minitsry of Education india (MoE)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MoE-STARS-2/2023-0249;""},{""name"":""SERB, India"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRG/2023/001838;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

On the macroscopic level the engrams are not static either: numbers of engram neurons in different brain regions change over time, which is considered to reflect the process of memory consolidation. Here we predict a link between these two levels, using a novel statistical physics approach to engram modeling. Importantly, it is general as it makes only minimal assumptions on the engram's nature, does not rely on a specific architecture, and its fundamental implications hold for any representational drift with random component. Our first, analytically well tractable model shows that an entropic force emerges at the region level from random representational drift at the neuronal level. We refine the model by incorporating the interaction of the entropic force with biological processes that shape neuronal engrams. Here, the connectivity between the brain regions strongly influences the (quasi-)equilibrium engram distribution. The obtained distributions are in qualitative agreement with the ones of a biologically detailed drifting assembly model. Our engram description allows to predict the engram evolution in large neuronal systems such as the mouse brain. We find several predictions that are consistent across the valid tested parameter ranges, such as a strong tendency of the engram to leave the hippocampus. The results suggest that the brain operates in a regime where engrams drift, both deterministically and randomly, to allow for memory consolidation.","[{""name"":""German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""01GQ1710;""},{""name"":""German Research Society (DFG)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""430156448;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

This Gram-negative bacterium establishes pathogenicity through formation of multicellular communities, known as biofilms, that result in significant resistance to antibiotics and host immune systems. In Pa, the motile-to-biofilm transition is regulated through an interconnected signaling network known as the Gac Multikinase Network (Gac-MKN). This network comprises two regulatory branches: the HptB signaling network and GacS/A signaling network. In the Gac-MKN, several histidine kinases converge to regulate the activity of the post-transcriptional regulator protein, RsmA. Although previous studies have assessed the role of individual kinases in this network, the role of each Gac-MKN kinase in regulating RsmA activity has not been quantitatively characterized and compared in side-by-side experiments in the same reference strain, which is presented here. In this study, we show that kinases NahK and RetS are the predominant regulators of the Gac-MKN. Through controlled testing of RsmA-dependent phenotypes, we demonstrate loss of nahK or retS leads to complete inactivation of RsmA, triggering biofilm formation. Our results support previous findings that RetS regulates RsmA through the GacS/A network but present the new finding that NahK is the central kinase involved in HptB phosphorylation; previous studies have attributed HptB phosphorylation to PA1611 and SagS. Our findings demonstrate that NahK signaling controls RsmA activity to rapidly transition between the motile and biofilm states. We anticipate the results of this study will facilitate the use of targeting the Gac-MKN to trigger biofilm dispersal for improved antibiotic treatment.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM118894;T32GM136572;K12GM102778;""},{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CHE-2050541;""},{""name"":""Marcus and Kimberley Boehm"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

This necessitates continuous RBC production, resulting in [~]200 billion new RBCs made per day to maintain oxygen delivery. Despite this enormous biosynthetic demand, the metabolic pathways supporting erythropoiesis are poorly understood. We profiled metabolites across four independent models of elevated erythropoiesis and a consistent increase in aspartate levels emerged when compared to controls. This suggested a potential role for aspartate metabolism in RBC production. To test this, we deleted the aspartate aminotransferases Got1 or Got2 globally or in an erythroid-specific manner. Loss of either enzyme resulted in anemia, with Got2 deficiency producing a more severe phenotype. Individual loss of either Got or dual Got deletion led to an erythroid defect, where early progenitors accumulated. In human and mouse models of erythropoiesis, GOT1 and GOT2 loss had opposing impacts on aspartate despite exhibiting similar anemic phenotypes, suggesting an aspartate-independent function for these enzymes. GOT1 and GOT2 are also components of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), which regulates NAD(H) homeostasis. However, conditional deletion of another MAS enzyme, Mdh1, did not cause anemia, and alleviating NADH reductive stress in GOT2-deficient cells with cytoplasmic bacterial NADH oxidase (LbNOX) failed to restore erythropoiesis. Instead, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses revealed dysregulation of chromatin histone modifications in GOT-deficient erythroid cells, implicating epigenetic dysfunction as a driver of defective erythropoiesis. Collectively, these findings identify a previously unrecognized role for GOT1 and GOT2 as a central link between metabolism and epigenetic regulation during erythroid development. These insights may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies for anemia.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R37 CA015910;RO1 CA025560;R01 CA001120;R01 CA148828;R01 CA245546;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00adh9b73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 DK095201;U2C DK129445;""},{""name"":""National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Division of Intramural Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/023ny1p48"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 HL148333;R01 HL157062;F31 HL172674-02.;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

While energetics of base pairing interactions are relatively well established, our understanding of the energetic contributions of base stacking remain incomplete. Here, we use a combination of single-molecule and computational biophysics approaches to investigate the effect of strand polarity on base-stacking energetics. We designed pairs of DNA constructs with reversed stacking polarities at nick sites, along with corresponding no-stack controls to isolate stacking contributions. Performing single-molecule force-clamp assays with a Centrifuge Force Microscope (CFM), we observed polarity-dependent differences in stacking energetics. These differences were most pronounced in purine-purine and certain purine-pyrimidine interactions. Notably, a 5' purine stacked on a 3' pyrimidine was generally more stable than the reverse polarity. We employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to observe stacking interfaces in the DNA constructs. The simulations were qualitatively consistent with our experiments, and showed positional differences between opposite polarity stacking pairs, giving some insight into the origin of these polarity differences. Overall, these results demonstrate that base polarity can modulate stacking stability and should be considered when designing short duplex regions such as overhangs in molecular biology and biotechnology applications.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM124720;R35GM133469;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

E2F1, a canonical activator of cell-cycle genes, is sufficient to induce reentry from quiescence, but how it overcomes chromatin-mediated repression remains unclear. Here, we show that inducible E2F1 expression triggers exit from quiescence and progression through the cycle without changes in chromatin accessibility, by harnessing regulatory elements with limited, pre-existing accessibility. Using time-resolved transcriptomics, we demonstrate that E2F1 induces an accelerated transcriptional program compared to serum. Unlike serum, which triggers broad chromatin remodeling, E2F1-induced activation occurs in a context of limited accessibility. ChIP-seq reveals that E2F1 directly binds target sites in quiescent cells to upregulate canonical genes. Biochemical reconstitution shows that E2F1 binds nucleosomes and accesses internal E2F sites within histone-wrapped DNA. These findings suggest that E2F1 can engage nucleosome-associated DNA and initiate transcription without major chromatin reorganization, redefining transcription factor-chromatin dynamics during cell fate transitions and establishing E2F1 as a potent regulator of cell-cycle reentry.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM147395;R35GM145255;P01CA254867;K12GM139185;K99GM126027/R00GM126027;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council (NWO Domain Science Board)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2021/ENW/01120083;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NucEM, No. 884331;""},{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SNF#: 310030_214852;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

The posterior insular cortex (pInsCx) contains representations of internal states and sensory cues, amongst them auditory stimuli. Nevertheless, the possibility of plastic encoding of auditory responses in the pInsCx during fear learning, and its underlying synaptic mechanisms have not been addressed. Using single-unit recordings in the pInsCx of male mice during fear learning, we find that ~ 10% of putative principal neurons acquire a response to an auditory CS during fear learning (""CS learners""). CS learners are enriched in the insula auditory field (IAF) of the dorsal pInsCx, and strongly overlap with a larger neuronal subpopulation which increases its activity during movement initiation. Using optogenetic circuit mapping, we find that the IAF receives glutamatergic synapses from the non-lemniscal auditory thalamus and the auditory cortex (A1); fear learning induces a postsynaptic form of LTP at the cortical, but not at the thalamic input synapse. Combined single-unit recordings and optogenetic axon silencing showed that the acquired CS-response during fear recall depends on transmission at the A1 [-&gt;] pInsCx synapse. Our study shows that the pInsCx generates a plastic representation of an auditory CS during fear learning, driven by LTP of an associative cortical input. Future work should further investigate how the integration of CS- and movement information in the insula contributes to the expression of auditory-cued fear memories.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""31003A_176332 / 1;310030_204587 / 1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

Indeed, in sensory-cognitive experiments participants tend to align their respiration to the upcoming expected trials and their respiratory phase relates to neurophysiological processes reflecting changes in neural excitation, attention or arousal. However, it remains unclear whether this alignment is a passive entrainment to a task's overall rhythm or an active process selectively aligning respiration based on the demands of individual events. We here tested this by recording respiration during three visual discrimination experiments that manipulated trial importance by either imposing different response deadlines or by manipulating trial value and difficulty. Our results show that participants align their respiration more consistently around stimulus onset for trials with short deadlines or trials presenting high-value and high-difficulty. These findings demonstrate that respiratory alignment is dynamically modulated on a trial-by-trial basis according to the anticipated required effort or task demands. Hence we conclude that respiration serves as an active tool to strategically allocate cognitive resources for sensory-motor challenges.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

The accuracy of downstream models depends on how well predicted poses match experimentally-validated poses. Although the ideal input to these downstream tasks would be experimental structures, the time and cost required to collect new experimental structures for synthesized compounds makes obtaining this structure for every input intractable. Thus, leveraging available structural data is required to efficiently extrapolate new designs. Using data from the open science COVID Moonshot project---where nearly every compound synthesized was crystallographically screened---we assess several popular strategies for generating docked poses in a structure-enabled discovery program using both retrospective and prospective analyses.

We find that a simple strategy using molecular similarity to identify relevant structures for template-guided docking is successful in predicting poses for the SARS-CoV-2 main viral protease. Further efficiency analysis suggests template-based docking of a scaffold series is a robust strategy even when the quantity of available structural data is limited.

We formalize state predictability as a quantitative proxy for plasticity, where stable states are predictable and plastic states are not. Applied to epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) in breast cancer, the framework shows that mesenchymal states are stabilized by recurrent copy number alterations and microenvironmental cues, whereas hybrid states remain unpredictable and plastic. It also uncovers a long-range influence of myofibroblasts on EMP, demonstrating that stromal remodeling can propagate plasticity across tissue regions. Our framework yields interpretable, scale-aware insights into intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of state transitions, providing a broadly applicable strategy for modelling dynamic cell states in spatial biology.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""218529/Z/19/Z;204841/Z/16/Z;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/T042184/1;MR/Y034031/1;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/R01356X/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

Despite this, the high dimensionality of molecular representations greatly complicates its sampling, analysis, and visualization. A popular approach to overcome problem is to project these representations to a ""human-manageable"" subspace, usually containing only two dimensions. Non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques are by far the preferred strategy, following the reasoning that their flexibility can accommodate any arbitrary distribution originally present in the high-dimensional space. However, this ignores the elevated computational cost of these methods and the difficulty in tuning their hyper-parameters. Here, we show that basic properties of the metrics used in the original space can be used to infer the shape of the chemical space, which in turns suggests an optimal strategy to project chemical information to lower dimensions. The key insight is to realize that, no matter the set of molecules, their fingerprint representation can be considered to lie on a hyper-spherical surface. The smooth nature of this manifold means that we can use clustering to identify locally-dense sectors of chemical space, and selectively project them simply using linear (hyper-parameter free) methods, like principal component analysis. This approach surpasses non-linear techniques in several neighborhood preservation metrics, while only requiring a fraction of the computational cost. This pipeline is implemented in our N-Ary Mapping Interface (NAMI: https://github.com/mqcomplab/NAMI), which we tested in the visualization of 10 million molecules.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM150620;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

Specifically, reversing an ancestral mutation bias (e.g., in Escherichia coli, shifting from a transition-biased to a transversion-biased mutation spectrum) enhances access to under-sampled variants, increasing the supply of beneficial mutations. However, the effect of mutation bias relative to other factors influencing adaptation remains unclear. By experimentally evolving wild type and mutator E. coli strains in different growth media, we show that mutation bias reversal facilitates early adaptation, altering the genetic basis of adaptation and the type of mutations accumulated under selection. Together, mutation bias, mutation rate, and initial fitness correctly predicted relative adaptation rates for any pair of strains.

This condition continues to be extremely difficult to treat, as we grapple with its neural and behavioral complexities. What we are missing is a comprehensive account on how naive brains react to occasional and chronic cocaine use, abstinence and re-exposure within subject. We tracked naive macaques using precision functional mapping before, during and after chronic cocaine self-administration over a period of nine months. We analyzed the entire brain to illustrate the pervasive impact of chronic cocaine use on overall function. Although we set out to map the addiction connectome, we found that the neural correlates of chronic drug use and recovery are more complex that can be captured by a singular, canonical connectome. We provide a preclinical model that maps the progression of the macaque functional connectome from a naive state through chronic cocaine use, recovery and re-exposure. We demonstrate that the addiction connectome is dynamic and is characterized by the interaction of subject by drug by time. Occasional cocaine use, whether initial or re-exposure, overrides individual differences, leading to a strong homogenous effect across subjects, or convergence. However, the brain's response to prolonged cocaine use becomes more individualized, resulting in the divergence of effects across subjects. This can be explained by heterogeneity in cocaine-induced effects and in their associated timescales. Abstinence-induced neural alterations converged across subjects after 1-month, but by 2 months, individual trajectories revealed heterogeneity, possibly indicating differences in recovery.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Drug Abuse"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00fq5cm18"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30 DA048742;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 MH128177;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting 'spacetime attractor' excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219525/Z/19/Z;225926/Z/22/Z;219627/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GAT3955;GAT3755;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0040/2024-L;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 651-2023;""},{""name"":""Fondation Fyssen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

We observed signatures of several proposed memory mechanisms including magnitude coding, repetition suppression, sparse coding, and population response consistency, but only sparse coding and population response consistency predicted behavior.

Although pain states increase vulnerability to opioid use disorders, the neural mechanisms underlying this interaction remain incompletely understood. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a key site for opioid actions, and emerging evidence suggests that pain states and opioid experience both induce transcriptional, molecular, and circuit adaptations in the VTA that contribute to motivated behaviors. However, the transcriptional responses of distinct VTA cell types to each of these factors (alone or in combination) have not been identified. Here, we employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to comprehensively define transcriptional alterations in the rat VTA to acute morphine administration in a chronic inflammatory pain model. We report that morphine induces gene expression changes primarily in glial cells and dopamine neurons, with minimal effects in other neuronal cell types. Surprisingly, VTA astrocytes and oligodendrocytes exhibited the most robust transcriptional responses to opioid exposure, despite lacking detectable opioid receptor expression. Among the most highly regulated glial genes was Fkbp5, which encodes a co-chaperone protein that acts in concert with heat shock proteins to modulate stress responses. Using pharmacological and CRISPR-based approaches in rat glial cells and human astrocytes, we demonstrate that regulation of Fkbp5 is mediated indirectly through glucocorticoid signaling rather than direct opioid receptor activation. These findings reveal that glial cells within reward circuits undergo profound transcriptional reprogramming in response to opioids through indirect, stress-hormone mediated mechanisms, highlighting a previously unappreciated non-neuronal contribution to opioid-induced neural adaptations.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01DA053743;R01DA054714;K99MH127244;""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Neurobiology of Brain Disorders Award;""},{""name"":""UAB Center for Addiction and Pain Prevention and Intervention"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pilot Award;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

In the brain parenchyma, it is executed by microglia, which are encumbered by large numbers of apoptotic debris generated during development, in adult neurogenic niches, aging, and brain diseases. Emerging evidence suggest that phagocytosis is not limited to garbage disposal, but triggers adaptations in the phagocytes that may have a functional impact. To test it we developed an in vivo model of superphagocytosis induced by low cranial irradiation (LCI, 2Gy) that specifically induced apoptosis in the neurogenic niche of the adult hippocampus, synchronizing microglia in a phagocytic state within 6h and leading to full clearance by 24h. Single cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics revealed an unexpected oxidative stress in post-phagocytic microglia, accompanied by catabolic shutdown, mitochondrial remodeling, increased expression of galectin 3, and production of polyamines that led to cell death and compensatory proliferation. To test whether these changes impaired subsequent microglial phagocytosis, we used a glioblastoma model treated with sequential irradiation to induce tumor cell apoptosis. The phagocytosis efficiency of tumor-associated microglia/macrophages was comparable in the first and second apoptotic challenge, suggesting that the metabolic remodeling induced by phagocytosis was adaptive and destined to sustain their functionality. Finally, we assessed the functional impact of post-phagocytosis adaptations using galectin 3 deficient mice under LCI. We found that the recovery of the neurogenic niche after LCI strongly depended on galectin 3, demonstrating the regenerative capacity of post-phagocytic microglia. Overall, our data unveils the complexity of post-phagocytosis adaptations in microglia, underscoring their unexplored therapeutic potential in brain disorders.","[{""name"":""Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation Competitiveness"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RTI2018-099267-B-I00;PID2022-136698OB-I00;RYC-2013-12817;""},{""name"":""Basque Government"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00pz2fp31"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IT1473-22;PIBA 2020_1_0030;""},{""name"":""Tatiana Foundation Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P-048-FTPGB 2018;""},{""name"":""Alzheimer's Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0375f4d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AARG-NTF-24-1304352;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

Here we show that the prevalence of sideways locomotion in true crabs reflects a single evolutionary origin from a forward-moving ancestor. Our behavioral analysis of 50 live crab species indicates that crab locomotion can be separated into two distinct types, sideways and forward locomotion, with no intermediates. The phylogenetic comparative analysis revealed a single origin of sideways locomotion, with multiple independent reversions to forward locomotion in ecologically specialized groups. The species richness data show that the lineage in which sideways locomotion originated is far more diverse than its nearest outgroups. These results suggest that sideways locomotion acted as a key innovation, potentially promoting adaptive radiation by enabling true crabs to exploit a wide range of ecological niches. Such a rare but innovative behavioral trait provides a framework for understanding how locomotor modes shape evolutionary diversification in animals.","[{""name"":""Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from The Japan Science Society"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-4086;2025-4060;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

However, the conditions and mechanisms that lead to the robust induction of respiratory IgA responses following mucosal vaccination remain poorly understood. It is also currently debatable whether mucosal vaccination is still warranted given that most individuals in developed countries have established a hybrid immunity from vaccination and infection. Here we characterized respiratory mucosal immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination or both in humans. We found that hybrid immunity resulted in moderately increased respiratory IgA and neutralizing antibody responses compared to infection or vaccination alone. However, a direct comparison of hybrid immunity and a mucosal adenovirus-based booster vaccination in animal models revealed that respiratory booster immunization elicited markedly stronger and more durable respiratory IgA, T cell response, and protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, supporting the promise of respiratory mucosal vaccination. Mechanistically, we found that mucosal booster immunization induced local IgA- secreting cells in the respiratory mucosa, aided by pulmonary CD4+ T cells in situ. Strikingly, local IL-21-producing Blimp-1+ Th1 effector cells were critical in mediating the CD4+ T cell help for respiratory IgA production. Furthermore, lung macrophages were important for this respiratory IgA response via the production of TGF-{beta}. Consequently, we demonstrated delivery of adenoviral booster to the lower airway was necessary to generate robust upper and lower airway IgA responses.

Interleaving the two tasks hindered performance when their structures were similar, compared to when they were different. In contrast, blocked training produced the opposite effect: it improved performance and facilitated transfer across similar tasks. This effect, however, emerged only when participants first learned the conceptual task, followed by the spatial task, suggesting an asymmetric interaction between task order and structural similarity.

In light of this, we developed FixGrower, a standardized protocol for center-port fixation training. FixGrower (1) requires a longer initial fixation requirement, (2) increases the required fixation duration at session boundaries customized to each animals performance, and (3) delays the introduction of violation penalties until the end of training. We demonstrate FixGrower decreases training time by 61%, yields low violation rates, and generalizes across rodent species and task difficulty. Moreover, the success of this curriculum is well supported by theories of operant conditioning and reinforcement learning.

Radial growth, reflected by an increase in fiber cross-sectional area, is mediated through an mTORC1-dependent signaling pathway, whereas longitudinal growth, marked by the in-series addition of sarcomeres, is mediated through an mTORC1-independent signaling pathway. To gain further insight into the events that drive longitudinal growth, we combined BONCAT-based labeling of newly synthesized proteins with high-resolution imaging and determined that the in-series addition of sarcomeres is mediated by a process that involves transverse splitting at the Z-lines of pre-existing sarcomeres. Collectively, our findings not only challenge the long-standing view that mechanically induced growth is uniformly governed by mTORC1, but they also lay the framework for a new understanding of the molecular and structural events that drive this process.

To account for the brains anatomically nested structure, we developed and applied a hierarchical statistical framework that detects region-specific changes in activity and outperforms conventional methods that treat brain regions as individual, unrelated units. These distributed signals formed ensembles with consistent and anatomically structured patterns of activity, both within subregions and across multiple connected brain areas. By combining TRAP2-based activity tagging with acute whole-brain c-Fos staining, we identified morphine- and withdrawal-activated ensembles and found that they are largely non-overlapping at the single-cell level, even within the same brain region. Integration with existing spatial transcriptomics datasets identified molecular markers for these state-specific ensembles in key brain areas such as the nucleus of accumbens, amygdala and ventral tegmental areas. Lastly, by integrating Allen mouse whole-brain transcriptional datasets, we identified the molecular identity of the morphine- administration and withdrawal ensembles.

Current pathological models emphasize defects in nuclear mechanics and transcription regulation. Yet these models do not fully explain the complexity of EDMD or other laminopathies. Here, we uncover an emerging pathway linking nuclear lamina defects to the reorganization of cytoplasmic biophysics, revealing how nuclear dysfunction cascades throughout the cell. Using Caenorhabditis elegans EDMD models, we demonstrate that lamin mutations dramatically alter cytoplasmic organization, reducing macromolecular crowding and increasing diffusivity of 40 nm Genetically Encoded Multimeric (GEM) nanoparticles. These striking biophysical changes coincide with nuclear positioning defects and collapsed endoplasmic reticulum architecture, mirroring phenotypes associated with ribosome depletion. We propose a mechanism where mutations in the C. elegans lamin lmn-1 disrupt nucleolar density and ribosome biogenesis, creating a nucleolar-ribosomal axis that propagates defects from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Genetic interactions between lmn-1 and ribosomes support this regulatory relationship. While individual depletion of other nuclear envelope proteins produces minimal effects, combined loss of the functionally redundant emerin ortholog emr-1 and LEM-domain protein lem-2 phenocopied lmn-1 mutants, demonstrating that cytoplasmic biophysical disruption lies at EDMDs pathogenic core.

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid.

This clade has been plagued by uncertainty, particularly concerning the phylogenetic relationships between its four major subclades: Gyrinocheilidae (algae eaters), Catostomidae (suckers), Cobitoidei (loaches), and Cyprinoidei (minnows and carps). Phylogenomic approaches require high-quality genomic resources, which have been lacking for the family Gyrinocheilidae, a key lineage for understanding cypriniform evolution. To address this, we generated the first chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation for the Chinese Algae Eater (Gyrinocheilus aymonieri). We utilized this new genome along with 42 other fish genomes to conduct comprehensive phylogenomic analyses and compare results from sequence-based methods with a microsynteny-based approach. Although chromosome-level macrosynteny is broadly conserved among cypriniforms, we demonstrate that microsynteny has impressive power to resolve deep phylogenetic nodes. Both sequence-based and microsynteny-based analyses find that Gyrinocheilidae is the sister lineage to all other cypriniforms, resolving a long-standing phylogenetic point of contention. However, while sequence-based analyses provided weak support for the relationships among the remaining subclades, our microsynteny analysis revealed a novel and strongly supported sister relationship between Catostomidae and Cyprinoidei. This conclusion is supported by a 3- to 12-fold greater number of shared microsynteny clusters (synapomorphies) compared to the alternative topologies. We also demonstrate that microsynteny synapomorphies often arise from gene family expansions. Conservation of synteny concentrated in specific genomic regions may harbor the genomic underpinnings of the unique aspects of these clades and have played an important role in the evolutionary history of these taxa. Together, these results provide a robust phylogenomic backbone for Cypriniformes. More broadly, our findings highlight the power of microsynteny to resolve recalcitrant phylogenetic nodes where sequence data is uninformative, while also underscoring the critical importance of high-quality reference genomes, as our work also shows that including fragmented assemblies can lead to spurious results. Beyond phylogenomics, our results also provide a functional genomics glimpse into how conserved, clade-specific blocks of collinear genes (synteny synapomorphies) might contribute to what makes this hyperdiverse clade so unique and evolutionarily successful.","[{""name"":""University at Buffalo, State University of New York"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01y64my43"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TJK laboratory startup funds;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

For example, someone talking about their hand is not referring to the other speakers hand, but the word ""hand"" still carries speaker-general information (e.g., having five fingers). These two requirements impose a cross-speaker generalization / differentiation dilemma that is not well addressed by existing theories. We hypothesized that the brain resolves the dilemma by use of a vectorial semantic code that blends collinear and orthogonal coding subspaces. To test this hypothesis, we examined semantic encoding in populations of hippocampal single neurons recorded during conversations between epilepsy patients and healthy partners in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU). We found clear semantic encoding for both spoken and heard words, with strongest encoding just around the time of utterance for production, and just after it for reception. Crucially, hippocampal neurons codes for word meaning were poised between orthogonalized and collinearized. Moreover, different semantic categories were orthogonalized to different degrees; body parts and names were most differentiated between speakers; function words and verbs were least differentiated. Finally, the hippocampus used the same coding principle to separate different partners in three-person conversations, with greater orthogonalization between self and other than between two others. Together, these results suggest a new solution to the problem of binding word meanings with speaker identity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits.

We found stronger inhibition by wMelM (median relative dissemination: 0.04) than wAlbB (median relative dissemination: 0.19).

However, the mechanisms underlying rearrangements of L1 retrotransposition intermediates are poorly understood. To address this gap, we developed GFP-based recombination reporter assays to study the formation of L1 retrotransposition-mediated rearrangements. Using these reporters combined with long-read sequencing approaches, we find that L1 retrotransposition intermediates can recombine with distal DNA breaks to generate chromosomal rearrangements. We also find that two distinct L1 insertion intermediates can recombine with each other to generate chromosomal rearrangements. Both types of rearrangements depend on L1-encoded ORF2p endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities. Using these reporters, we discover that L1 retrotransposition-mediated rearrangements are robustly induced when the recombining sequences share homology and that their formation requires the homologous recombination factor BRCA1.

To this end, large-scale CRISPR screens have been conducted to perturb thousands of candidate enhancers. Using these data, predictive models have been developed that aim to generalize such findings to predict which enhancers regulate which genes across the genome. However, existing CRISPR methods and large-scale datasets have limitations in power, scale, or selection bias, with the potential to skew our understanding of the properties of distal regulatory elements and confound our ability to evaluate predictive models. Here, we develop a new framework for highly powered, unbiased CRISPR screens, including an optimized experimental method (Direct-Capture Targeted Perturb-seq (DC-TAP-seq)), a random design strategy, and a comprehensive analytical pipeline that accounts for statistical power. We applied this framework to survey 1,425 randomly selected candidate regulatory elements across two human cell lines. Our results reveal fundamental properties of distal regulatory elements in the human genome. Most element-gene regulatory interactions are estimated to have small effect sizes (<10%), which previous experiments were not powered to detect. Most cis-regulatory interactions occur over short genomic distances (<100 kb). A large fraction of the discovered regulatory elements bind CTCF but do not show chromatin marks typical of classical enhancers. Housekeeping genes have similar frequencies of distal regulatory elements compared to other genes, but with 2-fold weaker effect sizes. Comparisons to the predictions of the ENCODE-rE2G model suggest that, while performance is similar across two cell types, new models will be needed to detect elements with weaker effect sizes, regulatory effects of CTCF sites, and enhancers for housekeeping genes. Overall, this study describes the first unbiased, perturbation-based survey of thousands of distal regulatory element-gene connections, and provides a framework for expanding such efforts to build more complete maps of distal regulation in the human genome.","[{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Genomic Mechanisms of Disease"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF21SA0072102;""},{""name"":""NHGRI Impact of Genomic Variation on Consortium"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UM1HG011972;""},{""name"":""NHLBI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HL159176;""},{""name"":""NHGRI Genomic Innovator Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35HG011324;""},{""name"":""NSF Graduate Research Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DGE-1656518;""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG011664;""},{""name"":""AHA Postdoctoral Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""821920 and 23POSTCHF1019753;""},{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DMS-2113072 and NSF DMS-2310654.;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility.

Although ""correlation does not imply cau-sation"" has become a cliche, leveraging correlations effectively--and understanding their inferential pitfalls--remains a nuanced challenge. Correlation-based analyses are typically not able to yield causal conclusions, yet they are fre-quently used to underpin causal narratives in neuroscience research and especially in clinical contexts, which represent a problematic case of overinterpretation.

Using causal inference reasoning, simulations and analytic methods, we address three critical questions when performing resting-state fMRI:

O_LIHow reliable are correlation estimates for capturing cross-regional synchrony?
C_LIO_LIWhat are the consequences of inaccuracies in estimated correlations?
C_LIO_LITo what extent do estimated correlations reflect causal neural interactions?
C_LI

We identify two principal pitfalls. First, correlation estimates are systematically distorted by diverse noise sources, including variability in neurovascular coupling, which can generate spurious, suppressed, or even reversed effects. Second, graph-based approaches lack causal interpretability, meaning that even large samples and strong statistical evidence may obscure fundamental ambiguities in what the correlations represent. In light of these challenges, we advocate for three priorities: (1) cautious interpretation that avoids causal overreach, (2) multimodal validation to cross-check findings against independent measures, and (3) enhanced methodological rigor, particularly in biomarker discovery and clinical trials, to ensure that resting-state fMRI provides meaningful insights.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ZICMH002888;ZIAMH002783;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

However, it remains unclear how the nutrients released during cell lysis affect the growth dynamics of the remaining bacterial population. Addressing this gap, we built a controlled system consisting of two Escherichia coli lysogenic strains: one carrying a wild-type{lambda} prophage and the other a temperature-inducible variant that can be induced to lyse at 38 {degrees}C. Using this system, we selectively induced phage lysis in a defined fraction of the population and quantified both total biomass and the biomass of surviving, non-lysed cells. We observed that the biomass loss was consistently smaller than expected based on the fraction of lysed cells, supporting the idea that some of the released biomass is rapidly recycled by the non-lysed population. To formalize the observed dynamics and obtain quantitative insight, we developed a mathematical model showing that nutrients released during lysis can transiently enhance the growth rate of the surviving, non-lysed cells. This effect emerges on a short timescale of minutes, consistent with the rapid onset of biomass compensation observed experimentally. The growth rate increase was confirmed in single-cell experiments using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, where we cultured wild-type lysogens in lysate-containing culture supernatants. In summary, the results suggest that nutrients released through lysis are rapidly consumed, leading to an acceleration in the growth rate of non-lysed cells. The consequent partial compensation for cell loss can substantially influence the population dynamics, highlighting phage lysis as a direct modulator of bacterial growth. Overall, our findings provide quantitative insights into how phage-mediated lysis affects the physiology of non-lysed bacterial cells, extending beyond its well-established role in biomass recycling.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""180575;225148;188642;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions. We envision that this method will further lower the molecular weight limit of single-particle cryo-EM, enabling its application to important drug-binding complexes that are below 50 kDa.","[{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

For such predictions to be useful, they should be updated when environments change. We investigated how and when new learning shapes hippocampal representations of temporally extended sequences, and how this updating relates to flexible predictions about future events. Human participants learned sequences of environments in immersive virtual reality. They then learned novel environment transitions connecting previously separate sequences. During subsequent fMRI, participants predicted multiple steps into the future in both the newly connected sequence and control sequences that remained separate. The hippocampus integrated representations of the connected sequence, such that activity patterns became more similar across trials for the connected sequence vs. the unconnected sequences. These integrated sequence representations in the hippocampus emerged soon after learning, incorporated representations of the initial sequences as well as new activity patterns not previously present in either sequence, and predicted participants ability to update their predictions in behavior. Together, these results advance our understanding of how structured knowledge dynamically emerges in service of adaptive behavior.","[{""name"":""National Eye Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wkg3b53"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01EY034436;Zuckerman Institute Seed Grant for MR Studies;CU-ZI-MR-S-0016;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

Here, we identify mechanically activated ion channels PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 as key mechanotransducers required for labor progression. Genetic deletion of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in mice resulted in weakened uterine contractions and severe parturition defects. Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either the uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects, whereas combined loss significantly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing showed that loss of PIEZO reduced expression of connexin43 (Gja1), a gap junction protein in uterine smooth muscle cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to impaired contraction. These findings highlight the critical role of PIEZO channels in mechanotransduction during parturition and suggest therapeutic targets for labor dysfunction.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 NS105067;R01AT012051;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-2405-20;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CMMI-2135428;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2DK128800;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252

However, this knowledge is fragmented across resources and often is not directly accessible for analytical methods. We developed OmniPath (https://omnipathdb.org/), a database combining diverse molecular knowledge from 168 resources. It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

This study identified more than 421 million single-nucleotide variants and indels and more than 600 million copy-number and structural variants. Small variants had 756 million molecular effects annotated. Of 7.7 million polymorphic variants having an allele frequency (AF) of more than 5% in EGP, 1,348 have a predicted deleterious effect on a protein. Characterization with respect to global variation shows that EGP represents a genetic continuum encompassing the range of African, Asian, and European populations. It is best described by two Arabian, an Eurasian, and an African component, with the predominant Arabian component linked to mitochondrial haplogroups J and T that are commonly attributed to the Middle East. Various aneuploidies of sex chromosomes were detected in 93 individuals overall, and aneuploidy of chromosome 21 was identified in 41 individuals. Median inbreeding coefficient and cumulative runs of homozygosity (ROHs) lengths were increased due to extensive consanguinity, were largest in the groups with Arabian main ancestry components, and were higher than reported for Qatar. Families were identified based on genetic relatedness and classified into 264 families with unrelated parents and 247 families with third- and fourth-degree consanguineous parents. Representative consanguineous pedigrees of families in EGP were outlined. Cumulative ROHs were affected by the main ancestry component and significantly increased in offspring of consanguineous parents, with a pronounced difference between 3rd and 4th-degree relatedness. Investigation of cumulative AFs of variants causing Mendelian diseases highlighted genes related to alpha- and beta-thalassemia (HBB, HBA2) and showed a high burden of variants causing severe recessive diseases, metabolic and retinal disorders, and hearing loss. In summary, EGP represents a landmark effort in characterizing the genetic diversity of the Emirati population, leveraging the largest Middle Eastern cohort reported to date.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758924528252

The anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus broadcasts the head-direction (HD) signal, which is generated in the brainstem, particularly in the upstream lateral mammillary nucleus, and thalamic HD cells remain coordinated even during sleep. Here, by recording and manipulating neuronal activity along the mammillary-thalamic-cortical pathway, we show that coherence among thalamic HD cells persists even when their upstream inputs are decorrelated, particularly during non-Rapid Eye Movement sleep. These findings suggest that thalamic circuits are sufficient to generate and maintain coherent population dynamics in the absence of structured input.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758924528252
