Reconstruction of visual input from human fMRI data has garnered significant attention in recent years. Comparatively less focus has been directed towards vision reconstruction from single-cell recordings, despite its potential to provide a more direct measure of the information represented by the brain. Here, we achieve high-quality reconstructions of videos presented to mice, from the activity of neurons in their visual cortex. Using our method of video optimization via gradient descent through a state-of-the-art dynamic neural encoding model we reliably reconstruct 10-second movies at 30 Hz from two-photon calcium imaging data. We achieve a {approx} 2-fold increase in pixel-by-pixel correlation compared to previous reconstructions of static images from mouse V1, while also capturing temporal dynamics. We find that critical for high-quality reconstructions are the number of neurons in the dataset and the use of model ensembling.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

However, evidence for a dominant female role in these societies has been scarce. We studied social organisation, mobility patterns and gendered practices in Neolithic Southwest Asia using 131 paleogenomes from Catalhoyuk East Mound (7100-5950 BCE), a major settlement in Central Anatolia with an uninterrupted occupation and an apparent egalitarian structure. In contrast to widespread genetic evidence for patrilocality in Neolithic Europe, the Catalhoyuk individuals revealed no indication of patrilocal mobility. Analysing genetic kin ties among individuals buried in the same house (co-burials) across 35 Catalhoyuk buildings, we identified close ties concentrated within buildings and among neighbours in Catalhoyuks Early period, akin to those in the preceding Pre-Pottery Neolithic in Southwest Asia. This pattern weakened over time: by the late 7th millennium BCE, subadults buried in the same building were rarely closely genetically related, despite sharing similar diets. Still, throughout the sites occupation, genetic connections within Catalhoyuk buildings were much more frequently connected via the maternal than the paternal line. We also identified differential funerary treatment of female subadults compared to those of males, with a higher frequency of grave goods associated with females. Our results reveal how kinship practices changed while key female roles persisted over one thousand years in a large Neolithic community in western Eurasia.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans.

These communication patterns can be comprehensively mapped using noninvasive functional imaging, resulting in functional connectivity (FC) networks. Despite its popularity, FC is a statistical construct and its operational definition is arbitrary. While most studies use zero-lag Pearsons correlations by default, there exist hundreds of pairwise interaction statistics in the broader scientific literature that can be used to estimate FC. How the organization of the FC matrix varies with the choice of pairwise statistic is a fundamental methodological question that affects all studies in this rapidly growing field. Here we comprehensively benchmark the topological and geometric organization, neurobiological associations, and cognitive-behavioral relevance of FC matrices computed using a large library of 239 pairwise interaction statistics. We comprehensively investigate how canonical features of FC networks vary with the choice of pairwise statistic, including (1) hub mapping, (2) weight-distance trade-offs, (3) structure-function coupling, (4) correspondence with other neurophysiological networks, (5) individual fingerprinting, and (6) brain-behavior prediction. We find substantial quantitative and qualitative variation across FC methods. Throughout, we observe that measures such as covariance (full correlation), precision (partial correlation) and distance display multiple desirable properties, including close correspondence with structural connectivity, the capacity to differentiate individuals and to predict individual differences in behavior. Using information flow decomposition, we find that differences among FC methods may arise from differential sensitivity to the underlying mechanisms of inter-regional communication, with some more sensitive to redundant and some to synergistic information flow. In summary, our report highlights the importance of tailoring a pairwise statistic to a specific neurophysiological mechanism and research question, providing a blueprint for future studies to optimize their choice of FC method.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

Using a live-cell imaging assay for the translation of the PINK1 precursor, we show that local translation of PINK1 requires a concerted interplay between mitochondria and the ER in neurons. For efficient translation, the Pink1 mRNA needs to relocate to ribosomes located near endolysosomes and the ER. The ER membrane-tethered chaperone DNAJB6 then shields the PINK1 precursor on transit to mitochondria following the ER-SURF pathway. Loss of DNAJB6 hence leads to persistence of ER/endolysosome-associated PINK1 precursor stores and failure of mitophagy upon mitochondrial damage.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

Plants actively guard these openings through defense mechanisms that have been described extensively for stomates, the most common points of entry. However, bacteria from the genus Xanthomonas have specialized in that they enter their host via hydathodes--a poorly studied organ at the leaf margin involved in guttation. While hydathodes can mount an effective immune response against bacteria, a dedicated perception mechanism still needs to be discovered. To identify a hydathode-specific immune receptor, we mapped a novel resistance gene against X. campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) in Arabidopsis using an inoculation procedure that promotes natural entry via hydathodes. Using Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) between susceptible accession Oy-0 and resistant Col-0, a QTL for resistance was identified on the right arm of Chromosome 5 in Col-0. Combining this finding with results of a genome-wide association analysis, a single candidate gene was fine-mapped that encoded a coiled-coil nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (CNL) immune receptor protein called SUPPRESSOR OF TOPP4 1 (SUT1). Whereas the ZAR1 immune receptor acts in the vasculature against Xcc, we establish that SUT1 already restricts Xcc in hydathodes but is ineffective in the vasculature. In corroboration, we confirm promoter activity of SUT1 in the epithem tissue within hydathodes. Altogether, we provide evidence for an NLR that confers hydathode-specific resistance in Arabidopsis against infection by Xcc.

Author summaryBlack rot disease, caused by the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc), is an economically relevant disease of cabbage crops. Xcc is rather unique in that it enters the plant interior through specialized organs at the edge of the leaf. These structures called hydathodes contain water pores and are involved in leaf water regulation. Although we know that hydathodes can mount an immune response against these bacteria, specific immune receptors still need to be discovered. In our search for hydathode resistance mechanisms, we use the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to identify genetic targets that could be translated to cabbage breeding practices. Here, by screening large populations of genetically diverse Arabidopsis plants, we could pinpoint a genetic locus that is involved in hydathode resistance. On this locus, we identified a gene, SUT1, that confers resistance against Xcc, restricting early hydathode colonization by the bacteria and reducing subsequent disease symptoms. Interestingly, this resistance is ineffective in later stages of infection when the bacteria colonize the plant vascular system. Therefore, this study provides new insights in hydathode-specific resistance and opens doors for more research on these tissue- or organ-specific resistance mechanisms in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

Sampling many trees and sequences under an evolutionary model, we train the network to learn a function that enables predicting the former from the latter. Under a commonly used model of protein sequence evolution and exploiting GPU acceleration, it outpaces fast distance methods while matching maximum likelihood accuracy on simulated and empirical data. Under more complex models, some of which include dependencies between sites, it outperforms other methods.

Effective antimicrobial therapy reduces complications and mortality; however, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major problem in many endemic countries. Prevention through vaccination is possible through recently-licensed Gavi-supported typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs), and national immunisation programs are currently being considered or deployed in several countries where AMR prevalence is known to be high. Pathogen whole genome sequence data are a rich source of information on Typhi variants (genotypes or lineages), AMR prevalence, and mechanisms. However, this information is currently not readily accessible to non-genomics experts, including those driving vaccine implementation or empirical therapy guidance.

ResultsWe developed TyphiNET (https://www.typhi.net), an interactive online dashboard for exploring Typhi genotype and AMR distributions derived from publicly available pathogen genome sequences. TyphiNET allows users to explore country-level summaries such as the frequency of pathogen lineages, temporal trends in resistance to clinically relevant antimicrobials, and the specific variants and mechanisms underlying emergent AMR trends. User-driven plots and session reports can be downloaded for ease of sharing. Importantly, TyphiNET is populated by high-quality genome data curated by the Global Typhoid Pathogen Genomics Consortium, analysed using the Pathogenwatch platform, and identified as coming from non-targeted sampling frames that are suitable for estimating AMR prevalence amongst Typhi infections (no personal data is included in the platform). As of February 2024, data from a total of n=11,836 genomes from 101 countries are available in TyphiNET. We outline case studies illustrating how the dashboard can be used to explore these data and gain insights of relevance to both researchers and public health policy-makers.

ConclusionsThe TyphiNET dashboard provides an interactive platform for accessing genome-derived data on pathogen variant frequencies to inform typhoid control and intervention strategies. The platform is extensible in terms of both data and features, and provides a model for making complex bacterial genome-derived data accessible to a wide audience.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

METEORs have a unique composition; MICOS enrichment sites are depleted of mtDNA and matrix proteins and contain high levels of the Ca2+ uniporter MCU, suggesting a functional specialization. METEORs are also enriched for the myosin MYO19, which promotes their trafficking to a small subset of filopodia.

Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1719353146604

In Ghana, no published studies have been conducted to evaluate the quality of COVID-19 data submitted onto the national web-based platform, District Health Information Management System version 2 (DHIMS-2) during the COVID-19 period. In this regard, this study seeks to assess the estimates and determinants of COVID-19 data quality in the DHIMS-2 in the Ahafo region of Ghana.

MethodsA facility-based cross-sectional study design was employed, with a desk review of COVID-19 records in DHIMS-2 and primary data sources (registers and monthly reporting forms). This study involved all 23 different levels of healthcare facilities that reported on COVID-19 in the Ahafo region from March 2020 to December 2022. We assessed COVID-19 data quality using three dimensions of completeness, accuracy, and timeliness according to the World Health Organization data quality guide. Mixed-effect logistic regression was then employed to identify the determinants of COVID-19 data quality at a 95% confidence interval.

ResultsThe overall COVID-19 data quality was estimated at 35.9% (95%CI=32.6%, 39.4%) while the rate of the data dimensions of timeliness, completeness, and accuracy were 50.2% (95%CI=46.7%, 53.8%), 50.6% (95%CI=47.1%, 54.2%), and 72.4% (95%CI=69.1%, 75.5%) respectively. It was found that the availability of a functional data validation team at the health facilities (AOR=18.3; 95%CI=1.62, 20.7; p= 0.019), training of data managers in COVID-19 data management (AOR=9.37; 95%CI=2.56, 34.3; p=0.001), and data managers with two-year professional training (certificate background) (AOR=3.42; 95%CI=1.95, 12.2; p=0.025) were independently associated with COVID-19 data quality.

ConclusionThe overall COVID-19 data quality in the Ahafo region was quite poor. Dimensionally, while the rate of data timeliness was high, that of data completeness, and accuracy were relatively low. The interaction of the independent correlates of COVID-19 data quality requires the healthcare system to identify stringent measures to strengthen the health information system to enhance planning and decision-making, especially during disease outbreaks.","NA","medrxiv",1719353146604

These events constitute a nationwide trauma with major ramifications for public mental health. This article presents an evidence-based model for the prediction of the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to the terrorist attack and the war.

Main bodyThe creation of the model consisted of several steps. Firstly, the Israeli population was divided into six groups based on the intensity, context, and type of traumatic exposure (direct exposure to terror, close proximity to terror, soldiers in combat and support units, intense exposure to rocket attacks, moderate exposure to rocket attacks, and indirectly affected communities), and the population size of each group was assessed using official national databases. Secondly, an estimation of the expected prevalence of PTSD in each of the exposure groups was based on a review of the relevant literature. A random-effects meta-analysis of the prevalence rates was conducted separately per each exposure group. Finally, the predicted number of PTSD causalities in the population was calculated by multiplying the group size and the PTSD prevalence estimation. Based on population size and estimated PTSD prevalence within each exposure category, the model predicts that approximately 5.3% (N=519,923) of the Israeli population (95% prediction interval, 160,346-879,502), may develop PTSD as a result of the terrorist attack and the war.

ConclusionsThe predicted number of individuals with PTSD following mass trauma is expected to be considerable. The presented model can assist policymakers, clinicians, and researchers in preparing and devising adequate interventions for the mental health needs of large populations. Moreover, this model can be applied in other instances of mass-trauma exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1719353146604

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 were a key line of defense for unvaccinated or immunocompromised individuals. However, these mAbs are now ineffective against current SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we tested three aspects of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. First, we tested whether Fc engagement is necessary for in vivo clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Secondly, we tested bi-specific killer engagers (BiKEs) that simultaneously engage SARS-CoV-2 and a specific Fc receptor. Benefits of these engagers include the ease of manufacturing, stability, more cell-specific targeting, and high affinity binding to Fc receptors. Using both mAbs and BiKEs, we found that both neutralization and Fc receptor engagement were necessary for effective SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Thirdly, due to ACE2 being necessary for viral entry, ACE2 will maintain binding to SARS-CoV-2 despite viral evolution. Therefore, we used an ACE2 decoy Fc-fusion or BiKE, instead of an anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody sequence, as a potential therapeutic that would withstand viral evolution. We found that the ACE2 decoy approach also required Fc receptor engagement and, unlike traditional neutralizing antibodies against specific variants, enabled the clearance of two distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants. These data show the importance of Fc engagement for mAbs, the utility of BiKEs as therapies for infectious disease, and the in vivo effectiveness of the ACE2 decoy approach. With further studies, we predict combining neutralization, the cellular response, and this ACE2 decoy approach will benefit individuals with ineffective antibody levels.

Here, we report the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle herds across several states in the U.S. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory distress, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state.

Brain imaging studies in living humans show changes in brain metabolism and structure that may contribute to the MT-associated brain disease risk. Although deficits in ovarian hormones have been implicated, cellular and molecular studies of the brain undergoing MT are currently lacking, mostly due to a difficulty in studying MT in postmortem human brain. To enable this research, we explored 39 candidate biomarkers for menopausal status in 42 pre-, peri-, and post-menopausal subjects across three postmortem tissues: blood, the hypothalamus, and pituitary gland. We identified thirteen significant and seven strongest menopausal biomarkers across the three tissues. Using these biomarkers, we generated multi-tissue and tissue-specific composite measures that allow the postmortem identification of the menopausal status across different age ranges, including the ""perimenopausal"", 45-55-year-old group.

PV-INs are particularly vulnerable to cell loss, potentially due to their increased metabolic demands arising from their uniquely high level of electrical activity, which render them susceptible to metabolic pressure. Here, we use single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNAseq) data from a rodent model of TBI, as well as human TBI data, and demonstrate PV-INs have unique metabolic specializations that are lost after injury and can be rescued by in vivo treatment with the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose. We generated a novel PV-IN transcriptional identity module comprised primarily of genes encoding specialized ion channels, metabolic enzymes, and synaptic machinery, that identifies heterogenous subsets of injury-associated PV-INs with loss of PV-IN transcriptional identity. We show that changes in metabolic specialization are coupled to changes in transcriptional identity in PV-INs and implicate the PV-IN-enriched transcriptional co-activator, Ppargc1a, as a key driver of PV-IN transcriptional metabolic dysfunction. We also identify a family of long non-coding RNAs enriched in this subset of transcriptionally dysfunctional PV-INs that negatively correlates with PV-IN metabolic specialization. Lastly, we utilize these tools to interrogate a published human TBI snRNAseq data set and find nearly identical changes, underscoring the importance of PV-IN metabolic dysfunction in the pathology of TBI.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

Rnf is widespread in primordial organisms and the evolutionary predecessor of the Na+-pumping NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (Nqr)1. By running in reverse, Rnf reduces ferredoxin with NADH as reductant at the expense of the transmembrane electrochemical ion gradient and provides low potential electrons for nitrogenases as well as CO2 reductases. Yet, the molecular principles that couple the long-range electron transfer to the Na+ translocation across the membrane remain elusive. Here we resolve key functional states along the electron transfer pathway using redox-controlled cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that, in combination with biochemical functional assays and atomistic molecular simulations, provide key insight into the redox-driven Na+ pumping mechanism. We show that the reduction of the unique membrane-embedded [2Fe2S] cluster in the vestibule between the RnfA/E subunits electrostatically attracts the sodium ions, and in turn, triggers an inward/outward transition with alternating membrane access driving the Na+ pump and the reduction of NAD+. Our study unveils an ancient mechanism for redox-driven ion pumping, and provides key understanding of the fundamental principles governing energy conversion in biological systems.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

The type of architecture that evolves depends strongly on migration rate, as weakly selected loci experience swamping and do not make stable contributions to divergence. Simulations from previous studies showed that even when mutations are strongly selected and should resist migration swamping, the architecture of adaptation can collapse and become transient at high mutation rates. Here, we use an analytical two-population model to study how this ""mutation swamping"" phenomenon depends upon population size, strength of selection, and parameters determining mutation effects. To do this, we developed a mathematical theory based on the diffusion approximation to predict the threshold mutation rate above which swamping occurs, and find that this performs well across wide range of parameter space, based on comparisons with individual-based simulations. The mutation swamping threshold depends most strongly on the average effect size of mutations, and weakly on the strength of selection, but is only minimally affected by population size. Across a wide range of parameter space, we observe that mutation swamping occurs when the trait-wide mutation rate is 10-3-10-2, suggesting that this phenomenon is potentially relevant to complex traits with a large mutational target. On the other hand, based on the apparent stability of genetic architecture in many classic examples of local adaptation, our theory suggests that per-trait mutation rates are often relatively low.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

The hypervirulence is strongly linked to the overproduction of hypermucovisous capsule, but the underlining regulatory mechanism of hypermucoviscosity (HMV) has been elusive, especially at the post-transcriptional level mediated by small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs). Using a recently developed RNA interactome profiling approach, we interrogate the Hfq-associated sRNA regulatory network and establish the intracellular RNA-RNA interactome in HvKP. Our data reveal numerous interactions between sRNAs and HMV-related mRNAs, and identify a plethora of sRNAs that repress or promote HMV. One of the strongest repressors of HMV is ArcZ, which is activated by catabolite regulator CRP and targets many HMV-related genes including mlaA and fbp. We discover that MlaA and its function in phospholipid transport is crucial for capsule retention and HMV, inactivation of which abolished Klebsiella virulence in mice. ArcZ overexpression significantly reduced bacterial burden in mice and reduced HMV in multiple carbapenem-resistant and hypervirulent clinical isolates with diverse genetic background, indicating it is a potent RNA inhibitor of bacterial pneumonia with therapeutic potential. In summary, our work unravels a comprehensive map of the RNA-RNA interaction network of HvKP and identifies a novel CRP-ArcZ-MlaA regulatory circuit of HMV, providing mechanistic insights into the posttranscriptional virulence control in a superbug of global concern.

While it is known that the infralimbic region (IL) of the medial prefrontal cortex mediates retrieval of an extinction memory through projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the contribution of the IL to extinction learning is not well-understood. Given the strong projection from the IL to the basal forebrain (BF), a center of attentional processing, we investigated whether this pathway participates in extinction, and compared it to the IL-BLA pathway. Using retrograde tracing, we first demonstrate that projections from the IL to the BF originate from superficial (L2/3) and deep cortical layers (L5), and that they are denser than IL projections to the BLA. Next, combining retrograde tracing with labeling of the immediate early gene cFos, we show increased activity of the L5 IL-BF pathway during extinction learning and increased activity of the L2/3 IL-BLA pathway during extinction retrieval. Our in vitro recordings demonstrate that neurons in the IL-BF pathway become more excitable towards the end of extinction learning, but less excitable during extinction retrieval. Finally, using optogenetics we show that inactivation of the IL-BF pathway impairs extinction learning, leaving retrieval intact.

Anxiety and stress-related changes in IL physiology could affect one or multiple lines of communication, impairing different aspects of extinction.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

However, large size also poses biophysical challenges, especially regarding the transport of nutrients to all cells; these constraints are typically overcome through multicellular innovations (e.g., a circulatory system). Here we show that an emergent biophysical mechanism -- spontaneous fluid flows arising from metabolically-generated density gradients -- can alleviate constraints on nutrient transport, enabling exponential growth in nascent multicellular clusters of yeast lacking any multicellular adaptations for nutrient transport or fluid flow. Surprisingly, beyond a threshold size, the metabolic activity of experimentally-evolved snowflake yeast clusters drives large-scale fluid flows that transport nutrients throughout the cluster at speeds comparable to those generated by the cilia of extant multicellular organisms. These flows support exponential growth at macroscopic sizes that theory predicts should be diffusion limited. This work demonstrates how simple physical mechanisms can act as a  biophysical scaffold to support the evolution of multicellularity by opening up phenotypic possibilities prior to genetically-encoded innovations. More broadly, our findings highlight how cooption of conserved physical processes is a crucial but underappreciated facet of evolutionary innovation across scales.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

Despite the fundamental importance of BLTPs for cellular function, the architecture, composition, and lipid transfer mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Here, we present the subunit composition and the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the native LPD-3 BLTP complex isolated from transgenic C. elegans. LPD-3 folds into an elongated, rod-shaped tunnel whose interior is filled with ordered lipid molecules that are coordinated by a track of ionizable residues that line one side of the tunnel. LPD-3 forms a complex with two previously uncharacterized proteins, here named ""Intake"" and ""Spigot"", both of which interact with the N-terminal end of LPD-3 where lipids enter the tunnel. Intake has three transmembrane helices, one of which borders the entrance to the tunnel; Spigot has one transmembrane helix and extends 80 [A] along the cytosolic surface of LPD-3. Experiments in multiple model systems indicate that Spigot plays a conserved role in ER-PM contact site formation. Our LPD-3 complex structural data, together with molecular dynamics simulations of the transmembrane region in a lipid bilayer, reveal protein-lipid interactions that suggest a model for how the native LPD-3-complex mediates bulk lipid transport and provide a foundation for mechanistic studies of BLTPs.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

This approach aims to perform simultaneous antibody sequencing and epitope mapping using a combination of single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and bottom-up proteomics techniques based on mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We evaluate the performance of the deep-learning tool ModelAngelo in determining de novo antibody sequences directly from reconstructed 3D volumes of antibody-antigen complexes. We demonstrate that while map quality is a critical bottleneck, it is possible to sequence antibody variable domains from cryoEM reconstructions with accuracies of up to 80-90%.

This provides a functional guide to assemble de novo peptides from LC-MS/MS data more accurately and improves the tolerance to a background of polyclonal antibody sequences. Following this proof-of-principle, we discuss the feasibility and future directions of this approach to characterize antigen-specific antibody repertoires.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

We tested whether this division of metabolic labour changes plastically and evolves when offspring are experimentally deprived of their parents metabolic assistance. In the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides parents deposit oral fluids on their carrion nest during pre-hatching care, and facultatively transfer fluids to larvae through oral trophallaxis as post-hatching care. We analysed the oral fluid proteomes of replicate experimental populations that had been evolving for 50 generations with or without post-hatching care, and which were then allowed to raise larvae with or without post-hatching care for one experimental generation. We found that parents and larvae plastically and evolutionarily adjusted the proteins in their oral fluids when we prevented post-hatching care. When reared in the absence of post-hatching care, larvae that evolved without post-hatching care were also more capable of consuming carrion proteins than larvae that had evolved with post-hatching care, and had higher survival. Our results suggest that metabolic division of labour within families is plastically modulated, and that the extent of socially modulated plasticity can evolve rapidly when social conditions change.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

The mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) evolve separately from nuclear genomes, and they can therefore provide relevant insights into the evolution of their host species. Fusarium oxysporum is a major fungal plant pathogen that is assumed to reproduce clonally. However, horizontal chromosome transfer between strains can occur through heterokaryon formation, and recently signs of sexual recombination have been observed. Similarly, signs of recombination in F. oxysporum mitogenomes challenged the prevailing assumption of clonal reproduction in this species. Here, we construct, to our knowledge, the first fungal pan-mitogenome graph of nearly 500 F. oxysporum mitogenome assemblies to uncover the variation and evolution. In general, the gene order of fungal mitogenomes is not well conserved, yet the mitogenome of F. oxysporum and related species are highly co-linear. We observed two strikingly contrasting regions in the Fusarium oxysporum pan-mitogenome, comprising a highly conserved core mitogenome and a long variable region (6-16 kb in size), of which we identified three distinct types. The pan-mitogenome graph reveals that only five intron insertions occurred in the core mitogenome and that the long variable regions drive the difference between mitogenomes. Moreover, we observed that their evolution is neither concurrent with the core mitogenome nor with the nuclear genome. Our large-scale analysis of long variable regions uncovers frequent recombination between mitogenomes, even between strains that belong to different taxonomic clades. This challenges the common assumption of incompatibility between genetically diverse F. oxysporum strains and provides new insights into the evolution of this fungal species.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

However, the molecular mechanisms that drive plant physiological responses to soil Zn deficiency are not well understood. We used an untargeted metabolomics approach to search for metabolites exuded from roots during Zn deficiency stress, which led to the discovery of a collection of secreted small defensin-like peptides in Arabidopsis thaliana (named Zinc-Deficiency Responsive Peptides (ZDRPs)). Phylogenetic analysis and untargeted metabolomics revealed ZDRPs in at least eleven accessions of A. thaliana and nine members of the Brassicaceae family. Analysis of Arabidopsis gene mutants and overexpressing lines, in combination with chemical complementation experiments, unveiled a critical role of these peptides in plant root growth. We hypothesize that Brassicaceae secreted peptides enable plants to expand their root mass to reach Zn-rich soil layers and optimize Zn uptake. These data reveal a critical relationship between plant survival, Zn status, root morphology and peptide production. Taken together, our results expand our knowledge regarding micronutrient deficiency responses in plants and could enable in engineering approaches to make plants more resilient to low Zn conditions.

SignificanceZinc deficiency is the most abundant micronutrient deficiency affecting about 50% of arable lands thus presenting a high burden for plant health and agriculture globally. In this study, we reveal a metabolic strategy by Brassicaceae to deal with low Zn concentrations. We characterize the role of peptides expressed upon zinc deficiency in a variety of important crop plants. The discovery of a cryptic class of peptides that are made by plant roots specifically suffering from Zn deficiency provides critical insight into the molecular mechanisms by which plants dynamically acclimate to nutrient-limited soils. The identification of peptides actively secreted by zinc-deprived plants has translational value for sustainable agriculture, human health, and bioengineering approaches to enable tolerance to low zinc.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

Mounting evidence suggests that mixed compared to monospecific planted forests may store more C, exhibit lower susceptibility to climate extremes and offer a broader range of ecosystem services. However, experimental studies comprehensively examining the control of tree diversity on multiple C stocks and fluxes above- and belowground are lacking. To address this gap, we leverage data from the Sardinilla experiment in Panama, the oldest tropical tree diversity experiment which features a gradient of one-, two-, three- and five-species mixtures. Over 16 years, we measured multiple above- and belowground C stocks and fluxes, ranging from tree aboveground C, over leaf litter C production, to soil organic carbon (SOC). We show that tree diversity significantly increased aboveground C stocks and fluxes, with a 57% higher gain in aboveground tree C in five-species mixtures compared to monocultures (35.7{+/-}1.8 vs 22.8{+/-}3.4 Mg C ha-1) 16 years after planting. In contrast, we observed a net reduction in SOC (on average -11.2{+/-}1.1 Mg C ha-1) and no significant difference in SOC3 stocks (the tree-derived SOC fraction) between five-species mixtures and monocultures (13.0{+/-}0.9 vs 15.1{+/-}1.3 Mg C ha-1). Positive tree diversity effects persisted despite repeated climate extremes and strengthened over time for aboveground tree growth. Higher tree growth in mixtures enhanced leaf litter and coarse woody debris C fluxes to the soil, resulting in a tightly linked C cycle aboveground. However, the only link between above- and belowground C stocks and fluxes was between leaf litter C inputs and SOC3 which was positively affected by diversity. Our study elucidates the mechanisms through which higher tree diversity bolsters the climate mitigation potential of tropical forest restoration. Restoration schemes should prioritize mixed over monospecific planted forests.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

In the endoplasmic reticulum, two distinct metal ion dependent enzyme families (i.e., multifunctional lysyl hydroxylases-glucosyltransferases LH/PLODs and galactosyltransferases GLT25D/COLGALT) alternatively operate on collagen lysine side chains ultimately generating the highly conserved -(1,2)-glucosyl-{beta}-(1,O)-galactosyl-5-hydroxylysine pattern. Malfunctions in the collagen lysine post-translational modification machinery is linked to multiple developmental pathologies as well as extracellular matrix alterations causing enhanced cellular proliferation and invasiveness of several solid tumors, prompting for an in-depth characterization of LH/PLOD and GLT25D/COLGALT enzyme families. Here, we present an integrative molecular study of GLT25D1/COLGALT, highlighting an elongated head-to-head homodimeric assembly characterized by an N-terminal segment of each monomer wrapping around its dimerization partner. Each monomer encompasses two Rossman fold-type domains (GT1 and GT2) separated by an extended linker. Both domains were found capable of binding Mn2+ cofactors and UDP--galactose donor substrates, resulting in four candidate catalytic sites per dimer.

Using quantitative proteomics, we show that M. smithii EVs are enriched in various proteins responsible for chromatin structure, including histones, and DNA repair. Consistently, the M. smithii EVs carry DNA, with fragments covering the entire cellular chromosome. Notably, the EVs are strongly enriched in extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) molecules which originate from excision of a 2.9-kb chromosomal fragment and a proviral genome. The eccDNA encodes two of the key methanogenesis enzymes and could boost their expression inside the cells through the gene dosage effect. Furthermore, four of the top ten most abundant EV proteins are implicated in methanogenesis.

Our results highlighted that within-host environmental heterogeneity led to diverse phenotypes in Wolbachia.

Release of eIF6 from the 60S subunit is important for permitting 60S interactions with 40S to form the 80S monosome. Here, using a mutant of eIF6 (N106S) that interacts poorly with the 60S subunit, we show that the ribosomal subunit associations are deregulated in the absence of eIF6 and lead to an increase in empty 80S ribosomes that decreases global protein synthesis rates. Intriguingly, altering 80S ribosome availability markedly affects the mitotic phase and leads to chromosome segregation defects that induces delays in mitotic exit and mitotic catastrophe. Ribo-Seq analysis of the eIF6-N106S mutant shows a significant downregulation in the translation efficiencies of genes associated with mitosis and cytoskeleton, and specifically transcripts with long 3' UTRs. eIF6-N106S mutation also markedly affects cancer invasion, and this role is correlated with the overexpression of eIF6 only in high-grade invasive bladder and breast cancers.

In two preregistered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with heterosexual participants (total N=294, comprising 149 males and 145 females), we explored how oxytocin affects memory consolidation. We administered oxytocin immediately after encoding (i.e., Study1) and 30 minutes before retrieval in a parallel study (i.e., Study2). This design allowed us to confirm that oxytocins effects were indeed due to consolidation rather than retrieval. We found that administering oxytocin post-encoding, but not before-retrieval, significantly improved female participants ability to recognize male faces 24 hours later, with no similar enhancement observed in males recognizing opposite-gender faces. Together with our analyses of social placebo effects and approachability rating during encoding, we concluded that oxytocin enhanced consolidation of long-term social memories in humans. Our results not only advance the understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying social memory consolidation but also highlight oxytocin as a pharmacological tool for selectively enhancing human memory consolidation.

While literature consistently highlights heightened risk behavior in individuals with STB and identifies mood issues as central to STB, the precise cognitive and affective computational mechanisms driving this increased risky behavior remain elusive. Here, we asked 83 adolescent inpatients with affective disorders, where 58 patients with STB (S+) and 25 without STB (S-), and 118 gender/age-matched healthy control (HC) to make decisions between certain vs. gamble option with momentary mood ratings. Choice data analyses revealed heightened risk behavior in S+ compared to S- and HC. Using a prospect theory model enhanced with approach-avoidance Pavlovian parameters revealed that this rise in risky behavior resulted only from a heightened Pavlovian approach parameter in S+. Furthermore, Pavlovian approach mediated the rise in gambling choices with STB severity. Altogether, model-based choice data analysis indicated dysfunction in the Pavlovian approach system in S+ individuals, leading to greater propensity for gambling in favorable outcomes regardless the lotteries expected value. Additionally, mood model-based analyses revealed reduced sensitivity to certain rewards in S+ compared to S- and HC. Importantly, these computational markers generalized to healthy population (n {square} = {square} 747). In S+, mood sensitivity to certain reward was negatively correlated with gambling, offering a mood computational account for increased risk behavior in STB. These findings remained significant even after adjusting for demographic, clinical, and medication-related variables. Overall, our study uncovers the cognitive and affective mechanisms contributing to increased risk behavior in STB, with significant implications for suicide prevention.","NA","medrxiv",1719353146604

Many proteins exert their functions through interactions with other proteins, and a significant challenge is designing these interactions effectively. While most efforts have focused on larger, more stable proteins, shorter peptides offer advantages such as lower manufacturing costs, reduced steric hindrance, and the ability to traverse cell membranes when cyclized.

Here, we present an AI method to design novel linear and cyclic peptide binders of varying lengths based solely on a protein target sequence. Our approach does not specify a binding site or the length of the binder, making the procedure completely blind. We demonstrate that high-affinity binders can be selected directly from predicted confidence metrics, and adversarial designs can be avoided through orthogonal in silico evaluation, tripling the success rate.

We selected a single designed linear sequence for lengths ranging from 8 to 20 residues and evaluated the affinity using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Of the sequences tested, 6 out of 13 (46%) displayed affinity with dissociation constants (Kd) in the micromolar range; the strongest binder had a Kd of 19 nM, and the weakest had a Kd of 7.9 M. Our protocol, EvoBind2 (https://github.com/patrickbryant1/EvoBind), enables binder design based solely on a protein target sequence, suggesting the potential for a rapid increase in the number of proteins that can be targeted for various biotechnological applications.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

Direct measurements of phenotypes like meat quality, methane emission, and disease susceptibility are difficult and expensive to measure at scale but are critically important to livestock production. Our work leans on our understanding of the ""Central Dogma"" of molecular genetics to leverage molecular intermediates as cheaply-measured proxies of organism-level phenotypes. The rapidly declining cost of next-generation sequencing presents opportunities for population-level molecular phenotyping. While the cost of whole transcriptome sequencing has declined recently, its required sequencing depth still makes it an expensive choice for wide-scale molecular phenotyping. We aim to optimize 3' mRNA sequencing (3' mRNA-Seq) approaches for collecting cost-effective proxy molecular phenotypes for cattle from easy-to-collect tissue samples (i.e., whole blood). We used matched 3' mRNA-Seq samples for 15 Holstein male calves in a heat stress trail to identify the 1) best library preparation kit (Takara SMART-Seq v4 3' DE and Lexogen QuantSeq) and 2) optimal sequencing depth (0.5 to 20 million reads/sample) to capture gene expression phenotypes most cost-effectively.

ResultsTakara SMART-Seq v4 3' DE outperformed Lexogen QuantSeq libraries across all metrics: number of quality reads, expressed genes, informative genes, differentially expressed genes, and 3' biased intragenic variants. Serial downsampling analyses identified that as few as 8.0 million reads per sample could effectively capture most of the between-sample variation in gene expression. However, progressively more reads did provide marginal increases in recall across metrics. These 3' mRNA-Seq reads can also capture animal genotypes that could be used as the basis for downstream imputation. The 10 million read downsampled groups called an average of 104,386 SNPs and 20,131 INDELs, many of which segregate at moderate minor allele frequencies in the population.

ConclusionThis work demonstrates that 3' mRNA-Seq with Takara SMART-Seq v4 3' DE can provide an incredibly cost-effective (<$25/sample) approach to quantifying molecular phenotypes (gene expression) while discovering sufficient variation for use in genotype imputation. Ongoing work is evaluating the accuracy of imputation and the ability of much larger datasets to predict individual animal phenotypes.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

Isotropic (3D) T1 images are desirable for quantitative analyses, however a routine compromise in the clinical setting is to acquire anisotropic (2D) analogues for qualitative visual inspection. Machine learning-based software have shown promise in addressing some of the limitations of 2D scans in research applications, yet their efficacy in quantitative research is not well understood. To evaluate the applicability of image preprocessing methods, morphometry in idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE)--in which, pathology-related abnormalities of the subcortical structures have been reproducibly demonstrated--was investigated first in 3D scans, then in 2D scans, resampled images, and synthesised images. Methods: 2D and 3D T1 MRI were acquired during the same scanning session from 31 individuals (males = 14, mean age = 32.16) undergoing evaluation for IGE at the Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, as well as 39 healthy age- and sex-matched controls (males = 16, mean age = 32.13). The DL+DiReCT pipeline was used to provide segmentations of the 2D images, and estimates of regional volume and thickness. The 2D scans were also resampled into isotropic images using NiBabel, and preprocessed into synthetic isotropic images using SynthSR. For the 3D scans, untransformed 2D scans, resampled images, and synthesised images, FreeSurfer 7.2.0 was used to create parcellations of 178 anatomical regions (equivalent to the 178 parcellations provided as part of the DL+DiReCT pipeline), defined by the aseg and Destrieux atlases, and FSL FIRST was used to segment subcortical surface shapes. Spatial correspondence and intraclass correlations between the morphometrics of the five parcellations were first determined, then subcortical surface shape abnormalities associated with IGE were identified by comparing the FSL FIRST outputs of patients with controls. Results: When standardised to the metrics derived from the 3D scans, cortical volume and thickness estimates trended lower for the untransformed 2D, DL+DiReCT, resampled, and SynthSR images, whereas subcortical volume estimates did not differ. Dice coefficients revealed a low spatial similarity between the cortices of the 3D scans and the other images overall, which was higher in the subcortical structures. Intraclass correlation coefficients reiterated this disparity, with estimates of thickness being less similar than those of volume, and DL+DiReCT estimates trending less similar than the other images types. For the people with epilepsy, the 3D scans showed significant surface deflations across various subcortical structures when compared to healthy controls. Analysis of the untransformed 2D scans enabled the detection of a subset of subcortical abnormalities, whereas analyses of the resampled and synthetic images attenuated almost all significance. Conclusions: Generalised image synthesis methods do not currently attenuate partial volume effects resulting from low through plane resolution in anisotropic MRI scans, instead quantitative analyses using 2D images should be interpreted with caution, and researchers should consider the potential implications of preprocessing.

Methods like AlphaFold have revolutionized protein structure prediction based only on the amino-acid sequence. However, proteins often appear in multiple different conformations, and it is highly relevant to resolve the full conformational distribution. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo EM) is a powerful tool for capturing a large number of images of a given protein, frequently in different conformations (referred to as particles). The images are, however, very noisy projections of the protein, and traditional methods for cryo EM reconstruction are limited to recovering a single, or a few, conformations. In this paper, we introduce cryoSPHERE, a deep learning method that takes as input a nominal protein structure, e.g. from AlphaFold, learns how to divide it into segments, and how to move these as approximately rigid bodies to fit the different conformations present in the cryo EM dataset. This formulation is shown to provide enough constraints to recover meaningful reconstructions of single protein structures. This is illustrated in three examples where we show consistent improvements over the current state-of-the-art for heterogeneous reconstruction.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

The olfactory nerve is widely accepted as the neuroinvasive route by which the etiological agent SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain, but the trigeminal nerve is an often-overlooked additional route. Based on this consensus, we initially conducted a pilot experiment investigating the olfactory nerve route of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion via intranasal inoculation in AC70 human ACE2 transgenic mice. Notably, we found that the trigeminal ganglion is an early and highly efficient site of viral replication, which then rapidly spread widely throughout the brain where neurons were primarily targeted. Despite the extensive viral infection across the brain, obvious evidence of tissue pathology including inflammatory infiltration, glial activation, and apoptotic cell deaths were not consistently observed, albeit inflammatory cytokines were significantly induced. However, the expression levels of different genes related to neuronal function, including the neurotransmitter dopamine pathway as well as synaptic function, and markers of neuronal damage were altered as compared to mock-infected mice. Our findings suggest that the trigeminal nerve can be a neuroinvasive route complementary to the olfactory nerve and that the ensuing neuroinvasion presented a unique neuropathological profile. This study provides insights into potential neuropathogenic mechanisms utilized by coronaviruses.

IMPORTANCECOVID-19 presents with extrapulmonary signs and symptoms, the most notable of which involve the central nervous system, such as seizures and alterations in consciousness, and can eventually lead to death if severe enough. Some neurological signs and symptoms may continue to persist in some patients even after the resolution of active viral infection in the form of post-acute sequelae. Since the trigeminal nerve is a commonly under-studied route of entry into the brain in studies of coronaviruses and the neuropathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 are not entirely elucidated, there is a need to thoroughly investigate this route of neuroinvasion. The significance of our research is in providing insights into the possible routes of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion as well as the discovery of potential neuropathogenic mechanisms which may help guide the development of novel medical countermeasures.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

The prediction and analysis of gene essentiality can advance our understanding of basic life and human diseases, and further boost the development of new drugs. Wet lab methods for identifying cell essential genes are often costly, time-consuming, and laborious. As a complement, computational methods have been proposed to predict essential genes by integrating multiple biological data sources. Most of these methods are evaluated on model organisms. However, prediction methods for human essential genes are still limited and the relationship between human gene essentiality and different biological information still needs to be explored. In addition, exploring suitable deep learning techniques to overcome the limitations of traditional machine learning methods and improve prediction accuracy is also important and interesting. We propose a snapshot ensemble deep neural network method, DeEPsnap, to predict human essential genes. DeEPsnap integrates sequence features derived from DNA and protein sequence data with features extracted or learned from multiple types of functional data, such as gene ontology, protein complex, protein domain, and protein-protein interaction network. More than 200 features from these biological data are extracted/learned which are integrated together to train a series of cost-sensitive deep neural networks by utilizing multiple deep learning techniques. The proposed snapshot mechanism enables us to train multiple models without increasing extra training effort and cost. The experimental results of 10-fold cross-validation show that DeEPsnap can accurately predict human gene essentiality with an average AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) of 96.1%, the average AUPRC (Area under the Precision-Recall curve) of 93.82%, the average accuracy of 92.21%, and the average F1 measure about 80.62%. In addition, the comparison of experimental results shows that DeEPsnap outperforms several popular traditional machine learning models and deep learning models. We have demonstrated that the proposed method, DeEPsnap, is effective for predicting human essential genes.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

However, the resurgent interest in the drugs as therapeutics has also prompted a search for novel agents with more specific pharmacological activities than the rather promiscuous classical psychedelics. Here we present the results of an elaborate preclinical characterization of one such compound, LPH-5 [(S)-3-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)piperidine]. LPH-5 was found to be a potent partial agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) and to exhibit pronounced selectivity for this receptor over the related 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors in a range of functional assays. LPH-5 (0.375 - 12.0 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently induced head-twitch responses (HTR) in Sprague Dawley rats, with substantial 5-HT2AR engagement being observed at 0.5-1.0 mg/kg. Acute administration of LPH-5 (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) induced robust antidepressant-like effects in Flinders Sensitive Line rats and adrenocorticotropic hormone-treated Sprague Dawley rats, and LPH-5 (0.3 and 1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) induced significant effects in a recently developed Wistar Kyoto rat model proposed to reflect the long-term antidepressant-like effects produced by psychedelics in humans. In conclusion, selective 5-HT2AR activation, as mediated here by LPH- 5, seems to hold antidepressant potential, suggesting that this activity component is key for the beneficial effects of classical psychedelics. Hence, we propose that LPH-5 and other 5-HT2AR- selective agonists could hold potential as therapeutics in psychiatric disease as a new generation of psychedelic-derived antidepressant.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

Among these approaches, the amplicon-based metagenomics relies on specific genetic markers, such as the 16S rRNA gene, while the shotgun metagenomics annotates the whole bacterial DNA. Despite the 16S being the gold standard marker, studies highlighted its inefficiency in characterising and quantifying divergent bacterial groups such as the Candidate Phyla Radiation. On the other hand, shotgun metagenomics is highly informative and accurate but it is more expensive and requires computational resources and time. In this study, we propose RecA as a pan-bacterial genetic marker, particularly suitable for the Candidate Phyla Radiation. Indeed, we found that applying a Random Forest machine learning model on RecA amino acid sequences provides an accurate and fast taxonomic annotation across the whole bacterial tree of life. Ultimately, we produced Forestax, a tool for the characterisation and quantification of bacterial communities in metagenomics data, on the basis of RecA sequences. The analyses showed that RecA-based metagenomics has a taxonomic accuracy comparable to other multi-gene approaches, reinforcing RecA as a powerful marker for taxonomic annotation in bacteria.

During low arousal states such as slow wave sleep, the cortex is synchronized and dominated by low frequency rhythms coordinated across multiple regions. Although recent evidence suggests that GABAergic inhibitory neurons are key players in cortical state modulation, the in vivo circuit mechanisms coordinating synchronized activity among local and distant neocortical networks are not well understood. Here, we show that somatostatin and chondrolectin co-expressing cells (Sst-Chodl cells), a sparse and unique class of neocortical inhibitory neurons, are selectively active during low arousal states and are largely silent during periods of high arousal. In contrast to other neocortical inhibitory neurons, we show these neurons have long-range axons that project across neocortical areas. Activation of Sst-Chodl cells is sufficient to promote synchronized cortical states characteristic of low arousal, with increased spike co-firing and low frequency brain rhythms, and to alter behavioral states by promoting sleep. Contrary to the prevailing belief that sleep is exclusively driven by subcortical mechanisms, our findings reveal that these long-range inhibitory neurons not only track changes in behavioral state but are sufficient to induce both sleep-like cortical states and sleep behavior, establishing a crucial circuit component in regulating behavioral states.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

Utilizing quantitative imaging and spatially resolved transcriptome approaches, we explore the deterministic process of a ring-like colony pattern formation from a single cell. This process is primarily driven by bifurcation events programmed by the gene regulatory network and microenvironmental cues. Additionally, we observe a noise-induced process amplified by the founder effect, leading to patterns of symmetry-break during range expansion. The degrees of asymmetry are profoundly influenced by the initial conditions of single progenitor cells during the nascent stages of colony development. These findings underscore how the process of range expansion enables individual cells, exposed to a uniform growth-promoting environment, to exhibit inherent capabilities in generating emergent, self-organized behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

Here, using a combination of physiological recordings, fiber photometry, optogenetics, and behavioral tracking, we show that the LCNE activation is tightly coupled to the return of organized movements during waking from an anesthetized state. Moreover, in an awake animal, movement initiations are coupled to LCNE activation, while movement arrests, to LCNE deactivation. We also report that LCNE activity covaries with the depth of anesthesia and that LCNE photoactivation leads to sympathetic activation, consistent with its role in mediating increased arousal. Together, these studies reveal a more nuanced, modulatory role that LCNE plays in coordinating movement and arousal.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded. We report the value of wastewater sequencing to track avian influenza.","NA","medrxiv",1719353146604

Then, using a custom library of 240,000 epegRNAs targeting >17,000 codons with 175 different substitution types, we benchmarked our platform for functional interrogation of small substitution variants (1-3 nucleotides) targeted to essential genes.

Spectral flow cytometry allows for high-dimensional analysis of immune cells, overcoming limitations of conventional flow cytometry. However, analyzing data from large antibody panels can be challenging using traditional bi-axial gating strategies. Here, we present a novel analysis pipeline designed to improve analysis of spectral flow cytometry. We employ this method to identify rare T cell populations in aging. We isolated splenocytes from young (2-3 months) and aged (18-19 months) female mice then stained these with a panel of 20 fluorescently labeled antibodies. Spectral flow cytometry was performed, followed by data processing and analysis using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment to perform batch correction, unsupervised clustering, dimensionality reduction, and differential expression analysis. Our analysis of 3,776,804 T cells from 11 spleens revealed 34 distinct T cell clusters identified by surface marker expression. We observed significant differences between young and aged mice, with certain clusters enriched in one age group over the other. Naive, effector memory, and central memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets exhibited age-associated changes in abundance and marker expression. Additionally, {gamma}{delta} T cell clusters showed differential abundance between age groups. By leveraging high-dimensional analysis methods borrowed from single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, we identified age-related differences in T cell subsets, providing insights into the immune aging process. This approach offers a robust, free, and easily implemented analysis pipeline for spectral flow cytometry data that may facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for age-related immune dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

T2D is a multifaceted disease, its treatment requires a holistic approach, beyond single target medications with high efficacy. There is a dire need to explore and invent new and effective therapeutic modalities for T2D.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

In conclusion, our results suggest that consumption of combined CBD and probiotics could be used as a natural, practical, affordable, and safe alternative and complementary therapeutic modality to treat T2D.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

These ruminants were presumed not to be hosts for IAVs. Previously, IAV-positive mammalian species were hunters and scavengers, possibly getting infected while feeding on infected birds. It is now presumed that H5N1 viruses that circulate in US dairy cattle transmit through a mammary gland route, in contrast to transmission by aerosols via the respiratory tract, although the latter cannot be excluded. The receptor display in the mammary and respiratory tract in cows for IAVs is unknown. Here, we used recombinant HA proteins representing current circulating and classical H5 viruses to determine the distribution of IAV receptors in the respiratory and mammary tract tissues of cows and goats. Most of the sialome of the cow and goat respiratory tract is lined with sialic acid modifications such as N-glycolyl and O-acetyl, which are not bound by IAV. Interestingly, the H5 protein representing the cow isolates bound significantly in the mammary gland, whereas classical H5 proteins failed to do so. Furthermore, whereas the 9-O-acetyl modification is prominent in all tissues tested, the 5-N-glycolyl modification is not, resulting in the display of receptors for avian IAV hemagglutinins. This could explain the high levels of virus found in these tissues and milk, adding supporting data to this possible virus transmission route.","NA","biorxiv",1719353146604

Applying this blueprint to Canadas extensive coastline, we find kelp forests store an estimated 1.4 Tg C in short-term biomass and produce 3.1 Tg C yr-1 with modest carbon fluxes to the deep ocean. Arctic kelps had the highest carbon stocks and production capacity, while Pacific kelps had greater carbon fluxes overall due to their higher productivity and export rates.

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1719353146604

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.
