YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1745878160204

In 2025, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) was dismantled, and other countries also announced cuts to overseas development assistance. We quantified potential epidemiological impacts attributable to these reductions in international donor funding.

MethodsWe calibrated a deterministic tuberculosis model to epidemiological indicators in low- and middle-income countries. We projected three future scenarios assuming: a) levels of funding in 2024 continue through 2035, b) termination of USAID funding from 2025, and c) additional reductions in funding through The Global Fund in line with current donor announcements from 2025. We assumed a reduction in tuberculosis treatment initiation rates proportional to budget reductions for each scenario, estimating cumulative excess incident episodes of symptomatic tuberculosis and tuberculosis deaths.

FindingsWe modelled 79 countries, representing 91% of global tuberculosis incidence and 90% of global tuberculosis mortality in 2023. Our modelling suggested that the termination of USAID funding may lead to 420 500 excess tuberculosis deaths by 2035. Further reductions in funding in line with current announcements by the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and Germany may lead to an additional 699 200, 63 100, 50 500, and 30 500 TB deaths, respectively. Impacts would be greatest in low-income countries.

InterpretationWe estimate substantial potential impacts on tuberculosis morbidity and mortality due to reductions in international donor funding. Expanded support from domestic and international donors is essential to address immediate gaps in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are effective anti-glycemic and weight-loss medications with a strong safety record. There is substantial preclinical evidence and mounting retrospective and prospective randomized controlled trial evidence that GLP-1RAs could be effective for reducing alcohol consumption. However, the mechanism by which GLP-1RAs reduce alcohol intake remains unclear. While medications that reduce alcohol intake such as naltrexone and acamprosate have central nervous system action, disulfiram reduces alcohol intake through peripheral mechanisms. Here, we test whether GLP-1RAs alter alcohol's peripheral pharmacokinetics as a potential mechanism of action for their alcohol intake suppressive effects. In this pilot study, twenty participants with obesity in the GLP-1RA or control group consumed a challenge dose of alcohol and we measured breath alcohol (BrAC) and the subjective effects of alcohol. We observed a delayed rise in BrAC and subjective effects in the GLP-1RA group as compared to controls, that was not explained by nausea.

Notably, in the past two decades, the incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer, affecting individuals under the age of 50 years, has doubled in many countries. The reasons for this increase are unknown. Here, we investigate whether mutational processes contribute to geographic and age-related differences by examining 981 colorectal cancer genomes from 11 countries. No major differences were found in microsatellite unstable cancers, but variations in mutation burden and signatures were observed in the 802 microsatellite-stable cases. Multiple signatures, most with unknown etiologies, exhibited varying prevalence in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Russia, and Thailand, indicating geographically diverse levels of mutagenic exposure. Signatures SBS88 and ID18, caused by the bacteria-produced mutagen colibactin, had higher mutation loads in countries with higher colorectal cancer incidence rates. SBS88 and ID18 were also enriched in early-onset colorectal cancers, being 3.3 times more common in individuals diagnosed before age 40 than in those over 70, and were imprinted early during colorectal cancer development. Colibactin exposure was further linked to APC driver mutations, with ID18 responsible for about 25% of APC driver indels in colibactin-positive cases. This study reveals geographic and age-related variations in colorectal cancer mutational processes, and suggests that early-life mutagenic exposure to colibactin-producing bacteria may contribute to the rising incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer.","NA","medrxiv",1745878160204

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

To investigate the transmission dynamics of common healthcare-associated respiratory virus infections, we performed retrospective whole genome sequencing (WGS) surveillance at one pediatric and two adult teaching hospitals in Pittsburgh, PA.

MethodsFrom January 2, 2018, to January 4, 2020, nasal swab specimens positive for rhinovirus, influenza, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) from patients hospitalized for [&ge;]3 days were sequenced on Illumina platform. High-quality genomes were assessed for genetic relatedness using [&le;]3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) cut-off, except for rhinovirus (10 SNPs). Patient health records were reviewed for genetically related clusters to identify epidemiological connections.

ResultsWe collected 436 viral specimens from 359 patients: rhinovirus (n=291), influenza (n=50), HMPV (n=47), and RSV (n=48). Of these, 55% (197/359 patients) were from pediatric hospital and 45% from adult hospitals. Patients ranged in age from 14 days to 93 years, 61% were male, and 74% were white. WGS was performed on 61.2% (178/291) rhinovirus, 78% (39/50) influenza, 92% (44/48) RSV, and all HMPV specimens. Among high-quality genomes, we identified 14 genetically related clusters involving 36 patients, ranging in size from 2-5 patients. We identified common epidemiological links for 53% (19/36) of clustered patients; 63% (12/19) patients had same-unit stay, 26% (5/19) had overlapping hospital stays, and 11% (2/19) shared common provider. On average, genetically related clusters spanned 16 days (range:0-55 days).

ConclusionWGS offered insights into respiratory virus transmission dynamics. These advancements could potentially improve infection prevention and control strategies, leading to enhanced patient safety and healthcare outcomes.

This multicenter study examined inter-individual differences in spatial patterns of intrinsic brain function in TLE using normative modeling at multiple spatial scales and evaluated the effectiveness of individual functional deviations for clinical diagnosis and postsurgical outcome prediction. We analyzed multimodal MRI data on 298 healthy controls, 282 TLE patients, and 45 disease controls with extratemporal epilepsy. Cortical function was profiled at local, regional, and global scales using brain signal variability, regional homogeneity, and node strength. We estimated patient-specific W-score maps to index deviations from normative metrics. Compared to healthy controls, patients with TLE showed considerable variations in patterns of functional alterations across the cortex, with the highest overlap in the ipsilateral mesiotemporal regions. Connectome-based simulation revealed the paralimbic and medial default mode regions as key disease epicenters. Functional changes were primarily underpinned by superficial white matter anomalies. Supervised pattern learning achieved classification AUCs of 0.76 for TLE versus disease controls, 0.74 for left versus right TLE, and 0.63 for seizure-free versus non-seizure-free TLE, with greater contralateral temporal functional deviations correlating with unfavorable postsurgical seizure outcome.

Yet, multiplexing samples and target assays is difficult and the dependence of NAATs on enzymes increases false negative rates with inhibitor-rich environmental samples. The Nanostring nCounter system (NNS) is a nucleic acid hybridization platform with a capability for high multiplexing (upwards of 800 probes) that directly counts RNA or DNA biomarkers without reverse transcription or amplification. This study determines the feasibility of direct detection and quantification of genetic markers of public health significance in wastewater samples using NNS and compares the performance with gold-standard NAAT assays targeting antimicrobial resistance (AMR) DNA loci, 16S DNA, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and the fecal content markers, Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) RNA and crAssphage DNA. We demonstrate that the direct detection and quantification of high- and medium-copy markers, including PMMoV RNA, beta-lactamase, and carbapenemase DNA, in wastewater extracts is both feasible and accurate when benchmarked against gold-standard NAATs. Low-copy detection and monitoring daily trends of SARS-CoV-2 N RNA was achievable but was not as robust as NAATs. Due to the lower analytical sensitivity of NNS compared to NAATs and the requirement of a 18h hybridization step, NNS may not be suitable to provide early warning of incident cases to public health. However, as the scope of wastewater surveillance expands to monitor a broad range of nucleic acid-based biomarkers, the target and sample multiplexing capability of NNS, combined with reduced hands-on time and ease-of-analysis, are distinct advantages. Thus, NNS has a role to play in wastewater and environmental monitoring applications, especially for AMR surveillance.

Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses.

MR is limited to cross-sectional summary statistics of different samples and time points to analyse time-varying effects. We aimed at using longitudinal summary statistics for an exposure in a multivariable MR setting and validating the effect estimates for the mean, slope and within-individual variability. Simulation study: We tested our approach in various scenarios for power and type I error, depending on the correlation structure between the mean, slope and variability, and regression model. We observed high power to detect causal effects of the mean and slope throughout the simulation, but the variability effect was low powered in case of correlation between the mean and variability. Mis-specified regression models led to lower power and increased the type I error. Real data application: We applied our approach to two real data sets (POPS, UK Biobank). We detected significant causal estimates for both the mean and the slope in both cases, but no effect of the variability. However, even in the UK Biobank we only had weak instruments. Conclusion: We used a new approach to test a time-varying exposure for causal effects of the exposure's mean, slope and variability. The simulation with strong instruments seems promising, but also highlights three crucial points: 1) the difficulty to define the correct exposure regression model, 2) the dependency on the genetic correlation, and 3) the lack of strong instruments in real data. Taken together, this demands a cautious evaluation of the results, taking into account known biology and trajectory of the exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1745878160204

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1745878160204

Yet for emerging infectious diseases, isolating the roles played by underlying social disadvantage from unequal access to protective interventions remains a challenge. This is amplified in the historically unique case of COVID-19: since mitigation measures were deployed contemporaneously with the disease's global dissemination, we lack empirical evidence to disentangle the effects of pre-existing social conditions from interventions. To address this gap, I developed a theory-guided, data-driven, geospatially explicit susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-deceased model of all 5,565 Brazilian municipalities. I parameterize pre-existing inequities through disparities in household transmission and infection fatality rates and model two interventions, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccination, for which I simulate nine counterfactual distribution scenarios, from no interventions to real-world distribution and alternative more-equitable strategies. In the absence of interventions the model reproduced an ``expected`` gradient: mortality became increasingly concentrated in low socioeconomic status municipalities as the disease proliferated. NPI adoption following observed, socially stratified patterns accelerated, rather than created, this gradient, suggesting pre-existing social conditions as the primary drivers of Brazil's COVID-19 mortality gradient, while unequal interventions merely reinforced their effects. However, prioritizing the most vulnerable municipalities for vaccination inverted the gradient, an effect further compounded by equal adoption of NPIs, largely neutralizing the impact of these pre-existing conditions. These findings can help guide more equitable policy responses to future emerging infectious disease crises. This study is the first incorporating the pathways framework of inequalities in emerging infectious disease into mechanistic modeling.","NA","medrxiv",1745878160204

To achieve the high rates of temporally precise synaptic transmission over long periods of time, IHCs employ sophisticated ribbon-type active zones (AZ). In order for us to understand synaptic sound encoding, we need to decipher the underpinning molecular topography of these synapse which had remained challenging due to technological limitations. Here we applied 3-dimensional minimal flux optical nanoscopy to mouse IHC synapses to chart the position of key pre- and postsynaptic proteins with single digit nanometre resolution of imaging. We demonstrate that nanoclusters of channels and interacting proteins govern the topography of AZs and postsynaptic densities (PSDs). We count synaptic proteins, their nanoclusters and determine their spatial organization feeding into computational modelling of AZ function. In conclusion, this study reveals a nanocluster-based molecular AZ and PSD topography, likely serving as functional modules in synaptic sound encoding.","NA","biorxiv",1745878160204

However, the precise mechanisms driving transmission between poultry premises and the impact of potential control measures in Great Britain, such as vaccination, are not fully understood. We have developed a spatial transmission model for the spread of HPAI in poultry premises calibrated to infected premises data for the 2022-23 season using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Our results indicate that enhanced biosecurity measures and/or vaccination of the premises surrounding an identified infected premises can substantially reduce the overall number of infected premises. Our findings highlight that enhanced control measures could limit the future impact of HPAI on the poultry industry and reduce the risk of broader health threats.","NA","biorxiv",1745878160204

Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes.

This design means that engine oil and/or hydraulic fluid can contaminate the ventilation supply air during otherwise normal flights, exposing onboard crewmembers and passengers to the fumes. The oils and hydraulic fluids contain a complex mixture of triaryl phosphates (TAPs) and decomposition products. Although the health and flight safety consequences of inhaling these fumes have been widely documented, measures of onboard inhalation exposure have been lacking. An approach is presented for documenting exposure to engine oil fumes by using high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) to monitor and quantify post-translational modifications of subjects butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) that are consistent with exposure to the engine oil TAPs. We hypothesized that plasma from exposed individuals would show modifications or adducts of these OPs on the active site serine (Ser198) of BChE. Plasma BChE from 64 exposed subjects was purified to near homogeneity and concentrated using antibodies immobilized on paramagnetic beads. The purified BChE was eluted at low pH, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC)-MS. In subjects reporting onboard oil fume exposures, the most consistent adduct modifying the Ser198-containing tryptic peptide had a mass value of +154.0031 Da. The normalized peak area (NPA) of the +154Da modification was determined by comparing the relative MS1 intensities of the +154Da-modified Ser198 containing peptide to the total observable peptides containing the active site, including missed cleavages. Notably, adducts from in vitro exposures of bioactivated TAPs to purified BChE conducted in this study (i.e., 80Da, 156Da, 170Da, and 186Da) as well as adducts reported in other earlier in vitro studies (i.e., 65Da, 80Da, 91Da, 107Da, 16Da, 17Da, and 180Da) were not detected in exposed subjects. Of 67 subjects in this study, the average NPA of +154Da-Ser198 resulted from fume event exposures that pre-dated 2012 (N=54; 0.46-17.8,[X] =4.0) was 7.4X higher than control subjects. These data are uncorrected for the time lag between the reported exposure and the blood draw. Samples from the remaining 13 subjects with exposures from 2016-2024 showed only the 154Da modification at background levels (0.24-1.13;[X] =0.53), as confirmed in control plasma samples from individuals who had not flown in at least three months. The observed reduction in the 154Da adduct over time in exposed individuals is likely a function of the change in the formulation of the OP blends added to engine oils during the course of the study. Further investigation into other protein biomarkers and adducts correlated with exposure to the current oil additives and hydraulic fluid fumes on aircraft is warranted. The most satisfactory solution would be to eliminate the exposure hazard by implementing bleed-free systems or, at a minimum, to develop less toxic oil formulations, suitable bleed air filters, and modified designs.","NA","medrxiv",1745878160204

Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing.

Although physiotherapists (PTs) often use reassurance strategies, the perception of the different reassuring messages remains unclear.

ObjectiveTo investigate perceptions of confidence of different reassurance messages delivered by PTs to people with LBP.

MethodsA survey was conducted among 544 participants with LBP. The survey included 21 reassuring messages divided into six themes  Prevalence and statistics,  Red flag,  Natural healing,  Imaging,  Treatment strategies, and  Pain physiology. Participants had to rate the extent to which each message increased their confidence using a 5-point Likert scale. Messages were categorized into four levels of perceived confidence based on participants responses: high ([&ge;]80% rated the message as  provide confidence or  significantly provide confidence), moderate (60-79%), low (40-59%) and very low ([&le;]40%). Correlation and non-parametric analyses examined the relationships between confidence ratings, demographic variables and personality traits.

ResultsMessages that emphasized patient autonomy and the absence of red flags were perceived as particularly reassuring and received the highest ratings ([&ge;]80%). In contrast, messages that referred to natural healing and the neurophysiology of pain were perceived as less effective in providing confidence. Personality traits and background characteristics had minimal effects on perceived reassurance.

ConclusionsReassuring communication that emphasizes patient autonomy and the low likelihood of serious pathology can boost confidence in individuals with LBP and may be more impactful than patient-specific characteristics. These findings may help PTs refine their communication strategies and strengthen therapeutic relationships, potentially leading to better treatment outcomes. Future research should explore the implications of these findings in clinical settings in real-life interactions.","NA","medrxiv",1745878160204

Yet, there is no consensus on the relative influence of schistosome and viral hepatitis coinfection for any liver disease.

MethodsWe conducted a meta-analysis for intestinal schistosome and hepatitis B or C coinfection on author-defined nonspecific liver outcomes, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The study protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023443435) and adhered to PRISMA reporting guidelines. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Global Health, Global Index Medicus, and Medline were systematically searched from inception to 23 January 2025. Inverse-variance weighted random effects were used to calculate pooled effect sizes. Subgroup analyses were conducted for study aims, region, species, diagnostic tools, and reference categories of singularly infected versus uninfected. We assessed study quality using a modified National Institute of Health risk of bias (RoB) tool.

FindingsOut of 1984 studies screened, 33 full text articles were eligible for meta-analysis with 8637 participants. 57% of studies (19/33) were on coinfection with hepatitis C and S. mansoni. Individuals with any coinfection were 2{middle dot}75 times more likely to have any liver disease than singularly or uninfected individuals, and a 2{middle dot}29, 2{middle dot}35 and 2{middle dot}69 higher likelihood of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Schistosome and hepatitis B coinfections, in particular, were 4{middle dot}11 times more likely to be associated with any liver disease. Results were similar when compared to singularly infected only. Heterogeneity was moderate (I2 74{middle dot}35%), and 42{middle dot}42% (14/32) of studies where RoB could be assessed were of low quality.

InterpretationSchistosome and viral hepatitis coinfection worsened hepatic disease. Guidelines for schistosomiasis and hepatitis B and C should consider coinfection when evaluating eligibility for treatment or prophylaxis, and determining morbidity management strategies.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSSchistosomiasis, caused by helminths of the species Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, S. mekongi, as well as chronic infection with hepatitis B and C viruses can lead to similar liver disease outcomes including periportal or portal fibrosis. In 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) released new guidelines for hepatitis B that changed treatment eligibility based on the importance of coinfections, of which schistosomiasis was not considered despite known co-endemicity. For schistosomiasis, there are currently no WHO guidelines that directly focus on morbidity management. A population-based study in Uganda by Anjorin and colleagues showed that schistosomal liver fibrosis risk depended on underlying hepatitis B coinfections. However, there is conflicting evidence as to the association of intestinal schistosome and hepatitis B or C coinfections, especially given the current context of available hepatitis B vaccinations and regular mass drug administration for schistosomiasis. It remains unknown how similar the hepatic disease presentations are between these vastly different helminth and viral pathogens; whether diseases specific to one pathogen can be worsened by coinfection; or whether an individual could be predisposed to develop hepatic disease if exposed previously to the other pathogen. These knowledge gaps exist despite known spatial overlap in the portal area of liver fibrosis caused by both pathogens. There remain open questions as to potential interactions between immune-driven inflammatory processes specific to schistosomes versus hepatitis B or C, or any role of immune priming for liver fibrosis. Here we synthesised the current state of evidence to assess whether coinfection worsens hepatic outcomes when compared to singular or no infections and to identify the relevance and severity of the type of hepatic outcome in humans only with murine models excluded.

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1996-), Medline including PubMed (1946-), Embase (1974-), Global Health (1973-) and Global Index Medicus (1901-) were searched from database inception to 7 July 2023 and updated on 23 January 2025 using the search string (schistosom* OR bilharzia* OR ""snail fever"" OR ""mansoni"" OR ""japonicum"" OR ""mekongi"") and (""hepatitis B"" OR HBV OR ""hepatitis C"" or HCV or ""hepatitis B C"") AND (liver OR hepat* OR cirrho*). One systematic literature review was identified from this search string, which summarised the clinical progression of liver disease in general in the event of coinfection of S. mansoni and hepatitis B or C. However, this review did not perform a meta-analysis and was focused solely on coinfection relating to one species of intestinal schistosomiasis. We found no published reviews specifically investigating coinfection with any intestinal schistosome species and hepatitis B or C for hepatomegaly, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Added value of this studyIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we estimated the pooled effect size of coinfection versus singular infections or no infection, as well as compared to singular infections only. We assessed whether intestinal schistosomes and viral hepatitis B or C coinfections influence the odds of nonspecific liver pathology, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma without restrictions on language or geography. By combining summary measures from 8637 participants across 7 different countries from 1991-2024, we identified that co-infected individuals were 2{middle dot}75 times more likely to have any liver pathology than singularly or uninfected individuals, and the odds were similar when coinfected individuals were compared to singularly infected individuals only (Odds Ratio 2{middle dot}61; CI 1{middle dot}62-4{middle dot}25). When specified by author-defined hepatic disease outcomes, we found that coinfection was over two times more likely to be associated with liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma when compared to singularly or uninfected individuals. The results were similar when compared to singularly infected individuals only, though slightly attenuated for hepatocellular carcinoma (Odds Ratio 1{middle dot}81; CI 1{middle dot}11-2{middle dot}96). Remarkably, schistosome and hepatitis B coinfection had over four times higher likelihood of any hepatic outcome than singular infections. Heterogeneity amongst the included studies was moderate (I2 74{middle dot}35%) and was reduced (I2 69{middle dot}85%) when outlying studies were removed. Risk of bias was moderate to high in most included studies, with only one study classed as low risk of bias.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis study demonstrates the importance of jointly considering schistosomes and hepatitis B or C for estimating the likelihood of chronic liver diseases of varying prognostic value. Coinfections influenced a range of author-defined hepatic outcomes of varying severity from fibrosis to cirrhosis. Future research is needed to assess whether to incorporate coinfections in guidelines for schistosomiasis and hepatitis B or C morbidity management, as well as to explore possibilities of coordinating vaccination campaigns with mass drug administration, or preventative interventions such as health education targeting.","NA","medrxiv",1745878160204

Given these unique characteristics and the urgent need for efficacious treatments, psychedelics are being tested for a variety of psychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders (SUDs). Despite promising results and growing interest, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics remain uncharacterized. Using a scoping review approach, we summarize current clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov that utilize classic psychedelics as interventions for SUDs with the goal of understanding the current state and outlook of the field. A second scoping review was conducted using PubMed and SCOPUS databases to identify the relevant publications addressing the pharmacotherapeutic potential of restoring dopamine homeostasis as a novel neurobiological mechanism of psychedelics. This mechanism may blunt drug-seeking behavior, promote drug abstinence, and underlie their clinical relevance for SUD in addition to previously characterized mechanisms.","NA","medrxiv",1745878160204

This study leverages NULISAseq, an ultra-sensitive proteomics platform, to analyze inflammatory responses in athletes participating in a half-marathon. A cohort of six individuals--three endurance athletes and three sedentary controls--underwent longitudinal blood collection at five timepoints: pre-run (R-7, R-1), mid-run (R), and post-run (R+1, R+7). DBS samples were processed using the NULISAseq 250-plex Inflammation Panel to quantify inflammatory biomarkers.

Principal component analysis revealed a significant inflammatory shift in athletes during the run, with a 3.9-fold greater proteomic change than controls. Enrichment analysis identified key inflammatory markers, including IL-6, TNFRSF8, and VEGFD, with individualized response patterns suggesting distinct recovery profiles. Furthermore, Inflammation Age increased transiently in athletes post-run, indicating acute immune activation. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of field-based proteomics using DBS and highlight potential biomarkers for exercise-induced stress and recovery, which underscores the potential of high-throughput proteomics in optimizing training and recovery strategies for athletes.","NA","medrxiv",1745878160204

However, cost and invasiveness preclude EGD in those who have no prior GERD symptoms, despite having other risk factors, representing missed opportunities for BE screening in individuals who account for approximately 40% of the patients who eventually develop esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).

AimThe aim of this study was to evaluate if non-endoscopic methods can enable BE detection in an at-risk population without GERD symptoms.

MethodsPatients presenting for colonoscopy who had not undergone previous EGD plus had [&ge;]3 BE risk factors (from among age >50 years, male sex, white race, smoking history, family history of BE/EAC, or central obesity) without chronic GERD symptoms were prospectively recruited for non-endoscopic screening. Trained nurses administered the EsoCheck (Lucid Diagnostics) encapsulated balloon. Samples were assayed with the EsoGuard BE detection methylated DNA marker panel (Lucid Diagnostics). Patients with a positive result were offered standard-of-care EGD, while patients with a negative EG result were offered free of cost research EGD. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and BE prevalence were calculated.

ResultsThe mean age of the 132 study subjects was 60.7 years, 129 (98%) were white, 124 (94%) were male, 71 (54%) had a prior smoking history, 46 (35%) were centrally obese, and 5 (4%) reported a family history. EsoCheck was successfully administered in 124 (94%) and the EsoGuard methylated DNA marker panel could be assayed in 120 (97%) of the samples. Thirty-four assays were positive of which 27 underwent a follow-up EGD and BE was identified in 9, PPV = 33% [17%, 54%] subjects. EGD was also performed in 22 of the 86 subjects whose assays were negative and none of them had BE, NPV = 100% [85%, 100%]. A logistic regression model fitted to impute the presence of BE estimated the PPV as 27% [13%, 44%], NPV as 98% [92%, 100%], and BE prevalence as 8.4% [4.5%, 14.3%].

ConclusionPatients without chronic GERD who have [&ge;]3 BE risk factors have a moderately high prevalence of BE. Non-endoscopic detection can effectively identify BE, enabling expansion of screening to this larger at-risk population. Those with a negative EG assay have a low likelihood of BE.","NA","medrxiv",1745878160204

Remodeling and expansion of this network during ductular reaction (DR) is a hallmark of liver disease that can be a key indicator of disease severity. Conventional histology fails to capture the full extent of IHBD structural changes following injury due to the complex 3D organization of the IHBD network which limits understanding of DR, especially in human tissue. A major barrier to leveraging 3D imaging as a diagnostic tool is the absence of standardized pipelines for IHBD imaging and analysis. Here, we establish a robust 3D IHBD imaging and analysis workflow and apply it to both mouse and human liver tissues. This pipeline enables quantification of tissue and individual duct (\""segment\"") level features and identifies features of invasive and noninvasive DR. In mouse models, we uncover regional phenotypes, including IHBD diverticula following duct blockage and the formation of anastomosed clusters after hepatocellular injury. Finally, we apply our 3D imaging and analysis workflow to quantify IHBD networks in human liver tissue. This work deepens our understanding of IHBD architecture in homeostasis and injury and lays the groundwork for advanced phenotyping of IHBD morphologies in mice and humans with relevance to next-generation experimental and diagnostic approaches to liver disease.","NA","biorxiv",1745878160204

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

Many recent studies have quantified their adverse events with a focus on gastrointestinal adverse events. However, no large epidemiologic study has investigated the risk of hair loss with these medications. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of hair loss. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone. The adjusted hazard ratio for hair loss for all patients using semaglutide, for men, and for women compared to bupropion-naltrexone were 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.86-2.69), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.05-14.49), and 2.08 (95% CI: 1.17-3.72) respectively. Our results demonstrate an increased risk of hair loss with semaglutide in women. Future studies are required to ascertain the association between semaglutide and hair loss.","NA","medrxiv",1745878160204

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1745878160204
