We demonstrate the real world implications of the use of testing and evaluate adverse events and outcomes in individuals who did not receive pharmacogenomic testing for clopidogrel.

MethodsWe analyzed ~100K individuals with paired EHR and exome sequencing data from population health studies administered at multiple medical centers using the Helix Exome+(R) assay. We inferred clopidogrel dosage by processing the prescription with an LLM. We identified all instances of individuals with at least one prescription that is not in concordance with their CYP2C19 genotype. Lastly, we identify instances of thrombosis using a comprehensive codeset based on ICD9, ICD10, and SNOMED terms.

ResultsWe identified 16,140 prescriptions of clopidogrel given to 3,853 participants. We found that 29% of these individuals have a mismatch between the recommended clopidogrel dosage guideline based on their CYP2C19 genotype and their actual prescribed daily dosage. 25% of poor metabolizers experienced thrombosis, with 40% occurring within 2 months of treatment. Poor and intermediate metabolizers receiving clopidogrel are much more likely to experience thrombosis and myocardial infarction (binomial p-value = 0.001).

ConclusionsWe estimate a 38% excess of adverse events occur in poor and intermediate metabolizers relative to normal and rapid metabolizers. The lack of testing may be responsible for 1 thrombosis event per every ~30 people prescribed clopidogrel.","NA","medrxiv",1748556594907

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1748556594907

Single-cell transcriptomics provides a detailed picture of the cellular states observed during these decisions, but building quantitative and predictive models from these data remains a challenge. Here, we present dynamic landscape analysis (DLA), a framework that applies dynamical systems theory to identify stable cell states, map transition pathways, and generate a predictive cell fate decision landscape from single-cell data. Applying this framework to vertebrate neural tube development, we reveal that progenitor specification by Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) can be captured in a landscape with an unexpected circular topology, where initially divergent lineages converge through multiple routes. This landscape accurately predicted cellular responses and cell fate allocation for unseen dynamic signalling regimes. By modelling the dynamic responses that drive cell fate decisions, the DLA framework provides a quantitative and generative framework for extracting mechanistic insights from high-dimensional single-cell data.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

Throughput can be increased by multiplexing samples in the mass domain with plexDIA, yet multiplexing along one dimension will only linearly scale throughput with plex. To enable combinatorial-scaling of proteomics throughput, we developed a complementary multiplexing strategy in the time domain, termed  timePlex. timePlex staggers and overlaps the separation periods of individual samples. This strategy is orthogonal to isotopic multiplexing, which enables combinatorial multiplexing in mass and time domains when paired together, and thus multiplicatively increased throughput. We demonstrate this with 3-timePlex and 3-plexDIA, enabling the multiplexing of 9 samples per LC-MS run, and 3-timePlex and 9-plexDIA exceeding 500 samples / day with a combinatorial 27-plex. Crucially, timePlex supports sensitive analyses, including of single cells. These results establish timePlex as a methodology for label-free multiplexing and combinatorial scaling of the throughput of LC-MS proteomics. We project this combined approach will eventually enable an increase in throughput exceeding 1,000 samples / day.

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

However, why do certain images remain unidentifiable while others can be recognized immediately, and what visual features drive subjective clarification? To address these critical questions, we developed a unique dataset of 1,854 ambiguous images and collected more than 100,000 participant ratings evaluating their identifiability before and after seeing undistorted versions of the images. Relating the representations of a brain-inspired neural network model in response to our images with human ratings, we show that subjective identification depends largely on the extent to which higher-level visual features from the original images are preserved in their ambiguous counterparts. Notably, the predominance of higher-level features over lower-level ones softens after participants disambiguate the images. In line with these results, an image-level regression analysis showed that the subjective identification of ambiguous images was best explained by high-level visual dimensions. Moreover, we found that the process of ambiguity resolution was accompanied by a notable decrease in semantic distance and a greater consistency in object naming among participants. However, the relationship between information gained after disambiguation and subjective identification was non-linear, indicating that acquiring more information does not necessarily enhance subjective clarity. Instead, we observed a U-shaped relationship, suggesting that subjective identification improves when the acquired information either strongly matches or mismatches prior predictions. Collectively, these findings highlight fundamental principles underlying the mapping between human visual perception and memory, advancing our understanding on how we resolve ambiguity and extract meaning from incomplete visual information.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

Thus the closed hypernucleosome conformation is conserved across archaeal lineages, while the open conformation resembles a eukaryotic H3-H4 octasome and likely represents an Asgard- specific innovation.

Overall, our study provides the first structure-based model of Asgard chromatin organization, expanding our understanding of chromatin architecture in evolutionary context.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

We identify a mechanism of symmetry mismatch at the caps of the vault, from 39-fold to 13-fold symmetry, where two out of three monomers are sequentially excluded from the cap, resulting in a narrow, greasy pore at the tip of the vault.

Here, we explore how DNA segregation and division are mechanistically coupled in archaeal relatives of eukaryotes, which lack CDK/Cyclins. Using live cell imaging we first describe the series of sequential changes in DNA organisation that accompany cell division in Sulfolobus, which computational modelling shows likely aid genome segregation. Through a perturbation analysis we identify a regulatory checkpoint which ensures that the compaction of the genome into two spatially segregated nucleoids only occurs once cells have assembly a division ring - which also defines the axis of DNA segregation. Finally, we show that DNA compaction and segregation depends, in part, on a ParA homologue, SegA, and its partner SegB, whose absence leads to bridging DNA. Taken together, these data show how regulatory checkpoints like those operating in eukaryotes aid high-fidelity division in an archaeon.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

Metacognitive ability is often measured through modeling the relationship between confidence reports and choice behavior in tasks where performance can be objectively measured. Previous work has explored whether metacognitive ability is conserved across different types of tasks, and across different domains such as perception and memory. However, it is unclear whether approaches to the assessment of metacognitive ability that have worked in these contexts can be extended to value-based decision-making where objective accuracy cannot be evaluated. Here, we compare metacognitive ability across different tasks spanning perception and valuation, using Bayesian hierarchical estimation of the parameters of a computational process model of confidence. This model captures metacognitive ability as the uncertainty of an individual's own decision uncertainty, and can do so in the space of any decision variable, regardless of whether it indexes external features or internal, subjective states. We find that metacognitive ability can be reliably estimated in both objective and subjective decision-making tasks, and is relatively well conserved across tasks, especially within domains and similar confidence reporting paradigms.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

High viral titres were detected in milk from infected cows, raising concerns about onwards human infections. Although pasteurisation was shown to effectively inactivate influenza viruses in milk, unpasteurised milk still poses a risk of infection, both from occupational exposure in dairies and from the consumption of raw milk. We therefore assessed how long influenza viruses could remain infectious for in milk without heat inactivation. We examined the stability of a panel of influenza viruses in milk, including a contemporary H5N1 HPAIV and a variety of other influenza A and D viruses. We incubated viruses in cows' milk under laboratory conditions: at room temperature to simulate exposure in dairies and at 4{degrees}C to simulate exposure to refrigerated raw milk. Following an isolated report of H5N1 viral RNA being detected in milk from a sheep in the UK, we also carried out similar experiments with a laboratory strain of IAV in sheep's milk. Although the survival of influenza viruses in milk was variable, we consistently found that under laboratory conditions substantial viral infectivity remained over periods when people might reasonably be exposed to infected milk - for over a day at room temperature and for more than 7 days when refrigerated. Our results highlight the zoonotic risk of H5N1 HPAIV in raw milk from infected animals and reinforce the importance of taking measures to mitigate this risk.","NA","medrxiv",1748556594907

Label-free approaches are simple to implement but challenging to scale to thousands of samples per day. Multiplexed techniques, such as plexDIA, can address these limitations but remain restricted by the lack of mass tags optimized for data-independent acquisition (DIA) workflows. Here, we present a systematic approach screening a library of 576 compounds that identifies several small molecules that, when conjugated to peptides, improve their detection and sequence identification by mass spectrometry. The lead molecule, PSMtag, substantially increases the detection of fragment b-ions, which increases the confidence of sequence identification and enhances de novo sequencing. PSMtags allow 9-plexDIA, using only stable isotopes of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. As a result, it allows simultaneously increasing proteome coverage and sample throughput for plexDIA workflows without compromising quantitative accuracy. We demonstrate 240 samples-per-day with 9-plexDIA, while acquiring 28,359 protein data points in the same time label-free methods acquire 4,340. Our approach constitutes an expandable framework for designing mass tags to overcome existing limitations in multiplexed proteomics and provides plexDIA reagents capable of analyzing over 1,000 samples per day when using 10 minute runs. By facilitating higher throughput and improved identification, this innovation holds significant potential for accelerating proteomic studies across diverse biological and clinical applications.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

Here, we combine metagenomics with 12/13C stable isotopic probing mesocosm experiments in a marine-derived meromictic pond to quantify lineage-specific carbon cycling activity to identify key microbial populations driving carbon cycling. We then tracked the flow of carbon from active chemoautotrophs to their viruses and found evidence supporting virus-mediated recycling of chemoautotrophic biomass through the production of viral particles. In particular, active populations of hydrogen/sulfur-oxidizing chemoautotrophs (Thiomicrorhabdus, Hydrogenovibrio, Sulfurimonas, Sulfurovum) were targeted by viruses. Considering the widespread distribution of chemoautotrophs on Earth, we postulate that this previously overlooked component of the microbial carbon cycle is a globally relevant process that has implications for our planets carbon cycle. This work provides the foundation for revealing the role of viral lysis in chemoautotrophic primary production and builds toward biogeochemical models that incorporate viral recycling of chemoautotrophic biomass.

Summary statementThe diversity, mechanisms, and processes governing microbial primary production and the recycling of autotrophic biomass are fundamental to our planets carbon cycle. These processes have implications for carbon sequestration, ocean biogeochemistry, and the overall balance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Beneath the Earths sunlit layer, primary production is driven by microbial chemoautotrophs that derive energy from the oxidation of reduced compounds, such as hydrogen and sulfur, to form the base of the food web. Growing evidence suggests that aquatic ecosystems fueled by chemoautotrophy are widely distributed on Earth, ranging from beneath ice shelves to coastal upwelling regions to oxygen minimum zones, deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, groundwater, and meromictic ponds and lakes2-7. Studying microbial processes regulating chemoautotrophic primary production and the recycling of chemoautotrophic biomass is fundamental to our understanding of global carbon cycles.

While the diversity, function, and activity of viruses targeting photoautotrophs have been well-described across aquatic ecosystems8, we have little understanding of viruses involved in the recycling of chemoautotrophic biomass. Viruses are a major source of cellular mortality and carbon cycling in aquatic environments9-11. Viral lysis is estimated to transform [~]150 gigatonnes of carbon annually from biomass back into the environment, equivalent to [~]25 times that of the oceans biological carbon pump12,13. Despite recognition of the important role of viruses in aquatic habitats, there is a large gap in our understanding of the impact of viruses on globally distributed chemoautotrophs2,4,5,14-18. In this study, we show that viruses are not merely passive players but active agents recycling carbon fixed by productive chemoautotrophs, fundamentally reshaping how we view carbon and nutrient cycling in redox-active ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

Deceased donor kidneys usually undergo cold storage until kidney transplantation, leading to cold ischemia injury that may contribute to poor graft outcomes. However, the molecular characterization of potential mechanisms of cold ischemia injury remains incomplete. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged spatial transcriptomics technology to perform full transcriptome characterization of cold ischemia injury (0-48 hours) using a murine model. We developed a computational workflow to identify spatiotemporal transcriptomic changes that accompany the injury pathophysiology in a compartment-specific manner. We identified potential metabolic reprogramming preferentially within the kidney inner medulla displaying strong oxidative phosphorylation signature in an ischemic environment. We found commonalities between the spatiotemporal transcriptomic presentation of cold ischemia and warm ischemia-reperfusion injury, including an induction of an anti-viral like immune response throughout the renal tissue. Altogether, these systems-level biological insights enabled by our full transcriptome temporal characterization unveil a molecular basis for how cold ischemia injury may negatively affect kidney outcomes. Moreover, our spatial analyses highlight pathological developments deep within the renal tissue, suggesting potential opportunities for new insights beyond biopsy-focused superficial tissue examinations.

These critical satiety neurons are strongly affected by a high-fat diet, yet the impact on their functional properties remains unknown. We used fiber photometry to track PVHMC4R neurons responses to the consumption of drops of milkshake in animals fed a chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD), both after obesity was established and after its reversal. PVHMC4R neurons in HFD-fed animals showed greater consumption-evoked responses than chow-fed animals at the early stages of meal consumption, and these responses did not increase further during the meal. HFD-fed animals also showed reduced licking vigor and motivation to consume Ensure. Switching HFD-fed obese animals to a normal chow diet (NCD) re-engaged the motivation to consume Ensure, partially restoring early-meal neural responses to a lower level, but did not restore the increase in consumption-evoked response magnitude across the meal.

While generally described as positively charged amphipathic helices, presequences lack a consensus motif and thus likely promote the import of proteins into mitochondria with variable efficiencies. Indeed, the concept of presequence 'strength' critically underlies biological models such as stress sensing, yet a quantitative analysis of what dictates 'strong' versus 'weak' presequences is lacking. Furthermore, the extent to which presequence strength affects mitochondrial function and cellular fitness remains unclear. Here, we capitalize on the high-throughput and kinetic nature of the MitoLuc mitochondrial protein import assay to quantify aspects of presequence strength. We find that select presequences, including those that regulate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), are sufficient to impart differential import efficiencies during mitochondrial uncoupling. Surprisingly, we find that presequences beyond those classically associated with stress signaling promote highly variable import efficiency in stressed and basal (i.e., non-stressed) conditions in vitro, suggesting that presequence strength may influence a broader array of processes than currently appreciated. We exploit this variability to demonstrate that only presequences that promote robust import in vitro can fully rescue defects in respiratory growth in Complex IV-deficient yeast, suggesting that presequence strength dictates metabolic potential. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that presequence strength can describe numerous metrics, such as total imported protein, maximal import velocity, or sensitivity to uncoupling, suggesting that the annotation of presequences as 'weak' versus 'strong' requires more nuanced characterization than is typically performed. Importantly, we find that such variability in presequence strength meaningfully affects cellular fitness in processes beyond stress signaling, suggesting that organisms may broadly exploit presequence strength to fine-tune mitochondrial import and thus organellar homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

CHASERR is a broadly expressed lncRNA located immediately upstream of the promoter of the CHD2 gene. We show that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting conserved motifs in CHASERR's last exon induce the formation of a fusion transcript joining CHASERR to CHD2. This fusion transcript is exported to the cytoplasm and translated into full-length CHD2 protein. Deleting the same motifs in mice mimics the ASO effect, increasing CHD2 protein without causing the deleterious effects associated with full CHASERR ablation. The fusion transcripts are also expressed endogenously, induced in activated neurons, and their constitutive induction affects neuronal gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Perinatal introduction of the ASO into Chd2+/- mice up-regulates CHD2 expression and alleviates behavioral phenotypes caused by CHD2 haploinsufficiency, providing a therapeutic route to CHD2 haploinsufficiency. This concept of targeting upstream genes with ASOs to induce transcript fusion can be extended to other gene pairs, and is thus a broadly relevant approach for increasing haploinsufficient gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

Here, we show that wounding in Arabidopsis leaves induces localized cooling, likely due to evaporative water loss, accompanied by the activation of cold-responsive genes. The subsequent disappearance of localized cooling and deactivation of cold-responsive genes serve as a quantitative marker of wound healing. Based on these observations, we developed a workflow by leveraging computer vision and deep learning to monitor the dynamics of wound healing.

To enhance sequence identification and quantification from such spectra, we developed an open source software for Joint Modeling of mass spectra: JMod. It uses the intrinsic structure in the spectra and explicitly models overlapping peaks as linear superpositions of their components. This modeling enabled performing 9-plexDIA using 2 Da offset PSMtags by deconvolving the resulting overlapping isotopic envelopes in both MS1 and MS2 space. The results demonstrate 9-fold higher throughput with preserved quantitative accuracy and coverage depth. This support for smaller mass offsets increases multiplexing capacity and thus proteomic throughput for a given plexDIA tag, and we demonstrate this generalizability with diethyl labeling.

Epistasis shapes this evolution, as an antigenic mutation that is deleterious in one genetic background may become tolerated in another. However, the extent to which epistasis can alleviate pleiotropic conflicts between immune escape and protein function/stability is unclear. Here, we measure how all amino acid mutations in the HA of a recent human H3N2 influenza strain affect its cell entry function, acid stability, and neutralization by human serum antibodies. We find that epistasis has enabled emergence of antigenic mutations that were detrimental to HAs cell entry function in earlier strains. However, epistasis appears insufficient to overcome the pleiotropic costs of antigenic mutations that impair HAs stability, explaining why some mutations that strongly escape human antibodies never fix in nature. Our results refine our understanding of the mutational constraints that shape influenza evolution: epistasis can enable antigenic change, but pleiotropic effects can restrict its trajectory.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

Embryoid bodies (EBs) are self-organizing multicellular structures that recapitulate aspects of early mammalian embryogenesis. We set out to perform a CRISPR screen perturbing all transcription factors (TFs) in murine EBs. Specifically, a library of TF-targeting guide RNAs (gRNAs) was used to generate mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) bearing single TF knockouts. Aggregates of these mESCs were induced to form mouse EBs, such that each resulting EB was mosaic with respect to the TF perturbations represented among its constituent cells. Upon performing single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on cells derived from mosaic EBs, we found many TF perturbations exhibiting large and seemingly significant effects on the likelihood that individual cells would adopt certain fates, suggesting roles for these TFs in lineage specification. However, to our surprise, these results were not reproducible across biological replicates. Upon further investigation, we discovered cellular bottlenecks during EB differentiation that dramatically reduce clonal complexity, curtailing statistical power and confounding interpretation of mosaic screens. Towards addressing this challenge, we developed a scalable protocol in which each individual EB is monoclonally derived from a single mESC and genetically barcoded. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we show how these monoclonal EBs enable us to better quantify the consequences of TF perturbations as well as inter-individual heterogeneity across EBs harboring the same genetic perturbation. Looking forward, monoclonal EBs and EB-derived organoids may be powerful tools not only for genetic screens, but also for modeling Mendelian disorders, as their underlying genetic lesions are overwhelmingly constitutional (i.e. present in all somatic cells), yet give rise to phenotypes with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

Here, utilizing Pseudomonas entomophila intestinal infection in Drosophila, we demonstrated that sex differences in intestinal redox processes contribute to female bias in susceptibility to gut infection. Female inability to overcome excessive pathogen-induced oxidative stress results in defecation blockage, pathogen persistence, and host death. Male flies exhibit increased carbohydrate metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway activity - a key antioxidant defense system. This allows males to withstand oxidative stress-induced defecation blockage and clear the pathogen from the intestine, resulting in survival. Additionally, P. entomophila showed increased expression of several virulence factors, including RNA-binding protein Hfq, in the female gut, contributing to female-biased virulence of P. entomophila. Thus, the effect of the gut metabolic environment on host defenses and pathogen virulence determines the sex differences in intestinal infection outcomes.

HighlightsIntestinal transit of gut pathogen contributes to sexually dimorphic susceptibility to Drosophila gut infection.
Male bias in PPP favors pathogen clearance and recovery post-infection.
P. entomophila reacts differently to female gut environment, where higher levels of Hfq might contribute to virulence/lethality.

The fruit fly Drosophila has provided a powerful model to dissect the mechanisms by which reward-encoding DANs mediate reward learning. However, the role of these DANs in regulating innate behaviors is less clear. Here, we show that activating the entire population of reward-encoding DANs in Drosophila drives innate aversion in multiple behavioral assays, including feeding, locomotion, and spatial preference, even as these neurons confer a positive value onto associated cues to drive future learned attraction. Activating subsets of DANs reveals that the effects on innate and learned behaviors are dissociable. Based on known circuitry, it is likely that innate aversion and learned attraction elicited by DANs arise from distinct effects - direct activation versus synaptic plasticity - on the same target neurons. These results reveal distinct roles for reward-encoding DANs in guiding immediate and future behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

This ability arises from the signal sent by muscle spindles to the brain. While there is clear evidence for age-related changes in the quantity of muscle spindles and in their sensitivity, behavioral assessment of age-related changes in position sense have produced mixed findings. Yet, study results are difficult to compare since there is no golden standard for assessment of proprioception. Therefore, we measured upper limb proprioception across several standard proprioceptive tasks together with key factors that could influence behavioral results such as touch, motor function, and cognition in 37 young (19-32 years old) and 35 older (53-71 years old) adults. We tested age-related differences in behavioral outcomes and their associations across tasks. Our results showed that age-related effects were very variable across position sense tasks, ranging from tasks where older participants performed better to tasks where they exhibit large age-related differences in position sense. These results were confirmed by meta-analysis based on data from hundreds of participants tested in our laboratory on the exact same tasks. Even within a task, different outcomes exhibit opposite age-related effects. Associations between outcome variables across or within proprioceptive tasks were overall negligible to weak. In conclusion, age-related changes in proprioception are limited, task- and outcome- dependent, and current tasks used to assess proprioception do not provide consistent evidence of age- related impairment in upper limb proprioception.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

We aimed to compare Germany-wide characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized adults with diabetes in diabetes certified vs. non-diabetes certified hospitals.

MethodsWe analyzed in the German Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) statistics for 2021-2023 all inpatient cases aged [&ge;] 20 years with and without diabetes (all types) as a main or secondary diagnosis based on ICD-10 codes. Using Wilcoxon and Chi2-tests, characteristics of inpatient cases with diabetes were compared between diabetes certified hospitals (n=300) and non-diabetes certified hospitals (n=1,103).

ResultsOf 43.4 million total inpatient cases in the period from 2021 to 2023, 8.1 million (18.5%) had a documented diabetes diagnosis (94% of the cases as secondary diagnosis). In certified hospitals, 19.0% of inpatient cases had diabetes compared to 18.3% in non-certified hospitals. Although inpatient cases with diabetes had more hospital-acquired and procedure-related complications (17.2% vs. 16.7%, p<0.001), as well as higher rates of hypoglycemia (3.2% vs. 2.1%, p<0.001) and metabolic disorder (diabetic ketoacidosis: 0,5% vs. 0,4%; acute metabolic disorder with multiple complications: 2.3% vs. 1.0%, p<0.001) in certified hospitals vs. non-certified hospitals, in-hospital mortality for all diabetes cases was similar (4.5% in both). However, among those with diabetes as the main diagnosis, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in diabetes certified hospitals (type 1 diabetes: 0.6% vs. 1.1% and type 2 diabetes: 2.3% vs. 2.9%, both p<0.001), despite a higher complication burden.

ConclusionsHospitalized people with diabetes as the main diagnosis had lower in-hospital mortality in diabetes-certified hospitals, even though they had a higher disease burden. These findings suggest that expanded use of DDG-certified departments, including consultation services for patients whose diabetes is a secondary diagnosis, may further improve clinical outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1748556594907

Yet, identifying such structures on dynamic surfaces remains an open challenge, limiting their application to many living and synthetic systems. Here, we introduce a geometric framework to extract Lagrangian and Eulerian coherent structures from velocity data on arbitrarily shaped, time-evolving surfaces. Our method operates directly on triangulated meshes, avoiding global parametrizations while preserving objectivity and robustness to noise. Applying this framework to active nematic vesicles, collectively migrating epithelial spheroids, and beating zebrafish hearts, we uncover hidden transport barriers and Lagrangian deformation patterns--such as dynamic attractors, repellers, isotropic and anisotropic strain--missed by conventional Eulerian analyses. This approach offers a new perspective on soft and living matter, revealing how geometry and activity can be harnessed to program synthetic materials, and how Lagrangian strain and principal deformation directions can help uncover mechanosensitive processes and directional cues in morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

Though regenerative neurogenesis is limited in humans, other animals use regenerative neurogenesis to faithfully restore form and function after brain injury. Planarians are flatworms with extraordinary capacity for brain regeneration. Planarians use pluripotent stem cells to create neurons after injury, rather than resident progenitors. In this context, genetic mechanisms that produce diverse neurons with correct local identity remain unknown. Here, we report the discovery of factors important for regenerative neurogenesis of dopaminergic neurons in the planarian central, peripheral, and pharyngeal nervous systems. Distinct genes promote dopaminergic neuronal identity and instruct neurons to inhabit regions of the nervous system. Our results demonstrate that planarian neuronal fate requires factors that simultaneously direct neurotransmitter choice and regional location.

Enhanced signaling between enterochromaffin (EC) cells in the gut epithelium and mucosal sensory nerve fibers likely contributes to this sex bias. Here, we identify a novel estrogen-responsive paracrine pathway in which two enteroendocrine cell types, PYY-expressing L cells and serotonergic EC cells, communicate to increase gut sensitivity in females. We demonstrate that ER estrogen signaling upregulates the bacterial metabolite SCFA receptor Olfr78 on colonic L-cells, increasing PYY release and their sensitivity to acetate. Elevated PYY acts on neighboring EC cells via NPY1R, thereby enhancing serotonin release and gut pain. We propose that hormonal fluctuations, in conjunction with internal (stress) or environmental (diet) factors, amplify this local estrogen-responsive colonic circuit, resulting in maladaptive gut sensitivity.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

In the spinal cord, different ""cardinal classes"" of neurons that share a common molecular identity are produced from spatially segregated progenitor domains. Within many such classes, a stereotyped sequence of divergent neuronal types of related function is generated over time, raising the question of the molecular mechanisms that control this process. Here, we show that the successive expression of mouse transcription factors Onecut2, Pou2f2 and Pou3f1 within the cardinal classes giving rise to motor and sensory circuits, correlates with the emergence of sequentially generated subpopulations of neurons within those domains. We demonstrate that the genetic loss of Pou2f2 results in impaired development of two early-born motor neuron columns and re-specification of anterolateral system projection neurons as a later-born subset. Similarly, we show that Pou3f1 expression is required for the normal development of later-born subsets of motor neurons and anterolateral system projection neurons. Together, our observations provide functional evidence that horologic diversification of output neurons of spinal motor and sensory circuits are driven by a conserved sequential order of expression of transcription factors.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

To investigate how dopamine release varies across the brain, we used multi-site fiber photometry to recors dopamine dynamics in mice performing tasks involving both rewarding and aversive outcomes. We found that while reward-related dopamine signals were broadly distributed, responses to aversive events were region-specific, enabling classification of projection targets from these dopamine dynamics. By examining the main axis of covariance of dopamine release across the brain, we found that reward prediction error signals are encoded by parallel manifolds, whereas aversive stimulus signals are encoded by orthogonal manifolds. Thus, our findings support a distributed, vector-valued model of dopaminergic signaling, in which anatomically and functionally distinct pathways contribute to encoding of reinforcement-related variables across the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

Consistently, paternally inherited TEs are derepressed in the progeny of Drosophila crosses involving a naive female. TEs have also been found to be derepressed in interspecific crosses, which is proposed to result from suboptimal interactions of piRNA pathway proteins. Fundulus heteroclitus and F. diaphanus hybridize in nature and produce viable and fertile offspring that sometimes reproduce asexually. We characterized the repetitive DNA content of these species and their asexually reproducing hybrids. TE load was slightly higher than expected in hybrids and associated with younger repeats.

The number and identity of vertebrae are ultimately determined by somitogenesis and subsequent anterior-posterior regionalisation, largely governed by hox gene expression. Interspecific variation in vertebral count and regionalisation therefore reflects evolutionary changes in somite number and homeotic identity following species divergence. While many macroevolutionary studies have examined homeotic and non-homeotic changes in the vertebral column, few have explored these dynamics in teleosts, despite their exceptional species richness. Using African cichlids as a model, we show that shifts in vertebral regionalisation can arise through modifications to anterior-posterior patterning, but that much of the observed variation is driven by changes in somite number, with homeotic effects emerging largely as a by-product of somitic changes. Moreover, low intraspecific variation in vertebral count, lacking phylogenetic structure, suggests that somitic count variation within species is strongly canalised and has remained consistent throughout the diversification of African cichlids. In addition, we find no correlation between intraspecific variation in vertebral counts and mean vertebral counts, and this variation does not consistently scale with body aspect ratio among individuals. Therefore, intraspecific variation is decoupled from both macroevolutionary patterns of vertebral count evolution and body shape diversification. Together, our findings highlight the dynamic interplay between somitogenesis and homeotic transformations in shaping vertebral diversity and underscore the value of cichlids as a model for understanding the developmental basis of axial evolution in teleosts.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

CB1 is widely expressed in various hippocampal cell types. While it is known that CB1 participates in memory processes, its specific roles in different cell types and how these roles may differ between sexes remain unclear. This study investigates how CB1 signaling in the hippocampus, in both, cell-type-specific and sex-dependent manner, contributes to navigation and memory. To this end, we selectively deleted CB1 receptors from neurons, CAMKII-expressing neurons, and astrocytes from the hippocampus of adult male and female mice. We then assessed its effect on a broad range of behaviors, including innate emotional responses, memory, navigation, and other hippocampus-related functions such as nesting. Deletion of CB1 in CAMKII-expressing neurons produced a pronounced effect in males, leading to increased anxiety and impairments in both reference and spatial memory. These mice also showed altered performance in the Barnes maze, relying less on spatial strategies. By contrast, females were less affected by this specific deletion. Interestingly, only deletion of CB1 from astrocytes led to spatial memory impairments in females, which also showed reduced LTP and a decreased reliance on spatial strategies in the Barnes maze. In conclusion, our findings show that neuronal CB1 receptors are critical for the spatial navigation strategy in males, while astrocytic CB1 receptors play a key role in memory processes both in males and females.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

While the molecular and cellular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been extensively studied experimentally, much of our understanding of how plasticity is organized across populations of neurons during task learning comes from training artificial neural networks (ANNs) using computational methods. However, the architectures of modern ANNs and the algorithms used to train them are not compatible with fundamental principles of neuroscience, leaving a gap in understanding how the brain coordinates learning across multiple layers of neural circuitry. Here we leverage recent experimental evidence to test an emergent theory that biological learning depends on specialization of distinct neuronal cell types and compartmentalized signaling within neuronal dendrites. We demonstrate that multilayer ANNs comprised of separate recurrently connected excitatory and inhibitory cell types, and neuronal units with separate soma and dendrite compartments, can be trained to accurately classify images using a fully biology-compatible deep learning algorithm called dendritic target propagation. By adhering to strict biological constraints, this model is able to provide unique insight into the biological mechanisms of learning and to make experimentally testable predictions regarding the roles of specific neuronal cell types in coordinating learning across different brain regions.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

IDPs are heterogeneous, existing in a conformational ensemble of various interconnected states without a definitive tertiary structure. The high dynamicity of IDPs limits ensemble protein characterisation techniques from capturing their properties, and measurements at the single-molecule level are hampered by the necessity to label the protein or modify its microenvironment, affecting their biophysics. Consequently, our understanding of IDPs is limited, translating to a lack of knowledge of their roles in related diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and various cancers. This work presents the first experimental observation of unmodified IDP conformational dynamics in vitro, at the single-molecule level in real time, achieved by trapping individual IDPs in a nanoscale volume using aperture-based plasmonic nanotweezers. Our results reveal that IDPs exhibit significantly larger conformational variation in solution compared to globular proteins of similar size, as expected, enabling clear differentiation between the two categories. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of native tau-441 by glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3{beta}-tau) induces compaction and reduced conformational dynamics.

To monitor ethylene in plants, analytical methods, phenotypic assays, gene expression analysis, and transcriptional or translational reporters are typically employed. In the model plant Arabidopsis, two ethylene-sensitive synthetic transcriptional reporters have been described, 5xEBS:GUS and 10x2EBS-S10:GUS. These reporters harbor a different type, arrangement, and number of homotypic cis-elements in their promoters and thus may recruit the ethylene master regulator EIN3 in the context of alternative transcriptional complexes. Accordingly, the patterns of GUS activity in these transgenic lines differ and neither of them encompasses all plant tissues even in the presence of saturating levels of exogenous ethylene. Herein, we set out to develop and test a more sensitive version of the ethylene-inducible promoter that we refer to as EBSnew (abbreviated as EBSn). EBSn leverages a tandem of ten non-identical, natural copies of a novel, dual, everted, 11bp-long EIN3-binding site, 2EBS(-1). We show that in Arabidopsis, EBSn outperforms its predecessors in terms of its ethylene sensitivity, having the capacity to monitor endogenous levels of ethylene and displaying more ubiquitous expression in response to the exogenous hormone. We demonstrate that the EBSn promoter is also functional in tomato, opening new avenues to manipulating ethylene-regulated processes, such as ripening and senescence, in crops.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

How disparate mutations converge on this regulatory pathway is not understood. Here we demonstrate that mutant NPM1 (NPM1c) forms nuclear condensates in multiple human cell lines, mouse models, and primary patient samples. We show NPM1c phase separation is necessary and sufficient to coordinate the recruitment of NUP98 and KMT2A to condensates. Through extensive mutagenesis and pharmacological destabilization of phase separation, we find that NPM1c condensates are necessary for regulating gene expression, promoting in vivo expansion, and maintaining the undifferentiated leukemic state. Finally, we show that nucleoporin and KMT2A fusion proteins form condensates that are biophysically indistinguishable from NPM1c condensates. Together, these data define a new condensate underlying leukemias that we term coordinating bodies (C-bodies), and propose C-bodies as a therapeutic vulnerability.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

The impermeability and structural complexity of the outer membrane of this envelope, driven by mycolic acids and glycolipids, pose significant challenges for therapeutic intervention. Here, we present the first all-atom models of an Mtb outer membrane using molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that -mycolic acids adopt extended conformations to stabilize bilayers, with a phase transition near 338 K that underscores their thermal resilience. Lipids in the outer leaflet such as PDIM and PAT induce membrane heterogeneity, migrating to the interleaflet space and reducing lipid order. The simulated mycobacterial outer membrane has ordered inner leaflets and disordered outer leaflets, which contrasts with the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. These findings reveal that PDIM- and PAT-driven lipid redistribution, reduced lipid order, and asymmetric fluidity gradients enable Mtbs outer membrane to resist host-derived stresses and limit antibiotic penetration, thereby promoting bacterial survival. Our work provides a foundational framework for targeting the mycobacterial outer membrane in future drug development.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

Soil ecosystems have long been recognized as hotspots of microbial diversity, but most estimates of their complexity remain speculative, relying on limited data and extrapolation from shallow sequencing. Here, we revisit this question using one of the deepest metagenomic sequencing efforts to date, applying 148 Gbp of Nanopore long-read and 122 Gbp of Illumina short-read data to a single forest soil sample. Results. Our hybrid assembly reconstructed 837 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including 466 high- and medium-quality genomes, nearly all lacking close relatives among cultivated taxa. Rarefaction and k-mer analyses reveal that, even at this depth, we capture only a fraction of the extant diversity: nonparametric models project that over 10 Tbp would be required to approach saturation. These findings offer a quantitative, technology-enabled update to long-standing diversity estimates and demonstrate that conventional metagenomic sequencing efforts likely miss the majority of microbial and biosynthetic potential in soil. We further identify over 11,000 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), >99% of which have no match in current databases, underscoring the breadth of unexplored metabolic capacity. Conclusions. Taken together, our results emphasize both the power and the present limitations of metagenomics in resolving natural microbial complexity, and they provide a new baseline for evaluating future advances in microbial genome recovery, taxonomic classification, and natural product discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

Using NAP1KO cell lines, we discovered that NAP1 exerts a dual effect on TBK1 activity. Initially, NAP1 binds TBK1 and increases its activity, which enhances the activation of the IFN pathway. Then, phosphorylation of NAP1 by TBK1 induces the formation of NAP1 condensates. These condensates concentrate TBK1 and PP2A, a phosphatase known to dephosphorylate and consequently deactivate TBK1, thus limiting IFN induction. Additionally, in patients with lupus or interferonopathies, we identified NAP1 variants, unable to form condensates upon cell exposure to danger signals, which can only activate TBK1 without limiting its activity. This study reveals an original mode of regulating a signaling pathway by formation of condensates and provides a molecular explanation for certain interferonopathies.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

The full extent of protein dysfunctions in AD and their impact on cellular physiology remains unknown. Here, we used plexDIA, an approach that parallelizes the acquisition of samples and peptides, to characterize proteomic changes in AD. Using human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue, we identified 281 differentially abundant proteins in AD. By systematically analyzing cellular compartment-specific shifts in protein abundance, we identified an AD-specific decrease in levels of the 20S proteasome, the catalytic core of the cell's primary protein degradation pathway. This alteration was accompanied by widespread decreases in proteasome subunit stoichiometries. Many proteasome substrate proteins were negatively correlated with 20S levels and increased in AD, suggesting that reduced 20S levels leads to abnormal protein accumulation. By analyzing proteins increased in AD, we identify key properties of such proteins. Namely, they have highly specific subcellular localizations and fast degradation rates, they contain signal sequences that allow them to be targeted for proteasomal degradation, and they are targeted by quality control pathways that recognize mislocalized proteins. Furthermore, we identify coherent sets of ubiquitin system enzymes, proteins that target substrates for proteasomal degradation, whose levels robustly discriminate AD from non-AD samples. One subset exhibited consistent increases in AD, while another exhibited consistent decreases, revealing complex alterations to the ubiquitin system in AD. Taken together, our results suggest that decreased ubiquitin-proteasome system capacity and impaired clearance of short-lived and mislocalized proteins contribute substantially to proteopathic burden in AD.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

This process is known as background selection. However, the impact of background selection has been studied almost exclusively without reference to its effect on phenotypic variation. Here, we use population genetic theory and simulation to investigate the consequences of background selection for linked variation impacting complex traits. We find the impact of background selection on a complex trait depends on the type of selection acting on the trait, the effect size distribution, and the background selection intensity. For instance, background selection impacts a much broader range of effect sizes for traits under directional selection via a liability threshold mechanism (i.e. when selection acts on individuals with phenotypes exceeding a threshold) than when fitness decays exponentially with trait value. We also find that background selection can increase the population prevalence of a liability threshold trait (e.g. a complex binary disease trait). Furthermore, while background selection can only reduce the genetic variance of a trait under directional selection (as might be expected from the classical population genetic theory for linked neutral variants) we find that background selection can increase the genetic variance of a trait under stabilizing selection. The results presented here use a synthesis of population genetic and quantitative genetic modeling, and overall, have relevance for understand the genetic architecture and evolution of complex traits, including complex diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

We show that SQ-1 sensitises p62 to oxidation and promotes its disulphide-mediated oligomerisation in response to mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). This ROS-dependent activation of p62-mediated selective autophagy enhances the clearance of ROS-generating mitochondria and restores cell viability in models of Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease, which is marked by impaired autophagic flux.

However, evidence of hybrid states, where cells co-express opposing fate determinants, challenges this model. We hypothesised that oscillatory expression enables co-existence of cross-repressive TFs within single cells, allowing hybrid states in bistable motifs. To test this, we focused on HES1 and HES5, oscillatory, cross-repressive TFs that regulate neural progenitor maintenance and are expressed in adjacent dorsoventral domains in the developing spinal cord. Using live-cell imaging of fluorescent reporters and computational modelling, we show that HES1 and HES5 co-express and oscillate in-phase within single cells. Differences in protein stability result in distinct free-running periodicity, but co-expression results in entrainment and phase-locking. Modulating cross-repression strength and/or abundance shifts the system towards bistability and dominance of a single TF oscillator.

The process has been primarily studied in a few model strains, particularly C58, and developed into Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (AMT) for genetic manipulation. However, the diversity of wild-type strains and their context-specific regulatory responses remain poorly characterized. Here, we evaluated five wild-type strains and identified 1D1108 as superior in tumorigenesis on legumes and transient transformation in Nicotiana benthamiana. Under in vitro virulence induction with acetosyringone (AS), we identified 126 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 1D1108. Although the number of DEGs was comparable to those in C58 and the legume isolate 1D1609 under the same condition, only 22 DEGs, primarily within the vir regulon, were conserved, indicating extensive divergence among these Agrobacterium strains. Leaf infiltration of N. benthamiana revealed 1,134 DEGs specifically regulated in planta for 1D1108. These included genes involved in attachment, virulence regulation, type IV pilus, succinoglycan biosynthesis, and diverse nutrient transporters, providing new evidence on expression regulation during colonization. Comparative analyses of in planta transcriptomes with C58 and Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 revealed distinct secretion systems required for pathogenesis, namely type IV for Agrobacterium and type III for Pseudomonas, and only approximately 5-19% of DEGs were conserved. These limited transcriptomic overlaps underscore the importance of studying gene expression in strains and conditions directly relevant to the biological context, rather than relying on model systems. Together, this work reveals how environmental and host-associated cues shape transcriptional responses in plant-associated bacteria.

IMPORTANCEAgrobacterium is a key tool for plant genetic engineering, yet much of our knowledge about its biology comes from a few strains studied under artificial conditions. This work combines tumor formation assays on legumes and transient transformation in Nicotiana benthamiana with transcriptomic analyses to explore how diverse Agrobacterium strains, particularly the high-performing wild-type strain 1D1108, respond to host and environmental cues. By comparing gene expression under in vitro and in planta conditions, we found that the bacterial response within plant tissue is more complex than previously appreciated. Cross-strain comparisons further revealed limited conservation in gene expression regulation, even under similar conditions. Comparative analysis with Pseudomonas syringae revealed the activation of distinct secretion systems for pathogenesis and differences in regulatory programs used during plant colonization. These findings underscore the importance of studying bacteria in biologically relevant contexts and highlight the limitations of relying solely on model strains to infer regulatory responses.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

Hub connectivity is strongly influenced by genetic factors but the molecular cues guiding the foundation of these structures remain poorly understood. Here, we combined high-resolution diffusion MRI tractography from 208 term-born neonates with spatially resolved prenatal gene expression data to investigate the molecular correlates of network hub formation at mid-gestation. We identified robust hub architecture in the neonatal connectome and mapped these structural hubs to corresponding cortical regions in the Brain prenatal digital brain atlas. Transcriptomic analysis revealed differential gene expression in network hubs prior to the time of birth, with genes positively associated with hub status supporting the establishment of early neuronal circuitry and predominantly expressed in the transient subplate and intermediate zones. Hub genes were expressed by excitatory neurons, including subplate neurons and intratelencephalic projection neurons in deep cortical layers, and overlapped with markers of cortical expansion and interhemispheric connectivity in adulthood. Our study identifies prenatal transcriptomic signatures of network hubs in the neonatal human brain, demonstrating how early gene expression programs can shape brain network connectivity from mid-gestation.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

ATP-binding cassette transporters of the D subfamily (ABCD1-3) mediate the import of CoA thioesters of fatty acids into the peroxisome. ABCD3, the most abundant of these transporters in the peroxisomal membrane, facilitates the transport of a broad spectrum of substrates including branched-chain fatty acids, very long-chain fatty acids, bile salt intermediates, and dicarboxylic acids. Mutations in ABCD3 are associated with defects in congenital bile acid synthesis and variants of Zellweger syndrome. The structural and functional details of the human ABCD3 transporter remain unclear, despite its significance. In this study, we report the cryogenic sample electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of full-length human ABCD3 in its apo state and bound to one of the physiological substrates (phytanoyl-CoA) at resolutions of 3.33 [A] and 3.13 [A], respectively. Our biochemical assays reveal that substrate binding induces ATPase activity in ABCD3, suggesting a substrate-dependent conformational change. Structural comparison of the apo and substrate bound states demonstrate that the substrate interaction brings nucleotide-binding domains closer, providing a mechanistic basis of substrate induced ATPase activity. These findings offer critical insights into the transport mechanism of ABCD3 and lay a structural foundation for understanding its role in peroxisomal metabolite import and related diseases.

Significance StatementPeroxisomes are involved in essential cellular metabolic processes that include fatty acid oxidation, bile acid synthesis, and detoxification. The ABCD subfamily of membrane transporter proteins transport fatty acyl-CoA molecules from the cytosol into peroxisomes. Among the ABCD subfamily members, ABCD3 transports branched chain fatty acids and a range of other important metabolites. Dysfunction in ABCD3 has been associated with several inherited and acquired diseases. Using cryo-EM, we determined high-resolution structures of full-length human ABCD3 in both unbound and phytanoyl-CoA-bound forms. We show that substrate binding stimulates ATP hydrolysis activity by apposition of the two nucleotide binding domains of ABCD3, adding structural insight into the mechanism of action of ABCD3 and its role in peroxisomal function and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

In the zero-shot setting, variant impact is estimated by comparing the likelihoods of sequences, under the assumption that likelihood serves as a proxy for fitness. However, this assumption often breaks down in practice: sequence likelihood reflects not only evolutionary fitness constraints, but also phylogenetic structure and sampling biases, especially as model capacity increases. We introduce Likelihood-Fitness Bridging (LFB), a simple and general strategy that improves variant effect prediction by averaging model scores across sequences subject to similar selective pressures. Assuming an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of evolution, LFB can be viewed as a way to marginalize the effects of genetic drift, although its benefits appear to extend more broadly. LFB applies to existing protein and genomic language models without requiring retraining, and incurs only modest computational overhead. Evaluated on large-scale deep mutational scans and clinical benchmarks, LFB consistently improves predictive performance across model families and sizes. Notably, it reverses the performance plateau observed in larger protein language models, making the largest models the most accurate when combined with LFB. These results suggest that accounting for phylogenetic and sampling biases is essential to realizing the full potential of large sequence models in variant effect prediction.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

Good clinical practice requires that samples be retained for decades, thus giving rise to enormous archives of healthy and diseased human tissues. Tissue-clearing technologies and whole-mount microscopy would enable 3D analyses, but whole FFPE tissue blocks are often unsuitable for clearing due to their size, their extensive covalent cross-linking, and their embedding in solid wax. Here, we present  archival DISCO (aDISCO), a versatile and robust clearing method for whole-mount archival FFPE human tissue blocks. aDISCO enabled complete clearing and consistent antibody staining of samples stored for at least 15 years. We show that aDISCO can be applied to human brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, skin, muscle, heart, kidney, liver, spleen, colon, and lung, and is compatible with a wide range of commonly used antibodies. We applied aDISCO to the 3D study of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a neurodevelopmental disease associated with epilepsy. We performed deep-learning-based segmentation and object detection to identify both focal and global neuronal density variations in FCD and to precisely quantify the disruption of cortical layering, features that are likely to be overlooked by conventional histology.

A recent discovery of a multi-subunit insertase in eukaryotes has raised the question about the architecture of the putative bacterial ortholog SecYEG-YidC and its functional mechanism. Here, we combine cryogenic electron microscopy with cell-free protein synthesis in nanodiscs to visualize biogenesis of the polytopic membrane protein NuoK, the subunit K of NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, that requires both SecYEG and YidC for insertion. We demonstrate that YidC is recruited to the back of the translocon at the late stage of the substrate insertion, in resemblance to the eukaryotic system, and in vivo experiments indicate that the complex assembly is vital for the cells. The nascent chain does not utilize the lateral gate of SecYEG, but enters the lipid membrane at the SecYE-YidC interface, with YidC being the primary insertase. SecYEG-YidC complex promotes folding of the nascent helices at the interface prior their insertion, so the examined cellular pathway follows the fundamental thermodynamic principles of membrane protein folding. Our data provide the first detailed insight on the elusive insertase machinery in the physiologically relevant environment, highlight the importance of the nascent chain for its assembly, and prove the evolutionary conservation of the gate-independent insertion route.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

We aimed to identify and validate parsimonious transcriptomic signatures that accurately predict fatal outcomes within 48 hours of hospitalization.

MethodsWe studied 894 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 across 20 US hospitals and enrolled in the prospective Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and nasal swabs collected within 48 hours of admission. Host gene expression was assessed by RNA sequencing, nasal SARS-CoV-2 viral load was measured by RT-qPCR, and mortality was assessed at 28 days. We first defined transcriptional signatures and biological features of fatal COVID-19, which we compared against mortality signatures from an independent cohort of patients with non-COVID-19 sepsis (n=122). Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression in 70% of the COVID-19 cohort, we trained parsimonious prognostic classifiers incorporating host gene expression, age, and viral load. The performance of single and three-gene classifiers was then determined in the remaining 30% of the cohort and subsequently externally validated in an independent, contemporary COVID-19 cohort (n=137) with vaccinated patients.

ResultsFatal COVID-19 was characterized by 4189 differentially expressed genes in the peripheral blood, representing marked upregulation of neutrophil degranulation, erythrocyte gas exchange, and heme biosynthesis pathways, juxtaposed against downregulation of adaptive immune pathways. Only 7.6% of mortality-associated genes overlapped between COVID-19 and sepsis due to other causes. A COVID-specific three-gene peripheral blood classifier (CD83, ATP1B2, DAAM2) combined with age and SARS-CoV-2 viral load achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88 (95% CI 0.82-0.94). A three-gene nasal classifier (SLC5A5, CD200R1, FCER1A), in comparison, yielded an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.64-0.83). Notably the expression of OLAH alone, a gene recently implicated in severe viral infection pathogenesis, yielded an AUC of 0.86 (0.79-0.93). Both peripheral blood classifiers demonstrated comparable performance in vaccinated patients from an independent external validation cohort (AUCs 0.74- 0.80).

ConclusionsA three-gene peripheral blood signature, as well as OLAH alone, accurately predict COVID-19 mortality early in hospitalization, including in vaccinated patients. These parsimonious blood- and nasal-based classifiers merit further study as accessible prognostic tools to guide triage, resource allocation, and early therapeutic interventions in COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1748556594907

Whole-cortex functional gradients, which organize regions along axes of functional similarity, are positioned here as a framework for understanding such alterations. Across two independent cohorts (BioFINDER-2, N=973; ADNI, N=129), we demonstrate that hyper- and hypoconnectivity in both healthy aging and biomarker-confirmed AD progression coexist systematically, forming consistent spatial patterns that align with two distinct axes of brain organization. Using a combination of longitudinal and non-linear analyses, we show that the early (but not late) stages of AD pathology accumulation is associated with functional alteration along the sensory-association axis, a pattern that vanishes in later stages of AD. However, functional alteration along the sensory-association axis is associated with worse cognition throughout the AD spectrum, and even in older adults without AD pathology, suggesting that these FC patterns may reflect a general neural response to cognitive strain. Independently of AD, older age was associated with alterations instead along the executive-nonexecutive axis, a finding that was consistent throughout the adult lifespan.

However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying eIF2As function remains poorly understood. Here, we exploit a TurboID-based proximity labeling combined with mass spectrometry to systematically map the interactome of eIF2A during homeostasis and stress. Combining polysome gradients with TurboID, we zoom into the interactions of eIF2A with the 40S small ribosomal subunit and map the eIF2A binding site close to the mRNA entry channel. We identify a network of interactors that link eIF2A to ribosome-associated quality control, including its strong interaction with G3BP1-USP10 complexes as well as RPS2 and RPS3. In the absence of eIF2A, RPS2 and RPS3 ubiquitination is diminished specifically upon ribosome stalling. 40S-specific footprinting in eIF2A knockout cells shows minimal changes in 5UTR occupancy, consistent with a limited role for eIF2A in translation initiation. Using dynamic SILAC mass spectrometry, we characterize the novel function of eIF2A in ribosome-associated quality control and show that eIF2A antagonizes USP10-dependent rescue of 40S ribosomes, resulting in altered turnover of 40S subunits upon cellular stress. Collectively, our study identifies a previously unknown link between eIF2A and ribosome-associated quality control, implies that eIF2A promotes translation fidelity by tuning 40S ribosome rescue under stress and warrants further investigations into the role of ribosome-associated quality control in tumorigenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

DesignMatched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Trypanosoma brucei expresses a single Variant-Surface-Glycoprotein (VSG) from a large genetic repertoire, which they periodically switch throughout an infection. Co-transcribed with the active-VSG within a specialised nuclear body are expression-site-associated-genes (ESAGs), involved in important host-parasite interactions, including protecting the parasite from human serum lytic effects, modulating the hosts innate immune response and uptake of essential nutrients. Despite expression within the same polycistron, there is a significant differential expression between ESAGs and VSGs (>140-fold), however, the regulatory mechanism has remained elusive for decades. Here, using a combination of genetic tools, super resolution microscopy, proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, we identified three novel proteins, which are recruited in a hierarchical manner, forming discreet sub-nuclear condensates that are developmentally regulated and negatively regulate ESAG transcripts. Among them, Expression-Site-Body-specific-protein-2 (ESB2) contains a nuclease domain that shares structural similarity to the endonuclease domain found in SMG6, a critical component of nonsense mediated decay in mammals. Mutation of key residues required for the nuclease activity impaired ESB2 localisation and function. Overall, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation and shed light on how specialised RNA decay can regulate expression of specific genes.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

However, the extent to which molecular evolution has influenced the isotopic signatures of nitrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to bioavailable ammonia, remains unresolved. Here, we reconstruct and experimentally characterize a library of synthetic ancestral nitrogenase genes, spanning over 2 billion years of evolutionary history. By engineering modern microbes to express these ancient nitrogenases, we assess the resulting {varepsilon}{superscript 1}N values under controlled laboratory conditions. All engineered strains exhibit {varepsilon}15N values within a narrow range comparable to that of modern microbes, suggesting that molybdenum (Mo)-dependent nitrogenase has been largely invariant throughout evolutionary time since the origins of this pathway.

Here, we present StringTie3, a major update to the widely used StringTie assembler, specifically designed for total RNA-seq. This new version introduces two key innovations: (1) a nascent mode that models co-transcriptional splicing to separate nascent from mature transcripts, and (2) a refined long-read module that distinguishes genuine polyadenylation sites from poly(A)-priming artifacts. Across short-, long-, and hybrid-read datasets, StringTie3 substantially reduces assembly errors and outperforms existing tools, boosting precision by up to 20% in short-read total RNA-seq and improving sensitivity and precision by as much as 37% and 75%, respectively, in long-read assemblies. In Argonaute knockout experiments, nascent-mode analysis shows that single knockouts predominantly alter nascent transcripts while leaving mature RNA largely unchanged, whereas double or triple knockouts disrupt both fractions. Applying this approach to breast cancer samples shows that, although nascent and mature RNA levels often correlate, certain extracellular matrix and tumor suppressor genes deviate from this pattern, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation. By accurately reconstructing transcriptomes and distinguishing nascent from mature RNA, StringTie3 reveals hidden layers of RNA regulation and provides a powerful framework for investigating transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes in total RNA-seq data.","NA","biorxiv",1748556594907

Yet, our understanding of which environmental and biological factors drive the prevalence of CRISPR-Cas systems in the oceans remains limited. A search for CRISPR-Cas systems was conducted among 176 globally-distributed marine microbial metagenomes from the Malaspina expedition, which sampled both free-living and particle-attached microbiomes with emphasis on the deep ocean. We show that CRISPR-Cas systems are proportionally more abundant among microbiomes from the deep ocean than in the photic layers and among free-living microbes compared to those attached to particles, reflecting the higher concentrations of archaea and their viruses in these habitats. We identified 1,146 CRISPR-cas loci, some of which displayed unique loci architectures. From these loci, a total of 48 Cas9 proteins were identified, many of which are potentially novel.

Despite this, little is known regarding the global epidemiology of IMP carbapenemases.

MethodsWe comprehensively identified blaIMP genes in all publicly available bacterial genomes, then systematically analysed the distribution of variants across species, lineages, plasmids and mobile elements, examining patterns over time, across geographic regions and by source. Structural analysis of IMP variants was performed.

Findings4,556 blaIMP-containing genomes were identified from 1996-2023, including 52 blaIMP variants across 93 bacterial species. Key variants (blaIMP-1, blaIMP-4, blaIMP-7, blaIMP-8 and blaIMP-13) achieved global endemicity, while blaIMP-26 and blaIMP-27 were regionally endemic in Southeast Asia and North America, respectively. blaIMP dissemination was driven by horizontal gene transfer, facilitating inter-species spread. Proliferation of multidrug-resistant Enterobacter hormaechei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae lineages led to local outbreaks. Dereplication removed 3,175/4,556 (69.9%) genomes, indicating that most blaIMP-containing genomes were highly related. blaIMP variants were associated with mobile genetic element combinations including class 1 integrons and insertion sequences (99.7%), aiding mobilisation into [&ge;]52 plasmid clusters, predominantly IncHI2A, IncN, IncL/M and IncC. Genomes of environmental and animal origin accounted for 10.0% and 1.1% of the dataset, respectively. Evidence of cross-source transmission was limited, with most spillover occurring between genomes of human and environmental origin. Structural analysis revealed a conserved carbapenemase structure (mean lDDT 0.977), with convergent missense mutations at seven catalytically relevant sites.

InterpretationGlobal analysis enabled us to historically reconstruct the emergence and variant-specific epidemiologies of blaIMP carbapenemase genes. Intersecting mobile elements enabled blaIMP genes to spread across multiple plasmids and bacterial genera, facilitating global and multi-source spread within a One Health framework. Additionally, convergent evolutionary patterns indicate that IMP variants may continue evolving, potentially evading novel beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.

Research in context panelO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSDespite being a major cause of carbapenem resistance in Gram negative infections, little is known about the global epidemiology of IMP carbapenemases. IMP carbapenemases are metallo-beta-lactamases that were first identified in 1991 and have evolved into 96 different IMP variants. On May 21 2025, we searched all published reports available in PubMed using the terms ""IMP and  carbapenemase genomics NOT (Review[Publication Type]) NOT (Case Reports[Publication Type]) NOT PCR"" with no language restrictions and no publication date restrictions. We identified 223 articles, 62 and 121 of which reported single species or a single study centre/country, respectively. Only 6 articles employed genomics to examine multi-species and multi-geographical isolates, though this was in the context of carbapenem resistance more broadly rather than IMP carbapenemases specifically. The most relevant study included 38 globally distributed genomes across four species and tracked seven blaIMP variants across mobile genetic elements.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this global characterisation provides the most comprehensive account of blaIMP carbapenemase gene epidemiology. To analyse the global distribution and diversity of blaIMP genes, we compiled all available public genome data resulting in a dataset of 4,646 genomes. This has allowed us to identify local, regional and international spread of blaIMP variants and determine the contributions of clonal expansion, plasmid proliferation and co-localised mobile genetic elements. We demonstrated that key blaIMP variants display global (IMP-1, IMP-4, IMP-7, IMP-8 and IMP-13) and regional (IMP-26 within Southeast Asia and IMP-27 within North America) endemicity and that these patterns have been previously unacknowledged, reframing the previous understanding that IMP carbapenemases were largely confined to the Asia-Pacific region. Our observation of convergent evolutionary patterns raise concern that IMP variants may continue to evolve, potentially evading new {beta}-lactam antimicrobials. This analysis has revealed the under-recognised contribution IMP carbapenemases make to global carbapenem resistance.

Implications of all the available evidenceThese findings provide the first comprehensive atlas of blaIMP carbapenemase gene dissemination and underscore the silent global spread of IMP carbapenemases. We note the critical need for enhanced surveillance systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, that can detect complex plasmid-mediated and mobile genetic element-associated spread, as we noted with blaIMP carbapenemase genes. Moreover, our analyses show that systematic sampling across human, animal, and environmental reservoirs is crucial to address the One Health dimensions of emerging antimicrobial resistance threats. The study provides a framework for future interventions aimed at tracking and stopping the spread of IMP carbapenemases and calls for co-ordinated, real-time public health responses to this growing challenge.","NA","medrxiv",1748556594907

Our results reveal new categories of exceptions and nuance to the N-degron pathway observed in bulk and context-specific analyses. For example, we find cases where penultimate residues can reinforce or shift the stability expected based only on the identity of position 1 (P1). We observe lowered stability for P2-P5 motifs rich in bulky residues and Gln as well as heightened stability for P2-P5 motifs rich in negatively charged residues, Gly, and Pro, particularly when these residues are at P2. We find that P1 Cys can be a component of an N-degron in a sequence-specific manner.

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1748556594907

We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo-Dropout CNN (MCD-CNN), as well as a few-shot learning approach to address dataset size limitations. Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1748556594907

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1748556594907
