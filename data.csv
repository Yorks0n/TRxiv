MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, .1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

SummaryAmong 47561 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine was 23% effective against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196830

Influenza A virus (IAV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded, RNA virus that has not previously been associated with widespread infection in cattle. As such, cattle are an extremely under-studied domestic IAV host species. IAV receptors on host cells are sialic acids (SAs) that are bound to galactose in either an 2,3 or 2,6 linkage. Human IAVs preferentially bind SA-2,6 (human receptor), whereas avian IAVs have a preference for 2,3 (avian receptor). The avian receptor can further be divided into two receptors: IAVs isolated from chickens generally bind more tightly to SA-2,3-Gal-{beta}1,4 (chicken receptor), whereas IAVs isolated from duck to SA-2,3-Gal-{beta}1,3 (duck receptor). We found all receptors were expressed, to a different degree, in the mammary gland, respiratory tract, and cerebrum of beef and/or dairy cattle. The duck and human IAV receptors were widely expressed in the bovine mammary gland, whereas the chicken receptor dominated the respiratory tract. In general, only a low expression of IAV receptors was observed in the neurons of the cerebrum. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for the high levels of H5N1 virus reported in infected bovine milk and show cattle have the potential to act as a mixing vessel for novel IAV generation.

Defense-associated reverse transcriptase (DRT) systems provide an intriguing counterpoint to this immune strategy by instead leveraging DNA synthesis, but the identities and functions of their DNA products remain largely unknown. Here we show that DRT2 systems execute an unprecedented immunity mechanism that involves de novo gene synthesis via rolling-circle reverse transcription of a non-coding RNA (ncRNA). Unbiased profiling of RT-associated RNA and DNA ligands in DRT2-expressing cells revealed that reverse transcription generates concatenated cDNA repeats through programmed template jumping on the ncRNA. The presence of phage then triggers second-strand cDNA synthesis, leading to the production of long double-stranded DNA. Remarkably, this DNA product is efficiently transcribed, generating messenger RNAs that encode a stop codon-less, never-ending ORF (neo) whose translation causes potent growth arrest. Phylogenetic analyses and screening of diverse DRT2 homologs further revealed broad conservation of rolling-circle reverse transcription and Neo protein function. Our work highlights an elegant expansion of genome coding potential through RNA-templated gene creation, and challenges conventional paradigms of genetic information encoded along the one-dimensional axis of genomic DNA.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

These communication patterns can be comprehensively mapped using noninvasive functional imaging, resulting in functional connectivity (FC) networks. Despite its popularity, FC is a statistical construct and its operational definition is arbitrary. While most studies use zero-lag Pearson's correlations by default, there exist hundreds of pairwise interaction statistics in the broader scientific literature that can be used to estimate FC. How the organization of the FC matrix varies with the choice of pairwise statistic is a fundamental methodological question that affects all studies in this rapidly growing field. Here we comprehensively benchmark the topological and geometric organization, neurobiological associations, and cognitive-behavioral relevance of FC matrices computed using a large library of 239 pairwise interaction statistics. We comprehensively investigate how canonical features of FC networks vary with the choice of pairwise statistic, including (1) hub mapping, (2) weight-distance trade-offs, (3) structure-function coupling, (4) correspondence with other neurophysiological networks, (5) individual fingerprinting, and (6) brain-behavior prediction. We find substantial quantitative and qualitative variation across FC methods. Throughout, we observe that measures such as covariance (full correlation), precision (partial correlation) and distance display multiple desirable properties, including close correspondence with structural connectivity, the capacity to differentiate individuals and to predict individual differences in behavior. Using information flow decomposition, we find that differences among FC methods may arise from differential sensitivity to the underlying mechanisms of inter-regional communication, with some more sensitive to redundant and some to synergistic information flow. In summary, our report highlights the importance of tailoring a pairwise statistic to a specific neurophysiological mechanism and research question, providing a blueprint for future studies to optimize their choice of FC method.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Design: Nationwide cohort studies, using target trial emulation. Setting: Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, from 1 October 2023 to 29 February 2024. Participants: Individuals aged [&ge;]65 years who had previously received at least four covid-19 vaccine doses. Main outcome measures: Cumulative incidences of covid-19 hospital admission and death for 12 weeks after immunisation (defined as 1 week after vaccination) among recipients of an XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk differences. Results: During autumn and winter 2023-2024, a total of 1,867,448 1:1 matched pairs of XBB-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and non-recipients were included (mean age 75.4 years, standard deviation 7.4 years). The comparative vaccine effectiveness was 60.6% (95% confidence interval, 46.1% to 75.1%) against covid-19 hospital admission (930 v 2,551 events) and 77.9% (69.2% to 86.7%) against covid-19 related death (301 v 1,326 events) at 12 weeks of follow-up. This corresponded to 191.1 (95% confidence interval, 50.2 to 332.1) covid-19 hospital admissions and 109.2 (100.2 to 118.1) deaths prevented per 100,000 individuals vaccinated with an XBB.1.5-containing vaccine. The comparative vaccine effectiveness was similar across sex, age (65-74/[&ge;]75 years), number of previous covid-19 vaccine doses received, and seasonal influenza vaccination co-administration subgroups and periods of either omicron XBB- or BA.2.86-sublineage dominance. While the protection was highest during the first weeks after vaccination, it was well-preserved at end of week 12 of follow-up. Conclusion: Among adults aged [&ge;]65 years, vaccination with a monovalent XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine reduced the rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and death during autumn and winter 2023-2024 across three Nordic countries.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196830

Hindwing tails that thwart bat attack have repeatedly originated in moon moths (Saturniidae), with longer tails having more pronounced anti-predator effect. Understanding the relative evolutionary balance between predation pressure and possible limiting factors requires a macroevolutionary perspective. To estimate the eco-evolutionary forces shaping tails, we conducted phylogenetically-informed linear regressions. We built a well-sampled, time-calibrated phylogeny of the entirely tailed moth group (Actias + Argema) and performed ancestral state reconstruction and biogeographical analyses. To generate metrics of evolutionary pressures, we developed estimates of bat predator abundance and estimated environmental conditions associated with individual moth wing measurements. This integrative approach reveals evidence for positive selection on hindwing tails and body size by bats and negative selective pressure from environmental factors. Our study provides insight into the tradeoffs between strong biotic selective pressures and abiotic constraints that shape elaborate traits across the tree-of-life.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Its downregulation can lead to perseveration, a symptom seen in several neuropsychiatric disorders. This balance is regulated by dopamine from VTADA (ventral tegmental area dopamine) neurons, which in turn are largely controlled by GABA (gamma amino-butyric acid) synapses. However, the causal relationship of these circuit elements to extinction and perseveration remain incompletely understood. Here, we employ an innovative drug targeting technology, DART (drug acutely restricted by tethering), to selectively block GABAA receptors on VTADA neurons as mice engage in Pavlovian learning. DART eliminated GABAA mediated pauses; brief decrements in VTADA activity canonically thought to drive extinction learning. However, contrary to the hypothesis that blocking VTADA pauses should eliminate extinction learning, we observed the opposite: accelerated extinction learning. Specifically, DART eliminated the naturally occurring perseveration seen in half of control mice. We saw no impact on Pavlovian conditioning, nor on other aspects of VTADA neural firing. These findings challenge canonical theories, recasting GABAA-mediated VTADA pauses from presumed facilitators of extinction to drivers of perseveration. More broadly, this study showcases the merits of targeted synaptic pharmacology, while hinting at circuit interventions for pathological perseveration.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

However, a survey of heritable insecticide susceptibility traits among wild-caught Anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes, collected across an extensive study area composed largely of wilderness in southern Tanzania, necessitated that live mosquitoes were carried on foot over distances up to 25 km per day because most of the area was impassable by car, motorcycle or even bicycle during the rains. A self-cooling, self-humidifying carrier backpack was therefore developed that allows live adult mosquito specimens to be transported across rugged miombo woodland and floodplain terrain throughout the year. This wettable backpack was fabricated from stitched Tanzanian kitenge cotton fabric and PVC-coated fiberglass netting that allows easy circulation of air in and out. An outer cover flap made of cotton towelling embedded inside a kitenge envelope overhangs the fiberglass netting upper body of the bag, to protect mosquitoes from direct sunlight, and can be soaked with water to maintain low temperature and high humidity inside. Mean survival of insectary-reared female Anopheles arabiensis transported through 9 different mobile camps inside the 509 km2 Ifakara-Lupiro-Mangula Wildlife Management Area (ILUMA WMA), over up to 143km and 25 days, was indistinguishable from those left in the field insectary over the same period. Although considerable variance was observed between different batches of mosquitoes from the insectary and between individual cups of mosquitoes, the different levels and positions inside the backpack had no influence on survival. Temperature and humidity inside the backpack were maintained at standard insectary condition throughout, despite much more extreme conditions immediately outside. When the backpack was applied to collecting wild An. arabiensis and Anopheles quadriannulatus across a much larger study area of >4000 km2, encompassing the ILUMA WMA, some nearby villages and adjacent parts of Nyerere National Park (NNP), it achieved a mean survival rate of 58.2% [95% confidence interval 47.5 to 68.2]. Encouragingly, no difference in survival was observed between ILUMA WMA and NNP even though transport back from NNP involves much longer distances, sometimes involving lengthy journeys by car or boat. Overall, this mosquito carrier backpack prototype appears to represent a viable and effective method for transporting live wild-caught mosquitoes on foot across otherwise impassable terrain under challenging weather conditions with minimal detrimental impact on their survival.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Evidence from homogeneous liquid or flat plate cultures implicates biochemical cues -- such as variation in nutrient composition, response to chemoattractants and toxins, and inter-species signalling -- as the primary modes of bacterial interaction with their microenvironment. However, these systems fail to capture the effect of physical confinement on bacteria in their natural habitats. Bacterial niches like the pores of soil, mucus, and infected tissues are disordered microenvironments with material properties defined by their internal pore sizes and shear moduli. Here, using three-dimensional matrices that match the viscoelastic properties of gut mucus, we test how altering the physical properties of their microenvironment influences bacterial growth under confinement. We find that low aspect-ratio bacteria form compact, spherical colonies under confinement while high aspect-ratio bacteria push their progenies further outwards to create elongated colonies with a higher surface area, enabling increased access to nutrients. As a result, the population level growth of high aspect-ratio bacteria is more robust to increased physical confinement compared to that of low aspect-ratio bacteria. Thus, our results capture the first experimental evidence that physical constraints play a selective role in bacterial growth based on cell shape.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Lipid peroxidation occurs primarily on phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Here, we show that even though extracellular lipid limitation reduces cellular PUFA levels, lipid-starved cancer cells are paradoxically more sensitive to ferroptosis. Using mass spectrometry-based lipidomics with stable isotope fatty acid labeling, we show that lipid limitation induces a fatty acid trafficking pathway in which PUFAs are liberated from triglycerides to synthesize highly unsaturated PUFAs such as arachidonic acid and adrenic acid. These PUFAs then accumulate in phospholipids, particularly ether phospholipids, to promote ferroptosis sensitivity. Therefore, PUFA levels within cancer cells do not necessarily correlate with ferroptosis susceptibility. Rather, how cancer cells respond to extracellular lipid levels by trafficking PUFAs into proper phospholipid pools dictates their sensitivity to ferroptosis.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

In this study, we first benchmark SHAPEIT and Beagle, two state-of-the-art phasing methods, on two large datasets: >8 million diverse, research-consented 23andMe, Inc. customers and the UK Biobank (UKB). We find that both perform exceptionally well. Beagle's median switch error rate (SER) (after excluding single SNP switches) in white British trios from UKB is 0.026% compared to 0.00% for European ancestry 23andMe research participants; 55.6% of European ancestry 23andMe research participants have zero non-single SNP switches, compared to 42.4% of white British trios. South Asian ancestry 23andMe research participants have the highest median SER amongst the 23andMe populations, but it is still remarkably low at 0.46%. We also investigate the relationship between identity-by-descent (IBD) and SER, finding that switch errors tend to occur in regions of little or no IBD segment coverage. SHAPEIT and Beagle excel at 'intra-chromosomal' phasing, but lack the ability to phase across chromosomes, motivating us to develop an inter-chromosomal phasing method, called HAPTIC (HAPlotype TIling and Clustering), that assigns paternal and maternal variants discretely genome-wide. Our approach uses identity-by-descent (IBD) segments to phase blocks of variants on different chromosomes. HAPTIC represents the segments a focal individual shares with their relatives as nodes in a signed graph and performs bipartite clustering on the signed graph using spectral clustering. We test HAPTIC on 1022 UKB trios, yielding a median phase error of 0.08% in regions covered by IBD segments (33.5% of sites). We also ran HAPTIC in the 23andMe database and found a median phase error rate (the rate of mismatching alleles between the inferred and true phase) of 0.92% in Europeans (93.8% of sites) and 0.09% in admixed Africans (92.7% of sites). HAPTIC's precision depends heavily on data from relatives, so will increase as datasets grow larger and more diverse. HAPTIC enables analyses that require the parent-of-origin of variants, such as association studies and ancestry inference of untyped parents.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Previous research has identified midbrain dopaminergic neuronal alterations related to maternal THC consumption. However, the enduring consequences that prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) has on striatum-based processing during voluntary reward pursuit have not been specifically determined. Here, we characterize PCE rats during food (palatable pellets) or opioid (remifentanyl)-maintained reward seeking. We find that the supra motivational phenotype of PCE rats is independent of value-based processing and is instead related to augmented reinforcing efficiency of opioid rewards. Our findings reveal that in utero THC exposure leads to increased cue-evoked dopamine release responses and an overrepresentation of cue-aligned, effort-driven striatal patterns of encoding. Recapitulating findings in humans, drug-related neurobiological adaptations of PCE were more pronounced in males, who also showed increased vulnerability for relapse. Collectively, these findings indicate that prenatal THC exposure in male rats engenders to a pronounced neurodevelopmental susceptibility to addiction-like disorders later in life.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Strikingly, late-wave dynamics were modulated by stimulus value and correlated with task performance. Mechanistically, the late wave component was i) modulated by motor feedback, ii) complemented by a sparse ensemble pattern across layer 2/3, which a balanced-state network model reconciled via inhibitory stabilization, and iii) aligned to regenerative Layer-5 apical dendritic Ca2+ events.

However, aDNA data typically have varying sampling times, but most demographic inference methods designed for modern data assume that sampling is contemporaneous. Here, we present TTNe (Time-Transect Ne), which models time-transect sampling to improve inference of recent effective population size trajectories. Using simulations, we show that utilizing IBD sharing in time series has increased resolution to infer recent fluctuations in effective population sizes compared to methods that only use contemporaneous samples.

However, few have investigated functional trade-offs and covariance among functional traits within and between the skull, limbs, and vertebral column simultaneously. In this study, we investigated the adaptive landscape of skeletal form and function in carnivorans to test how functional trade-offs between these skeletal regions contribute to ecological adaptations and the topology of the landscape. We found that functional traits derived from carnivoran skeletal regions exhibit trade-offs and covariation across their performance surfaces, particularly in the appendicular and axial skeletons. These functional trade-offs and covariation corresponded as specializations to different adaptive landscapes when optimized by locomotor mode, diet, or family. Lastly, we found that the topologies of the optimized adaptive landscapes and underlying performance surfaces are largely characterized as smooth, gradual gradients between regions of low and high adaptive zones rather than as rugged, multipeak landscapes. Our results suggest that carnivorans may already occupy a broad adaptive zone as part of a larger mammalian adaptive landscape that masks the form and function relationships of skeletal traits.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Several proposed adaptations extend this model to females with variable, often marginal effects. We examine the if widely used male-defined metrics of stress are suboptimal in females and reveal sex-specific adaptations. Methods: Using a data-driven method we comprehensively classified social interaction behavior in 761 male and female mice after chronic social witness/defeat stress, examining social modulation of behavioral frequencies and associations with conventional metrics (i.e., social interaction (SI) ratio). Results: Social stress induces distinct behavioral adaptation patterns in males and females. SI ratio leads to underpowered analyses in females with limited utility to differentiate susceptibility/resilience. Data-driven analyses reveal failure of social adaptation in stressed female mice that is captured in attenuated velocity change from no target to target tests ({Delta}Velocity) and validate this in three female social stress models. Combining SI ratio and {Delta}Velocity optimally differentiates susceptibility/ resilience in females and this metric reveals resilient-specific adaptation in a resilience-associated neural circuit in female mice. Conclusions: We demonstrate that psychological or physical social defeat stress induces similar deficits in females that is qualitatively distinct from male deficits and inadequately sampled by male-defined metrics. We identify modulation of locomotion as a robust and easily implementable metric for rigorous research in female mice. Overall, our findings highlight the need to critically evaluate sex differences in behavior and implement sex-based considerations in preclinical model design.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

This phenomenon can be used to convey feedback from a brain-controlled bionic hand about object interactions. However, ICMS currently provides an impoverished sense of touch, limiting dexterous object manipulation and conscious experience of neuroprosthetic systems. Leveraging our understanding of how these sensory features are encoded in S14,5, we sought to expand the repertoire of ICMS-based artificial touch to provide information about the local geometry and motion of objects in individuals with paralysis. First, we simultaneously delivered ICMS through multiple, spatially patterned electrodes, adopting specific arrangements of aligned projected fields (PFs). Unprompted, the participants reported the sensation of an edge. Next, we created more complex PFs and found that participants could intuitively perceive arbitrary tactile shapes and skin indentation patterns. By delivering patterned ICMS sequentially through electrodes with spatially discontinuous PFs, we could even evoke sensations of motion across the skin, the direction and speed of which we were able to systematically manipulate. We conclude that appropriate spatiotemporal patterning of ICMS inspired by our understanding of tactile coding in S1 can evoke complex sensations. Our findings serve to push the boundaries of artificial touch, thereby enriching participants conscious sensory experience from simple artificial percepts to highly informative sensations that mimic natural touch.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196830

Yet, despite its biological and clinical importance, the underlying mechanisms regulating folliculogenesis remain enigmatic. Here, we report a novel role of the surface-anchoring theca cells (TCs) in regulating follicle growth through mechanical signalling. Direct mechanical measurements reveal that these TCs are highly contractile and exert compressive stress to the follicular interior, potentially through active assembly of fibronectin scaffold around the follicles. Abolishing TC contractility disrupts fibronectin assembly, increases follicle size, and decreases intrafollicular pressure and viscosity. We further reveal that the granulosa cells (GCs) within the follicles exhibit spatial patterns of YAP signalling and proliferation, which appear to be decoupled. Transient manipulation of tissue pressure through bulk follicle compression, laser ablation or pharmacological perturbation of TC contractility leads to changes in GC YAP signalling, proliferation, and oocyte-GC communications, while long term abrogation of TC contractility leads to impaired follicle growth. Altogether, our study unveils the unique role of TC-mediated tissue pressure in ensuring robust mammalian ovarian folliculogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Mice, with discernible facial responses and evolutionarily conserved mammalian facial movement control circuits, provide an ideal model to unravel the link between facial movement and internal physiological states in mammals.

The precise face-wide motion data generated by Cheese3D provides clear physiological insights, as shown by proof-of-principle experiments predicting time under anesthetic from subtle facial patterns, and inferring tooth and muscle anatomy from fast chewing motions.

CTP binding and hydrolysis enable ParB to slide on DNA and to bridge and condense DNA, thereby dictating the size and dynamics of the tripartite ParABS complex. Several other evolutionarily distinct systems can also segregate DNA, although the full diversity of bacterial DNA partition systems is not yet known. Here, we identify a CTP-independent ParABS system that maintains a conjugative plasmid SCP2 in the filamentous bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. We demonstrate that an SCP2 ParB-like protein, ParT, loads onto DNA at an 18-bp parS site and diffuses away to the adjacent DNA despite lacking an apparent CTPase domain and detectable NTPase activity. We further show that parS DNA stimulates ParT transition from loading to a diffusing state to accumulate on DNA, and ParT activates the ATPase activity of its cognate partner protein ParA. We also identify numerous structural homologs of ParT, suggesting that CTP-independent diffusion on DNA might be widespread in bacteria despite being previously unappreciated. Overall, our findings uncover a CTP-independent DNA translocation as an alternative and unanticipated mechanism for the assembly of a bacterial DNA segregation complex and suggest that CTP binding and hydrolysis is not a fundamental feature of ParABS-like systems.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

ImportanceWhile surveillance for avian influenza viruses is often focused on migratory routes and their associated stop-over locations, or commercial poultry operations, many bird species - including migratory birds - frequent or live in urban green spaces and wetlands.

Particularly lacking is this information for dark taxa although they contain most animal species. This problem can be addressed with high-throughput single specimen barcoding (megabarcoding), but it remain unknown to what extent one dark taxon can be used as a proxy for another because of similar biodiversity patterns. This is here tested and we show that two Diptera taxa (Phoridae, Mycetophilidae) have very different spatio-temporal distributions across the same elevational gradient. We applied COI megabarcoding to samples collected every 14 days over three seasons at six elevations (800 to 1,800 m) in a temperate forest ecosystem in Northern China (Baihua Mountain Reserve). Elevation, precipitation, and temperature were used as environmental variables to understand the data obtained for 17,179 specimens representing 492 mOTUs of Phoridae and 2,281 specimens of 148 mOTUs of Mycetophilidae. Congruent is that the alpha diversity for both taxa increased in the summer and there is evidence for a mid-domain effect and phylogenetic clustering in high elevations. However, the extent and pattern of seasonal variation differed considerably. Phorid communities exhibited shifts between spring, summer and autumn seasons, but surprisingly little difference between elevations. In contrast, mycetophilid communities were structured along the elevational gradient and dependent on precipitation. Our study highlights the urgent need for obtaining detailed spatio-temporal information for the most diverse dark taxa, but also illustrates that these data can be readily obtained with megabarcoding.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

We performed single-cell-RNAseq-analysis of FACS-isolated early placodal cells, making up less than 0.4% of cells within the embryo. Differential expression analysis in comparison to epidermal cells analysed in parallel generated a repertoire of genes highly upregulated within placodal cells prior to morphogenetic changes. Furthermore, clustering and pseudo-time analysis of single-cell-sequencing data identified dynamic expression changes along the morphogenetic timeline. Our dataset provides a comprehensive resource for future studies of a simple but highly conserved morphogenetic process of tube morphogenesis.

Phage-encoded defense inhibitors have proven powerful tools to interrogate how defense systems function. A relatively common defense system is BREX (Bacteriophage exclusion); however, how BREX functions to restrict phage infection remains poorly understood. A BREX system encoded by the SXT integrative and conjugative element, VchInd5, was recently identified in Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera. The lytic phage ICP1 that co-circulates with V. cholerae encodes the BREX inhibitor OrbA, but how OrbA inhibits BREX is unclear. Here, we determine that OrbA inhibits BREX using a unique mechanism from known BREX inhibitors by directly binding to the BREX component BrxC. BrxC has a functional ATPase domain that, when mutated, not only disrupts BrxC function but also alters how BrxC multimerizes. Furthermore, we find that OrbA binding disrupts BrxC-BrxC interactions. We determine that OrbA cannot bind BrxC encoded by the distantly related BREX system encoded by the SXT VchBan9, and thus fails to inhibit this BREX system that also circulates in epidemic V. cholerae. Lastly, we find that homologs of the VchInd5 BrxC are more diverse than the homologs of the VchBan9 BrxC. These data provide new insight into the function of the BrxC ATPase and highlight how phage-encoded inhibitors can disrupt phage defense systems using different mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Controlling for age, UCH-L1 and GFAP were significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID-19 controls, and UCH-L1, but not GFAP, was elevated in patients with neurological alterations. Data from this study are also compared to historical data on levels of UCH-L1 and GFAP in brain injured and healthy normal patients. These data support further studies of an FDA approved assay format that could facilitate timely development, validation, and FDA approval of blood tests to detect neuronal and glial cell injuries following infection by SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, appropriately validated blood tests could detect brain injury originating from any systemic pathogen.

This often leads to large datasets with complex experimental designs that need advanced comparative analysis. Concurrently, bioinformatics software and analytic approaches also become more diverse and constantly undergo improvement. Thus, there is an increased need for automated and standardized data processing and analysis pipelines, which should be efficient and flexible too. To address these, we develop the single-cell Differential Analysis and Processing Pipeline (scDAPP), a R-based workflow for comparative analysis of single cell (or nucleus) transcriptomic data between two or more groups and at the levels of single cells or pseudobulking samples. The pipeline automates many steps of pre-processing using data-learnt parameters, uses previously benchmarked software, and generates comprehensive intermediate data and final results that are valuable for both beginners and experts of scRNA-seq analysis. Moreover, the analytic reports, augmented by extensive data visualization, increase the transparency of computational analysis and parameter choices, while facilitate users to go seamlessly from raw data to biological interpretation. Availability and Implementation: scDAPP is freely available for non-commercial usage as an R package under the MIT license.

Particularly, African countries are at risk of viral introductions through air travel connectivity with areas of South America and Asia that experience frequent explosive outbreaks. Limited reporting and diagnostic capacity hinder a comprehensive assessment of continent-wide transmission dynamics and deployment of surveillance strategies in Africa. Methods: The risk of dengue introduction into Africa from countries of high incidence was estimated based on origin-destination air travel flows and epidemic activity at origin. We produced a novel proxy for local dengue epidemic activity using a composite index of theoretical climate-driven transmission potential and population density, which we used, along with travel information in a risk flow model, to estimate the importation risks. Findings: We find that countries in east Africa face higher risk of importation from Asia, whereas for west African countries, larger risk of importation is estimated from South America. Some countries with high risk of importation experience low local transmission potential which likely hampers the chances that importations lead to local establishment and transmission. Conversely, Mauritius, Uganda, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Kenya are identified as countries susceptible to dengue introductions during periods of persistent transmission suitability. Interpretation: Our work improves the data driven allocation of surveillance resources, in regions of Africa that are at high risk of dengue introductions and establishment. This will be critical in detecting and managing imported cases and can improve local response to dengue outbreaks.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196830

Traditional tools, optimised for bacterial genomes, fall short in addressing the complexities of phage genomics such as high sequence variability, mosaicism or the absence of universally shared genes. To bridge this gap, we introduce MANIAC (MMseqs2-based ANI Accurate Calculator), aiming to accurately estimate ANI and alignment fraction (AF) between pairs of viral genomes, using the MMseqs2 software which combines alignment-free and alignment-based approaches. We evaluated MANIAC against the gold-standard ANIb using complete phage genomes and further validated its performance with simulated and real genomic data. MANIAC demonstrated a near-perfect correlation with ANIb (R2 = 0.999), outperforming existing tools like fastANI and Mash, especially for genomes below 80% ANI. When applied to hundreds of millions of pairs of phage genomes, MANIAC revealed a bimodal ANI distribution amongst phage populations, pointing to the existence of an  ANI gap similar to that observed in bacterial populations, albeit with quantitative differences. We then used a machine learning approach to classify same-genus pairs by combining both ANI and AF metrics, showing its strong predictive power (PR-AUC=0.970), particularly in virulent phages (PR-AUC=0.990). These findings underscore MANIACs potential to significantly advance viral genomics by providing a more accurate framework for quantifying genetic relatedness between viral genomes.

However, designing pan-specific primers for viral pathogens that have high genomic variability represents a major challenge. Here, we present a bioinformatics command-line tool, called varVAMP (variable virus amplicons). It relies on multiple sequence alignments of highly variable virus sequences and enables automatic pan-specific primer design for qPCR or tiled amplicon whole genome sequencing. The varVAMP software guarantees pan-specificity by two means: it designs primers in regions with minimal variability and introduces degenerate nucleotides into primer sequences to compensate for common sequence variations. We demonstrate varVAMPs utility by designing and evaluating novel pan-specific primer schemes suitable for sequencing the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, Hepatitis E virus, rat Hepatitis E virus, Hepatitis A virus, Borna-disease-virus-1, and Poliovirus. Moreover, we established highly sensitive and specific Poliovirus qPCR assays that could potentially simplify current Poliovirus surveillance. Importantly, wet-lab and bioinformatic techniques established for SARS-CoV-2 tiled amplicon sequencing were readily transferable to these new primer schemes and will allow sequencing laboratories to extend their established methodology to other human pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

However, ROH are common in populations that practice endogamy or consanguinity, and cutoffs for reporting ROH in such populations may not be evidence-based.

MethodsWe reviewed prenatal testing results (based on cytogenetic microarrays) from 2191 pregnancies in the Jewish and non-Jewish populations of Northern Israel and estimated the prevalence of ROH according to self-reported ethnicity and parental relationships.

ResultsThe proportion of the genome in ROH, ROH rate, was higher in non-Jews [Mean(SD)=2.91%(3.92%); max=25.54%; N=689] than in Jews [Mean(SD)=0.81%(0.49%); max=3.93%; N=1502]. In the non-Jewsih populations, consanguineous marriages had the highest ROH rates [Mean(SD)=7.14%(4.55%), N=217], followed by endogamous [Mean(SD)=1.13%(1.09%), N=283]) and non-endogamous [Mean(SD)=0.69%(0. 56%), N=189]) marriages. ROH rates were greater than 5%, the ACMG-recommended cutoff, in 149/689 (21.63%) of the non-Jewish samples. Within the Jewish populations, the rates were similar between Ashkenazi, North African, and Middle Eastern Jews, but were higher for six consanguineous unions [Mean(SD)=2.38%(1.23%)] and when spouses belonged to the same sub-population.

ConclusionsGiven the high ROH rates we observed in some subjects, we suggest that assessing the risk for recessive conditions in consanguineous/endogamous populations should be done before the first pregnancy, through genetic counseling and sequencing. Such an approach will: (1) identify couples who are at risk and counsel them on reproductive options; and (2) avoid the stress that couples who are not at risk may experience due to a prenatal ROH report.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196830

However, it remains unclear to what extent the formation of such predictions taxes executive resources. Our study set out to investigate how a limitation of executive resources impacts natural language prediction on multiple timescales in a novel dual-task paradigm, and how this impact is modulated by age. Participants (N = 175; 18-85 years) read short newspaper articles, presented word by word in varying font colours. This self-paced reading task was either performed in isolation or paired with a competing n-back task (1-back or 2-back) on the words' font colour. We measured word-level reading time and block-level reading comprehension as well as n-back performance. To quantify word predictability, we estimated word surprisal on four distinct timescales (i.e., context lengths ranging from words to paragraphs) using a large language model. Under high cognitive load, adults aged 60 and over benefited most from high word predictability. Our results show that independent of timescale, higher cognitive load diminishes the benefits of high word predictability on reading time, suggesting language predictions draw on executive resources.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

However, current animal models of memory typically present sensory cues to trigger retrieval and assess retrieval based on action. As a result, it is difficult to determine whether measured patterns of neural activity relate to the cue(s), the retrieved memory, or the behavior. We therefore asked whether we could develop a paradigm to isolate retrieval-related neural activity in animals without retrieval cues or the requirement of a behavioral report. To do this, we focused on hippocampal ""place cells."" These cells primarily emit spiking patterns that represent the animal's current location (local representations), but they can also generate representations of previously visited locations distant from the animal's current location (remote representations). It is not known whether animals can deliberately engage specific remote representations, and if so, whether this engagement would occur during specific brain states. So, we used a closed-loop neurofeedback system to reward expression of remote representations that corresponded to uncued, experimenter-selected locations, and found that rats could increase the prevalence of these specific remote representations over time; thus, demonstrating memory retrieval modulated by internal goals in an animal model. These representations occurred predominately during periods of immobility but outside of hippocampal sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events. This paradigm enables future direct studies of memory retrieval mechanisms in the healthy brain and in models of neurological disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

While the effects of GLP-1RAs have been extensively studied in the context of diet-induced obesity, their impact on physiology in other nutritional contexts have been less explored. We investigated the potential beneficial effects of the GLP-1RA semaglutide during juvenile protein malnutrition, a dietary challenge known to cause stunted growth and to disrupt metabolic homeostasis. Methods: We used a murine model to assess the effects of twice-weekly subcutaneous injections of semaglutide during juvenile protein malnutrition. Glucose metabolism was evaluated through in vivo oral glucose tolerance test, ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated pancreatic islets and histology of the pancreas. We combined linear growth monitoring, analysis of the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling pathway and liver bulk RNA sequencing to characterize the effects of semaglutide on the somatotropic axis during juvenile protein malnutrition. Results: Semaglutide improved glucose tolerance in control and malnourished mice, but differentially impacted pancreatic islet physiology depending on the dietary protein intake. While semaglutide did not alter growth in control conditions, it further inhibited growth of malnourished mice associated with reduction in fat but not lean mass. Surprisingly, semaglutide had no discernible effect on the functionality of the somatotropic axis in malnourished mice. Liver transcriptomics revealed that semaglutide may interfere with the growth of malnourished juvenile mice by altering circadian rhythm and thermogenesis. Conclusions: Our data reveal that semaglutide interacts differentially with the physiology of juvenile mice depending on their dietary protein intake.

Previously we showed that genetic deletion of Flrt1/3 adhesion molecules causes folding of the smooth mouse cortex into sulci resulting from increased lateral dispersion and faster neuron migration, without progenitor expansion. Here, we find that combining the Flrt1/3 double knockout with an additional genetic deletion that causes progenitor expansion, greatly enhances cortex folding. Expansion of intermediate progenitors by deletion of Cep83 results in enhanced formation of sulci. Expansion of apical progenitors by deletion of Fgf10 results in enhanced formation of gyri. Single cell transcriptomics and simulations suggest that changes in adhesive properties of cortical neurons, their proportions and densities in the cortical plate, combined with lateral dispersion during their radial migration are important folding parameters. These results identify key developmental mechanisms that cooperate to promote cortical gyrification.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Recent studies have shown that shifts in the diapause stage precede social evolution in wasps and bees, however, the genomic basis remains unknown. Given the overlap in molecular pathways that regulate diapause and lifespan, we hypothesized that the evolutionary loss of developmental diapause may lead to extended lifespan among adults, which is a prerequisite for the evolution of eusociality. To test this, we compared 27 bee genomes with or without prepupal diapause. Our results point to several potential mechanisms for lifespan extension in species lacking prepupal diapause, including the loss of the growth hormone PTTH and its receptor TORSO, along with a significant overlap between genes for which selection is intensified and those with a known role in aging. Specifically, we observed purifying selection of pro-longevity genes and relaxed selection of anti-longevity genes within the IIS/TOR pathway in species that have lost prepupal diapause. Changes in selection pressures on this pathway may lead to the evolution of new phenotypes, such as lifespan extension and altered responses to nutritional signals, that are crucial for social evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

By studying a wide range of generative models in simulations, and by re-analyzing 25 well-studied quantitative phenotypes from 349,468 individuals in the UK Biobank and up to 159,095 individuals in BioBank Japan, we show that the inclusion of a cis-interaction score (i.e., interactions between a focal variant and proximal variants) recovers genetic variance that is not captured by LDSC.

In addition to the major toxin A and toxin B virulence factors, RT027 strains also encode the CDT binary toxin. Our lab previously identified a toxigenic RT027 isolate, ST1-75, that is avirulent in mice despite densely colonizing the colon. Here, we show that co-infecting mice with the avirulent ST1-75 and virulent R20291 strains protects mice from colitis due to rapid clearance of the virulent strain and persistence of the avirulent strain. Although avirulence of ST1-75 is due to a mutation in the cdtR gene, which encodes a response regulator that modulates the production of all three C. difficile toxins, the ability of ST1-75 to protect against acute colitis is not directly attributable to the cdtR mutation. Metabolomic analyses indicate that the ST1-75 strain depletes amino acids more rapidly than the R20291 strain and supplementation with amino acids ablates ST1-75 s competitive advantage, suggesting that the ST1-75 strain limits the growth of virulent R20291 bacteria by amino acid depletion. Since the germination kinetics and sensitivity to the co-germinant glycine are similar for the ST1-75 and R20291 strains, our results identify the rapidity of in vivo nutrient depletion as a mechanism providing strain-specific, virulence-independent competitive advantages to different BI/NAP1/027 strains. They also suggest that the ST1-75 strain may, as a biotherapeutic agent, enhance resistance to CDI in high-risk patients.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

These neuromodulators each regulate the other, and disturbances to their coordinated signals contribute to human disorders ranging from Parkinson's Disease to depression and addiction. Pauses in the firing of cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are thought to coincide with pulses in dopamine release that encode reward prediction errors (RPEs), together shaping synaptic plasticity and thereby learning. However, such models are based upon recordings from unidentified neurons, and do not incorporate the distinct characteristics of striatal subregions. Here we compare the firing of identified, individual CINs to dopamine release as unrestrained rats performed a probabilistic decision-making task. The relationships between CIN spiking, dopamine release, and behavior varied strongly by subregion. In dorsal-lateral striatum a Go! cue evoked burst-pause CIN spiking, quickly followed by a very brief (~150ms) dopamine pulse that was unrelated to RPE. In dorsal-medial striatum the same cue evoked only a CIN pause; this pause was curtailed by a movement-selective rebound in firing. Finally in ventral striatum a reward cue evoked slower, RPE-coding increases in both dopamine and CIN firing, without any distinct pause. Our results demonstrate a spatial and temporal dissociation between CIN pauses and dopamine RPE signals, and will inform new models of striatal microcircuits and their contributions to behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Hemin, released during hemolysis in SCD, induces platelet activation through CLEC-2, endothelial activation through TLR4, neutrophil adhesion and NETosis, all of which are regulated by spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). In this study, we assessed neutrophil and platelet recruitment to the pulmonary, renal, splenic, and hepatic microvasculature in control and SCD mice following hemin injection and the effect of Syk inhibition on cell recruitment and organ perfusion. Compared to controls, SCD mice exhibited higher baseline neutrophil and platelet recruitment to the lungs without alterations in lung perfusion as measured by laser speckle contrast imaging. Injection of hemin increased cell recruitment to the pulmonary and renal vasculature with a concomitant reduction in organ perfusion. However, hemin injection did not change cell recruitment or organ perfusion in the spleen and liver, both of which were altered at baseline in SCD mice. Pretreatment of SCD mice with the Syk inhibitor BI-1002494 mitigated baseline and hemin-induced neutrophil and platelet adhesion in the pulmonary and renal microvasculature, with a corresponding normalization of perfusion. Syk regulates vascular integrity in the lung of SCD mice; whilst high concentrations of BI-1002494 increased bleeding, lowering drug concentrations preserved the inhibitory effect on platelet and neutrophil recruitment and lung perfusion and protected from bleeding complications. These data substantiate Syk as a mediator of vascular thrombo-inflammation and hypoperfusion in the lung and kidney of SCD and provide a rationale for pharmacological inhibition as a therapeutic strategy.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

The accident occurred at Chornobyl nuclear power plant (Ukraine, April 1986) contaminated a large extension of territory after the deposition of radioactive material. Beyond the immediate negative impact caused by the accident, it is still under debate whether the chronic exposure to the radiation levels currently present in the area signifies a serious threat for organisms. One hypothesis suggests that current levels of radiation may cause unobservable damage in the short-term, but have long-term effects such as decreases in longevity. Here, we investigate through a field-based approach, whether current levels of radiation in Chornobyl negatively impact the age of a semi-aquatic vertebrate, the Eastern tree frog Hyla orientalis. We also explore whether radiation induces changes in an ageing marker, telomere length, or in the stress hormone corticosterone. We found no effect of total individual absorbed radiation (including both external and internal exposure) on frog age (n = 197 individuals sampled in three consecutive years). We also did not find any relationship between individual absorbed radiation and telomere length, but a negative relationship between individual absorbed radiation and corticosterone levels. Our results suggest that radiation levels currently experienced by tree frogs in Chornobyl may not be high enough to cause severe chronic damage to semi-aquatic vertebrates such as this species. This is the first study addressing age and stress hormones in Chornobyl wildlife, and thus future research will confirm if these results can be extended to other taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

In addition, WHIRLY1 has a second localization in the nucleus making it an excellent candidate for chloroplast-to-nucleus communication. To unravel the role of WHIRLY1 for structure and protein composition of nucleoids and its potential involvement in retrograde signaling during chloroplast development, knockout mutants of HvWHIRLY1 were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using Cas9 endonuclease. In contrast to mutants of rice and maize, which die after the seedling stage, the barley why1 mutants survive and produce grains. Leaves of the mutants are initially pale and get green with time (xantha-to-green phenotype). However, the chlorophyll content of primary leaves stayed distinctly lower than that of the wild-type leaves, coinciding with a rather heterogeneous plastid population, whereby only 50% developed a rather normal thylakoid membrane system. For comparison, mature foliage leaves had almost normal levels of chlorophyll but a severely reduced photosynthetic capacity.

A proteome analysis of chloroplasts isolated from mature foliage leaves revealed that in the absence of WHIRLY1, the abundances of a considerable fraction of proteins were downregulated. The fraction included multiple nucleoid-associated proteins including components of the transcriptional apparatus. Furthermore, ribosomal proteins, subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase, CLP protease, ATP synthase, Rubisco and chaperons/chaperonins were found to be downregulated.

In conclusion, the characterization of the barley why1 mutant plants revealed that WHIRLY1 is not essential for chloroplast development. Rather, it ensures a fast and failure-free progression of chloroplast development by remodeling nucleoids, which serve as assembly platforms for a concerted workflow of the numerous processes required for chloroplast development. Gene expression analyses revealed that the disturbance of chloroplast development is signaled to the nucleus, indicating that WHIRLY1 is not part of the biogenic retrograde signaling of plastids.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Key findings demonstrate that CBP/p300 expression increases with disease progression and selects for poor prognosis in metastatic disease. CBP/p300 bromodomain inhibition enhances response to standard of care therapeutics. Functional studies, CBP/p300 cistrome mapping, and transcriptome in CRPC revealed that CBP/p300 regulates DDR.

Similarly, CBP/p300 expression in human prostate tissue correlates with HR factors. Lastly, targeting CBP/p300 impacts HR-mediate repair and patient outcome.

During this time, we collected and genome sequenced 341 non-invasive throat and skin S. pyogenes isolates identified during routine clinical diagnostic testing in Sheffield, a large UK city. We compared the data with that obtained from a similar collection of 165 isolates from 2016-17.

Numbers of throat-associated isolates collected peaked in early December 2022, reflecting the national scarlet fever upsurge, while skin infections peaked later in December. The most common emm-types in 2022-23 were emm1 (28.7%), emm12 (24.9%), and emm22 (7.7%) in throat; and emm1 (22%), emm12 (10%), emm76 (18%), and emm49 (7%) in skin. Whilst all emm1 isolates were the M1UK lineage, comparison with 2016-17 revealed diverse lineages in other emm-types, including emm12, and emergent lineages within other types including a new acapsular emm75 lineage, demonstrating that the upsurge was not completely driven by a single genotype. Analysis of the capsule locus predicted only 51% of throat isolates would produce capsule compared to 78% of skin isolates. 90% of throat isolates were also predicted to have high NADase and Streptolysin O (SLO) expression, based on the promoter sequence, compared to only 56% of skin isolates.

Our study has highlighted the value in analysis of non-invasive isolates to characterise tissue tropisms, as well as changing strain diversity and emerging genomic features which may have implications for spillover into invasive disease and future S. pyogenes upsurges.

Data summaryAll new genome sequence data is available on the NCBI short read archive under the bioproject PRJNA1062601 and individual accession numbers are listed in Supplementary Table 1 and Table 2.

Impact statementThe human bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A Streptococcus or StrepA, caused a dramatic and sudden upsurge in scarlet fever in the UK at the end of 2022 into early 2023. We present molecular characterisation of this upsurge, through genome sequence analysis of throat, skin and other types of non-severe infection isolates collected by the microbiology diagnostic lab at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, England. We found that, whilst two strain types were the predominant cause of infections during the upsurge, other types had emerged or changed when compared to a similar collection from 2016-17. We also identified differences between throat-associated isolates and skin-associated isolates and highlighted important bacterial factors that might influence infection types. Isolates from non-severe throat/skin types of infections are rarely saved and therefore our knowledge of them is limited. However, here we demonstrate that study of such isolates may be key to understanding upsurges of more severe infections.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

The Omicron XBB* recombinant lineages are a noteworthy example, as they have been the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant worldwide in the first half of 2023. Since November 2023, a new recombinant lineage between Omicron subvariants XBB and BA.2.86, designated XDR, has been detected mainly in Brazil. In this study, we reconstructed the spatiotemporal dynamics and estimated the absolute and relative transmissibility of the XDR lineage. The XDR lineage displayed a recombination breakpoint in the ORF1a coding region, and the most closely related sequences to the 5 and 3 ends of the recombinant correspond to JD.1.1 and JN.1.1 lineages, respectively. The first XDR sequences were detected in November 2023 in the Northeastern Brazilian region, and their prevalence rapidly surged from <1% to 25% by February 2024. The Bayesian phylogeographic analysis supports that the XDR lineage likely emerged in the Northeastern Brazilian region around late October 2023 and rapidly disseminated within and outside Brazilian borders from mid-November onwards. The median effective reproductive number of the XDR lineage in Brazil during the initial expansion phase was estimated to be around 1.5. In contrast, the average relative instantaneous reproduction numbers of XDR and JN* lineages were estimated to be 1.37 and 1.29 higher than that of co-circulating XBB* lineages. In summary, these findings support that the recombinant lineage XDR arose in the Northeastern Brazilian region in October 2023, shortly after the first detection of JN.1 sequences in the country. In Brazil, the XDR lineage exhibited a higher transmissibility level than its parental XBB.* lineages and is spreading at a rate similar to or slightly faster than the JN.1* lineages.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196830

However, the transcriptional and signalling pathways regulating this process are still not fully established, and only a small number of enhancers for key arterial genes have been characterized. Here, we sought to generate a useful and accessible cohort of arterial enhancers with which to study arterial transcriptional regulation. We combined in silico analysis with transgenic zebrafish and mouse models to find and validate enhancers associated with eight key arterial identity genes (Acvrl1/Alk1, Cxcr4, Cxcl12, Efnb2, Gja4/Cx37, Gja5/Cx40, Nrp1 and Unc5b). This identified a cohort of enhancers able to independently direct robust transcription to arterial ECs within the vasculature. To elucidate the regulatory pathways upstream of arterial gene transcription, we determined the occurrence of common endothelial transcription factor binding motifs, and assessed direct binding of these factors across all arterial enhancers compared to similar assessments of non-arterial-specific enhancers. These results find that binding of SOXF and ETS factors is a shared event across arterial enhancers, but also commonly occurs at pan-endothelial enhancers. Conversely, RBPJ/Notch, MEF2 and FOX binding was over-represented but not ubiquitous at arterial enhancers. We found no shared or arterial-specific signature for canonical WNT-associated TCF/LEF transcription factors, canonical TGF{beta}/BMP-associated SMAD1/5 and SMAD2, laminar shear stress-associated KLF factors or venous-enriched NR2F2 factors. This cohort of well characterized and in vivo-verified enhancers can now provide a platform for future studies into the interaction of different transcriptional and signalling pathways with arterial gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

However, which lymphocyte populations are critical in AS pathogenesis is not known. In this study, we aimed to identify the key cell types mediating the genetic risk in AS using an unbiased integrative functional genomics approach.

MethodsWe integrated GWAS data with epigenomic and transcriptomic datasets of immune cells in healthy humans. To quantify enrichment of cell type-specific open chromatin regions or gene expression in AS risk loci, we used three published methods which have identified cell types for other diseases. Additionally, we performed co-localization analyses between GWAS risk loci and genetic variants associated with gene expression (eQTL) to find putative target genes of AS risk variants.

ResultsNatural killer (NK) cell-specific open chromatin regions are significantly enriched in heritability for AS, compared to other immune cell types such as T cells, B cells, and monocytes. This finding was consistent between two AS GWAS. Using RNA-seq data, we validated that genes in AS risk loci are enriched in NK cell-specific gene expression. Expression levels of AS-associated genes, such as RUNX3, TBX21, TNFRSF1A, and NPEPPS, were found to be highest in NK cells compared to five T cell subsets. Using the human Space-Time Gut Cell Atlas we found significant upregulation of AS-associated genes predominantly in NK cells. Co-localization analysis revealed four AS risk loci affecting regulation of candidate target genes in NK cells: two known loci, ERAP1 and TNFRSF1A, and two under-studied loci, ENTR1 (aka SDCCAG3) and B3GNT2.

ConclusionOur results point to NK cells as potential key drivers in the development of AS and highlight four putative target genes for functional follow-up in NK cells.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196830

However, factors like the phylogeny or epidemiology of host bacteria are often disregarded, despite their potential influence on phage specialization and virulence. This research utilizes a new ""phylogenetic host range index"" that accounts for the genetic diversity of bacterial hosts, to classify phages into specialists and generalists accurately. We provide evidence that the CRISPR-Cas immune system of bacteria more frequently targets generalist phages than specialist phages. We explore the hypothesis that generalist phages might exhibit lower virulence than specialist ones due to potential evolutionary trade-offs between host range breadth and virulence. Importantly, contrasted correlations between phage virulence and host range depend on the epidemiological context. A trade-off was confirmed in a homogeneous bacterial epidemiology situation, but not in more complex epidemiological scenario, where no apparent costs were detected for phages adapted to a wide range of hosts. This study highlights the need for genetic analyses in phage host range and of investigating ecological trade-offs that could improve their applications in biocontrol or therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

The tight regulation of gene expression during skeletal development is essential, with [~]1/500 individuals born with skeletal abnormalities. Furthermore, increasing evidence is emerging to link age-associated complex genetic musculoskeletal diseases, including osteoarthritis (OA), to developmental factors including joint shape. Multiple studies have shown a functional role for DNA methylation in the genetic mechanisms of OA risk using articular cartilage samples taken from aged patients. Despite this, our knowledge of temporal changes to the methylome during human cartilage development has been limited.

We quantified DNA methylation at [~]700,000 individual CpGs across the epigenome of developing human articular cartilage in 72 samples ranging from 7-21 post-conception weeks, a time period that includes cavitation of the developing knee joint. We identified significant changes in 8% of all CpGs, and >9400 developmental differentially methylated regions (dDMRs). The largest hypermethylated dDMRs mapped to transcriptional regulators of early skeletal patterning including MEIS1 and IRX1. Conversely, the largest hypomethylated dDMRs mapped to genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins including SPON2 and TNXB and were enriched in chondrocyte enhancers. Significant correlations were identified between the expression of these genes and methylation within the hypomethylated dDMRs. We further identified 811 CpGs at which significant dimorphism was present between the male and female samples, with the majority (68%) being hypermethylated in female samples.

Following imputation, we captured the genotype of these samples at >5 million variants and performed epigenome-wide methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) analysis. Colocalization analysis identified 26 loci at which genetic variants exhibited shared impacts upon methylation and OA genetic risk. This included loci which have been previously reported to harbour OA-mQTLs (including GDF5 and ALDH1A2), yet the majority (73%) were novel (including those mapping to CHST3, FGF1 and TEAD1).

To our knowledge, this is the first extensive study of DNA methylation across human articular cartilage development. We identify considerable methylomic plasticity within the development of knee cartilage and report active epigenomic mediators of OA risk operating in prenatal joint tissues.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196830

Identifying the relationships between genetic variation and gene expression is critical for understanding the mechanisms of genome regulation. However, the genetic control of gene expression variability among the cells within individuals has yet to be extensively examined. This is primarily due to the statistical challenges, such as the need for sufficiently powered cohorts and adjusting mean-variance dependence. Here, we introduce MEOTIVE (Mapping genetic Effects On inTra-Individual Variability of gene Expression), a novel statistical framework to identify genetic effects on the gene expression variability (sc-veQTL) accounting for the mean-variance dependence. Using single-cell RNA-seq data of 1.2 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 980 human donors, we identified 14 - 3,488 genes with significant sc-veQTLs (study-wide q-value < 0.05) across different blood cell types, 2,103 of which were shared across more than one cell type. We further detected 55 SNP-gene pairs (in 34 unique genes) by directly linking genetic variations with gene expression dispersion (sc-deQTL) regardless of mean-variance dependence, and these genes were enriched in biological processes relevant to immune response and viral infection. An example is rs1131017 (p<9.08x10-52), a sc-veQTL in the 5UTR of RPS26, which shows a ubiquitous dispersion effect across cell types, with higher dispersion levels associated with lower auto-immune disease risk, including rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. Another example is LYZ, which is associated with antibacterial activity against bacterial species and was only detected with a monocyte-specific deQTL (rs1384) located at the 3 UTR region (p=1.48x10-11) and replicated in an independent cohort. Our results demonstrate an efficient and robust statistical method to identify genetic effects on gene expression variability and how these associations and their involved pathways confer auto-immune disease risk. This analytical framework provides a new approach to unravelling the genetic regulation of gene expression at the single-cell resolution, advancing our understanding of complex biological processes.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

RESULTS: T and B cells were altered in brain-associated and systemic immune tissues between genetic models and wildtype mice, with earlier signs if inflammation in female mice. Systemic immune responses were modulated by the microbiome and differed by sex. Further, the absence of a microbiome in germ-free mice resulted in reduced cognitive deficits, primarily in female mice. DISCUSSION: These data reveal sexual dimorphism in early signs of inflammation and the effects of the microbiome, and highlight a previously unrecognized interaction between sex and the microbiome in mouse models of AD.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Although the vasculature has been recognized as a main player in this disease, the recently found capillary heterogeneity and cellular dynamics of endothelial subpopulations in BPD remain unclear. Here, we show Cap2 cells are damaged during neonatal hyperoxic injury, leading to their replacement by Cap1 cells which, in turn, significantly decline. Single-cell RNA-seq identifies the activation of numerous p53 target genes in endothelial cells, including Cdkn1a (p21). While global deletion of p53 results in worsened vasculature, endothelial-specific deletion of p53 reverses the vascular phenotype and improves alveolar simplification during hyperoxia. This recovery is associated with the emergence of a transitional EC state, enriched for oxidative stress response genes and growth factors.

In the visual cortex, studies using simple grating stimuli indicate that congruent stimuli - where the center and surround share the same orientation - are more inhibitory than when orientations are orthogonal, potentially serving redundancy reduction and predictive coding. Understanding these center-surround interactions in relation to natural image statistics is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the stimulus space, yet crucial for deciphering the neuronal code of real-world sensory processing. Utilizing large-scale recordings from mouse V1, we trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict and synthesize surround patterns that either optimally suppressed or enhanced responses to center stimuli, confirmed by in vivo experiments. Contrary to the notion that congruent stimuli are suppressive, we found that surrounds that completed patterns based on natural image statistics were facilitatory, while disruptive surrounds were suppressive. Applying our CNN image synthesis method in macaque V1, we discovered that pattern completion within the near surround occurred more frequently with excitatory than with inhibitory surrounds, suggesting that our results in mice are conserved in macaques. Further, experiments and model analyses confirmed previous studies reporting the opposite effect with grating stimuli in both species. Using the MICrONS functional connectomics dataset, we observed that neurons with similar feature selectivity formed excitatory connections regardless of their receptive field overlap, aligning with the pattern completion phenomenon observed for excitatory surrounds. Finally, our empirical results emerged in a normative model of perception implementing Bayesian inference, where neuronal responses are modulated by prior knowledge of natural scene statistics. In summary, our findings identify a novel relationship between contextual information and natural scene statistics and provide evidence for a role of contextual modulation in hierarchical inference","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Human FPN is subjected to multi-level regulation at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels. How plant FPNs are regulated remains to be explored. In the current study, we have characterized wheat FPN1, a plasma-membrane localized protein, for its role in Fe homeostasis. A spatial-temporal expression analysis of wheat FPN1 suggested that its tissue-specific expression is differentially upregulated during Fe deficiency conditions. Unlike human FPN, plant FPN lacks the necessary sites for hepcidin binding, thereby emphasizing the need to explore the transcriptional/post-transcriptional mode of regulation. The lack of Iron Responsive Elements (IRE) in TaFPN1 promoter suggests no direct regulation through the Iron Regulatory Protein (IRP) mechanism like in humans. Further, to explore the miRNA-mediated regulation, we identified Fe-regulated tae-miR1130b-3p capable of targeting TaFPN1 under in-vivo conditions. Transcript expression of tae-miR1130b-3p negatively correlates with the TaFPN1. This alternative regulation pathway suggests a complex network of interactions governing the expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis, highlighting the intricacies of cellular regulatory mechanisms.

Consequently, to maintain genome stability, aneuploidy must inhibit hPSC proliferation, but the mechanisms are unknown. Here, we surprisingly find that homogeneous aneuploid populations of hPSCs proliferate unlike aneuploid non-transformed somatic cells. Instead, in mosaic populations, cell non-autonomous competition between neighboring diploid and aneuploid hPSCs eliminates less fit aneuploid cells. Aneuploid hPSCs with lower Myc or higher p53 levels relative to diploid neighbors are outcompeted but conversely gain a selective advantage when Myc and p53 relative abundance switches. Thus, although hPSCs frequently missegregate chromosomes and inherently tolerate aneuploidy, Myc- and p53-driven cell competition preserves their genome integrity. These findings have important implications for the use of hPSCs in regenerative medicine and for how diploid human embryos are established despite the prevalence of aneuploidy during early development.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

We now report a previously unknown role for microglia in regulating neuroplasticity within spinal phrenic motor neurons, the neurons driving diaphragm contractions and breathing. We demonstrate that microglia regulate phrenic long-term facilitation (pLTF), a form of respiratory memory lasting hours after repetitive exposures to brief periods of low oxygen (acute intermittent hypoxia; AIH) via neuronal/microglial fractalkine signaling. AIH-induced pLTF is regulated by the balance between competing intracellular signaling cascades initiated by serotonin vs adenosine, respectively. Although brainstem raphe neurons release the relevant serotonin, the cellular source of adenosine is unknown. We tested a model in which hypoxia initiates fractalkine signaling between phrenic motor neurons and nearby microglia that triggers extracellular adenosine accumulation. With moderate AIH, phrenic motor neuron adenosine 2A receptor activation undermines serotonin-dominant pLTF; in contrast, severe AIH drives pLTF by a unique, adenosine-dominant mechanism. Phrenic motor neuron fractalkine knockdown, cervical spinal fractalkine receptor inhibition on nearby microglia, and microglial depletion enhance serotonin-dominant pLTF with moderate AIH but suppress adenosine-dominant pLTF with severe AIH.

Our analysis identified 157 types of diverse functional domains in 287 effectors, including 159 effectors with no prior functional annotations. Furthermore, we identified 35 unique domains in 30 effector models that have no similarity with experimentally structurally characterized proteins, thus, hinting at novel functionalities. Using this analysis, we demonstrate the activity of thirteen domains, including three unique folds, predicted in L. pneumophila effectors to cause growth defects in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae model system.

How learners adapt to changing environments is a central issue in both reinforcement learning theory and psychology. For example, learners may adapt to changes in volatility by increasing learning if volatility increases, and reducing it if volatility decreases. Computational neuroscience and neural network modeling work suggests that this adaptive capacity may result from a meta-reinforcement learning process (implemented for example in the prefrontal cortex), where past experience endows the system with the capacity to rapidly adapt to environmental conditions in new situations. Here we provide direct evidence for a meta-reinforcement learning account of adaptation to environmental volatility. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were trained on a restless four-armed bandit reinforcement learning problem under three different training regimes (low volatility training only, medium volatility training only, or meta-volatility training across a range of volatilities). We show that, in contrast to RNNs trained in the low volatility regime, RNNs trained under the medium or meta-volatility regimes exhibited a superior adaption to environmental volatility. This was reflected in a better performance, and computational modeling of the networks behavior revealed a more adaptive adjustment of learning and exploration to varying levels of volatility during test. Results extend the meta-RL account to volatility adaptation and confirm past experience as a crucial factor of adaptive decision-making.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Building upon a finding that exposure to male pheromone ascr#10 improves oocyte quality in C. elegans, we uncovered a regulatory cascade that promotes proliferation of oocyte precursors in adults and regulates oocyte quality. We found that the male pheromone promotes proliferation of oocyte precursors by upregulating LAG-2, a ligand of the Notch-like pathway in the germline stem cell niche. LAG-2 is upregulated by a TGF{beta}-like ligand DAF-7 revealing similarity of regulatory mechanisms that promote germline proliferation in adults and larvae. A serotonin circuit that also regulates food search and consumption upregulates DAF-7 specifically in adults. The serotonin/DAF-7 signaling promotes germline expansion to compensate for oocyte expenditure which is increased by the male pheromone. Finally, we show that the earliest events in reproductive aging may be due to declining expression of LAG-2 and DAF-7. Our findings highlight neuronal signals that promote germline proliferation in response to the environment and argue that deteriorating oocyte quality may be due to reduced neuronal expression of key germline regulators.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

In type III CRISPR-Cas systems, the Cas10 subunit of the activated recognition complex synthesizes cyclic oligoadenylates (cOAs), second messengers that activate downstream ancillary effector proteins. Once the viral attack has been weathered, elimination of extant cOA is essential to limit the antiviral response and to allow cellular recovery. Various families of ring nucleases have been identified, specializing in the degradation of cOAs either as standalone enzymes or as domains of effector proteins. Here we describe the ring nuclease activity inherent in the SAVED domain of the cA4 -activated CRISPR Lon protease CalpL. We characterize the kinetics of cA 4 cleavage and identify key catalytic residues. We demonstrate that cA4 -incuced oligomerization of CalpL is essential not only for activation of the protease, but is also required for nuclease activity. Further, the nuclease activity of CalpL poses a limitation to the protease reaction, indicating a mechanism for regulation of the CalpL/T/S signaling cascade. This work is the first demonstration of a catalytic SAVED domain and gives new insights into the dynamics of transcriptional adaption in CRISPR defense systems which are not aimed at abortive infection but rather at a reversible adaption to phage attack.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Despite evidence that different cortico-subcortical projections play distinct roles in behavior, few studies have examined the physiological effects of chronic ethanol at the circuit level. The rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) is a GABAergic midbrain region involved in aversive signaling and is functionally altered by chronic ethanol exposure. Our recent work identified a dense input from the mPFC to the RMTg, yet the effects of chronic ethanol exposure on this circuitry is unknown. In the current study, we examined physiological changes after chronic ethanol exposure in prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) mPFC neurons projecting to the RMTg. Adult male Long-Evans rats were injected with fluorescent retrobeads into the RMTg and rendered dependent using a 14-day chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure paradigm. Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings were performed in fluorescently-labeled (RMTg-projecting) and -unlabeled (projection-undefined) layer 5 pyramidal neurons 7-10 days following ethanol exposure. CIE significantly increased intrinsic excitability as well as excitatory and inhibitory synaptic drive in RMTg-projecting IL neurons. In contrast, no lasting changes in excitability were observed in RMTg-projecting PL neurons, although a CIE-induced reduction in excitability was observed in projection-undefined PL neurons. CIE also increased excitatory synaptic drive in RMTg-projecting PL neurons. These data uncover novel subregion- and circuit-specific neuroadaptations in the mPFC following chronic ethanol exposure and reveal that the IL mPFC-RMTg projection is uniquely vulnerable to long-lasting effects of chronic ethanol.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Such imaging can identify cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals who will subsequently develop cognitive impartment (CI). Plasma biomarkers would be more practical than PET or even cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays in clinical settings. Objective: Assess the prognostic accuracy of plasma p-tau217 in comparison to CSF and PET biomarkers for predicting the clinical progression from CU to CI. Design: In a cohort of elderly at high risk of developing Alzheimer''s dementia (AD), we measured the proportion of CU individuals who developed CI, as predicted by A{beta} (A+) and/or tau (T+) biomarker assessment from plasma, CSF, and PET. Results from each method were compared with (A-T-) reference individuals. Data were analyzed from June 2023 to April 2024. Setting: Longitudinal observational cohort. Participants: Some 228 participants from the PREVENT-AD cohort were CU at the time of biomarker assessment and had 1 - 10 years of follow-up. Plasma was available from 215 participants, CSF from 159, and amyloid- and tau-PET from 155. Ninety-three participants had assessment using all three methods (main group of interest). Progression to CI was determined by clinical consensus among physicians and neuropsychologists who were blind to plasma, CSF, PET, and MRI findings, as well as APOE genotype. Exposures: Plasma A{beta}42/40 was measured using IP-MS; CSF {beta}42/40 using Lumipulse; plasma and CSF p-tau217 using UGOT assay. A{beta}-PET employed the 18F-NAV4694 ligand, and tau-PET used 18F-flortaucipir. Main Outcome: Prognostic accuracy of plasma, CSF, and PET biomarkers for predicting the development of CI in CU individuals. Results: Cox proportional hazard models indicated a greater progression rate in all A+T+ groups compared to A-T- groups (HR = 6.61 [95% CI = 2.06 - 21.17] for plasma, 3.62 [ 1.49 - 8.81] for CSF and 9.24 [ 2.34 - 36.43] for PET). The A-T+ groups were small, but also characterized with individuals who developed CI. Plasma biomarkers identified about five times more T+ than PET. Conclusion and relevance: Plasma p-tau217 assessment is a practical method for identification of persons who will develop cognitive impairment up to 10 years later.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196830

However, current methods have technical limitations that hinder them from making systematic, scalable, interpretable disease-cell-type associations. In order to rapidly and accurately pinpoint associations, we develop a novel framework, seismic, which characterizes cell types using a new specificity score. We compare seismic with alternative methods across over 1,000 cell type characterizations at different granularities and 28 traits, demonstrating that seismic both corroborates findings and identifies trait-relevant cell groups which are not apparent through other methodologies. Furthermore, as part of the seismic framework, the specific genes driving cell type-trait associations can easily be accessed and analyzed, enabling further biological insights. The advantages of seismic are particularly salient in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinsons and Alzheimers, where disease pathology has not only cell-specific manifestations, but also brain region-specific differences. Interestingly, a case study of Alzheimers disease reveals the importance of considering GWAS endpoints, as studies relying on clinical diagnoses consistently identify microglial associations, while GWAS with a tau biomarker endpoint reveals neuronal associations. In general, seismic is a computationally efficient, powerful, and interpretable approach for identifying associations between complex traits and cell type-specific expression.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Our results also revealed multiple structure-activity relationship trends that can be used to design and optimize future optical imaging probes.

We show that starvation of juvenile males disrupts serotonin dependent activation of the CREB transcription factor in a nociceptive sensory neuron, PHB. CREB acts through a cascade of transcription factors to control expression of an atypical cadherin protein, FMI-1/Flamingo. During postembryonic development, FMI-1/Flamingo has the capacity to promote and maintain synaptic connectivity of the PHB nociceptive sensory to a command interneuron, AVA, in both sexes, but the serotonin transcriptional regulatory cassette antagonizes FMI-1/Flamingo expression in males, thereby establishing sexually dimorphic connectivity between PHB and AVA. A critical regulatory node in this process is the CREB-target LIN-29, a Zn finger transcription factor which integrates four different layers of information: sexual specificity, past feeding status, time and cell-type specificity. Our findings provide the mechanistic details of how an early juvenile experience defines sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

We evaluated the functionality of nAChRs at a central synapse and explored the impact of perinatal nicotine exposure (PNE) on synaptic currents and auditory brainstem responses (ABR) in mice. Our findings revealed developmentally regulated changes in nAChR expression in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) neurons and presynaptic Calyx of Held terminals.

Our analysis uncovers a significant limitation of the AFM-derived interface pTM (ipTM) metric, which, while reflective of structural integrity, can miss physiologically relevant interactions at small interfaces or within flexible regions.

As the small-molecule Mavacamten is known to promote the myosin super-relaxed state and reduce the ATP demand, here, we tested its potency in the context of NEB-NM. We first conducted in vitro experiments in isolated single myofibres from patients and found that Mavacamten successfully reversed the myosin ATP over-consumption.

Major differences were found, with over 70,000 A-to-I sites showing higher editing levels in postmortem tissues. Increased A-to-I editing in postmortem tissues is linked to higher ADAR1 and ADARB1 expression, is more pronounced in non-neuronal cells, and indicative of postmortem activation of inflammation and hypoxia. Higher A-to-I editing in living tissues marks sites that are evolutionarily preserved, synaptic, developmentally timed, and disrupted in neurological conditions.

In co-culture studies, pre-treatment of {beta} cells with a TYK2i prevented IFN-induced activation of T cells targeting an epitope of insulin. In vivo administration of BMS-986202 in two mouse models of T1D (RIP-LCMV-GP mice and NOD mice) reduced systemic and tissue-localized inflammation, prevented {beta} cell death, and delayed T1D onset. Transcriptional phenotyping of pancreatic islets, pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN), and spleen during early disease pathogenesis highlighted a role for TYK2 inhibition in modulating signaling pathways associated with inflammation, translational control, stress signaling, secretory function, immunity, and diabetes. Additionally, TYK2i treatment changed the composition of innate and adaptive immune cell populations in the blood and disease target tissues, resulting in an immune phenotype with a diminished capacity for {beta} cell destruction. Overall, these findings indicate that TYK2i has beneficial effects in both the immune and endocrine compartments in models of T1D, thus supporting a path forward for testing TYK2 inhibitors in human T1D.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Given their widespread influence, dysfunction in mast cells can contribute to a variety of pathologies including allergies, long COVID, and autoimmune and neuroinflammatory disorders. Despite this, the specific transcriptional mechanisms that control mast cell mediator release remain poorly understood, significantly hindering the development of effective therapeutic strategies. We found that the two proteins encoded by the transcription factor FosB, FOSB and the highly stable variant {Delta}FOSB, are robustly expressed upon stimulation in both murine and human mast cell progenitors. Motivated by these findings, we generated a novel mouse model with targeted ablation of FosB gene expression specifically in mast cells (MCFosB-) by crossing a mast cell-specific Cre reporter line (Mcpt5-Cre) with a Cre-dependent floxed FosB mouse lines. We found that mast cell progenitors derived from MCFosB- mice, compared to wild types (WT), exhibit baseline increased histamine content and vesicle numbers. Additionally, they show enhanced calcium mobilization, degranulation, and histamine release following allergy-related IgE-mediated stimulation, along with heightened IL-6 release in response to infection-like LPS stimulation. In vivo experiments with IgE-mediated and LPS challenges revealed that MCFosB- mice experience greater drops in body temperature, heightened activation of tissue-resident mast cells, and increased release of pro-inflammatory mediators compared to their WT counterparts. These findings suggest that FosB products play a crucial regulatory role in moderating stimulus-induced mast cell activation in response to both IgE and LPS stimuli. Lastly, by integrating CUT&RUN and RNAseq data, we identified several genes targeted by {Delta}FOSB that could mediate these observed effects, including Mir155hg, CLCF1, DUSP4, and Trib1. Together, this study provides the first evidence that FOSB/{Delta}FOSB modulate mast cell functions and provides a new possible target for therapeutic interventions aimed at ameliorating mast cell-related diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

ACE2 expression is altered in pregnancy disorders and ACE2 gene variants (specifically rs2074192 in this study) are associated with several major pregnancy complications. This study utilised gene-editing to generate ACE2 knockout placental organoids and ACE2 rs2074192 placental organoids, creating the first induced SNP gene-edited organoids in human placenta. These organoid models facilitated mechanistic studies into the role of ACE2 in placental organoid development, and the effect of carriage of the ACE2 rs2074192 CT and TT genotypes. Methods: Human placentae (6-7 weeks' gestation) from elective terminations of pregnancy were used to isolate trophoblast stem cells prior to transfection with either an ACE2 whole gene knockout plasmid or ACE2 rs2074192 SNP induction plasmid. This generated trophoblast stem cells for each patient with ACE2+/+, ACE2+/- and ACE-/- (ACE2 knockout, KO) genotypes, and rs2074192 CC, CT and TT genotypes. Gene-edited trophoblast stem cells were then used to generate organoids. We investigated the role of ACE2 in placental development by profiling expression of ACE2 mRNA (qPCR) and protein (Western Blotting), ACE protein (ELISA), and parameters of cell growth (time to confluence and percentage cell death) and organoid growth (diameter and symmetry) in all groups from both models. Results: ACE2 KO placental organoids were successfully generated, verified by significantly reduced ACE2 mRNA expression and nil ACE2 protein detectable in cell lysate or media. Compared to ACE2+/+ and ACE2+/- trophoblast stem cells, ACE2 KO trophoblast stem cells took significantly longer to reach confluence in cell culture and had a higher percentage of cell death. Compared to ACE2+/+ and ACE2+/- placental organoids, ACE2 KO organoids had lower ACE protein expression, reduced organoid diameters and asymmetrical growth. ACE2 rs2074192 CC, CT and TT placental organoids were successfully generated and verified by Sanger sequencing and genotyping. Compared to CC and CT placental organoids, TT organoids had significantly higher expression of ACE2 mRNA and ACE2 protein, both in cell lysate and media. Compared to CC and CT placental organoids, TT organoids had significantly higher ACE2:ACE expression ratios, despite no change in ACE protein expression. TT organoids also had reduced organoid diameters and asymmetrical growth. Conclusion: The absence of ACE2 is detrimental to placental cell organoid growth and symmetry, as evident in the ACE2 KO placental organoids. Despite ACE2 rs2074192 TT placental organoids having increased ACE2 protein expression, their growth and symmetry was also diminished. ACE2:ACE ratio appeared to make more difference to the growth and development of TSCs and placental organoids than the absolute expression values of ACE2 alone. This study will facilitate a deeper understanding of the role of ACE2 in placental development.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are exposed to domoic acid through ingestion of fish that feed on toxic diatoms, resulting in a domoic acid toxicosis (DAT), which can vary from mild to fatal. Sea lions with mild disease can be treated if toxicosis is detected early after exposure, therefore, rapid diagnosis of DAT is essential but also challenging. In this work, we performed multi-omics analyses, specifically proteomic and lipidomic, on blood samples from 31 California sea lions. Fourteen sea lions were diagnosed with DAT based on clinical signs and postmortem histological examination of brain tissue, and 17 had no evidence of DAT. Proteomic analyses revealed three apolipoproteins with statistically significant lower abundance in the DAT individuals compared to the non-DAT individuals. These proteins are known to transport lipids in the blood. Lipidomic analyses highlighted 29 lipid levels that were statistically different in the DAT versus non-DAT comparison, 28 of which were downregulated while only one was upregulated. Furthermore, of the 28 downregulated lipids, 15 were triglycerides, illustrating their connection with the perturbed apolipoproteins and showing their potential for use in rapid DAT diagnoses.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

However, replication of previous findings and identification of novel microRNAs associated with cognitive domains, including their relation to brain structure and the pathways they regulate, are still lacking. METHODS: We examined circulating microRNAs and microRNA co-expression clusters in relation to cognitive domains, structural MRI measures, and target gene expression in 2869 participants of a population-based cohort. RESULTS: Five previously identified and 10 novel microRNAs were associated with cognitive domains. Importantly, seven of these microRNAs were also associated with cortical thickness and two with hippocampal volume. Functional genomics analysis showed that the identified microRNAs regulated genes in pathways like neurogenesis, axon guidance, and synapse assembly. DISCUSSION: We identified microRNAs associated with cognitive domains, brain regions, and neuronal processes affected by aging and neurodegeneration, making them promising candidate blood-based biomarkers or therapeutic targets of subclinical cognitive dysfunction.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196830

Yet the current diagnostic criteria uses a single label of autism and implicitly emphasizes what individuals have in common as core social-communicative and restricted repetitive behavior difficulties. Subtype labels based on the non-core LIMA features may help to more meaningfully distinguish types of autisms with differing developmental paths and differential underlying biology. Using relatively large (n=615) publicly available data from early developing (24-68 months) standardized clinical tests tapping LIMA features, we show that stability-based relative cluster validation analysis can identify two robust and replicable clusters in the autism population with high levels of generalization accuracy (98%). These clusters can be described as Type I versus Type II autisms differentiated by relatively high versus low scores on LIMA features. These two types of autisms are also distinguished by different developmental trajectories over the first decade of life. Finally, these two types of autisms reveal striking differences in functional and structural neuroimaging phenotypes and their relationships with gene expression. This work emphasizes the potential importance of stratifying autism by a Type I versus Type II distinction focused on LIMA features and which may be of high prognostic and biological significance.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196830

Their trophic regulation shapes the soil microbiome, but the underlying population dynamics of bacteria and archaea are poorly understood. Here, we followed bulk soil respiration and time-resolved population dynamics (32 days) of bacterial and archaeal species in response to top-down control by a common bacterivorous soil nematode, Acrobeloides buetschlii, bottom-up control by resource amendment via maize litter as well as the combination of both. Addition of maize litter significantly increased soil respiration rates, while bacterivorous nematodes shifted the maximum rate of soil respiration from day 12 to day 6. Underlying bacterial and archaeal abundance changes could be separated into five major response types, dominating in different top-down and bottom-up control scenarios. Individual microbial species switched between response types depending on the different scenarios. In-depth analysis of these differential abundance patterns revealed a broad feeding behavior for A. buetschlii on dominating populations of gram-negative bacteria (Acidobacteriota, Bacteroidota, Gemmatimonatoda, Pseudomonadota) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (Nitrososphaerota), while discriminating against dominant populations of gram-positive bacteria (Actinobacteriota, Bacillota). Combined bottom-up control by maize litter and top-down control by nematode grazing caused a succession of soil microbiota, which was driven by population changes first in the Bacteroidota, then in the Pseudomonadota, and last in the Acidobacteriota and Nitrososphaerota. This mechanistic understanding of nematode grazing on soil microbiota population dynamics is essential to inform predictive models of the soil food web.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Hence, a neuro-economic dilemma arises whether learning is a profitable investment or not, and the brain must therefore judiciously regulate learning. Indeed, in experiments it was observed that during starvation, Drosophila suppress formation of energy-intensive aversive memories. Here we include energy considerations in a reinforcement learning framework. Simulated flies learned to avoid noxious stimuli through synaptic plasticity in either the energy expensive long-term memory (LTM) pathway, or the decaying anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) pathway. The objective of the flies is to maximize their lifespan, which is calculated with a hazard function. We find that strategies that switch between the LTM and ARM pathways based on energy reserve and reward prediction error, prolong lifespan. Our study highlights the significance of energy-regulation of memory pathways and dopaminergic control for adaptive learning and survival. It might also benefit engineering applications of reinforcement learning under resources constraints.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

The Peruvian Genome Project is an initiative first of its kind, started in 2011, to address the underrepresentation of genomic data from native South American populations. This project has collected to date 1,149 samples from 17 traditional native and 13 mestizo (mixed of native, African, and European ancestry) communities. Currently, 150 whole genomes and 873 array-genotyped individuals have been sequenced from across the geography of Western South America, including coastal, Andes, and Amazonian regions. We discovered 1.6 million novel genetic variants with varying frequencies, indicative of local environmental adaptations and population drift. These novel variants allow us to infer local evolutionary traits and population-specific allele frequencies for people living at different altitudes, as well as varying adaptations to pathogens and living conditions. The Peruvian Genome Project is the result of more than a decade of work in sample selection, logistics, and approved regulatory community engagement, designed to enhance the human genome pool of diversity of native Americans. The data collected here enable the targeted characterization of endemic diseases, trait adaptations, and new variants of clinical significance in South America.

However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood, and inter-brain methods underdeveloped. Previously, we reported unique individual behavioral and neural signatures of performing actions when observed by others using a mirror-game paradigm. Here, we explored inter-brain synchronization during the mirror-game paradigm using a novel approach employing two-brain EEG microstates. Microstates are quasi-stable configurations of brain activity that have been reliably replicated across studies, and proposed to be basic buildings blocks for mental processing. Expanding the microstate methodology to dyads of interacting participants (two-brain microstates) enables us to investigate quasi-stable moments of inter-brain synchronous and asymmetric activity. Interestingly, we found that conventional microstates fitted to individuals were not related to the different task conditions; however, the dynamics of the two-brain microstates were changed for the observed actor-observer condition, compared to all other conditions where participants had more symmetric task demands (rest, individual, joint). These results suggest that two-brain microstates might serve as a method for identifying inter-brain states during asymmetric real-time social interaction.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Altered lipid metabolism is associated with loss of lymphatic vessel integrity, which compromises organ function, protective immunity, and metabolic health. However, the role of lipid metabolism in LEC function is not well understood.

Insulin is a key regulator of lipid metabolism and protein palmitoylation, the reversible post-translational protein modification by palmitate that affects protein stability, trafficking, protein-protein, and protein-membrane interactions. Human LECs are highly sensitive to insulin and can develop insulin resistance in vitro, but whether insulin regulates LEC protein palmitoylation and function is unknown.

To examine the role of palmitoylation in LEC function, we generated the first palmitoylation proteomics profile in human LECs, validated insulin regulated targets and profiled differences in palmitoylation between lymphatic and blood endothelial cells. Palmitoylation occurred primarily in proteins involved in LEC vesicular or membrane trafficking, translation initiation, and in those found in membrane rafts. Insulin enriched palmitoylation of LEC proteins involved in GTPase signaling, ubiquitination, and junctional anchoring. We also determined that the long-chain fatty acid receptor CD36 mediates optimal lymphatic palmitoylation. CD36 silencing in LECs doubled palmitoylation targets involving proteins related to inflammation and neutrophil degranulation contributing to an activated inflamed endothelium. These results suggest that the coordination of the process of palmitoylation is critical for normal lymphatic endothelial function.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Autophagy is significantly induced within systemically infected tissues, its disruption rendering plants highly sensitive to infection. Contrary to being an antiviral defense mechanism as previously suggested, quantitative analyses of the viral loads established autophagy as a tolerance pathway. Further analysis of one of these viruses, the Turnip Crinkle Virus (TCV) that hijack mitochondria, showed that despite perturbing mitochondrial integrity, TCV does not trigger a typical mitophagy response. Instead, TCV and Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) infection activates a distinct selective autophagy mechanism, where oligomeric metabolic enzymes moonlight as selective autophagy receptors and degrade key executors of defense and cell death such as EDS1. Altogether, our study reveals an autophagy-regulated metabolic rheostat that gauges cellular integrity during viral infection and degrades cell death executors to avoid catastrophic amplification of immune signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

Furthermore, single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis of Japanese AD patient samples revealed a significant reduction of GPR34 expression in microglia from AD patients compared to controls. We also observed an age-dependent decline in microglial GPR34 expression in both human and mouse datasets, suggesting a potential contribution of GPR34 downregulation to age-related A{beta} accumulation and AD risk. Collectively, our findings identify GPR34 as a promising target for modulating microglial A{beta} clearance and highlight the therapeutic potential of GPR34 agonists in AD.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

These findings give rise to the notion of cognitive 'resilience', suggesting maintained cognitive function despite the presence of AD neuropathology, highlighting the influence of factors beyond classical pathology. Cortical astroglial inflammation, a ubiquitous feature of symptomatic AD, shows a strong correlation with cognitive impairment severity, potentially contributing to the diversity of clinical presentations. However, noninvasively imaging neuroinflammation, particularly astrogliosis, using MRI remains a significant challenge. Here we sought to address this challenge and to leverage multidimensional (MD) MRI, a powerful approach that combines relaxation with diffusion MR contrasts, to map cortical astrogliosis in the human brain by accessing sub-voxel information. Our goal was to test whether MD-MRI can map astroglial pathology in the cerebral cortex, and if so, whether it can distinguish cognitive resiliency from dementia in the presence of hallmark AD neuropathological changes. We adopted a multimodal approach by integrating histological and MRI analyses using human postmortem brain samples. Ex vivo cerebral cortical tissue specimens derived from three groups comprised of non-demented individuals with significant AD pathology postmortem, individuals with both AD pathology and dementia, and non-demented individuals with minimal AD pathology postmortem as controls, underwent MRI at 7 T. We acquired and processed MD-MRI, diffusion tensor, and quantitative T1 and T2 MRI data, followed by histopathological processing on slices from the same tissue. By carefully co-registering MRI and microscopy data, we performed quantitative multimodal analyses, leveraging targeted immunostaining to assess MD-MRI sensitivity and specificity towards A{beta}, pTau, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for astrogliosis. Our findings reveal a distinct MD-MRI signature of cortical astrogliosis, enabling the creation of predictive maps for cognitive resilience amid AD neuropathological changes. Multiple linear regression linked histological values to MRI changes, revealing that the MD-MRI cortical astrogliosis biomarker was significantly associated with GFAP burden (standardized {beta}=0.658, pFDR<0.0001), but not with A{beta} (standardized {beta}=0.009, pFDR=0.913) or pTau (standardized {beta}=-0.196, pFDR=0.051). Conversely, none of the conventional MRI parameters showed significant associations with GFAP burden in the cortex. While the extent to which pathological glial activation contributes to neuronal damage and cognitive impairment in AD is uncertain, developing a noninvasive imaging method to see its affects holds promise from a mechanistic perspective and as a potential predictor of cognitive outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

However, introgression (gene flow between the genomic backbone of distinct species) has been reported in bacteria and is associated with fuzzy species borders in some lineages, but its prevalence and impact on the delimitation of bacterial species has not been systematically characterized. Here, we quantified the patterns of introgression across 50 major bacterial lineages. Our results reveal that bacteria present various levels of introgression, with an average of 2% of introgressed core genes and up to 12% in Campylobacter. Furthermore, our results show that some species are more prone to introgression than others within the same genus and introgression is most frequent between highly related species. We found evidence that the various levels of introgression across lineages are likely related to ecological proximity between species. Introgression can occasionally lead to fuzzy species borders, although many of these cases are likely instances of ongoing speciation. Overall, our results indicate that introgression has substantially shaped the evolution and the diversification of bacteria, but this process does not substantially blur species borders.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196830

In recent years, FGFR4 overexpression and activating mutations have been associated with numerous adult and pediatric cancers. As such, FGFR4 presents an opportunity for therapeutic targeting which is being pursued in clinical trials. To understand the role of FGFR4 signaling in disease and development, we generated and characterized three alleles of fgfr4 knockout zebrafish strains using CRISPR/Cas9. To generate fgfr4 knockout crispants, we injected single-cell wildtype zebrafish embryos with fgfr4 targeting guide RNA and Cas9 proteins, identified adult founders, and outcrossed to wildtype zebrafish to create an F1 generation. The generated mutations introduce a stop codon within the second Ig-like domain of Fgfr4, resulting in a truncated 215, 223, or 228 amino acid Fgfr4 protein compared to 922 amino acids in the full-length protein. All mutant strains exhibited significantly decreased fgfr4 mRNA expression during development, providing evidence for successful knockout of fgfr4 in mutant zebrafish. We found that, consistent with other Fgfr4 knockout animal models, the fgfr4 mutant fish developed normally; however, homozygous fgfr4 mutant zebrafish were significantly smaller than wildtype fish at three months post fertilization. These fgfr4 knockout zebrafish lines are a valuable tool to study the role of FGFR4 in vertebrate development and its viability as a potential therapeutic target in pediatric and adult cancers, as well as other diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Our results demonstrate that unlike unimodal cortical input, transmodal cortical input to the hippocampal region was selectively preserved during mammalian evolution.

Here, we investigate the potential regulatory roles of non-neural tissues in neuronal aging, using Caenorhabditis elegans PVD polymodal neuron as a model. We find that cutaneous PVD neurons develop progressive excessive dendritic branching during normal aging, functionally correlated with age-related deficits in proprioception. Our study reveals that age-related reduction in skin collagens, a common change across species, triggers the aging process of PVD. Specifically, loss-of-function mutations or adulthood-specific RNAi knockdown of skin collagen genes, dpy-5 or col-120, which are downregulated with age, induce an early onset of PVD excessive dendritic branching and proprioception deficits. Overexpressing dpy-5 or col-120 mitigates the development of excessive branching without affecting lifespan, suggesting a skin collagens' role in promoting healthspan rather than longevity. Notably, neither dpy-5 or col-120 is not involved in aging-associated dendritic beading, another degenerative phenotype in PVD associated with harsh touch response deficits. Moreover, dpy-5 mutation induces ectopic branching in ALM, but does not affect PLM, two other cutaneous sensory neurons. Finally, we identify rig-3, a neuronal Immunoglobulin Superfamily member not expressed in PVD or the skin, functioning in the same pathway as skin collagen genes to preserve PVD neuron integrity during aging. Our findings reveal the causative role of age-related reduction in skin collagens in neuronal aging, selectively impacting distinct neuron subtypes and structures. This study underscores the importance of exploring multi-tissue strategies to comprehensively address the complexities of neuronal aging.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

We propose a general theoretical framework to relate named atlas compartments across taxa and use it to establish a detailed correspondence between marmoset and mice brains. Contrary to conventional wisdom that brain structures may be easier to relate at higher levels of the atlas hierarchy, we find that finer parcellations at the leaf levels offer greater reconcilability despite naming discrepancies. Utilizing existing atlases and associated literature, we created a list of leaf- level structures for both species and establish five types of correspondence between them. One-to-one relations were found between 43% of the structures in mouse and 47% in marmoset, whereas 25% of mouse and 10% of marmoset structures were not relatable. The remaining structures show a set of more complex mappings which we quantify. Implementing this correspondence with volumetric atlases of the two species, we make available a computational tool for querying and visualizing relationships between the corresponding brains.

The large number of rare diseases and the difficulty for doctors to be familiar with all of them contribute to this problem. Artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), has shown promise in improving the diagnostic process by leveraging their extensive knowledge to help doctors navigate the complexities of diagnosing rare diseases. Foundation 29 presents a comprehensive evaluation of DxGPT, a web-based platform designed to assist healthcare professionals in the diagnostic process for rare diseases. The platform currently utilizes GPT-4, but this study also compares its performance with other large language models, including Claude 3, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama, Mistral, Mixtral, and Cohere Command R+. It is crucial to emphasize that DxGPT is not a medical device but rather a decision support tool that aims to aid in clinical reasoning. This study extends beyond initial synthetic patient cases, incorporating real-world data from the RAMEDIS and Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) datasets. The analysis followed two main metrics: Strict Accuracy (P1), how often the first diagnostic suggestion agreed with the real diagnosis, and Top-5 Accuracy (P1 + P5), how often the right diagnosis was in the top five suggestions. The results show a complex picture of diagnostic accuracy, with performance varying significantly across models and datasets: - On the synthetic dataset, closed models like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini exhibited relatively high accuracy. Open models like Llama 3 and Mixtral performed reasonably well, though lagging behind. - On the RAMEDIS rare disease cases, Claude 3 Opus model demonstrated 55% Strict Accuracy and 70% Top-5 Accuracy, outperforming other closed models. Open models like Llama 3 and Mixtral showed moderate accuracy. - The PUMCH dataset proved challenging for all models, with the highest Strict Accuracy at 59.46% (GPT-4 Turbo 1106) and Top-5 Accuracy at 64.86%. These findings demonstrate the potential of DxGPT and LLMs in improving diagnostic methods for rare diseases. However, they also emphasize the need for further validation, particularly in real-world clinical settings, and comparison with human expert diagnoses. Successful integration of AI into medical diagnostics will require collaboration between researchers, clinicians, and regulatory bodies to ensure safety, efficacy, and ethical deployment.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196831

The static vision mode (low flashing frequencies) is associated with strong SC activation modulated by cortical gain and inhibitory intertectal effects, while the dynamic vision mode (high flashing frequencies) evokes the continuity illusion, with associated suppression of SC neural activity. However, the pathway-wide mechanisms underpinning the dynamic vision mode remain poorly understood, especially in terms of corticotectal and tectotectal feedback. Here, we harness rat functional MRI combined with brain lesions to investigate whole-pathway interactions in the dynamic vision mode. In the SC, we find contralateral suppression of activity opposing positive ipsilateral neural activation upon monocular visual stimulation in the dynamic vision mode. A cortical amplification effect was confirmed for both static and dynamic vision modes through cortical lesions, while further lesioning ipsilateral SC led to a boost in the contralateral negative signals, suggesting an active push-pull interaction between ipsilateral and contralateral SCs during the dynamic vision mode regime. This push-pull interaction is specific to the dynamic vision mode; in the static vision mode, both SCs show similar response polarities. These results highlight hitherto unreported frequency-dependent modulations in the tectotectal pathway and further challenge the contemporary notion that intertectal connections solely serve as reciprocal inhibitory mechanisms for avoiding visual blur during saccade occurrence.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

The kidneys which are important in the response to the anaemia characteristic of African trypanosomiasis, are prone to acute kidney injury (AKI) from multiple noxious stimuli. Little is known about the transcriptional responses of the kidney to trypanosome infection. To assess the tissue-specific response to infection with Trypanosoma brucei, we profiled the clinicopathologic and transcriptional responses of the kidney in BALB/C (susceptible) and C57BL/6 (tolerant) murine models, at early (7 dpi) and late (21 dpi) time points of infection. Trypanosomes in the renal interstitium, tubular necrosis and inflammation characterised early infection in both mouse strains. By late infection, we observed extensive tubular necrosis in the susceptible BALB/C but reparative tubular regeneration in the tolerant C57BL/6 mice. T.b. brucei infection resulted in significant increases in serum creatinine in both strains. Consistent with the clinicopathologic findings, RNA-seq detected both mouse strain- and time-dependent transcriptional responses in the kidney. These included perturbations in genes associated with solute/ion transport, upregulation of markers of tubular injury, hypoxia, glycolysis, and a profound inflammatory and immune response, mirroring the responses observed in other models of AKI. Differential tissue pathology at late time point is preceded by expansion of CD8+ T cells, profound expression of transcription factors and upregulation of anti-inflammatory pathways in C57BL/6 mice.

However, less clear is how socioeconomic inequalities in diet develop across the life course. This study assessed the associations of early adulthood socioeconomic trajectories (SETs) with adult diet quality, adjusting for childhood socioeconomic position (SEP) and testing for mediation by adulthood SEP. Methods: Participants from the 1970 British Cohort Study with socioeconomic data in early adulthood were included (n=12434). Diet quality at age 46 years, evaluated using the Mediterranean diet pyramid, was regressed on six previously identified classes of early adulthood SETs between ages 16 and 24 years, including a Continued Education class, four occupation-defined classes, and an Economically Inactive class. Causal mediation analyses tested the mediation of the association via household income and neighbourhood deprivation at age 46 years separately. Models were adjusted for sex, childhood SEP, adolescent diet quality and adolescent health. Results: The Continued Education class showed the best diet quality at age 46 years, while little difference in diet quality was found among the remaining SET classes. The association between the Continued Education class and adult diet quality was independent of parental SEP in childhood, and was largely not mediated by household income or neighbourhood deprivation (0.7% and 3.7% of the total effect mediated, respectively) in mid-adulthood. Conclusions: Early adulthood SETs independently contribute to adult diet quality, with continuing education associated with better adherence to Mediterranean diet. Early adulthood therefore represents a critical period for intervention to alleviate dietary inequalities in later life.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196831

Polyploid chromosomes can be identical or heterogeneous, the latter giving rise to bacterial heterozygosity. While the benefits of heterozygosity are well studied in eukaryotes, its consequences in bacteria are unknown. Here we examine this question in the context of antibiotic resistance to understand how bacterial heterozygosity affects bacterial survival. Using a cell wall deficient model system in the actinomycete Kitasatospora viridifaciens, we found that heterozygous cells containing different chromosomes expressing different antibiotic resistance markers persist across a broader range of antibiotic concentrations. Recombinant cells containing the same resistance genes on a single chromosome also survive these conditions, but these cells pay a significant fitness cost due to constitutive expression of these genes. By contrast, heterozygous cells mitigate these costs by flexibly adjusting the ratio of their different chromosomes, thereby allowing rapid responses in temporally and spatially variable environments. Our results provide evidence that bacterial heterozygosity can increase adaptive plasticity in bacterial cells, in a similar manner to the evolutionary benefits provided by multicopy plasmids in bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Monitoring this cycle is necessary as it serves as a biomarker for overall health and is crucial for interpreting study results. The estrous cycle comprises four stages influenced by fluctuating levels of hormones, mainly estradiol and progesterone. Tracking the cycle traditionally relies on vaginal cytology, which categorizes stages based on three epithelial cell concentrations. However, this method has limitations, including time-consuming training and variable accuracy among researchers. To address these challenges, this study assessed the feasibility and reliability of two machine learning methods. An object detection-based machine learning model, Object Detection Estrous Staging (ODES), was employed to identify cell types throughout the estrous cycle in mice. A dataset of 555 vaginal cytology images with four different stains was annotated, with 335 images for training, 45 for validation, and 175 for testing. A novel, accurate set of rules for classification was derived by analyzing training images. ODES achieved an average accuracy of 87% in classifying cycle stages and took only 3.9 minutes to analyze 175 test images. The use of object detection machine learning significantly improved accuracy and efficiency compared to previously derived supervised image classification models (33-45% accuracy) and human accuracy (66% accuracy), refining research practices for female studies. These findings facilitate the integration of the estrous cycle into research, enhancing the quality of scientific results by allowing for efficient and accurate identification of the cycle stage.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Methods: We developed a comprehensive clinical genome CVD test with semi-automated interpretation. Monogenic conditions and risk alleles were selected based on systematic assessment of the strength of disease association and evidence for increased disease risk, respectively. Non-CVD secondary finding genes, pharmacogenomic (PGx) variants and CVD polygenic risk scores (PRS) were also assessed for inclusion. Test performance was modeled using 2,594 genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project, and further investigated in 20 previously tested individuals. Results: The CVD genome test is composed of a panel of 215 CVD gene-disease pairs, 35 non-CVD secondary findings genes, 4 risk alleles or genotypes, 10 PGx genes and a PRS for coronary artery disease. Modeling of test performance from samples in the 1000 Genomes Project revealed ~6% of individuals with a monogenic finding in a CVD-associated gene, 6% with a risk allele finding, 0.9% with a non-CVD secondary finding, and 93% with CVD-associated PGx variants. Assessment of blinded clinical samples showed complete concordance with prior testing. An average of 4 variants were reviewed per case, with interpretation and reporting time ranging from 9-96 min. Conclusions: A genome sequencing based CVD genetic risk assessment can provide comprehensive genetic disease and genetic risk information to patients with CVD. The semi-automated and limited interpretation burden suggest that this testing approach could be scaled to support population-level initiatives.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196831

The gut microbiome of children with SAM has been demonstrated to have a lower production of beneficial short chain fatty acids, which may contribute to impaired gut barrier function. Recently, several microbiota-directed therapies have been tested in clinical trials in children with SAM. Among them we hypothesized that feeds containing fermentable carbohydrates from various sources (legumes, chicory, milk oligosaccharides) would be fermented to produce beneficial microbial metabolites by the microbiota of children with SAM. In this study we used an in vitro model system inoculated with stool from children with SAM to investigate the fermentability of four substrates; inulin (a chicory-derived fructan), two milk powders (one supplemented with a human milk oligosaccharide) and a chickpea enriched feed. We demonstrated that while the milk powders and chickpea feed were fermented to produce short chain fatty acids, inulin was only fermented to a very limited degree. Through 16S rRNA sequencing we demonstrated that the samples inoculated with inulin had low microbial diversity and linked this to the limited ability to metabolise inulin. Through revealing the fermentability of different complementary feeds, the findings of this study will be of use for the design of future therapeutic feeds for treatment of SAM.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Notably, in children, as well as human volunteers challenged with ETEC, diarrheal severity is significantly increased severity in blood group A (bgA) individuals. EtpA, is a secreted glycoprotein adhesin that functions as a blood group A lectin to promote critical interactions between ETEC and blood group A glycans on intestinal epithelia for effective bacterial adhesion and toxin delivery. EtpA is highly immunogenic resulting in robust antibody responses following natural infection and experimental challenge of human volunteers with ETEC. To understand how EtpA directs ETEC-blood group A interactions and stimulates adaptive immunity, we mutated EtpA, mapped its glycosylation by mass-spectrometry (MS), isolated polyclonal (pAbs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from vaccinated mice and ETEC-infected human volunteers, and determined structures of antibody-EtpA complexes by cryo-electron microscopy. Both bgA and mAbs that inhibited EtpA-bgA interactions and ETEC adhesion, bound to the C-terminal repeat domain highlighting this region as crucial for ETEC pathogen-host interaction. MS analysis uncovered extensive and heterogeneous N-linked glycosylation of EtpA and cryo-EM structures revealed that mAbs directly engage these unique glycan containing epitopes. Finally, electron microscopy-based polyclonal epitope mapping revealed antibodies targeting numerous distinct epitopes on N and C-terminal domains, suggesting that EtpA vaccination generates responses against neutralizing and decoy regions of the molecule. Collectively, we anticipate that these data will inform our general understanding of pathogen-host glycan interactions and adaptive immunity relevant to rational vaccine subunit design.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Sensory experiences can also be stored and referenced in the form of memory. The Drosophila larva is a simple model organism that can store associative memories during classical conditioning, and is well-suited for studying learning and memory at a fundamental level. Much progress has been made in understanding larval learning behavior and the associated neural circuitry for olfactory conditioning, but other sensory systems are relatively unexplored. Here, we investigate memory formation in larvae treated with a temperature-based associative conditioning protocol, pairing normally neutral temperatures with appetitive (fructose, FRU) or aversive (salt, NaCl) stimuli. Associative memory is tested using thermal gradient geometries, and we quantify navigation strength towards or away from conditioned temperatures. We find that larvae demonstrate short-term associative learning. They navigate towards warmer or colder temperatures paired with FRU, and away from warmer temperatures paired with NaCl. These results, especially when combined with future investigations of thermal memory circuitry in larvae, should provide broader insight into how sensory stimuli are encoded and retrieved in insects and more complex systems.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Patients with small cell lung carcinoma or malignant thymoma can develop an autoimmune response against the CV2/collapsin response mediator protein 5 (CRMP5) antigen. For reasons that are not understood, approximately 80% of patients experience painful neuropathies. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying anti-CV2/CRMP5 autoantibodies (CV2/CRMP5-Abs)-related pain. We found that patient-derived CV2/CRMP5-Abs can bind to their target in rodent dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and superficial laminae of the spinal cord. CV2/CRMP5-Abs induced DRG neuron hyperexcitability and mechanical hypersensitivity in rats that were abolished by preventing binding to their cognate autoantigen CRMP5. The effect of CV2/CRMP5-Abs on sensory neuron hyperexcitability and mechanical hypersensitivity observed in patients was recapitulated in rats using genetic immunization providing an approach to rapidly identify possible therapeutic choices for treating autoantibody-induced pain including the repurposing of a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody that selectively deplete B-lymphocytes. These data reveal a previously unknown neuronal mechanism of neuropathic pain in patients with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes resulting directly from CV2/CRMP5-Abs-induced nociceptor excitability. CV2/CRMP5-Abs directly sensitize pain responses by increasing sensory neuron excitability and strategies aiming at either blocking or reducing CV2/CRMP5-Abs can treat pain as a comorbidity in patients with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

In Arabidopsis, POPEYE (PYE), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor (TF), has been shown to play a crucial role in regulating this balance. In recent years, the mechanisms regulating Fe uptake have been well established but the upstream transcriptional regulators of Fe transport and storage are still poorly understood. In this study, we report that ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5), a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) TF which has recently been shown to play a crucial role in Fe homeostasis, interacts with PYE. Molecular, genetic and biochemical approaches revealed that PYE and HY5 have overlapping as well as some distinct roles in regulation of Fe deficiency response. We found that HY5 and PYE both act as a repressor of Fe transport genes such as YSL3, FRD3 NPF5.9, YSL2, NAS4, and OPT3. HY5 was found to directly bind on the promoter of these genes and regulate intercellular Fe transport. Further analysis revealed that HY5 and PYE directly interact at the same region on PYE and NAS4 promoter. Overall, this study revealed that HY5 regulates Fe homeostasis by physically interacting with PYE as well as independently.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

We perform a systematic analysis of transfer learning using PLMs, conducting 370 experiments across a comprehensive suite of factors including different downstream tasks, architectures, model sizes, model depths, and pretraining time. We observe that while almost all down-stream tasks do benefit from pretrained models compared to naive sequence representations, for the majority of tasks performance does not scale with pretraining, and instead relies on low-level features learned early in pretraining.

The main factor limiting acetogenesis is often H2. Assessing the potential of acetogens in environmental and biotechnological processes thus requires insights into their H2 consumption kinetics. In this study, initial H2 consumption rates at a range of different initial H2 concentrations were measured for three different acetogens. Interesting, for all three strains, H2 consumption was found to follow first-order kinetics, i.e. the H2 consumption rate increased linearly with the dissolved H2 concentration up to almost saturated H2 levels. This contradicts Monod kinetics, which is commonly assumed for acetogens. The obtained first-order rate coefficients (k1) were further validated by fitting first-order kinetics on previous time-course experimental results. The latter method was also used to determine the k1 value of five additional acetogens strains. Biomass specific first-order rate coefficients were found to vary up to six-fold, with the highest k1 for Acetobacterium wieringae and the lowest for Sporomusa sphaeroides.

On the other hand, in other neuronal systems, increased activity leads to adaptive reduction of neuronal excitability to maintain homeostasis. Projection neurons (PNs) of spinal and medullary dorsal horns summate the activity of primary nociceptive and local central interneurons and convey it to higher centers. We show that at the peak of acute inflammatory pain, PNs reduce their intrinsic excitability and, consequently, action potential firing. When pain resolves, the excitability of PNs returns to baseline. Using electrophysiological and computational approaches, we found that an increase in potassium A-current (IA) underlies the decrease in the excitability of PNs in acute pain conditions. We hypothesized that an IA-induced decrease in PNs firing may restrain the output from the dorsal horn to prevent sensitization and pain chronification. Indeed, no changes of IA in PNs were observed in chronic pain conditions, and PNs exhibit increased intrinsic excitability and firing. Our results reveal an adaptive mechanism in acute pain conditions for regulating the output from the dorsal horn network, which, if interrupted, could trigger pain chronification.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the effects of m6A RNA modification on phage replication in two model organisms: Vibrio campbellii BAA-1116 (previously V. harveyi BB120) and Escherichia coli MG1655. An m6A-RNA depleted V. campbellii mutant ({Delta}rlmF{Delta}rlmJ) did not differ from the wild type in the induction of lysogenic phages or in susceptibility to the lytic Virtus phage. In contrast, the infection potential of the T5 phage, but not that of other T phages or the lambda phage, was reduced in an m6A-RNA depleted E. coli mutant ({Delta}rlmF{Delta}rlmJ) compared to the wild type. This was shown by a lower efficiency of plaquing and a higher percentage of surviving cells. There were no differences in T5 phage adsorption rate, but the mutant exhibited a 5 min delay in the rise period during the one-step growth curve. This is the first report demonstrating that E. coli mutant cells with lower m6A RNA levels have a higher chance of surviving T5 phage infection.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Here, we use Ptr23c null mutants to investigate the functional significance of Ptr through the entire life cycle monitoring survival during embryonic, larval, pupal and adult development, and studying larval locomotion and muscle structure. We report that Ptr23c larvae displayed impaired hatching, indicative of defective embryonic development. Moreover, mutant larvae exhibited reduced mobility and lethargy, suggesting a potential involvement of Ptr in neuromuscular function. Morphological analysis of somatic muscles in mutant larvae revealed enlarged cell nuclei. Despite high pre-adult mortality, a subset of Ptr23c mutant adults display an unexpected extension in lifespan compared to controls, implicating Ptr in the regulation of longevity. Our findings provide critical insights into the multifaceted role of Ptr in Drosophila development, highlighting its contributions to post-embryonic survival, neuromuscular function, and lifespan regulation. This study underscores the significance of exploring broader genetic networks to unravel the complexities of developmental processes.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Past research indicates there may be sex differences in cognitive aging trajectories and risk for age-related neurodegenerative diseases, i.e. Alzheimer's Disease. Yet, little is known about how biological sex affects episodic memory in the adult lifespan. We examined age differences in episodic memory for spatial context in males and females. Research Design and Methods: 192 adults aged 21 to 65 (M=44, SD=13, 134 females) completed a face-location task measuring spatial context memory (correct spatial context retrieval rates) and facial item memory (correct recognition rates), and the California Verbal Learning Test version II (CVLT-II) measuring verbal item memory (long free recall, cued recall, and recognition rates). Changepoint regression analysis was used to estimate the slope of memory across age and any significant shifts in the slope (indicating critical transition periods). Results: Regression analyses revealed that the best fitting model for females on spatial context memory accuracy was a one-changepoint model, with gradual decline of 2% (SE=1) fewer correct responses per year of age from age 21 until age 50 (95% CI 41, 58), shifting to more rapid decline of 4% (SE=1) fewer correct responses per year of age until age 65. The best fitting model for males on spatial context memory accuracy was linear, with no significant changes across ages. The best fitting models for both sexes were linear for facial item memory accuracy, spatial context memory and facial item memory reaction times, and verbal item memory accuracy. Discussion and Implication: Males and females show similar decline on spatial context memory from young adulthood until midlife, after which females show greater decline than males. Importantly, disaggregating by sex indicated that past midlife effects on episodic memory for context may be driven by a specific group of females (post-menopausal), as accelerated decline occurred at the same time as menopause in midlife females and did not occur in midlife males.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

The core transcriptional machinery responsible for auxin-mediated responses is conserved across all land plants. Genetic, physiological and molecular exploration in bryophyte and angiosperm model species have shown both qualitative and quantitative differences in auxin responses. Given the highly divergent ontogeny of the dominant gametophyte (bryophytes) and sporophyte (angiosperms) generations, however, it is unclear whether such differences derive from distinct phylogeny or ontogeny. Here, we address this question by comparing a range of physiological, developmental and molecular responses to auxin in both generations of the model fern Ceratopteris richardii. We find that auxin response in Ceratopteris gametophytes closely resembles that of a thalloid bryophyte, whereas the sporophyte mimics auxin response in flowering plants. This resemblance manifests both at phenotypic and transcriptional level. Furthermore, we show that disrupting auxin transport can lead to ectopic sporophyte induction on the gametophyte, suggesting a role for auxin in the alternation of generations. Our study thus identifies ontogeny, rather than phylogeny, as a major determinant of auxin response properties in land plants.

Summary statementStudies in angiosperms and bryophytes have left unresolved the roles of tissue ontogeny and species phylogeny in auxin response. We address that problem by characterizing auxin response in a fern.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Our persistence is the scaffold on which many higher executive functions are built. However, it remains unclear whether humans are uniquely persistent or, instead, if this capacity is widely conserved across species. To address this question, we compared humans with mice and monkeys in harmonised versions of an uncertain decision-making task. The task encouraged all species to strike a balance between persistently exploiting one policy and exploring alternative policies that could become better at any moment. Although all three species had similar strategies, we found that both primate species--humans and monkeys--were able to persist in exploitation for much longer than the mice. We speculate that the similarities in persistence patterns in humans and monkeys, as opposed to mice, may be linked to ecological, neurobiological, or cognitive factors that differ systematically between these species.

TeaserHumans, monkeys and mice use similar decision-making strategies, but exploit valuable options for different lengths of time.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

However, this approach can produce variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice appeared to habituate more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in withdrawal behavior. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdalar neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map pain sensation and affect.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

DesignThis case series study analyzed adverse event (AE) reports submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database following RSVPreF immunization from September 1, 2023, to February 23, 2024.

SettingVAERS, as a national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system, provides insights into the safety profile of the RSVPreF vaccine in a real-world setting.

ParticipantsSurveillance data included all AE reports submitted to VAERS for pregnant individuals following vaccination.

ExposureReceipt of RSVPreF vaccine among pregnant individuals in the U.S.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresDescriptive statistics assessed all AE reports with RSVPreF, including frequency, gestational age at vaccination, time to AE onset, and serious report proportions. The Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) was utilized, estimating the information component (IC) to identify disproportionate reporting of RSVPreF-event pairs.

ResultsVAERS received 77 reports pertained to RSVPreF vaccination in pregnant individuals, with 42 (54.55%) classified as serious. The most reported non-pregnancy-specific AEs were headache, injection site erythema, and injection site pain. Preterm birth was the most frequently reported pregnancy-specific AE, followed by preterm premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, cervical dilatation, and hemorrhage during pregnancy. The median time from immunization to reported preterm birth was 3 days, with two-thirds of cases within a week. Disproportionality analysis indicated a significant signal for various AEs, particularly highlighting preterm birth with an IC of 2.18 (95%CI, 1.54-2.63), suggesting that reports of preterm birth associated with RSVPreF vaccination occurred more frequently than statistically expected.

ConclusionsWhile reported AEs were generally consistent with the safety profile observed in prelicensure studies, this study highlights ongoing concern about preterm birth among pregnant individuals following RSVPreF vaccination. Comprehensive longitudinal follow-up, including prospective pregnancy registries and infant follow-up studies is urgently required.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196831

However, in some cases, such molecular effects may be ambiguous following genetic sequence analysis alone. One such case is exonic, codon-altering variants that are also predicted to disrupt normal RNA splicing. Here, we identify such cases in the context of inherited retinal disease. NR2E3 c.932G>A (p.Arg311Gln) is a variant commonly associated with Enhanced S Cone Syndrome (ESCS). Previous studies using mutagenized cDNA constructs have shown that the arginine to glutamine substitution at position 311 of NR2E3 does not meaningfully diminish function of the rod-specific transcription factor. Using retinal organoids, we explored the molecular consequences of NR2E3 c.932G>A when expressed endogenously during human rod photoreceptor cell development. Retinal organoids carrying the NR2E3 c.932G>A allele expressed a transcript containing a 186-nucleotide deletion of exon 6 within the ligand binding domain. This short transcript was not detected in control organoids or control human donor retina samples. A minigene containing exons 5 and 6 of NR2E3 showed sufficiency of the c.932G>A variant to cause the observed splicing defect. These results support the hypothesis that the pathogenic NR2E3 c.932G>A variant leads to photoreceptor disease by causing a splice defect and not through an amino acid substitution as previously supposed. They also explain the relatively mild effect of Arg311Gln on NR2E3 function in vitro. We also used in silico prediction tools to show that similar changes are likely to affect other inherited retinal disease variants in genes such as CEP290, ABCA4, and BEST1.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

As resistance outpaces development, new perspectives are required. For decades, scientists have prioritized chemical optimization, while largely ignoring the physical process of delivery. Here, we used mathematical simulations and microfluidic experiments to explore how fluid flow delivers antimicrobials into communities of the highly-resistant pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We discover that increasing flow overcomes bacterial resistance towards three chemically distinct antimicrobials: hydrogen peroxide, gentamicin, and carbenicillin. Without flow, resistant P. aeruginosa cells generate local zones of depletion by neutralizing all three antimicrobials through degradation or chemical modification. As flow increases, delivery overwhelms neutralization, allowing antimicrobials to regain effectiveness against resistant bacteria. Additionally, we discover that cells on the edge of a community shield internal cells, and cell-cell shielding is abolished in higher flow regimes. Collectively, our quantitative experiments reveal the unexpected result that physical flow and chemical dosage are equally important to antimicrobial effectiveness. Thus, our results should inspire the incorporation of flow into the discovery, development, and implementation of antimicrobials, and could represent a new strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) for noninvasive speech BCIs offers an accessible and affordable solution, potentially benefiting a broader audience. However, EEG-based speech decoding remains controversial especially for overt speech, due to difficulties in separating speech-related neural activities from myoelectric potential artifacts generated during articulation. Here we aim to delineate the extent of the neural contributions by employing Explainable AI techniques to a convolutional neural network predicting spoken words based on signals obtained by ultra-high-density (uhd)-EEG. We found that electrode-wise contributions to the decoding cannot be explained by their mutual information with electromyography (EMG). Furthermore, contributing periods of speech to EEG-based decoding are distinct from those to decoding solely relying on EMG. In contrast, there are significant overlaps in signal timings contributing to EEG-based decoding, regardless of vocal conditions such as overt or covert speech. Notably, the denoising process successfully enhanced the decoding contribution from electrodes within speech-related brain areas for all speech conditions. Altogether, our findings support the idea that, with appropriate preprocessing, EEG becomes a valuable tool for decoding spoken words based on underlying neural activities.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Sparse genetic manipulations in vivo demonstrate that in the absence of GPR158, unrestrained PLCXD2 activity impedes postsynaptic SA incorporation and hampers dendritic spine maturation. Finally, we show that extracellular heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) binding modulates the GPR158-PLCXD2 interaction. Together, our findings reveal how a postsynaptic receptor signaling complex regulates the local lipid microenvironment to control SA abundance required for the proper maturation of dendritic spines.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Developmental disturbances in pyramidal neuron activity can impede the development of GABAergic neurons with long-lasting effects on inhibitory networks. However, the role of deep-layer pyramidal neurons in instructing the development and distribution of GABAergic neurons remains unknown. To unravel the role of deep-layer pyramidal neuron activity in orchestrating the spatial and laminar organisation of parvalbumin neurons, we selectively manipulated the activity of projection neurons in layer 5 of the cortex. By ablating SNAP25 from subsets of glutamatergic L5 projection neurons across the cortical mantle, we abolished Ca2+-dependent vesicle release from Rbp4-Cre+ pyramidal neurons. We explored the local (location of the cell bodies) and the global (subcortical projection sites) effects of chronically silencing cortical L5 neurons on parvalbumin interneurons. We found that the chronic cessation of vesicle release from L5 projection neurons left the density, distribution, and developmental trajectory of cortical and subcortical PV neurons intact during the second and third postnatal week; however, it resulted in the reorganisation of the laminar distribution of cortical PV neurons in layer 4 of S1 in the adult cortex. The abolition of evoked vesicle release from L5 also affected the perineuronal nets in the adult motor cortex and revealed a significant decrease in the density of VVA+ and PV-VVA+ cells in L5 of M1 at 3 months of age. The alterations in the laminar arrangement of VVA+ neurons may imply that Ca2+- dependent synaptic transmission from L5 may control PNN density in adult networks. We also discovered that the absence of L5 activity only had a transient effect on the morphology of striatal PV neurons. The correlation between PV and VVA neurons was contingent on brain regions and cortical layers, therefore the link between the perineuronal net and PV neurons is significantly more intricate than previously believed. The present study will aid our understanding of the bidirectional relationship between deep-layer pyramidal cells and GABAergic neurons while uncovering the long-term effects of chronically disrupting pyramidal neurons on inhibitory networks.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Yet, a comprehensive characterization of the unique and shared neuroanatomical signatures of these schizotypy dimensions is lacking. Leveraging 3D brain MRI data from 2,730 unmedicated healthy individuals, we identified neuroanatomical profiles of positive and negative schizotypy and systematically compared them to disorder-specific, micro-architectural, connectome, and neurotransmitter-level measures. Positive and negative schizotypy were associated with thinner frontal and thicker paralimbic cortical areas, respectively, and were differentially linked to cortical patterns of schizophrenia-spectrum and neurodevelopmental conditions. Furthermore, these schizotypal cortical patterns mapped onto local attributes of gene expression, cortical myelination, D1 and histamine receptor distributions. Network models identified cortical hub vulnerability to schizotypy-related thickness reduction and epicenters in sensorimotor-to-association and paralimbic areas. This study yields insights into the complex cortical signatures of schizotypy and their relationship to diverse features of cortical organization.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196831

Plant meristems are structured organs consisting of distinct layers of stem cells. Somatic mutations occurring in one of these layers can propagate into large sectors of the plant. However, the frequency and characteristics of meristematic mutations that form the basis of somaclonal phenotypic variation remain unclear. Results Here, we analysed the frequency and distribution of somatic mutations in an individual Apricot tree. For this, we sequenced the genomes of fruit samples corresponding to distinct meristematic cell layers selected across the entire tree. Most somatic mutations (>90%) were specific to individual layers. Genotyping the somatic mutations in leaves sampled next to the fruits confirmed their meristematic origin. Interestingly, layer 1 (epidermis) had a higher mutation load than layer 2 (mesocarp), implying differential mutational dynamics between the layers. The somatic mutations followed the branching pattern of the tree. These factors led to the unexpected observation that the layer 1 samples from different branches were more similar to each other than to layer 2 samples of the same branch. Further, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrated that the layer-specific mutant alleles could only be found in the transcripts of the respective, layer-specific cell clusters and could form the basis for somaclonal phenotypic variation. Conclusions Here, we analyzed the prevalence and distribution of somatic mutations with meristematic origin. Our insights into the yet unexplored layer-specificity of such somatic mutations outlined how they can be identified and how they impact the breeding of clonally propagated crops.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

In contrast to prior approaches that mostly focused on protein sequence features, we employ pretrained protein language model to encode the sequence features, and natural language model for the semantic information of property descriptions. Specifically, we present FAPM, a contrastive model between natural language and protein sequence language, which combines the pretrained protein sequence model with the pretrained large language model to generate labels such as GO functional terms and catalytic activity prediction in the format of natural language. Our result shows that FAPM has learned superior representations related to protein properties, outperforming protein sequence-based or structure-based models. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance both on public benchmarks and on experimentally-annotated phage proteins that have limited known homologous sequences. Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility of our model to accept additional free text prompts as input, such as easily accessible taxonomy information, not only enhances its predictive performance but also improves the model\'s explainability. Our methodology presents a novel avenue for exploration, characterized by its potential to supersede current methodologies reliant on multiple sequence alignment for protein annotation.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

The success of groups in these conflicts depends on individual contributions to collective fighting, yet individuals may have personal fitness incentives to defect rather than fight, which could undermine group performance. Here we test the hypothesis that personal fitness incentives affect intergroup conflict success in wild banded mongooses (Mungos mungo). In this species, intergroup fights are sometimes initiated by estrous females, who gain outgroup matings while their male group-mates contribute most of the fighting effort. We found that group fighting success was highest when a group's females were in estrus, suggesting that, although females may initiate fights, their male group-mates seem motivated to chase away rival groups to defend their paternity. Surprisingly, we found that groups that won fights conceded more paternity to their rivals than groups that lost. In other words, behavioral ""wins"" did not always result in fitness ""wins"". Younger males were more successful at attaining paternity between groups compared to within their own groups, suggesting that they may forego intergroup fighting to focus on intergroup mating. Overall, our results suggest that personal fitness incentives--here, in the form of paternity--vary widely among group members and can undermine rather than promote collective fighting performance. Such conflicts of interest are likely inherent in group combat and can contribute to variation in the frequency and costliness of intergroup violence.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Contrary to the traditional view of taste perception as innate, our findings suggest rapid, experience-dependent changes in GC responses during initial taste exposure trials. Specifically, we find that early responses to novel taste are less ""stereotyped"" and encode taste identity less reliably compared to later responses. These changes underscore the dynamic nature of sensory processing and provides novel insights into the real-time dynamics of sensory processing across novel-taste familiarization.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Emerging evidence suggests a role for S. aureus in exacerbating AD skin inflammation. We have previously shown that specific glycosylation of S. aureus cell wall structures amplifies skin inflammation through interaction with Langerhans cells (LCs). However, the role of LCs in AD remains poorly characterized. Here, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing of primary epidermal LCs and dermal T cells isolated from skin biopsies of AD patients and healthy controls, alongside specific glycoanalysis of S. aureus strains isolated from the AD lesions. Our findings reveal four LC subpopulations, including two steady-state clusters (LC1 and LC1H) and two pro-inflammatory/matured subsets (LC2 and migratory LCs). The latter two subsets were enriched in AD skin. AD LCs showed enhanced expression of C-type lectin receptors, the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc{epsilon}R1), and activation of prostaglandin and leukotrienes biosynthesis pathways, as well as upregulated transcriptional signatures related to T cell activation pathways and increased expression of CCL17 (specifically LC2) compared to healthy LCs. Correspondingly, T helper 2 and regulatory T cell populations were increased in AD lesions.

Whole-cell recordings in neonatal slices revealed preferential interconnectivity within embryonically TRAPed piriform neurons and their enhanced synaptic connectivity with other piriform neurons. In vivo Neuropixels recordings in neonates demonstrated that embryonically TRAPed piriform neurons exhibit broad functional connectivity within piriform and lead spontaneous synchronized population activity during a transient neonatal period, when recurrent connectivity is strengthening. Selectively activating or silencing of these neurons in neonates enhanced or suppressed recurrent synaptic strength, respectively. Thus, embryonically TRAPed piriform neurons represent an interconnected hub-like population whose activity promotes recurrent connectivity in early development.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Methods A cohort of 152,508 patients with 293,557 ECGs paired serum potassium levels obtained within one hour at Cedars Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) was used to train an AI-ECG model (Kardio-Net) to predict serum potassium level. The model was further fine-tuned on 4,337 ECGs from 1,463 patients with ESRD using inputs from 12-lead and single-lead ECGs. Kardio-Net was evaluated in held-out test cohorts from CSMC and Stanford Healthcare (SHC) as well as a prospective international cohort of 40 ESRD patients with smartwatch ECGs at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH). Results The Kardio-Net, when applied to 12-lead ECGs, identified severe hyperkalemia with an AUC of 0.852 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.527 mEq/L. In external validation at SHC, the model achieved an AUC of 0.849 and an MAE of 0.599 mEq/L.

Genomic medicine may help guide care, as pathogenic variants are identified in up to 50% of patients with NDDs. We evaluate the impact of a genomics-informed, multidisciplinary, neuropsychiatric specialty clinic on the diagnosis and management of patients with NDDs. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 316 patients from the UCLA Care and Research in Neurogenetics Clinic, a genomics-informed multidisciplinary clinic composed of psychiatry, neurology, medical genetics, psychology, and social work. Results: We observed high rates of psychiatric and medical comorbidity. Among the 246 patients that underwent genetic testing, 41.8% had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variant. Patients had 62 different genetic diagnoses, with 12 diagnoses shared by two or more patients, including Duplication 15q syndrome (9.18%), Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (3.48%), and Angelman syndrome (1.27%), while 50 diagnoses were found in only single patients. Genetic diagnosis resulted in direct changes to clinical management in all patients with a P/LP variant, including high rates of cascade testing (30.6%), family counseling (22.2%), medication changes (13.9%), clinical trial referral (2.8%), medical surveillance (30.6%), and specialty referrals (69.4%). Conclusions: A genomics-informed model can provide significant clinical benefits to patients with NDDs, directly impacting management across multiple domains for most diagnosed patients. As precision treatments for NDDs advance, establishing a genetic diagnosis will be critical for proper management. With the growing number of rare neurogenetic disorders, clinician training should emphasize core principles of genomic medicine over individual syndromes.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196831

Methods: Troponin composition was analyzed in heparin plasma samples taken from 45 runners <1 h after marathon race and from 45 patients with Type 1 MI <12 h after the pain onset. The concentration of long molecular forms of cTnT (long cTnT) was measured with a novel upconversion luminescence assay, total cTnT was measured with a commercial high-sensitivity cTnT assay, and the ratio of long to total cTnT (troponin ratio) was determined. Results: Total cTnT exceeded the upper reference limit (>14 ng/l) in 37 (82%) runners. The median total and long cTnT concentrations and the troponin ratio were higher (113 ng/l vs. 25 ng/l, 57 ng/l vs. 4.1 ng/l, and 0.36 vs. 0.17, respectively) in patients with MI than in marathon runners (p <0.001 for all comparisons). Troponin ratio decreased (r = -0.497, p <0.001) in marathon runners and increased (r = 0.466, p = 0.001) in patients with MI with increasing troponin release. In the receiver operating characteristics curve analyses of all subjects with cTnT release >14ng/l and those with 15-100 ng/l, long cTnT showed good predictive power with the area under the curve 0.969 (CI95% 0.939-1.000) and 0.937 (95% CI, 0.877?0.996) in discriminating marathon runners from MI patients.

On September 20, 2022, Uganda declared a Sudan Virus Disease (SVD, caused by Sudan ebolavirus) outbreak after a patient with confirmed Sudan virus (SUDV) infection was identified in Mubende District. The outbreak led to 142 confirmed and 22 probable cases over the next two months. We examined the types of stigma experienced by survivors and their household members and its effect on their well-being. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study during January 2023 in Mubende and Kassanda Districts. We conducted in-depth and key informant interviews with ten SVD survivors, ten household members of SVD survivors, and ten key informants (district officials and health workers in the affected communities). Interviews were recorded, translated,  transcribed, and analyzed thematically. Results: Survivors reported experiencing isolation and rejection by community members and loss of work. They reported being denied purchases at shops or having their money collected in a basket and disinfected (enacted stigma), which led to self-isolation (felt stigma). Educational institutions denied admission to some students from affected homes, while parents of children in some affected families stopped sending children to school due to verbal abuse from students and teachers (structural stigma). Prolonged SVD symptoms and additional attention to survivors from responders (including home visits by health workers, public distribution of support items, and conspicuous transport from home to the survivors clinic) were perceived as aggravating both felt and enacted stigma. Even after the outbreak had been declared over, survivors felt that they were still considered a threat to the community. Conclusion: Survivors experienced felt stigma, enacted stigma, and structural stigma. Strengthening community engagement to counteract stigma, rethinking response activities that aggravate stigma, management of long-term SVD symptoms for survivors, integrated response interventions by partners, private distribution of support items, and increasing awareness and sensitization through video messages could reduce stigma among persons affected in future similar outbreaks.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196831

We aimed to estimate associations between violent victimisation and subsequent common psychiatric disorders, suicidal behaviours, and premature mortality whilst accounting for unmeasured familial confounders.   Methods and Findings Using nationwide registers, we identified a total of 127,628 individuals born in Finland (1987-2004) and Sweden (1973-2004) who had experienced violent victimisation, defined as either hospital admissions or secondary care outpatient visits for assault-related injuries. These were age- and sex-matched with up to 10 individuals in the general population (n=1,276,215) and their unaffected siblings (n=132,408). Outcomes included depression, anxiety, personality disorders, substance use disorders, suicidal behaviours, and premature mortality. Participants were followed from the victimisation date until the date of the outcome, emigration, death, or December 31, 2020, whichever occurred first. Country-specific associations were estimated using stratified Cox regression models, which also accounted for unmeasured familial confounders via sibling comparisons. The country-specific associations were then pooled using meta-analytic models.   Among 127,628 patients (69.0% men) who had experienced violent victimisation, the median age at first violent victimisation was 21 (interquartile range: 18-26) years. Absolute risks of all outcomes were larger in those who were exposed to violent victimisation compared to population controls (2.3-22.5 vs. 0.6-7.3 per 1000 person-years). In adjusted models, people who had experienced violent victimisation were between two to three times as likely as their siblings to develop any of the outcomes (adjusted hazard ratios [aHRs]: 1.7-3.0). Risks remained elevated two years post-victimisation (aHRs: 1.4-2.3).   Conclusions Improving clinical assessment, management and aftercare psychosocial support could potentially reduce rates of common psychiatric disorders, suicidality and premature in individuals experiencing violent victimisation.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196831

We show that while FGF17 and FGF18 both recapitulate VM DA progenitor patterning events, FGF17 induced expression of key VM DA progenitor markers at higher levels than FGF8 and transplanted FGF17-patterned progenitors fully reversed motor deficits in a rat PD model. Early activation of the cAMP pathway mimicked FGF17-induced patterning, although strong cAMP activation came at the expense of EN1 expression.

Neuronal synchronization and brain criticality are key candidates of such mechanisms both for healthy cognitive functions and in constituting mechanistic biomarkers for several brain disorders. Despite significant advances, there is not an abundance of modeling approaches that yield both in-vivo-like critical synchronization dynamics and observables that directly match those obtainable with multi-modal neuroimaging. Here, we advance a framework for hierarchical Kuramoto models where the simplest two-layer model comprises a network of pairwise coupled nodes which each contain a large number of oscillators. Already at two levels of hierarchy, this enables explicit representation of local and inter-areal coupling and observations of emergent multi-scale synchronization dynamics. We show here that the model produces observables of meso- and macro-scale synchronization dynamics that are physiologically plausible when compared to, e.g., magneto- and electroencephalographic (M/EEG) data. We also present here a novel approach for fitting this model with individual experimental data that uses not only functional connectivity but also critical dynamics to converge model parameters that are personalized with individual M/EEG and structural-connectivity data. We posit that brain-dynamics matched personalized models yield a basis for 'digital twins' that may support both clinical applications and basic research on the systems-level mechanisms of cognitive functions. The model and model fitting approach advanced here support both new mechanistic understanding of experimental observations and derivation of predictions for future research.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Maroon farmers still cultivate a large rice diversity, their oldest staple crop. Maroon oral history and written records by colonial authorities provide contrasting perspectives on the origins of Maroon rice. Here, we integrated genomic ancestry analyses of 136 newly sequenced Maroon rice varieties with ethnobotanical and archival research to reconstruct the historical contexts associated with the introduction of rice varieties to the Guianas. We found that a large subset traces to West Africa, linked to the transatlantic slave trade (c.1530-1825). Maroons obtained other varieties from indentured laborers from Java (1890 onwards), USA rice breeders (1932 onwards), and Hmong refugees from the Vietnam War (1991). Furthermore, we found rice types never documented before, indicating Maroon farmers selected from crosses. Overall, our results demonstrate that the Maroon farming system prioritizes maintenance of a high stock diversity, which we posit reflects the expertise they inherited from their (African) ancestors. Ignored by agricultural modernization initiatives, Maroon farmers today are important custodians of a unique cultural heritage. Moreover, the genomic findings underline many Maroon stories about their past. This study hence demonstrates the power of cross-disciplinary crop research to reconstruct aspects of the human past for which historical records may be biased or incomplete. We anticipate that a similar study approach can be applied to other heirloom crops of (Indigenous) communities that may have preserved their history on their farms to reconstruct, acknowledge and honor the past.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

As such, ASCs are key mediators of humoral immunity whether it be in the context of pathogen exposure, vaccination or even homeostatic clearance of cellular debris. Therefore, understanding basic tenants of ASC biology such as their differentiation kinetics following B cell stimulation is of importance. Towards that aim, we developed a mouse model which expresses simian HBEGF (a.k.a., diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR)) under the control of the endogenous Jchain locus (or J-DTR). ASCs from these mice expressed high levels of cell surface DTR and were acutely depleted following diphtheria toxin treatment. Furthermore, proof-of-principle experiments demonstrated the ability to use these mice to track ASC reconstitution following depletion in 3 distinct organs. Overall, J-DTR mice provide a new and highly effective genetic tool allowing for the study of ASC biology in a wide range of potential applications.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of tauopathy, tau aggregation begins in the brainstem and entorhinal cortex and then spreads throughout the brain. Understanding the mechanism by which locally formed tau pathology propagates throughout the brain is crucial for comprehending the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, a novel model of tau pathology that artificially induces tau aggregation in targeted cells at specific times is essential. In this study, we report a novel optogenetic module, OptoTau, human tau with the P301L mutation fused with a photosensitive protein Cry2Olig, which could induce various forms of tau depending on the pattern of blue light illumination. Continuous blue light illumination for 12 h to Neuro2a cells stably expressing OptoTau (OptoTauKI cells) resulted in cluster formation along microtubules, many of which eventually accumulated in aggresomes. On the other hand, when alternating light exposure and darkness in 30-minute cycles for 8 sets per day were repeated over 8 days, methanol-insoluble tau aggregation was formed. Methanol-insoluble tau was induced more rapidly by repeating cycles of 5-minute illumination followed by 25 minutes of darkness over 24 hours. These findings suggest that OptoTau can induce various stages of tau aggregation depending on the pattern of blue light exposure. Thus, this technique holds promise as a novel approach to creating specific tau aggregation in targeted cells at desired time points.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

The Pseudomonas syringae species complex is present in various environments, including plants. It can cause major crop diseases, such as bacterial canker on apricot trees. This study presents a collection of 25 unique phages genomes that infect P. syringae. These phages were isolated from apricot orchards with bacterial canker symptoms after enrichment with 21 strains of P. syringae. This collection comprises mostly virulent phages, with only three being temperate. They belong to 14 genera, 11 of which are newly discovered, and 18 new species, revealing great genetic diversity within this collection. Novel DNA packaging systems have been identified bioinformatically in one of the new phage species, but experimental confirmation is required to define the precise mechanism. Additionally, many phage genomes contain numerous potential auxiliary metabolic genes with diversified putative functions. At least three phages encode genes involved in bacterial tellurite resistance, a toxic metalloid. This suggests that viruses could play a role in bacterial stress tolerance. This research emphasises the significance of continuing the search for new phages in the agricultural ecosystem to unravel novel ecological diversity and new gene functions. This work contributes to the foundation for future fundamental and applied research on phages infecting phytopathogenic bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

We investigate the role of a distinct cell type, Taschykinin 2-expressing (Tac2+) neurons, located in the dorsomedial PAG (dmPAG), in modulating aggression in mice. METHODS: We combined activity mapping, in vivo Ca2+ recording, chemogenetic and pharmacological manipulation, and a viral-based translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) profiling using a mouse resident-intruder model. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the dmPAGTac2 neurons were exclusively activated by fighting behaviors. Further, we show that activation of the dmPAGTac2 neurons evoked, while inhibition or genetic ablation of the dmPAGTac2 neurons suppressed fighting behaviors. TRAP proofing of dmPAGTac2 neurons revealed that fighting behaviors specifically induced enrichment of serotonin-associated transcripts to the dmPAGTac2 neurons. Last, we validated these findings by selectively delivering pharmacological agents into the dmPAG and reversed the behavioral outcomes induced by chemogenetic manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: We identify that the dmPAGTac2 neuron can regulate mouse aggressive behavior and thus suggest a distinct molecular target for the treatment of exacerbated aggressive behavior in populations that exhibit high-level of violence.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Eleven megabase-sized chromosomes each comprise a transcribed core flanked by silent subtelomeres, housing thousands of Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) genes. Additionally, silent VSGs are also found on hundreds of sub-megabase chromosomes that harbour 177 bp repeats of unknown function, and multiple VSG transcription sites localise to the telomeres of both chromosome types. DNA replication dynamics have been described in the megabase chromosome cores but not in the subtelomeres or sub-megabase chromosomes, and targeted early replication of the single active VSG transcription site is unexplained. Here, using Nanopore assembly, we mapped DNA replication across this compartmentalised genome. We show that subtelomeres display a paucity of replication initiation events relative to the core, correlating with increased instability in the silent VSG archive. In addition, early replication of the active VSG transcription site is shown to originate from the telomere, likely causing targeted VSG recombination. Lastly, we demonstrate that the 177 bp repeats act as widespread, conserved DNA replication origins, explaining mitotic stability of the abundant small chromosomes and early DNA replication of megabase chromosome centromeres. Compartmentalized DNA replication dynamics therefore explains how T. brucei balances stable genome transmission with localised instability driving immune evasion.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

However, shifts in strategy cannot be captured by a static MoA. To investigate such dynamics, we present the mixture-of-agents hidden Markov model (MoA-HMM), which simultaneously learns inferred action values from a set of agents and the temporal dynamics of underlying ""hidden"" states that capture shifts in agent contributions over time. Applying this model to a multi-step,reward-guided task in rats reveals a progression of within-session strategies: a shift from initial MB exploration to MB exploitation, and finally to reduced engagement. The inferred states predict changes in both response time and OFC neural encoding during the task, suggesting that these states are capturing real shifts in dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

We found that the yeast membrane protein Yet3, the homolog of human BAP31, is localized to multiple ER contact sites. We show that Yet3 interacts with all the enzymes of the post-squalene ergosterol biosynthesis pathway and recruits them to create sterol-rich domains. Increasing sterol levels at ER contacts causes its depletion from the plasma membrane leading to a compensatory reaction and altered cell metabolism. Our data shows that Yet3 provides on-demand sterols at contacts thus shaping organellar structure and function. A molecular understanding of this proteins functions gives new insights into the role of BAP31 in development and pathology.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

DYN fibers synapse onto DA terminals which express both KOR and dopamine transporter (DAT). DAT activity is critical in the regulation of DA dynamics and dopaminergic neurotransmission. Previously, we demonstrated that KOR agonists upregulate DAT activity via ERK1/2 signaling involving phospho-Thr53 DAT (pT53-DAT). However, whether pT53-DAT is involved in KOR-mediated DAT regulation in-vivo and whether such phenomenon contributes to the behavioral effects of KOR agonism are unknown. Here, we investigated the role of endogenous pT53-DAT in KOR-mediated DAT regulation and the effect of KOR agonists on locomotor suppression and aversive behaviors using DAT-Ala53 knock-in mice expressing DAT carrying non-phosphorylatable Ala at position 53 replacing Thr. Acute systemic administration of KOR agonist, U69593 resulted in KOR antagonist-sensitive increases in DAT activity in parallel to increases in pT53-DAT, and DAT Vmax and surface expression in the ventral and dorsal striatum (containing the nucleus accumbens and caudate putamen respectively) of WT, but not DAT-Ala53 mice. KOR agonists produced conditioned place aversion (CPA) and locomotor suppression in WT but not DAT-Ala53 mice. However, both WT and DAT-Ala53 mice exhibited similar lithium chloride-induced CPA and morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). These findings provide the first evidence that locomotor suppression and aversive responses to KOR agonists manifest due to the modulation of DAT activity via DAT-T53 phosphorylation establishing a causal relationship of pT53-DAT in KOR-mediated DAT regulation and KOR agonist-induced adverse effects.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

In this study, a multilevel genome typing (MGT) scheme comprised of 8 levels of multilocus sequence typing schemes of increasing resolution was developed for S. aureus and used to analyse 50,481 publicly available genomes. Application of MGT to S. aureus epidemiology was showcased in three case studies. Firstly, the population structure of the globally disseminated sequence type ST8 were described by MGT2, which was compared with Spa typing. Secondly, MGT was used to characterise MLST ST8 - PFGE USA300 isolates that colonised multiple body sites of the same patient. Unique STs from multiple MGT levels were able to group isolates of the same patient, and the highest resolution MGT8 separated isolates within a patient that varied in predicted antimicrobial resistance. Lastly, MGT was used to describe the transmission of MLST ST239 - SCCmec III throughout a single hospital. MGT STs were able to describe both isolates that had spread between wards and also isolates that had colonised different reservoirs within a ward.

Numerous studies have explored how we perceive these cues, considering factors such as health, social signals and personality traits. However, most of this research involves observers facing a monitor and assessing facial stimuli presented directly in front of them. Real-life scenarios offer more diverse spatial dynamics, such as conversing with someone at a table or glancing back at a passerby. Thus, faces behind the observer might trigger heightened recognition, akin to reacting swiftly to a perceived threat. Herein, we demonstrate that facial expression recognition is influenced by spatial relationships, i.e., faces in front of versus behind the observer. Participants judged the expressions of faces appearing in front of or behind them in virtual space. The findings of three experiments reveal an enhanced level of recognition for faces behind the participant. Interestingly, this effect varies with emotional valence; anger is amplified merely by the presence of a face behind the observer, while happiness requires actively turning to the rear for enhancement to occur. These findings suggest a biological instinct for perceiving threats behind us, potentially influencing subsequent actions.

This innovative approach aims to decode the biological heterogeneity of cortical microstructures, contributing to the structural annotation of canine atlas as well as public human brain atlases. The study not only offers valuable resources but also presents a novel zonation approach to investigate the cellular organization pattern and topology of the cortex.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Epigenetic changes associated with obesity have been detected in blood, liver, pancreas, and adipose tissues. Previous work found that dietary glucose hyperabsorption occurs in some obese subjects, but detailed transcriptional or epigenomic features of the intestine associated with this phenotype are unknown. This study evaluated differentially expressed genes and relative chromatin accessibility in intestinal organoids established from donors classified as lean, obese, or obese hyperabsorptive by body mass index and glucose transport assays. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that obese hyperabsorptive subjects have significantly upregulated dietary nutrient absorption proteins and downregulated type I interferon targets. Chromatin accessibility and transcription factor footprinting suggested that enhanced binding of HNF4G promotes the obese hyperabsorption phenotype. Quantitative PCR assessment in a larger subject cohort suggested that intestinal epithelial expression of CUBN, GIP, and SLC2A5 have high correlation with hyperabsorption. The obese hyperabsorption phenotype is characterized by transcriptional changes that support increased nutrient uptake and may be driven by differentially accessible chromatin. Recognizing unique intestinal phenotypes in obesity provides new perspective in considering therapeutic targets and options to manage the disease.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

STAT5 activation is key to successful lactation making the mammary gland an ideal experimental system to investigate the impact of human missense mutations on mammary tissue homeostasis. Here, we investigated the effects of two human variants in the STAT5B SH2 domain, which convert tyrosine 665 to either phenylalanine (Y665F) or histidine (Y665H), both shown to activate STAT5B in cell culture. We ported these mutations into the mouse genome and found distinct and divergent functions. Homozygous Stat5bY665H mice failed to form functional mammary tissue, leading to lactation failure, with impaired alveolar development and greatly reduced expression of key differentiation genes. STAT5BY665H failed to recognize mammary enhancers and impeded STAT5A binding. In contrast, mice carrying the Stat5bY665F mutation exhibited abnormal precocious development, accompanied by an early activation of the mammary transcription program and the induction of otherwise silent genetic programs. Physiological adaptation was observed in Stat5bY665H mice as continued exposure to pregnancy hormones led to lactation. In summary, our findings highlight that human STAT5B variants can modulate their response to cytokines and thereby impact mammary homeostasis and lactation.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

However, despite the increasing use of large, consortium-based datasets to examine brain structure and function in neurotypical and neurodivergent populations, it is unclear whether age-related changes are consistent between datasets, and whether inconsistencies related to differences in sample characteristics, such as demographics and phenotypic features, exist. To address this, we built models of age-related changes of brain structure (cortical thickness and surface area; N=1,579) and function (resting-state functional connectivity strength; N=1,792) in two neurodiverse datasets: the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental network (POND) and the Healthy Brain Network (HBN). We examined whether deviations from these models differed between the datasets, and explored whether these deviations were associated with demographic and clinical variables. We found significant differences between the two datasets for measures of cortical surface area and functional connectivity strength throughout the brain. For cortical surface area, the patterns of differences were associated with intelligence, while for functional connectivity strength, positive associations were observed with head motion. Our findings highlight that patterns of age-related changes in the brain may be influenced by demographic and phenotypic characteristics, and thus future studies should consider these when examining or controlling forage effects in analyses.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Traditional MRE approaches assume mechanical isotropy. However, white matter is known to be anisotropic from aligned, myelinated axonal bundles, which can lead to uncertainty in mechanical property estimates in these areas when using isotropic MRE. Recent advances in anisotropic MRE now allow for estimation of shear and tensile anisotropy, along with substrate shear modulus, in white matter tracts. The objective of this study was to investigate age-related differences in anisotropic mechanical properties in human brain white matter tracts for the first time. Anisotropic mechanical properties in all tracts were found to be significantly lower in older adults compared to young adults, with average property differences ranging between 0.028-0.107 for shear anisotropy and between 0.139-0.347 for tensile anisotropy. Stiffness perpendicular to the axonal fiber direction was also significantly lower in older age, but only in certain tracts. When compared with fractional anisotropy measures from diffusion tensor imaging, we found that anisotropic MRE measures provided additional, complementary information in describing differences between the white matter integrity of young and older populations. Anisotropic MRE provides a new tool for studying white matter structural integrity in aging and neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

There's a need for a robust, scalable, and non-parametric functional clustering approach to capture interpretable dynamics. To address this challenge, we developed a model-based, statistical framework for unsupervised clustering of multiple time series datasets that exhibit nonlinear dynamics into an a-priori-unknown number of parameterized ensembles called Functional Encoding Units (FEUs). FEU outperforms existing techniques in accuracy and benchmark scores. Here, we apply this FEU formalism to single-unit recordings collected during social behaviors in rodents and primates and demonstrate its hypothesis-generating and testing capacities.

This study demonstrates, through stochastic simulations and mean-field theory, how IAVs harness a 'burnt-bridge' Brownian ratchet mechanism for directed, persistent translational motion. We show viruses occupy the optimal parameter range ('Goldilocks zone') for efficient mucous transport, possibly due to the evolutionary adaptation of enzyme kinetics.

Thus, identifying BCBM targets that reduce morbidity and mortality is critical. BCBM upregulate Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase (SCD), an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, suggesting a potential metabolic vulnerability of BCBM. In this study, we tested the effect of a brain-penetrant clinical-stage inhibitor of SCD (SCDi), on breast cancer cells and mouse models of BCBM. Lipidomics, qPCR, and western blot were used to study the in vitro effects of SCDi. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to explore the effects of SCDi on cancer and immune cells in a BCBM mouse model. Pharmacological inhibition of SCD markedly reshaped the lipidome of breast cancer cells and resulted in endoplasmic reticulum stress, DNA damage, loss of DNA damage repair, and cytotoxicity. Importantly, SCDi alone or combined with a PARP inhibitor prolonged the survival of BCBM-bearing mice. When tested in a syngeneic mouse model of BCBM, scRNAseq revealed that pharmacological inhibition of SCD enhanced antigen presentation by dendritic cells, was associated with a higher interferon signaling, increased the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, and decreased the proportion of exhausted T cells and regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of SCD decreased engagement of immunosuppressive pathways, including the PD-1:PD-L1/PD-L2 and PVR/TIGIT axes. These findings suggest that SCD inhibition could be an effective strategy to intrinsically reduce tumor growth and reprogram anti-tumor immunity in the brain microenvironment to treat BCBM.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Hdac1 and Hdac2 exhibit a broad tissue distribution and modulate various cellular processes across multiple tissues. In this study, we examined the role of Hdac1 and Hdac2 in AM homeostasis. By using Cd11c-Cre and Lyz2-Cre mouse strain to mediate deletion of Hdac1 and Hdac2 in AMs, we found simultaneous loss of both Hdac1 and Hdac2 caused profound defect of AMs. These HDACs deficient mice spontaneously developed pulmonary alveolar proteinosis syndrome and lost resistance to influenza virus. We further found up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins in AMs with HDACs defect, which caused apoptosis of AM. Taken together, these observations shed light on the roles of Hdac1 and Hdac2 as key epigenetic regulators in maintaining integrity of the AMs.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

Understanding interneuronal connectivity and how activity is regulated in the neuronal circuits is crucial for interpreting how the brain works. Multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) are particularly useful for studying the dynamics of neuronal network activity and their development as they allow for real-time, high-throughput measurements of neural activity. At present, the key challenge in the utilization of MEA data is the sheer complexity of the measured datasets. Available software offers semi-automated analysis for a fixed set of parameters that allow for the definition of spikes and bursts. However, this analysis remains time-consuming, user-biased, and limited by pre-defined parameters. Here, we present autoMEA, software for machine learning-based automated burst detection in MEA datasets. We exemplify autoMEA efficacy on neuronal network activity of primary hippocampal neurons from wild-type mice monitored using 24-well multi-well MEA plates. To validate and benchmark the software, we showcase its application using wild-type neuronal networks and two different neuronal networks modeling neurodevelopmental disorders to assess network phenotype detection. Detection of network characteristics typically reported in literature, such as synchronicity and rhythmicity, could be accurately detected compared to manual analysis using the autoMEA software. Additionally, autoMEA could detect reverberations, a more complex burst dynamic present in hippocampal cultures. Furthermore, autoMEA burst detection was sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in the synchronicity and rhythmicity of networks modeling neurodevelopmental disorders as well as detecting changes in their burst dynamics. Thus, we show that autoMEA reliably analyses neural networks measured with the multi-well MEA setup with the precision and accuracy compared to that of a human expert.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196831

The mechanism linking pathogenic variants in HMGCR with skeletal muscle dysfunction is unclear.

Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increase the synaptic and extracellular 5-HT level and are effective in treating depression. Treatment of two weeks or longer is often required for SSRIs to exert clinical benefits. The cellular mechanism underlying this delay was not fully understood. Here we show that the GABAergic inputs inhibit the spike firing of raphe 5-HT neurons; this GABAergic regulation was reduced by 5-HT, which was prevented by G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (Girk) channel inhibitor tertiapin-Q, indicating a contribution of 5-HT activation of Girk channels in GABAergic presynaptic axon terminals. Equally important, after 14 days of treatment of fluoxetine, a widely used SSRI type antidepressant, this 5-HT inhibition of GABAergic inputs was substantially downregulated. Furthermore, the chronic fluoxetine treatment substantially downregulated the 5-HT activation of the inhibitory Girk current in 5-HT neurons. Taken together, our results suggest that chronic fluoxetine administration, by blocking 5-HT reuptake and hence increasing the extracellular 5-HT level, can downregulate the function of 5-HT1B receptors on the GABAergic afferent axon terminals synapsing onto 5-HT neurons, allowing extrinsic, behaviorally important GABA neurons to more effectively influence 5-HT neurons; simultaneously, chronic fluoxetine treatment also downregulate somatic 5-HT autoreceptor-activated Girk channel-mediated hyperpolarization and decrease in input resistance and intrinsic excitability, rendering 5-HT neurons resistant to autoinhibition and leading to increased 5-HT neuron activity, potentially contributing to the antidepressant effect of SSRIs.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

This means that an individual does not seek to resolve the situation they are confronted with and consciously or unconsciously chooses to be passive. The Dorsal Raphe Nucleus (DRN) core could be at the root of the persistent action of the LH phenomenon and influences regions such as the striatum and amygdala. It is thought that the LH phenomenon could affect self-perception and it has been shown that the default mode network (DMN) is often associated with self-reflection during the resting state (RS) phase. It is therefore possible that LH influences both self-perception and the DMN. Based on previous studies, we investigated how LH affects participants. We used functional MRI (fMRI) to test this hypothesis. Participants were divided into two groups, subjected to solvable (control group), and solvable plus unsolvable (LH group) cognitive tasks. We also measured electrodermal signals, OCEAN (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) personality scores, variables related to the anagram resolution, and related these to LH. The study revealed significant differences in the RS contrast between the two groups, with the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) (an area of the DMN) being more connected to the DRN in the LH group than in the control group, and a portion of the Superior Temporal Gyrus being more connected to the PCC in the control group than in the LH group. These results suggest that LH may have a direct impact on the DMN and could lead to the start of long-term changes.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

Existing memories are thought to be updated through the process of reconsolidation, in which memory retrieval initiates destabilization and updating to incorporate new information. Memory updating is impaired in old age, yet little is known about the mechanisms that go awry. One potential mechanism is the repressive histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), which is a powerful negative regulator of memory formation that contributes to age-related impairments in memory formation. Here, we tested whether HDAC3 also contributes to age-related impairments in memory updating using the Objects in Updated Locations (OUL) paradigm. We show that blocking HDAC3 immediately after updating with the pharmacological inhibitor RGFP966 ameliorated age-related impairments in memory updating in 18-m.o. mice. Surprisingly, we found that post-update HDAC3 inhibition in young (3-m.o.) mice had no effect on memory updating but instead impaired memory for the original information, suggesting that the original and updated information may compete for expression at test and HDAC3 helps regulate which information is expressed. To test this idea, we next assessed whether HDAC3 inhibition would improve memory updating in young mice given a weak, subthreshold update. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that HDAC3 blockade strengthened the subthreshold update without impairing memory for the original information, enabling balanced expression of the original and updated information.

These signals originate in the retina and are relayed to the brain by more than 40 types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Despite a growing appreciation for the diversity of RGCs, how these diverse channels of light information are ultimately integrated by the ~50 retinorecipient brain targets to drive these light-evoked effects is a major open question. This gap in understanding primarily stems from a lack of genetic tools that specifically label, manipulate, or ablate specific RGC types. Here, we report the generation and characterization of a new mouse line (Opn4FlpO), in which FlpO is expressed from the Opn4 locus, to manipulate the melanopsin-expressing, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. We find that the Opn4FlpO line, when crossed to multiple reporters, drives expression that is confined to ipRGCs and primarily labels the M1-M3 subtypes. Labeled cells in this mouse line show the expected intrinsic, melanopsin-based light response and morphological features consistent with the M1-M3 subtypes. In alignment with the morphological and physiological findings, we see strong innervation of non-image forming brain targets by ipRGC axons, and weaker innervation of image forming targets in Opn4FlpO mice labeled using AAV-based and FlpO-reporter lines. Consistent with the FlpO insertion disrupting the endogenous Opn4 transcript, we find that Opn4FlpO/FlpO mice show deficits in the pupillary light reflex, demonstrating their utility for behavioral research in future experiments. Overall, the Opn4FlpO mouse line drives Flp-recombinase expression that is confined to ipRGCs and most effectively drives recombination in M1-M3 ipRGCs. This mouse line will be of broad use to those interested in manipulating ipRGCs through a Flp-based recombinase for intersectional studies or in combination with other, non-Opn4 Cre driver lines.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

Recent work modeling this behavior across species has established associations between aspects of this choice process and their contributions to altered decision-making in psychopathology. Here, we investigated the actions in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons of long intergenic non-coding RNA, LINC00473, known to induce stress resilience in a striking sex-dependent manner, but whose role in cognitive function is unknown. We characterized complex decision-making behavior in male and female mice longitudinally in our neuroeconomic foraging paradigm, Restaurant Row, following virus-mediated LINC00473 expression in mPFC neurons. On this task, mice foraged for their primary source of food among varying costs (delays) and subjective value (flavors) while on a limited time-budget during which decisions to accept and wait for rewards were separated into discrete stages of primary commitments and secondary re-evaluations. We discovered important differences in decision-making behavior between female and male mice. LINC00473 expression selectively influenced multiple features of re-evaluative choices, without affecting primary decisions, in female mice only. These behavioral effects included changing how mice (i) cached the value of the passage of time and (ii) weighed their history of economically disadvantageous choices. Both processes were uniquely linked to change-of-mind decisions and underlie the computational bases of distinct aspects of counterfactual thinking. These findings reveal a key bridge between a molecular driver of stress resilience and psychological mechanisms underlying sex-specific decision-making capabilities.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

Expectations (or 'internal models') are generated from prior knowledge and constantly updated based on sensory feedback. This optimized information integration ('predictive coding') results in a global behavioral advantage of anticipated action in the presence of uncertainty. Our goal was to probe the effect of phase entrainment of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm on visuomotor integration. Participants received transcranial alternating current stimulation over bilateral motor cortices (M1) while performing a visually-guided force adjustment task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Inter-hemispheric zero-phase entrainment resulted in effector-specific modulation of performance precision and effector-generic minimization of force signal complexity paralleled by BOLD activation changes in bilateral caudate and increased functional connectivity between the right M1 and contralateral putamen, inferior parietal, and medial temporal regions. While effector-specific changes in performance precision were associated with contralateral caudate and hippocampal activation decreases, only the global reduction in force signal complexity was associated with increased functional M1 connectivity with bilateral striatal regions. We propose that zero-phase synchronization represents a neural mode of optimized information integration related to internal model updating within the recursive perception-action continuum associated with predictive coding.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

Acute stress increased mRNA and protein levels of 5R2, but not 5R1, in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of male, but not female, rats. Targeted mPFC downregulation of 5R2, but not 5R1, markedly reduced the responsiveness of males, but not females, to both stressful and arousing stimuli. Similar sex differences were observed in 5R2 knockout rats. While 5R1 regulated AP synthesis under baseline conditions, 5R2 enabled this process in response to acute stress. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analyses revealed that 5R2 enabled stress-induced protein synthesis in pyramidal neurons and glia of the mPFC. These findings underscore the pivotal role of 5R2 in shaping sex-related differences in acute stress reactivity.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

Here, we conducted functional assessments and deep molecular phenotyping in the aging mouse to demonstrate that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) treatment attenuates body-wide age-related changes. Apart from improvements in physical and cognitive performance, the age-counteracting effects are prominently evident at multiple omic levels. These span the transcriptomes and DNA methylomes of various tissues, organs and circulating white blood cells, as well as the plasma metabolome. Importantly, the beneficial effects are specific to aged mice, not young adults, and are achieved with a low dosage of GLP-1RA which has a negligible impact on food consumption and body weight. The molecular rejuvenation effects exhibit organ-specific characteristics, which are generally heavily dependent on hypothalamic GLP-1R. We benchmarked the GLP-1RA age-counteracting effects against those of mTOR inhibition, a well-established anti-aging intervention, observing a strong resemblance across the two strategies.

Despite this diversity, common neuromechanical phenomena have been observed across biologically disparate undulators, due to common mechanics. For example, Neuromechanical Phase Lags (NPL), a phenomenon where waves of muscle contraction travel at different speeds than body bends, have been observed in fish, lamprey and lizards. Existing theoretical descriptions of this phenomenon implicate the role of physical body-environment interactions. However, systematic experimental variation of body-environment interactions and measurement of the corresponding phase lags has not been performed. Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans we measured muscle and body curvature dynamics simultaneously, performing calcium imaging in the body wall muscles while systematically varying the environmental rheology. A mechanical model demonstrates that the measured phase lags are controlled by the relative strength of elastic torques within the body and resistive forces within the medium. We further show that the phase lags correspond with a difference in the wavenumber of the muscle activity and curvature patterns. Hence, the environmental forces that create NPL also act as a filter that shapes and modulates the gait commanded by the nervous system. Beyond nematodes, the simplicity of our model further suggests that tuning body elasticity may serve as a general means of modulating the degree of mechanical control in other undulators.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

The conventional view is that their pore is a large passive conduit through which both ions and molecules diffuse in a similar manner. In stark contrast to this notion, we demonstrate that the permeation of ions and of molecules in connexin hemichannels can be uncoupled and differentially regulated. We find that human connexin mutations that produce pathologies and were previously thought to be loss-of-function mutations due to the lack of ionic currents are still capable of mediating the passive transport of molecules with kinetics close to those of wild-type channels. This molecular transport displays saturability in the micromolar range, selectivity, and competitive inhibition, properties that are tuned by specific interactions between the permeating molecules and the N-terminal domain that lies within the pore -- a general feature of large-pore channels. We propose that connexin hemichannels and, likely, other large-pore channels, are hybrid channel/transporter-like proteins that might switch between these two modes to promote selective ion conduction or autocrine/paracrine molecular signaling in health and disease processes.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

Since the pond water is rich in sulphate, these anaerobic conditions eventually lead to the production of sulphide. Sulphides are toxic and even lethal to the shrimp that live on the pond sediment, but physicochemical and microbial reactions that occur during the accumulation of organic waste and the subsequent formation of sulphide in shrimp pond sediments remain unclear. Molybdate treatment is a promising strategy to inhibit sulphate reduction, thus, preventing sulphide accumulation. We used an experimental shrimp pond model to simulate the organic waste accumulation and sulphide formation during the final 61 days of a full shrimp growth cycle. Sodium molybdate (5 and 25 mg/L Na2MoO4.2H2O) was applied as a preventive strategy to control sulphide production before oxygen depletion. Molybdate addition partially mitigated H2S production in the sediment, and delayed its transfer to the bulk liquid by pushing the higher sulphide concentration zone towards deeper sediment layers. Molybdate treatment at 25 mg/L significantly impacted the overall microbial community composition and treated samples (5 and 25 mg/L molybdate) had about 50% higher relative abundance of sulphate reducing bacteria than the control (no molybdate) treatment. In conclusion, molybdate has the potential to work as mitigation strategy against sulphide accumulation in the sediment during shrimp growth by directly steering the microbial community in a shrimp pond system.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

However, achieving precise cell-type-specific labeling of these proteins has been challenging in vivo. A notable solution to this challenge is the self-complementing split green fluorescent protein (GFP1-10/11) system. In this paper, we present a detailed protocol for labeling endogenous proteins in a cell-type-specific manner using the GFP1-10/11 system in fruit flies. This approach depends on the automatic reconstitution of the GFP1-10 and GFP11 fragments, creating a fluorescence signal. We insert the GFP11 fragment into a specific genomic locus while expressing its counterpart, GFP1-10, through an available Gal4 driver line. The unique aspect of this system is that neither GFP1-10 nor GFP11 alone emits fluorescence, enabling the precise detection of protein localization only in Gal4-positive cells. We illustrate this technique using the adhesion molecule gene teneurin-m (Ten-m) as a model, highlighting the generation and validation of GFP11 protein trap lines via Minos-mediated integration cassette (MiMIC) insertion. Furthermore, we demonstrate the cell-type-specific labeling of Ten-m proteins in the larval brains of fruit flies.

Groups of female Wistar rats underwent twice daily 30-minute sessions of heroin or propylene glycol (control) vapor inhalation from postnatal days (PND) 36-45 or PND 85-94, respectively. Nociception was assessed after vapor inhalation sessions and forty days later, for the Adolescent-Exposed and Adult-Exposed groups. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed with an elevated plus-maze (EPM) and spatial learning was assessed with a Barnes maze. Acute effects of naloxone (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) and heroin (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) on thermal nociception were determined on PND 140/189 and PND 149/198, respectively. Repeated heroin vapor inhalation produced anti-nociceptive tolerance across sessions in both adolescent and adult rats, with the adolescents exhibiting more complete tolerance. Heroin vapor inhalation produced anxiolytic effects, regardless of age of exposure. There were no effects of heroin on spatial learning. Naloxone produced acute hyperalgesia in all but the Adolescent-Exposed heroin group, and heroin anti-nociception was blunted in both heroin-exposed groups at the highest heroin dose. Repeated heroin vapor inhalation can produce lasting effects on nociception and anxiety-like behavior that persist for months after the exposure. Importantly, these findings suggest that adolescent exposure to heroin vapor produces specific effects on nociception that are not observed when exposure occurs in adulthood.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

We found that mice undergoing alternate-day fasting (ADF) respond profoundly differently to a following fasting bout compared to mice first experiencing fasting. Hundreds of genes enabling ketogenesis are sensitized (induced more strongly by fasting following ADF). Liver enhancers regulating these genes are also sensitized and harbor increased binding of PPAR alpha, the main ketogenic transcription factor. ADF leads to augmented ketogenesis compared to a single fasting bout in wild-type, but not hepatocyte-specific PPAR alpha-deficient mice.

To explore the evolution of Iron Age Italic populations and the genetic impact of Romanization, we focused on the Picenes, one of the most fascinating pre-Roman civilizations, who flourished on the Middle Adriatic side of Central Italy between the 9th and the 3rd century BCE, until the Roman colonization.

ResultsWe analyzed more than 50 samples, spanning more than 1,000 years of history from the Iron Age to Late Antiquity. Despite cultural diversity, our analysis reveals no major differences between the Picenes and other coeval populations, suggesting a shared genetic history of the Central Italian Iron Age ethnic groups. Nevertheless, a slight genetic differentiation between populations along the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian coasts can be observed, possibly due to genetic contacts between populations residing on the Italian and Balkan shores of the Adriatic Sea. Additionally, we found several individuals with ancestries deviating from their general population. Lastly, In the Late Antiquity period, the genetic landscape of the Middle Adriatic region drastically changed, indicating a relevant influx from the Near East.

ConclusionsOur findings, consistently with archeological hypotheses, suggest genetic interactions across the Adriatic Sea during the Bronze/Iron Age and a high level of individual mobility typical of cosmopolitan societies. Finally, we highlighted the role of the Roman Empire in shaping genetic and phenotypic changes that greatly impacted the Italian peninsula.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

These signals change the shape and developmental identity of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), causing it to form flowers and inflorescences rather than leaves. How the changes in SAM shape and identity are coordinated is poorly understood. Using genetics, confocal microscopy and RNA sequencing, we show that reciprocal repression of the APETALA2 (AP2) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) transcription factors in the SAM is crucial in coupling these processes. During vegetative development, AP2 represses SOC1 transcription to delay floral transition. Later, SOC1 is activated during floral transition in response to environmental cues and represses AP2 transcription. However, during floral transition and prior to its stable repression by SOC1, AP2 rapidly promotes an increase in the size, and changes in the morphology, of the SAM. Thus, direct reciprocal repression of AP2 and SOC1 couples floral transition and changes in SAM morphology, which initiate inflorescence development.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

Having evolved for millions of years in the absence of cane toads or other bufotoxin-secreting organisms, many of the Australia's native predators that include cane toads in their diet suffered large population declines following cane toad invasion to their habitat. One marsupial species, the northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus), is now classified as endangered (IUCN Red List) largely due to bufotoxin ingestion. This study aimed to introduce bufotoxin resistance into a marsupial cell line by editing part of the ATP1A1 gene encoding the extracellular H1-H2 domain - the binding target of bufotoxin. To this end, CRISPR prime editing was used to replace the part of the wildtype ATP1A1 gene encoding the H1-H2 domain in fibroblasts of a related marsupial model, the fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata), with modifications known to be associated with bufotoxin resistance. The genetically modified cell population showed a >45-fold increase in resistance to bufalin (an active component of bufotoxin) compared to wild type. This study provides a proof of concept towards engineering genetic resistance in the northern quoll to halt or even reverse its current population decline.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

Here, we investigate the effects of surface charge point mutations both proximal and distal to the active site of the mesophilic PET-degrading enzyme from Ideonella sakaienses (IsPETase) and an engineered thermostable variant with superior activity, STAR PETase. The vicinal K95A mutation significantly inhibited IsPETase activity on mechanically processed PET powder. Conversely, this mutation significantly increased hydrolysis of PET powder in the STAR PETase background. Activity of both enzymes on PET film was inhibited by the K95A mutation, highlighting complex interplay between mutation context and substrate morphology. Further installing the distal R132N and R280A surface charge mutations potentiated activity of STAR on all substrates tested. This variant afforded 100% degradation of bottle-grade PET powder in 3 days at 40degC reaction temperature, a 3-fold improvement over IsPETase. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal modulation of active site flexibility in mutants, which differentially impacts both hydrolysis of morphologically distinct PET substrates and the concentration-dependent inhibition phenomenon observed for PETase.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

These gels typically offer viscoelasticity and self-healing properties that more closely mimic in vivo tissue mechanics than traditional, predominantly elastic, covalent crosslinked hydrogels. Despite their promise, the effects of varying crosslinker architecture, such as side chain versus telechelic crosslinks, on the viscoelastic properties of DCC hydrogels have not been thoroughly investigated. This study introduces hydrazone-based alginate hydrogels and examines how side-chain and telechelic crosslinker architectures impact hydrogel viscoelasticity and stiffness. In side-chain crosslinked gels, higher polymer concentrations, enhances stiffness and decelerates stress relaxation, while an off-stoichiometric hydrazine-to-aldehyde ratio leads to reduced stiffness and shorter relaxation time. In telechelic crosslinked gels, maximal stiffness and stress relaxation occurs at intermediate crosslinker concentrations for both linear and star crosslinkers, with higher crosslinker valency further increasing stiffness and decreasing relaxation rates. Our result suggested different ranges of stiffness and stress relaxation are accessible with the different crosslinker architectures, with side-chain crosslinking leading to gels with slower stress relaxation times relative to the other architectures, and star crosslinked gels providing increased stiffness and slower stress relaxation relative to linear crosslinked gels. The mechanical properties of hydrogels with star crosslinking are more robust to changes induced by competing chemical reactions compared to linear crosslinking. Our research underscores the pivotal role of crosslinker architecture in defining hydrogel stiffness and viscoelasticity, providing crucial insights for the design of DCC hydrogels with tailored mechanical properties for specific biomedical applications.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

The specific pattern of histone PTMs across the gene is critical for turning on/off the expression of the corresponding gene. During DNA replication in mitotic cells, the histone PTMs are dislodged from the mother chromatid, ahead of the replication fork, and distributed uniformly at random among the daughter chromatids. Building on our previous work which modelled the inheritance of a single PTM, the current work considers the effect of an additional antagonistic PTM. We model the joint PTM sequence as a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and the DNA replication fork as a noisy communication channel. The optimal Bayesian sequence estimator is employed at the daughter chromatids to reconstruct the mother. A high-fidelity reconstruction, aided by the enzyme machinery, is shown to be possible in the presence of epigenetic memory. The structural properties derived for the optimal estimator are then verified through simulations, which show the improvement in fidelity of inheritance in the presence of antagonism. This is further validated through recent experimental data.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

Our findings indicate that state-of-the-art methods AlphaMissense and VARITY demonstrate commendable performance despite generally underperforming compared to cancer-specific methods. This is notable considering that these methods do not explicitly incorporate cancer-specific information in their training and have made concerted efforts to prevent data leakage from the human-curated training and test sets. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that a significant limitation of using pathogenicity predictors for cancer arises from their inability to detect cancer potential driver mutations specific for a particular cancer type.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

Traditional reporting of the insulitis progression is based on cumulative, donor-averaged values of leucocyte density in the vicinity of pancreatic islets, that hinders intra- and inter-islet heterogeneity of disease progression. Here, we aimed to understand why insulitis is non-uniform, often with peri-insulitis lesions formed on one side of an islet. To achieve this, we demonstrated applicability of network theory in detangling intra-islet multi-cellular interactions during insulitis. Specifically, we asked the question 'what is unique about regions of the islet which interact with immune cells first'. This study utilized the non-obese diabetic mouse model of type one diabetes and examined the interplay among -, {beta}-, T-cells, myeloid cells, and macrophages in pancreatic islets during the progression of insulitis. Disease evolution was tracked based on T/{beta} cell ratio in individual islets. In the early stage, we found that immune cells are preferentially interacting with -cell-rich regions of an islet. At the islet periphery -linked {beta}-cells were found to be targeted significantly more compared to those without -cell neighbors. Additionally, network analysis revealed increased T-myeloid, and T-macrophage interactions with all {beta}-cells.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

However, the application of chain elongating bacteria for synthesizing products beyond C6-C8 medium-chain fatty acids has not been evaluated. In this study, we assess the feasibility of expanding the product spectrum of chain elongating bacteria to C9-C12 fatty acids, along with the synthesis of C6 fatty alcohols, dicarboxylic acids, diols, and methyl ketones. We propose several metabolic engineering strategies to accomplish these conversions in chain elongating bacteria and utilize constraint-based metabolic modelling to predict pathway stoichiometries, assess thermodynamic feasibility, and estimate ATP and product yields. We also evaluate how producing alternative products impacts the growth rate of chain elongating bacteria via resource allocation modelling, revealing a trade-off between product carbon length and class versus cell growth rate. Together, these results highlight the potential for using chain elongating bacteria as a platform for diverse oleochemical biomanufacturing and offer a starting point for guiding future metabolic engineering efforts aimed at expanding their product range.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

Since the breeding colorations of males are widely considered to attract females, most previous studies on breeding coloration have mostly focused on conspicuous breeding coloration, which may have prevented the discovery of possible functions other than appealing. Here, based on a speculation that such breeding coloration might occur in species with weak sexual selection in males, we focused on Apogoninae whose sex role is considered to be reversed due to their characteristic parental behavior, paternal mouthbrooding. Through detailed morphological observations, we found that males exhibit non-conspicuous white structures, consisting of iridophores, in the lower jaw during the breeding season. Artificial implantation of eggs inside the mouth in both sexes showed that the white structure in the lower jaws, which specifically exists in males, drastically reduces the visibility of eggs during mouthbrooding. This suggested that this coloration may serve to conceal the conspicuous coloration of eggs during mouthbrooding. In addition, in vivo and in vitro hormone treatment experiments revealed that iridophore development in the lower jaw is induced by androgen through the Alkal-Ltk pathway. These results suggest that androgen-dependent breeding colorations in males, which have been considered to attract females, may serve the opposite function in these species, ""inconspicuous coloration"", to increase the fitness of their specialized behavior, mouthbrooding.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196832

We evaluated the clinical validity of a brief, patient-administered hereditary cancer risk assessment digital tool programmed to assess if patients meet criteria for germline genetic testing, based on personal and family history, and in line with national guidelines. Methods: We applied the tool to cases seen in a nationwide telehealth genetic counseling practice. Validity of the tool was evaluated by comparing the tool's assessment to that of the genetic counselor who saw the patient. Patients' histories were extracted from genetic counselor-collected pedigrees and input into the tool by the research team to model how a patient would complete the tool. We also validated the tool's assessment of which specific aspects of the personal and family history met criteria for genetic testing. Results: Of the 152 cases (80% ((121/152)) female, mean age 52.3), 56% (85/152) had a personal history of cancer and 66% (99/152) met genetic testing criteria. The tool and genetic counselor agreed in 96% (146/152) of cases. Most disagreements (4/6; 67%) occurred because the GC's assessment relied on details the tool was not programmed to collect since patients typically don't have access to the relevant information (pathology details, risk models). We also found complete agreement between the tool and research team on which specific aspects of the patient's history met criteria for genetic testing.

Amongst individuals without cancer, worse SDOH was associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality only when adjusted for demographics, but not when further adjusted for comorbidities and risk factors.

We sought to estimate the prevalence and factors contributing to menstrual-related absenteeism across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: We analysed cross-sectional data from 47 nationally representative Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys from 2017-2023 comprising 3,193,042 individuals from 555,869 households across 44 countries. The outcome of interest was menstrual-related absenteeism from work, school, or social activities during the respondents last menstrual period. Independent factors included womens age, household wealth index, use of menstrual materials (e.g. pads, tampons, or cloth), availability of a private place to wash at home during menstruation, and contraceptive use (hormonal and other). Univariable and multivariable associations between each factor and menstrual-related absenteeism were obtained using log binomial models. Prevalences and associations were pooled by geographical region and across all surveys using a random effects meta-analysis. Findings: We included 673,380 women and girls aged 15-49 years in this analysis. The pooled global prevalence of menstrual-related absenteeism was 15.0% [95% CI: 12.7-17.3], with the highest prevalence in South Asia (19.7% [11.6-27.8]) and West and Central Africa (18.5% [13.5-23.5]). After pooling data across surveys, girls aged 15-19 years were found to endure a higher prevalence of menstrual-related absenteeism compared to older age-groups. There was no association between menstrual-related absenteeism and household wealth or the use of menstrual materials. In contrast, having a private place to wash at home was associated with an increased prevalence of menstrual-related absenteeism (global adjusted Prevalence Ratio [PR]: 1.25 [1.05-1.48]). Menstrual-related absenteeism was less prevalent in women and girls using contraception (global adjusted PR any contraception vs no contraception: 0.86 [0.82-0.90]), including those using hormonal contraception (global adjusted PR hormonal contraception vs non-hormonal or no contraception: 0.85 [0.78-0.93]). Interpretation: Menstrual-related absenteeism is prevalent, especially in Asia and Africa, and particularly in adolescent girls. The age-independent protective effect of hormonal contraception suggests symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding or pain drive absenteeism. Improving access to private wash facilities outside the home and medical solutions for menstrual symptoms may reduce menstrual-related absenteeism, but further prospective research is urgently needed.

METHODS: This study analyzed data from participants across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum from the ALFA and ADNI studies. We exploited compositional data analysis to examine relative brain volumetric variations that (i) differentiate cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals, defined as amyloid-negative (A-) based on CSF profiling, from those at different AD stages, and (ii) associated with increased genetic susceptibility to AD, assessed using polygenic risk scores. RESULTS: Distinct brain signatures differentiated CU A- individuals from amyloid-positive MCI and AD. Moreover, disease stage-specific signatures were associated with higher genetic risk of AD. DISCUSSION: The findings underscore the complex interplay between genetics and disease stages in shaping brain structure, which could inform targeted preventive strategies and interventions in preclinical AD.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196832

However, the validity and reliability of digital biomarkers as measures of cognitive function must first be determined. The Ignite computerised cognitive app contains several iPad-based measures of executive function, social cognition, and other domains known to be affected in FTD. Here we describe the normative properties of the Ignite tests, evaluate the associations with gold-standard neuropsychology tests, and investigate test-retest reliability through two healthy controls studies. Over 2,000 cognitively normal adults aged 20-80 years (mean=55.2, standard deviation=15.8) were recruited to complete the Ignite app through a remote data collection study. Significant associations were found between age and performance on several Ignite measures of processing speed (r=0.42 to 0.56, p<0.001) and executive function (r=0.43 to 0.62, p<0.001), suggesting the tests are sensitive to cognitive decline observed in normal ageing. A separate cohort of 98 healthy controls were recruited to an observational study (mean age=51.2 years, standard deviation=17.3), completing Ignite at two timepoints (7 days apart), a gold-standard pen and paper neuropsychology battery of corresponding tests, and a user experience questionnaire (10-items). The Ignite tests demonstrated moderate to excellent test-retest reliability (ICCs=0.54 to 0.92) and significantly correlated with their pen and paper counterparts (r=0.25 to 0.72, p<0.05). The majority of participants (>90%) also rated the app favourably, stating it was enjoyable and easy to complete unsupervised. These findings suggest the Ignite tests are valid measures of cognitive processes, capture a stable picture of performance over time and are well accepted in healthy controls, speaking to the feasibility of administering the app remotely. Therefore, the results have important implications for the utility of Ignite as a cognitive endpoint in upcoming FTD clinical trials.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196832

No specific therapeutic is available for this condition. Argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) is a key enzyme in the urea cycle that converts citrulline and aspartic acid to argininosuccinate. Here, we found that CVB3 and its capsid protein VP2 inhibit the autophagic degradation of ASS1 and that CVB3 consumes citrulline to upregulate ASS1, triggers urea cycle metabolic reprogramming, then activates macrophages to develop pro-inflammatory polarization, thereby promoting the occurrence and development of VMC. Conversely, citrulline supplementation to prevent depletion can downregulate ASS1, rescue macrophage polarization, and alleviate the pathogenicity of VMC. These findings provide a new perspective on the occurrence and development of VMC, revealing ASS1 as a potential new target for the treatment of this disease.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Furthermore, to evaluate if enrollment in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) significantly affects diet quality and interacts with the relationship between cardioprotective diet adherence and mortality. Design, Setting, Participants: A retrospective cohort study using cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) including study cycles 1999-2018 and longitudinal mortality data from the National Death Index (NDI). NHANES is a weighted population-based study that represents the non-institutionalized civilian population in the United States. Adults age [&ge;]18 years with complete food security, dietary recall, and mortality data were included. Exposures: Adherence to DASH or Mediterranean diet and food security status. Main outcomes and measures: All-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) related mortality. Results: 51,193 eligible adults were analyzed, representing a weighted population size of 207.1 (200.1 - 214.2) million. Participants with FI were more likely to be younger, female, Black or Hispanic, smokers, obese, lower educational attainment, lower income, and less physically active. FI was a significant predictor of all-cause mortality (p=0.006) but not CVD mortality (p=0.263). After adjustment for multiple covariates and food security status, DASH diet non-adherence significantly predicted all-cause mortality in those with hypertension (p=0.038) and coronary heart disease (CHD) (p=0.001), and CVD mortality in CHD (p=0.041). Mediterranean diet non-adherence significantly predicted all-cause mortality across the entire study population (p=0.005). There was no significant interaction effect between adherence to cardioprotective diets and SNAP enrollment in prediction of all-cause or CVD mortality. Food security was a significant predictor of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (p=0.001). SNAP enrollment was associated with improved adherence to the DASH diet among food insecure individuals (p=0.024), and the Mediterranean diet among food secure individuals (p=0.001). Conclusions and relevance: The relationship between FI and mortality is associated with diet quality. Expanding SNAP eligibility to include food security status may have positive effects on public health.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196833

Here, we investigate the entropy of time-varying functional connectivity (TVFC) patterns from resting-state fMRI (rfMRI) as potential biomarker for cognitive performance in PSDs. By combining our results with multimodal reference data, we hope to generate new insights into the mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction in PSDs. We hypothesized that low-entropy TVFC patterns (LEN) would be more behaviorally informative than high-entropy TVFC patterns (HEN), especially for tasks that require extensive integration across diverse cognitive subdomains. Methods: rfMRI and behavioral data from 97 patients in the early phases of psychosis and 53 controls were analyzed. Positron-Emission Tomography (PET) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were taken from a public repository (Hansen et al., 2022). Multivariate analyses were conducted to examine relationships between TVFC patterns at multiple spatial scales and cognitive performance in patients. Results: Compared to HEN, LEN explained significantly more cognitive variance on average in PSD patients, driven by superior encoding of information on psychometrically more integrated tasks. HEN better captured information in specific subdomains of executive functioning. Nodal HEN-LEN transitions were spatially aligned with neurobiological gradients reflecting monoaminergic transporter densities and MEG beta power. Exploratory analyses revealed a close statistical relationship between LEN and positive PSD symptoms. Conclusion: Our entropy-based analysis of TVFC patterns dissociates distinct aspects of cognitive performance in PSDs. By linking topographies of neurotransmission and oscillatory dynamics with cognitive symptoms, it enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in PSDs.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196833

The OM is thus critical for fitness and antibiotic resistance. Building this bilayer require proper assembly of lipopolysaccharides, proteins, and phospholipids, yet how the intricate balance of these components is achieved to ensure a stable OM is not well understood. One system long known to be important for OM stability is the Tol-Pal complex, which has recently been implicated in the maintenance of OM lipid homeostasis, possibly via retrograde phospholipid transport. However, assignment of its primary function has been challenging, owing to septal localization of Tol-Pal and its associated role(s) during cell division. Here, we uncouple the function of the Tol-Pal complex in OM lipid homeostasis from its impact on cell division in Escherichia coli, by preventing recruitment to mid-cell. The Tol-Pal complex comprises the inner membrane TolQRA and OM TolB-Pal subcomplexes. We engineer a TolA variant that forms a chimeric complex with ExbBD, which are homologous to TolQR, resulting in loss of septal enrichment of Tol-Pal. We demonstrate that this peripherally-localized complex cannot rescue division defects in strains lacking TolQRA, but restores OM integrity and barrier. Importantly, this chimeric complex is fully capable of maintaining lipid balance in the OM, independent of the role of Tol-Pal in cell division. Our work establishes the primary function of the Tol-Pal complex in OM lipid homeostasis, and provides novel insights on how this conserved system also contributes to cell division.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Soluble oligomeric forms of A{beta} shift synaptic plasticity induction threshold leading to memory deficits in male and female mice in early amyloidosis models. Some protein changes underlying those deficits have been previously studied, but the spatial distribution within the hippocampus, as well as the potential sex differences, remain unknown. Since each hippocampal region (dorsal vs. ventral) has clearly distinct functionality and connectivity, we postulated that some protein changes may be unique to each and might also be sex dependent. Methods: An innovative spatial proteomics study was performed to map whole hippocampal proteome distribution using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry, which allows protein detection with spatial resolution directly on tissue sections. Brains from sixteen adult male and female mice intracerebroventricularly injected with A{beta}1-42 oligomers or vehicle were sectioned. MALDI imaging was performed using a RapifleXTM MALDI TissuetyperTM TOF/TOF mass spectrometer followed by protein identification by traditional tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) directly on the tissue. To precisely delineate both dorsal and ventral hippocampus, a Nissl staining was performed on succeeding tissue sections. Results: Of the 234 detected peptides, significant differences in expression levels were found in 34 proteins, due to treatment, sex, or hippocampal location. Moreover, a significant protein-protein interaction (PPI) was observed, showing a relationship to long-term potentiation (LTP), the functional basis of memory. Accordingly, 14 proteins related to synaptic plasticity and/or AD were selected to further study. Results showed many of the altered protein to modulate glycogen synthase kinase-3{beta} (GSK-3{beta}), a protein widely involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity induction threshold. In fact, hippocampal GSK-3{beta} was found overactivated suggesting a facilitated long-term depression (LTD) instead of LTP in AD models. Conclusions: This study offers for the first time the specific protein changes in dorsal/ventral hippocampus in both male and female mice, that modulate GSK-3 {beta} activity, providing new insight in the pathogenesis of early AD and valuable potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapeutic targets.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Malformations can originate from numerous genetic or non-genetic factors but in most cases the underlying causes are unknown. Genetic disruption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) de novo synthesis drives the formation of multiple congenital malformations, collectively termed Congenital NAD Deficiency Disorder (CNDD), highlighting the necessity of this pathway during embryogenesis. Previous work in mice shows that NAD deficiency perturbs embryonic development specifically during a critical period when organs are forming. While NAD de novo synthesis is predominantly active in the liver postnatally, the site of activity prior to and during organogenesis is unknown. Here, we used a mouse model of human CNDD and applied gene expression, enzyme activity and metabolic analyses to assess pathway functionality in the embryonic liver and extraembryonic tissues. We found that the extra-embryonic visceral yolk sac endoderm exclusively performs NAD de novo synthesis during early organogenesis before the embryonic liver takes over this function. Furthermore, under CNDD-inducing conditions, mouse visceral yolk sacs had reduced NAD levels and altered NAD-related metabolic profiles which affected embryo metabolism. Expression of requisite genes for NAD de novo synthesis is conserved in the equivalent yolk sac cell type in humans. Our findings show that visceral yolk sac-mediated NAD de novo synthesis activity is essential for mouse embryonic development and perturbation of this pathway results in CNDD. Given the functional homology between mouse and human yolk sacs, our data improve the understanding of human congenital malformation causation.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

The isotopic signatures of eelgrass and phytoplankton food webs explain much of the variation in {delta}13C, {delta}15N and {delta}34S values in marine vertebrate remains recovered from prehistoric coastal sites in Denmark. Isotope data from human and dog remains reflect the overwhelming importance of the eelgrass biotope to the fisher-hunter-gatherer (FHG) subsistence during the Late Mesolithic Erteb&oslashlle epoch (~7400-5800 cal BP). By recognising eelgrass and pelagic resources as isotopically distinct, we obtain more accurate diet reconstructions and dietary 14C reservoir effect corrections for Erteb&oslashlle individuals. Longstanding research issues, including technology, palaeodemography, and the resilience and sustainability of the FHG economy need to be reassessed in view of the isotopic signature and productivity of the eelgrass biotope in Danish waters. Eelgrass productivity is also pertinent to comparisons between Erteb&oslashlle and Neolithic economies in Denmark, and between FHG adaptations in Denmark and neighbouring regions, and may be key to understanding the much-discussed delay in the transition to farming.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Previous studies exploring the splicing landscape of human tissues have shown that AS has contributed to human biology, especially in disease progression and the immune response. Nonetheless, this phenomenon remains poorly characterised across human populations, and it is unclear how genetic and environmental variation contribute to alternative splicing. Here, we examine a set of 115 Indonesian samples from three traditional island populations spanning the genetic ancestry cline that characterizes Island Southeast Asia. We conduct a global AS analysis between islands to ascertain the degree of functionally significant AS events and their consequences. Using a hierarchical event-based statistical model, we detected over 1,000 significant differential AS events across all comparisons. Additionally, we identify over 6,000 genetic variants associated with changes in splicing (splicing quantitative trait loci; sQTLs), some of which are driven by Papuan-like genetic ancestry, and only show partial overlap with other publicly available sQTL datasets derived from other populations. Computational predictions of RNA binding activity revealed that a fraction of these sQTLs directly modulate the binding propensity of proteins involved in the splicing regulation of immune genes. Overall, these results contribute towards elucidating the role of genetic variation in shaping gene regulation in one of the most diverse regions in the world.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

The dependence on serial sections is attributed to technological limitations of MTI panel size or incompatible multi-assay protocols. Although image registration can align serially sectioned MTIs, integration at the single-cell level poses a challenge due to inherent biological heterogeneity. Existing computational methods overlook both cell population heterogeneity across modalities and spatial information, which are critical for effectively completing this task. To address this problem, we first use Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate the overlap between serial 5m-thick sections. We then introduce COEXIST, a novel algorithm that synergistically combines shared molecular profiles with spatial information to seamlessly integrate serial sections at the single-cell level. We demonstrate COEXIST necessity and performance across several applications. These include combining MTI panels for improved spatial single-cell profiling, rectification of miscalled cell phenotypes using a single MTI panel, and the comparison of MTI platforms at single-cell resolution. COEXIST not only elevates MTI platform validation but also overcomes the constraints of MTIs panel size and the limitation of full nuclei on a single slide, capturing more intact nuclei in consecutive sections and thus enabling deeper profiling of cell lineages and functional states.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

The sleep and circadian disruptions are recapitulated in animal models, and these models provide the opportunity to evaluate whether circadian interventions can be effective countermeasures for neurodegenerative disease. Time restricted feeding (TRF) interventions successfully improve activity rhythms, sleep behavior and motor performance in mouse models of HD. Seeking to determine if these benefits of scheduled feeding extend to physiological measures of sleep, electroencephalography (EEG) was used to measure sleep/wake states and polysomnographic patterns in adult mice (six mo-old) under TRF and ad lib feeding (ALF). With each diet, both male and female wild-type (WT) and bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic (BACHD) mice were evaluated. Our findings show that male, but not female, BACHD mice exhibited significant changes in the temporal patterning of wake and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The TRF intervention reduced the inappropriate early morning activity by increasing NREM sleep in the male BACHD mice. In addition, the scheduled feeding reduced sleep fragmentation (# bouts) in the male BACHD mice. The phase of the rhythm in rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep was significantly altered by the scheduled feeding. The treatment did impact the power spectral curves during the day in male but not female mice. Sleep homeostasis, as measured by the response to six hours of gentle handling, was not altered by the diet. Thus, TRF improves the temporal patterning and fragmentation of NREM sleep without impacting sleep homeostasis. This work adds critical support to the view that sleep is a modifiable risk factor in neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

The reasons for this lack of invasiveness remain unclear. Here, we present phylogenetic, epidemiological and historical evidence to explain how European vineyards escaped Xf. Using Bayesian temporal reconstruction, we show that the export of American grapevines to France as rootstocks to combat phylloxera ([~]1872-1895) preceded the spread of the Xf grapevine lineage in the US. In the dated tree, the time of the most recent common ancestor places the introduction of Xf into California around 1875, which agrees with the emergence of the main PD outbreak and the onset of its expansion into the southeastern US around 1895. We also show that between 1870 and 1990, climatic conditions in continental Europe were mostly below the threshold for PD epidemics. This lack of spatiotemporal concurrence between factors that could facilitate the establishment of the Xf grapevine lineage would explain the historical absence of PD in continental Europe. However, our model indicates that there has been an inadvertent expansion of risk in southern European vineyards since the 1990s, which is accelerating with global warming. Our temporal approach identifies the biogeographic conditions that have so far prevented PD, and gives continuity to predictions of increased risk in important southern European wine-producing areas under a forthcoming scenario of +2 and +3{degrees}C temperature increases.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

However, we and others have shown that LNPs induce severe inflammation, and massively aggravate pre-existing inflammation. Here, using structure-function screening of lipids and analyses of signaling pathways, we elucidate the mechanisms of LNP-associated inflammation and demonstrate solutions. We show that LNPs hallmark feature, endosomal escape, which is necessary for RNA expression, also directly triggers inflammation by causing endosomal membrane damage. Large, irreparable, endosomal holes are recognized by cytosolic proteins called galectins, which bind to sugars on the inner endosomal membrane and then regulate downstream inflammation. We find that inhibition of galectins abrogates LNP-associated inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo. We show that rapidly biodegradable ionizable lipids can preferentially create endosomal holes that are smaller in size and reparable by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway. Ionizable lipids producing such ESCRT-recruiting endosomal holes can produce high expression from cargo mRNA with minimal inflammation. Finally, we show that both routes to non-inflammatory LNPs, either galectin inhibition or ESCRT-recruiting ionizable lipids, are compatible with therapeutic mRNAs that ameliorate inflammation in disease models. LNPs without galectin inhibition or biodegradable ionizable lipids lead to severe exacerbation of inflammation in these models. In summary, endosomal escape induces endosomal membrane damage that can lead to inflammation. However, the inflammation can be controlled by inhibiting galectins (large hole detectors) or by using biodegradable lipids, which create smaller holes that are reparable by the ESCRT pathway. These strategies should lead to generally safer LNPs that can be used to treat inflammatory diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

The adverse effects and toxicity associated with conventional RA treatment pathways underscore the critical need to seek potential new therapeutic candidates, particularly those of natural sources that can treat the condition with minimal side effects. To address this challenge, this study employed a deep-learning (DL) based approach to conduct a virtual assessment of natural compounds against the Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) protein. TNF-alpha stands out as the primary pro-inflammatory cytokine, crucial in the development of RA. Our predictive model demonstrated appreciable performance, achieving MSE of 0.6, MAPE of 10%, and MAE of 0.5. The model was then deployed to screen a comprehensive set of 2563 natural compounds obtained from the Selleckchem database. Utilizing their predicted bioactivity (pIC50), the top 128 compounds were identified. Among them, 68 compounds were taken for further analysis based on drug-likeness analysis. Subsequently, selected compounds underwent additional evaluation using molecular docking (< -8.7 kcal/mol) and ADMET resulting in four compounds posing nominal toxicity, which were finally subjected to MD simulation for 200 ns. Later on, the stability of complexes was assessed via analysis encompassing RMSD, RMSF, Rg, H-Bonds, SASA, and Essential Dynamics. Ultimately, based on the total binding free energy estimated using the MM/GBSA method, Imperialine, Veratramine, and Gelsemine are proven to be potential natural inhibitors of TNF-alpha.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

We find that for different guide-RNA sequences, slicing rates of perfectly complementary, bound targets can be surprisingly different (>250-fold range), and that faster slicing confers better knockdown in cells. Nucleotide sequence identities at guide-RNA positions 7, 10, and 17 underlie much of this variation in slicing rates. Analysis of one of these determinants implicates a structural distortion at guide nucleotides 6-7 in promoting slicing. Moreover, slicing directed by different guide sequences has an unanticipated, 600-fold range in 3'-mismatch tolerance, attributable to guides with weak (AU-rich) central pairing requiring extensive 3' complementarity (pairing beyond position 16) to more fully populate the slicing-competent conformation.

However, the immense size of WSIs and the absence of fine-grained sub-region labels, such as patches, pose significant challenges for accurate WSI classification. Typical classification-driven deep learning methods often struggle to generate compact image representations, which can compromise the robustness of WSI classification. In this study, we address this challenge by incorporating both discriminative and contrastive learning techniques for WSI classification. Different from the extant contrastive learning methods for WSI classification that primarily assign pseudo labels to patches based on the WSI-level labels, our approach takes a different route to directly focus on constructing positive and negative samples at the WSI-level. Specifically, we select a subset of representative and informative patches to represent WSIs and create positive and negative samples at the WSI-level, allowing us to better capture WSI-level information and increase the likelihood of effectively learning informative features. Experimental results on two datasets and ablation studies have demonstrated that our method significantly improved the WSI classification performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods and enabled learning of informative features that promoted robustness of the WSI classification.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Throughout life, olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are generated from olfactory epithelium (OE) stem cells in the nose, while the subventricular zone generates neuroblasts that migrate to the olfactory bulb (OB) and differentiate into multiple populations of inhibitory interneurons. Methimazole (MMZ) selectively ablates OSNs, but OE neurogenesis enables OSN repopulation and gradual recovery of OSN input to the OB within six weeks. However, it is not known how OB interneurons are affected by this loss and subsequent regeneration of OSN input following MMZ treatment. We found that dopaminergic neuron density was significantly reduced 7-14 days post-MMZ but recovered substantially at 35 days. The density of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons was unaffected by MMZ; however, their soma size was significantly reduced at 7-14 days post-MMZ, recovering by 35 days. Surprisingly, we found a transient increase in the density of calretinin-expressing neurons in the glomerular and external plexiform layers, but not the granule cell layer, 7 days post- MMZ. This could not be accounted for by increased neurogenesis but may result from increased calretinin expression. At subsequent time points, calretinin neurons in all three layers showed reduced density at 14 days but recovered to baseline by 35 days.

Label-free differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy of the first embryonic cell division of nematodes related to Caenorhabditis elegans has been successfully employed to examine the constraints and divergence of intracellular mechanisms during this asymmetric cell division. However, identifying stages of the cell division cycle were performed interactively, pointing to a need to automate of cell stage identification from DIC microscopy. To this end, we have trained deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), both pre-existing such as ResNet, VGGNet and EfficientNet, and a customized shallow network, EvoCellNet, to automatically classify first-embryonic division into the stages: (i) pro-nuclear migration and (ii) centration and rotation, (iii) spindle elongation and (iv) cytokinesis, with all networks performing with 91% or greater accuracy. The activations of the networks superimposed on the images result in segmentation-free detection of intracellular features such as pro-nuclei, spindle and spindle- poles in case of the shallow EvoCellNet, while ResNet, VGGNet and and EfficientNet detect large-scale, features that are less biologically meaningful. The UMAP space representation combined with support vector machines (SVM) allows for stage boundary identification and recovers a cyclical map connecting the states (i) to (iv) of the division. This approach could be used to automate quantification of cell division stages and sub-cellular dynamics without explicit labelling in label-free microscopy.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Despite several decades of compelling experimental results, the factors that determine which experiences are selected for replay remain unclear. A particular challenge for current theories is that on tasks that feature unbalanced experience, rats paradoxically replay the less-experienced trajectory. To understand why, we simulated a feedforward neural network with two regimes: rich learning (structured representations tailored to task demands) and lazy learning (unstructured, task-agnostic representations). Rich, but not lazy, representations degraded following unbalanced experience, an effect that could be reversed with paradoxical replay. To test if this computational principle can account for the experimental data, we examined the relationship between paradoxical replay and learned task representations in the rat hippocampus. Strikingly, we found a strong association between the richness of learned task representations and the paradoxicality of replay. Taken together, these results suggest that paradoxical replay specifically serves to protect rich representations from the destructive effects of unbalanced experience, and more generally demonstrate a novel interaction between the nature of task representations and the function of replay in artificial and biological systems.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

However, how chromatin dysregulation in glial cells impacts cognitive abilities is less well understood. Here, we demonstrate that targeted loss of the ATRX chromatin remodeler in microglia alters chromatin accessibility profiles, leading to the de-repression of endogenous retroelements, triggering viral mimicry. Functionally, we find that ATRX microglial deficiency alters the electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons and causes deficits in object recognition and spatial memory. Overall, these findings demonstrate that ATRX is required in microglia to preserve chromatin structure and maintain microglial homeostasis. Disruption of these functions elicit neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits and potentially contribute to the pathology of human neurological disorders caused by ATRX mutations.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Abnormalities in structural and functional brain features are well-documented in children with PAE, but the effects of PAE on brain metabolism in children have received less attention. Levels of brain metabolites can be measured non-invasively using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Here, we present the first study of PAE-related brain metabolite differences in early childhood (ages 3-8 years) and their associations with cognitive performance, including executive functioning (EF) and pre-reading skills. We measured metabolites in two cohorts of children with PAE and unexposed children using MRS in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; cohort 1) and left temporo-parietal cortex (LTP; cohort 2). Total choline (tCho), a marker of membrane/myelin metabolism, was elevated in both regions in children with PAE compared to UC, and glutamate+glutamine (Glx), a marker of excitability, was elevated in the ACC. The PAE group exhibited more difficulties with EF, and higher tCho was associated with better EF in both PAE and unexposed groups. In addition, elevated Glx in the ACC was associated with poorer inhibitory control within the PAE group only. LTP metabolites were not significantly associated with pre-reading skills in PAE or unexposed groups. Together, these findings point to altered membrane metabolism and excitability in young children with PAE. These findings provide new insight to potential mechanisms by which PAE disrupts brain development and cognitive functioning in early childhood.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

The mechanism of cancer pain is complex, and opioid analgesics, which are widely used clinically, have obvious addiction and side effects, which seriously affect patients' life functions and may aggravate their anxiety, depression and other negative emotions. Acupuncture has a history of thousands of years in China, and acupuncture analgesia has been confirmed by many studies. This study investigated whether electroacupuncture can alleviate abnormal pain in bone cancer pain (BCP) mouse models and its possible central mechanism. A bone cancer pain model was established by injecting Lewis lung cancer cells into the left femoral cavity of adult male mice. Mechanical paw withdrawal threshold was tested baseline before surgery and 1, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 21 days after surgery. On day 21, behaviours related to depression emotions were tested. After the behaviours, the femurs were removed to observe pathological changes, the neck was broken and brain tissue was collected from the basal lateral amygdala (BLA) area for subsequent Western Blot and ELISA experiments were performed to verify the expression of (stimulator of interferon genes, STING) STING/NF-{kappa}B pathway proteins and the expression of inflammatory factors. Immunofluorescence of Ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba-1) and STING in the basal lateral amygdala (BLA) brain region was also performed. The results show that electroacupuncture can increase the pain threshold of the bone cancer pain model and alleviate the depressive-like emotional phenotype. Electroacupuncture inhibited the expression of STING/NF-{kappa}B pathway proteins, activation of microglia and release of inflammatory factors in the basal lateral amygdala (BLA) area. Therefore, this study shows that electroacupuncture may relieve bone cancer pain by regulating microglial activation and inflammatory factor release through the STING/NF-{kappa}B pathway.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Compared to developmental neurite outgrowth, axon guidance, and target selection, relatively little is known of mechanisms that maintain mature neuron morphology. Loss of function in C. elegans DIP-2, a member of the conserved lipid metabolic regulator Dip2 family, results in progressive overgrowth of neurites in adults. We find that dip-2 mutants display specific genetic interactions with sax-2, the C. elegans ortholog of Drosophila Furry and mammalian FRY. Combined loss of DIP-2 and SAX-2 results in severe disruption of neuronal morphology maintenance accompanied by increased release of neuronal extracellular vesicles (EVs). By screening for suppressors of dip-2 sax-2 double mutant defects we identified gain-of-function (gf) mutations in the conserved Dopey family protein PAD-1 and its associated phospholipid flippase TAT-5/ATP9A. In dip-2 sax-2 double mutants carrying either pad-1(gf) or tat-5(gf) mutation, EV release is reduced and neuronal morphology across multiple neuron types is restored to largely normal. PAD-1(gf) acts cell autonomously in neurons. The domain containing pad-1(gf) is essential for PAD-1 function, and PAD-1(gf) protein displays increased association with the plasma membrane and inhibits EV release. Our findings uncover a novel functional network of DIP-2, SAX-2, PAD-1, and TAT-5 that maintains morphology of neurons and other types of cells, shedding light on the mechanistic basis of neurological disorders involving human orthologs of these genes.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Distal interactions between cis-regulatory elements and their target genes are widespread and many causal loci underlying heritable agricultural traits have been mapped to distal non-coding elements. The biology underlying chromatin loop formation in plants is poorly understood. Dissecting the sequence features that mediate distal interactions is an important step toward identifying putative molecular mechanisms. Here, we trained GenomicLinks, a deep learning model, to identify DNA sequence features predictive of 3D chromatin interactions in maize. We found that the presence of binding motifs of specific Transcription Factor classes, especially bHLH, are predictive of chromatin interaction specificities. Using an in silico mutagenesis approach we show the removal of these motifs from loop anchors leads to reduced interaction probabilities. We were able to validate these predictions with single-cell co-accessibility data from different maize genotypes that harbor natural substitutions in these TF binding motifs. GenomicLinks is currently implemented as an open-source web tool, which should facilitate its wider use in the plant research community.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Prominent examples include nucleic acids and proteins, both of which assume a vast array of mechanical properties and three-dimensional shapes. The persistence length represents a numerical value to classify the bending rigidity of individual polymers. The shape of a polymer, dictated by the topology of the polymer backbone - a line trace through the center of the polymer along the contour path - is also a critical metric. Common architectures include linear, ring-like or cyclic, and branched; combinations of these can also exist, as in complex polymer networks. Determination of persistence length and shape are largely informative to polymer function and stability in biological environments. Here we demonstrate PS Poly, a near-fully automated algorithm to obtain polymer persistence length and shape from single molecule images obtained in physiologically relevant fluid conditions via atomic force microscopy. The algorithm, which involves image reduction via skeletonization followed by end point and branch point detection via {-}filtering, is capable of rapidly analyzing thousands of polymers with subpixel precision. Algorithm outputs were verified by analysis of deoxyribose nucleic acid, a very well characterized macromolecule. The utility of method was further demonstrated by application to a recently discovered polypeptide chain named candidalysin. This toxic protein segment polymerizes in solution and represents the first human fungal pathogen yet discovered. PS poly is a robust and general algorithm. It can be used to extract fundamental information about polymer backbone stiffness, shape, and more generally, polymerization mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

We mapped the afferent projections to the lateral part of the PB in mice using conventional cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) retrograde tracing, and then used conditional rabies virus retrograde tracing to map monosynaptic inputs specifically targeting the PBCalca/CGRP neurons. Using vesicular GABA (vGAT) and glutamate (vGLUT2) transporter reporter mice, we found that lateral PB neurons receive GABAergic afferents from regions such as the lateral part of the central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral dorsal subnucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, substantia innominata, and the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. Additionally, they receive glutamatergic afferents from the infralimbic and insular cortex, paraventricular nucleus, parasubthalamic nucleus, trigeminal complex, medullary reticular nucleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Using anterograde tracing and confocal microscopy, we then identified close axonal appositions between these afferents and PBCalca/CGRP neurons. Finally, we used channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping to test whether some of these inputs directly synapse upon the PBCalca/CGRP neurons.

Cupriavidus necator H16 has emerged as a promising industrial host for this purpose. Despite its prominence, the ability to engineer C. necator inorganic carbon uptake and fixation is underexplored. Here, we test the role of endogenous and heterologous genes on C. necator inorganic carbon metabolism. Deletion of one of the four carbonic anhydrases in C. necator, {beta}-carbonic anhydrase can, had the most deleterious effect on C. necator autotrophic growth. Replacement of this native uptake system with several classes of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) transporters from Cyanobacteria and chemolithoautotrophic bacteria recovered autotrophic growth and supported higher cell densities compared to wild-type (WT) C. necator in saturating CO2 in batch culture. Several heterologous strains with Halothiobacillus neopolitanus DAB2 (hnDAB2) expressed from the chromosome in combination with diverse rubisco homologs grew in CO2 equally or better than the wild-type strain. Our experiments suggest that the primary role of Can carbonic anhydrase during autotrophic growth is for bicarbonate accumulation to support anaplerotic metabolism, and an array of DIC transporters can complement this function.

Our analysis of 79 patients highlighted distinct gene expression patterns between acute YF infections, other viral infections, and the milder infection induced by the live-attenuated YF-17D vaccine. We identified a critical role for low-density, immature neutrophils in severe outcomes, marked by the downregulation of genes such as PADI4, CSF3R, and ICAM1 in deceased patients. These genes are essential for neutrophil migration and maturation, suggesting their pivotal role in disease progression. Furthermore, our study revealed a complex interaction among inflammation-related genes: increased expression of CXCL10 in the acute phase was accompanied by decreased expression of IL-1b and an increase in IL1R2, a decoy receptor that binds to IL-1 to inhibit its activity. The diminished expression of HLA class II genes suggests an impairment in antigen presentation. These insights underscore the delicate balance of immune responses in YF pathogenesis and provide a foundation for future therapeutic and diagnostic advancements in managing YF.

Highlights[bullet] PBMC transcriptome analysis in acute YFV highlights different immune responses between survivors and deceased patients.
[bullet]Decreased expression of HLA class II genes in dendritic cells of deceased YFV patients indicates a critical impairment in antigen presentation and innate immunity.
[bullet]Elevated B cell activation markers, such as BLNK and TNFRSF13B, in fatal YFV cases suggest an overactive, potentially dysregulated B cell response.
[bullet]Increased expression of neutrophil-related genes, including DEFA1B and MMP9, in deceased YFV patients highlights neutrophils role in aggravating inflammation and tissue damage.

T2D is associated with increased risk and worse prognosis of cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and cancer. Here we propose an updated framework for describing emergence of insulin resistance that precedes development of T2D. We show that diminishing capacity to store excess glucose can qualitatively capture the transition from normal to diabetic phenotype as captured by responses to oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs). We then show that an emerging tumor can either progress or regress depending on the metabolic environment of the host, consistent with experimental results of Hopkins et al. (2018), who showed that drug-induced transient diabetic phenotype, and specifically hyperinsulinemia, resulted in loss of therapeutic efficacy, and its reversal restored drug sensitivity and response to therapy. Given the prevalence of hyperinsulinemia in individuals with normoglycemia, addressing this condition emerges as a promising avenue to augment cancer therapy outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Identifying miRNA targets remains a central challenge and is pivotal for elucidating the complex gene regulatory networks. Traditional computational approaches have predominantly focused on identifying miRNA targets through perfect Watson-Crick base pairings within the seed region, referred to as canonical sites. However, emerging evidence suggests that perfect seed matches are not a prerequisite for miRNA-mediated regulation, underscoring the importance of also recognizing imperfect, or non-canonical, sites. To address this challenge, we propose Mimosa, a new computational approach that employs the Transformer framework to enhance the prediction of miRNA targets. Mimosa distinguishes itself by integrating contextual, positional, and base-pairing information to capture in-depth attributes, thereby improving its predictive capabilities. Its unique ability to identify non-canonical base-pairing patterns makes Mimosa a standout model, reducing the reliance on pre-selecting candidate targets. Mimosa achieves superior performance in gene-level predictions and also shows impressive performance in site-level predictions across various non-human species through extensive benchmarking tests. To facilitate research efforts in miRNA targeting, we have developed an easy-to-use web server for comprehensive end-to-end predictions, which is publicly available at http://monash.bioweb.cloud.edu.au/Mimosa/.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

The concealed nature of the capsid interior ensures that any encapsulated signal or signal generating enzyme, e.g., fused to an internal capsid protein, is suppressed whilst the phage is unaccompanied by its host. Furthermore, the only naturally occurring mechanism for releasing the internal capsid proteins, and therefore exposing their amalgamated signal/enzyme, is for them to be passed through the tail and subsequently ejected out of the phage, a post-adsorption phenomenon which occurs when the host is present, thus presenting a precise model for signal/enzyme release only upon pathogen presence. Here, a small N terminal subunit of the NanoLuc luciferase is fused and incorporated into the K1F internal capsid structure using a simple, non-genomic method. This internalised subunit is exposed to the test solution containing its C terminal counterpart (natural complementation immediately forms the full NanoLuc enzyme) and substrate furimazine in an inducible manner which mimics the presence of the K1F host, E. coli K1 thereby presenting a novel method for rapidly detecting this disease causing pathogen.

These facilities convert the kinetic energy of offshore wind, waves, tides or currents into electricity that is transported to shore through alternating current (AC), or direct current (DC), subsea cables. Energized cables emit magnetic fields radially into the surrounding seawater and induce secondary electric field artifacts. Thus, anthropogenic electromagnetic fields (EMFs) can alter the local geomagnetic landscape and may impact the behavior of EMF sensitive elasmobranchs that use the geomagnetic field (GMF) to navigate. We magnetically displaced big (Beringraja binoculata) and longnose (Caliraja rhina) skates to determine their response to GMF navigational cues. We then exposed skates to model AC and DC subsea cables to determine their response to fluctuating and constant EMFs. We then exposed skates to GMF and EMF to understand how EMF-AC and EMF-DC impacts GMF mediated behaviors. Experiments were recorded on video and 3D pose estimation software tracked the velocity, body angle, and spatial use of skates to quantify their behavioral response to magnetic stimuli. Big skates exposed to GMF and EMF were more active and showed the greatest changes in spatial use, velocity, and body angle. Conversely, longnose skates were less active but showed significant magnetic stimulus-specific changes in their movement kinematics. Thus, skates exposed to GMF and EMF showed stimulus- and species-specific changes in their behavior. Future studies will leverage these lab-based results to interpret the response of free-ranging elasmobranchs to EMF.

In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Here, we show that a carbonic sensing pathway (CSP) promotes development of resistance to amphotericin B through a reactive oxygen species (ROS) response, as well as ectopic cell wall and membrane lipid homeostasis. Mechanistically, the transcription factor Rca1 acts in cooperation with Efg1 to control the expression and activity of the carbonic anhydrase Nce103 as a key effector component. The conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate provides a direct link to energy metabolism, facilitating colonization and growth on skin tissues. Native mouse and human skin models unequivocally show that the CSP is essential for maintaining skin tropism as well as fungal fitness. Curiously, upon ablation of Rca1 and Efg1, C. auris debilitates efficient growth on native skin. Collectively, our findings highlight critical roles of the CSP in C. auris skin tropism and antifungal drug resistance. The work suggests therapeutic options for disrupting skin colonization and thus preventing infections.

Both prehistoric and historic movements of populations between Africa, Asia, and Europe may have been influenced by the unique geographical features of the Iranian plateau. Iran boasts ancient cultures and urban settlements predating some of the earliest civilizations, including the Neolithic revolution in neighboring Mesopotamia. Spanning from the Balkans and Egypt in the west to the Indus Valley in Pakistan and northern India in the southeast, the Iranian plateau encompasses a vast area characterized by incredible ethnocultural diversity. This region served as the origin for numerous mt-DNA/Y-DNA haplogroups that expanded to West Asia, Europe, Siberia, Central Asia, and South Asia. By examining both maternal and paternal haplogroups within the Iranian context, we aim to contribute to the broader narrative of human dispersals and elucidate the role those specific regions, such as the Iranian plateau, played in shaping the observed genetic diversity today. Due to the lack of comprehensive studies on mt-DNA /Y-DNA haplogroups in the Iranian population, our study sought to uncover the distribution of haplogroups among Iranian peoples using a large sample size. Our analysis focused on the frequency of ancestral haplogroups in Iran through the examination of large-scale whole-exome sequencing (WES) and SNP microarray data from 18,184 individuals. In our study, we observed 24 mt-DNA super haplogroups in the Iranian population, with the most common haplogroups belonging to West-Eurasian lineages U (20.73%), H (18.84%), J (12.10%), HV (9.22%), and T (8.98%), collectively comprising 69.70% of all Iranian samples. Notably, subclades J1 and U7 emerged as the two most frequent subclades, with frequencies of 11.24% and 7.30%, respectively. We also revealed the presence of 14 distinct Y-DNA haplogroups, with J, R, G, T, and Q emerging as the five predominant lineages. Notably, J2 (including J-L26) exhibited the highest frequency at 35.64%, followed by R1a at 14.68%. also, The detected mtDNA and Y-chromosome haplogroups were clustered into distinct groups that confirmed the heterogenicity of the Iranian population because of various factors including geographic or linguistic ethnic groups.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

To address this, we have developed Squigualiser, a toolkit for intuitive, interactive visualisation of sequence-aligned signal data, which currently supports both DNA and RNA sequencing data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) instruments. A series of methodological innovations enable efficient alignment of raw signal data to a reference genome/transcriptome with single-base resolution. Squigualiser generates an interactive signal browser view (HTML file), in which the user can navigate across a genome/transcriptome region and customise the display. Multiple independent reads are integrated into a signal  pileup format and different datasets can be displayed as parallel tracks to facilitate their comparison.

In fact, after a distraction, rotations were fuller when the task was correctly performed vs when errors were made. We found a direct correspondence between state-space rotations and traveling waves rotating across the surface of the PFC.

Methods We constructed a total of 105 PRS across individual level data from seven diverse ancestries. First, a cross-ancestry conventional PRS comparison was implemented by utilizing the 90 known European risk loci with weighted effects from four independent summary statistics including European, East Asian, Latino/Admixed American, and African/Admixed. These models were adjusted by sex, age, and principal components (28 PRS) and by sex, age, and percentage of admixture (28 PRS) for comparison. Secondly, a novel and refined multi-ancestry best-fit PRS approach was then applied across the seven ancestries by leveraging multi-ancestry meta-analyzed summary statistics and using a p-value thresholding approach (49 PRS) to enhance prediction applicability in a global setting. Results European-based PRS models predicted disease status across all ancestries to differing degrees of accuracy. Ashkenazi Jewish had the highest Odds Ratio (OR): 1.96 (95% CI: 1.69-2.25, p < 0.0001) with an AUC (Area Under the Curve) of 68%. Conversely, the East Asian population, despite having fewer predictive variants (84 out of 90), had an OR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.32-1.42) and an AUC of 62%, illustrating the cross-ancestry transferability of this model. Lower OR alongside broader confidence intervals were observed in other populations, including Africans (OR =1.38, 95% CI: 1.12-1.63, p=0.001). Adjustment by percentage of admixture did not outperform principal components. Multi-ancestry best-fit PRS models improved risk prediction in European, Ashkenazi Jewish, and African ancestries, yet didn't surpass conventional PRS in admixed populations such as Latino/American admixed and African admixed populations. Interpretation The present study represents a novel and comprehensive assessment of PRS performance across seven ancestries in PD, highlighting the inadequacy of a 'one size fits all' approach in genetic risk prediction. We demonstrated that European based PD PRS models are partially transferable to other ancestries and could be improved by a novel best-fit multi-ancestry PRS, especially in non-admixed populations.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196833

Arguably, this social knowledge is restricted to species with a degree of sociality (sensu [1], for a review [2]). Here we show the exception to this rule in an asocial arthropod species, the jumping spider (Phidippus regius). Using a habituation - dishabituation paradigm, we visually confronted pairs of spatially separated spiders with each other and measured the 'interest' of one spider towards the other. The spiders exhibited high interest upon initial encounter of an individual, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, but adapted towards that individual when it reoccurred in the subsequent trial, indicated by their preference of staying farther apart. In contrast, spiders exhibited a rebound from habituation, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, when a different individual occurred in the subsequent trial, indicating the ability to tell apart spiders' identities. These results suggest that P. regius is capable of individual recognition based on long-term social memory.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

These models are trained to yield vector representations, or embeddings, of various biological entities, such as cells, genes, individuals, or genomic regions. Recent applications of unsupervised embedding approaches have been shown to learn relationships among genomic regions that define functional elements in a genome. Unsupervised representation learning of genomic regions is free of the supervision from curated metadata and can condense rich biological knowledge from publicly available data to region embeddings. However, there exists no method for evaluating the quality of these embeddings in the absence of metadata, making it difficult to assess the reliability of analyses based on the embeddings, and to tune model training to yield optimal results. To bridge this gap, we propose four evaluation metrics: the cluster tendency score (CTS), the reconstruction score (RCS), the genome distance scaling score (GDSS), and the neighborhood preserving score (NPS). The CTS and RCS statistically quantify how well region embeddings can be clustered and how well the embeddings preserve information in training data. The GDSS and NPS exploit the biological tendency of regions close in genomic space to have similar biological functions; they measure how much such information is captured by individual region embeddings in a set. We demonstrate the utility of these statistical and biological scores for evaluating unsupervised genomic region embeddings and provide guidelines for learning reliable embeddings.

A key behavioural mechanism whereby animals may cope with such events is by increasing social cohesion to improve access to scarce resources like refuges, which in turn could exacerbate epidemic risk due to increased close contact. However, how and to what extent natural disasters affect disease risk via changes in sociality remains unexplored in animal populations. By modelling disease spread in free-living rhesus macaque groups (Macaca mulatta) before and after a hurricane, we demonstrate doubled pathogen transmission rates up to five years following the disaster, equivalent to an increase in pathogen infectivity from 10% to 20%. Moreover, the hurricane redistributed the risk of infection across the population, decreasing status-related differences found in pre-hurricane years. These findings demonstrate that natural disasters can exacerbate and homogenise epidemic risk in an animal population via changes in sociality. These observations provide unexpected further mechanisms by which extreme weather events can threaten wildlife health, population viability, and spillover to humans.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

They include viruses, mitochondrial DNAs, transposons and multi-gene families. The paradox is that their evolution in two stages should be far slower than single-copy systems but the opposite is often true. The paradox has been unresolvable because the standard Wright-Fisher (WF) model for molecular evolution cannot track multi-copy genes. We now apply the newly expanded WF-Haldane (WFH) model to such systems, first on ribosomal rRNA genes. On average, rRNAs have C ~ 150 - 300 copies per haploid in mammals. While a neutral mutation would take 4N (N being the population size) generations to become fixed, the time should be 4NC generations for rRNAs. However, the observed fixation time in mouse and human is < 4N; thus the paradox means, effectively, C < 1. Genetic drift (i.e., all random neutral forces driving molecular evolution by the WFH model) of rRNA genes appears 200-300 times higher than single-copy genes, thus reducing C to < 1. The large increases in genetic drift are driven by the homogenizing forces of unbiased gene conversion, unequal crossover and replication slippage within individuals. This study is one of the first applications of the WFH model to track random neutral forces of evolution. Such random forces, outside of the standard WF model, are often mis-interpreted as the working of natural selection.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BKCa) play an essential role in vasodilatory responses and maintenance of myogenic tone in resistance arteries. BKCa impairment can lead to microvascular dysfunction and hemodynamic deficits in the brain. We hypothesized that reduced BKCa function in cerebral arteries mediates microvascular and neurovascular responses in the 5x-FAD model of AD. Methods: BKCa activity in the cerebral microcirculation was assessed by patch clamp electrophysiology and pressure myography, in situ Ca2+ sparks by spinning disk confocal microscopy, hemodynamics by laser speckle contrast imaging. Molecular and biochemical analyses were conducted by affinity-purification assays, qPCR, Western blots and immunofluorescence. Results: We observed that pial arteries from 5-6 months-old male and female 5x-FAD mice exhibited a hyper-contractile phenotype than wild-type (WT) littermates, which was linked to lower vascular BKCa activity and reduced open probability. In males, BKCa dysfunction is likely a consequence of an observed lower expression of the pore-forming subunit BK and blunted frequency of Ca2+ sparks, which are required for BKCa activity. However, in females, impaired BKCa function is, in part, a consequence of reversible nitro-oxidative changes in the BK subunit, which reduces its open probability and regulation of vascular tone. We further show that BKCa function is involved in neurovascular coupling in mice, and its dysfunction is linked to neurovascular dysfunction in the model. Conclusion: These data highlight the central role played by BKCa in cerebral microvascular and neurovascular regulation, as well as sex-dependent mechanisms underlying its dysfunction in a mouse model of AD.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Here, we experimentally evolve granulosis virus in microcosms of its Plodia interpunctella (Indian meal moth) host that vary in spatial structure and host genetic diversity. We do this by manipulating food viscosity (spatial structure) and adding either one (homogeneous) or two (heterogeneous) host genotypes to the microcosm. Spatial structure therefore bot generally structures of infectious contacts and decreases the rate of contact between genotypes. We preserve spatial structure across passages and assay virus from different positions on the two host genotypes. We find that virus evolves specific interactions with its locally familiar host genotype, but that the impact of specialization on evolved phenotypes depends on the spatial structure. In spatially structured treatments, exploitation rates are higher on the familiar host, while, in well-mixed treatments, they are lower. We also find that virus can specialize to their locally familiar host in heterogeneous microcosms when spatial structure lowers contact rates between hosts. These results demonstrate that host genetic diversity and spatial structure can interact to reshape the evolution of pathogen host range.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

The information theory of aging posits that epigenetic information loss is a principal driver of the aging process. Despite this, the connection between epigenetic information loss and disease has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we analyzed tissue-unique methylation patterns in healthy and diseased organs, revealing that for several diseases these patterns degrade, regressing to a mean form. We interpret this as epigenetic information loss, where tissue-unique patterns erode. Information loss is not limited to diseases. Age-related erosion of unique methylation patterns was observed in some tissues and cells, while other tissues and cells diverged away from the mean. Our findings demonstrate that analyzing methylation patterns in tissue-unique sites can effectively distinguish between patients and healthy controls across a range of diseases, and underscore the role of epigenetic information loss as a common feature in various pathological conditions.

This study investigated whether a small subset of TFs and miRNAs could accurately predict genome-wide gene expression. We analyzed 8895 samples across 31 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas and identified 28 miRNA and 28 TF clusters using unsupervised learning. Medoids of these clusters could differentiate tissues of origin with 92.8% accuracy, demonstrating their biological relevance. We developed Tissue-Agnostic and Tissue-Aware models to predict ~20,000 gene expressions using the 56 selected medoid miRNAs and TFs. The Tissue-Aware model attained an R2 of 0.70 by incorporating tissue-specific information. Despite measuring only 1/400th of the transcriptome, the prediction accuracy was comparable to that achieved by the 1000 landmark genes. This suggests the transcriptome has an intrinsically low-dimensional structure that can be captured by a few regulatory molecules. Our approach could enable cheaper transcriptome assays and analysis of low-quality samples. It also provides insights into genes that are heavily regulated by miRNAs/TFs versus alternative mechanisms. However, model transportability was impacted by dataset discrepancies, especially in miRNA distribution.

Its principal objectives are to reduce the systematic biases primarily introduced through technical sources and to transform the data to make it more amenable for application of established statistical frameworks. In the standard workflows, normalization is followed by feature selection to identify highly variable genes (HVGs) that capture most of the biologically meaningful variation across the cells. Here, we make the case for a revised workflow by proposing a simple feature selection method and showing that we can perform feature selection before normalization by relying on observed counts. We highlight that the feature selection step can be used to not only select HVGs but to also identify stable genes. We further propose a novel variance stabilization transformation inclusive residuals-based normalization method that in fact relies on the stable genes to inform the reduction of systematic biases. We demonstrate significant improvements in downstream clustering analyses through the application of our proposed methods on biological truth-known as well as simulated counts datasets. We have implemented this novel workflow for analyzing high-throughput scRNA-seq data in an R package called Piccolo.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

While much is known about the circuits supporting stress-induced associative fear, how stress-induced circuit plasticity supports non-associative changes in defensive behavior remains unclear. Methods: Mice were exposed to an acute severe stressor, and subsequently, both associative and non-associative defensive behavioral responses were assessed. A mixture of local protein synthesis inhibition, pan-neuronal chemogenetic inhibition, and projection-specific chemogenetic inhibition were utilized to isolate the roles of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral hippocampus (vHC) to the induction and expression of associative and non-associative defensive behavioral changes. Results: Stress-induced protein synthesis in the BLA was necessary for enhancements in stress sensitivity but not enhancements in anxiety-related behaviors, whereas protein synthesis in the vHC was necessary for enhancements in anxiety-related behavior but not enhancements in stress sensitivity. Like protein synthesis, neuronal activity of the BLA and vHC were found to differentially support the expression of these same defensive behaviors. Additionally, projection-specific inhibition of BLA-vHC connections failed to alter these behaviors, indicating that these defensive behaviors are regulated by distinct BLA and vHC circuits. Lastly, contributions of the BLA and vHC to stress sensitivity and anxiety-related behavior were independent of their contributions to associative fear. Conclusions: Stress-induced plasticity in the BLA and vHC were found to support dissociable non-associative behavioral changes, with BLA supporting enhancements in stress sensitivity and vHC supporting increased anxiety-related behavior. These findings demonstrate that independent BLA and vHC circuits are critical for stress-induced defensive behaviors, and that differential targeting of BLA and vHC circuits may be needed in disease treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Such fluctuations are particularly prominent in reaction time (RT) series from laboratory neurocognitive tasks. Despite their omnipresent nature, trial-to-trial fluctuations remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically analysed RT series from various neurocognitive tasks, quantifying how much of the total trial-to-trial RT variance can be explained with general linear models (GLMs) by three sources of variability that are frequently investigated in behavioural and neuroscientific research: 1) experimental conditions, employed to induce systematic patterns in variability, 2) short-term temporal dependencies as the autocorrelation between subsequent trials, and 3) long-term temporal trends over experimental blocks and sessions. Furthermore, we examined to what extent the explained variances by these sources are shared or unique. We analysed 1913 unique RT series from 30 different cognitive control and perception-based tasks. On average, the three sources together explained ~8-17% of the total variance. The experimental conditions explained on average ~2.5-3.5% but did not share explained variance with temporal dependencies. Thus, the largest part of the trial-to-trial fluctuations in RT remained unexplained by these three sources. Unexplained fluctuations may take on non-linear or non-additive forms that are not picked up by GLMs. They may also be partially attributable to observable endogenous factors such as fluctuations in brain activity and bodily states. Still, some extent of randomness may be a feature of the neurobiological system rather than just nuisance.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

[1] studied the dependence between the identity of synonymous codons and the distribution of the backbone dihedral angles of the translated amino acids. In the past, it has been shown that the use of synonymous codons is highly relevant in multiple biological processes including, among others, mRNA splicing, translational rates and protein folding [2,3]. While the correlation between synonymous codons and secondary structure in translated proteins has been widely studied [4-6], Rosenberg et al. evaluated the effect of codon identity on a finer scale, analyzing whether the distribution of ({varphi}, {psi}) dihedral angles within secondary structure elements is significantly altered when synonymous codons are used. Their conclusion, showing significant differences, particularly for amino acid residues involved in {beta} strands, would represent a new paradigm for the role played by synonymous codons in defining protein structure. However, the statistical methodology used in that study was formally incorrect, casting doubt on the obtained results. Besides, it is based on density estimates that might be imprecise for small sample sizes, yielding misleading comparisons. These methodological errors are described in the following section. Then, using an appropriate methodology, we reanalyzed the data presented in [1]. Our results show that the influence of the codon on the distribution of the dihedral angles is statistically non-significant for all types of secondary structures, contradicting the conclusion by Rosenberg et al.. These results were corroborated by repeating the analysis on structures extracted from the AlphaFold Database [7,8] for the same set of proteins, and shown to be robust with respect to the definition secondary structural classes and also when considering the nature of the neighbor residues. Overall, our observations demonstrate that the influence of the synonymous codons on the backbone dihedral angles can not be inferred with current data.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

While we can readily observe the phenotypic effects of domestication, the genetic consequences of domestication often remain elusive. Artificial selection can alter the selection coefficients of both new and pre-existing genetic variation within domesticated populations. To investigate this, we conducted simulations using a combination of population genomic parameters designed to reflect the domestication process observed in large livestock mammals. Our study uses forward-in-time simulations to examine the 1D and 2D site frequency spectra (SFS) of mutations in two populations that have diverged since the domestication split. In total, we examined eighteen different scenarios, varying the strength of selection acting on beneficial mutations and the proportion of mutations with altered selection coefficients post-domestication. First, we re-evaluate how linked selection and fluctuating selection coefficients affect the accuracy of inferred demographic histories. Second, we find that certain aspects of the full distribution of fitness effects (DFE), such as the shape and strength of the deleterious DFE, can be accurately estimated in both populations using only the 1D-SFS. However, the accurate characterization of the beneficial DFE remains a challenge, even when using the 2D-SFS. Third, using a novel joint DFE model, we are able to quantify the fraction of mutations that have experienced a change in their selection coefficient (pc) during domestication. Interestingly, classic hard selective sweeps can mimic a substantial increase in pc, even when the simulated pc was initially zero. In summary, our work highlights the strengths and limitations of detecting changes in the DFE using a novel joint DFE model and emphasizes the risks of over-interpreting demographic histories across a range of realistic domestication scenarios.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Given its significance for evolutionary and medical studies, many algorithms focusing on the inference of the genetic composition of admixed populations have been developed. In particular, the recent development of new ancestry estimation methods that consider the fragmentary nature of ancient genotype data, such as the f-statistics family and its derivations, have radically changed our understanding of the past. F-statistics capture similar genetic similarity information as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is widely used in population genetics to quantify genetic affinity between populations or individuals.

We investigated the effects of adopting a medical cannabis law on the cost of employer-sponsored health insurance.

MethodsWe analyzed state-level data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) Private Sector spanning from 2003 to 2022. The outcomes included log transformed average total premiums per employee for single, employee-plus-one, and family coverage plans. We utilized the Sun and Abraham (2021) difference-in-difference (DiD) method, looking at the overall DiD and event-study DiD. Models were adjusted for various state-level demographics and dichotomous policy variables including whether a state later adopted recreational cannabis as well as time and unit fixed effects and population weights.

ResultsFor states that adopted a medical cannabis law, there was a significant decrease in the log average total premium per employee for single (-0.034, standard error [SE] = 0.009) and employee plus one (-0.025, SE = 0.009) coverage plans considering the first 10 years of policy change compared to states without such laws. Looking at the last five years of policy change, we saw increases in effect size and statistical significance. Sensitivity analyses suggest findings are robust to our model specifications.

DiscussionAdoption of a medical cannabis law may contribute to decreases in healthcare costs. This phenomenon is likely a secondary effect and suggests positive externalities outside of medical cannabis patients.

Key PointsO_LIStates that passed medical cannabis laws, compared to states that did not pass such laws, saw decreases in the average total costs for employer-sponsored health insurance premiums.
C_LIO_LIThe difference in average total costs for employer-sponsored health insurance premiums, comparing states with and without medical cannabis laws, grew over time.
C_LIO_LIThis paper contributes to the idea that medical cannabis laws may contain positive externalities.

Recent research has highlighted the therapeutic potential of psychoactive substances and especially 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), in alleviating trauma symptoms in chronic patients. However, little is known regarding the consequences of trauma that is acutely experienced under the influence of psychoactive substances. Here we investigated the acute experiences and peritraumatic processing of 657 survivors from the high-casualty terror attack at the Supernova music festival in Israel on October 7th, 2023. Data were collected four to twelve weeks following the TE. Approximately two-thirds of survivors were under the influence of psychoactive substances at the time of the TE, offering a tragic and unique natural experiment on the impact of psychoactive compounds on TE processing. Our findings reveal that individuals who experienced the trauma while under the influence of MDMA demonstrated significantly improved intermediate outcomes compared to those who were under the influence of other substances or no substances at all. Specifically, the MDMA group reported increased feelings of social support, more social interactions and enhanced quality of sleep during the peritraumatic period, yielding reduced levels of mental distress and reduced PTSD symptom severity. These novel findings suggest that the influence of MDMA during the TE may carry protective effects into the peritraumatic period, possibly mediated through the known effects of MDMA in reducing negative emotions and elevating prosociality. These protective effects in turn may mitigate the development of early psychopathology-related symptoms. Current preliminary results underscore the need for further understanding of the cognitive and physiological processes by which psychedelic substances intersect with trauma recovery processes.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Here, we characterized N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific monoclonal antibodies previously isolated from COVID-19 convalescent donors for their activity against emergent SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Among these, the NTD-specific antibody C1596 displayed the greatest breadth of binding to VOCs, with cryo-EM structural analysis revealing recognition of a distinct NTD epitope outside of the site i antigenic supersite. Given C1596s favorable binding profile, we designed a series of bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) termed CoV2-biRNs, that featured both NTD and RBD specificities. Notably, two of the C1596-inclusive bsAbs, CoV2-biRN5 and CoV2-biRN7, retained potent in vitro neutralization activity against all Omicron variants tested, including XBB.1.5, EG.5.1, and BA.2.86, contrasting the diminished potency of parental antibodies delivered as monotherapies or as a cocktail. Furthermore, prophylactic delivery of CoV2-biRN5 significantly reduced the viral load within the lungs of K18-hACE2 mice following challenge with SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5.

The cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, acting through cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING), is broadly expressed in tissues, and is poised to regulate local type I interferon (IFN-I)-dependent and independent inflammatory processes within tissues. Recent studies suggest that the cGAS/STING pathway may drive pathology in various in vitro and in vivo models of accelerated aging. To date, however, the role of the cGAS/STING pathway in physiological aging processes, in the absence of genetic drivers, has remained unexplored. This remains a relevant gap, as STING is ubiquitously expressed, implicated in multitudinous disorders, and loss of function polymorphisms of STING are highly prevalent in the human population (>50%). Here we reveal that, during physiological aging, STING-deficiency leads to a significant shortening of murine lifespan, increased pro-inflammatory serum cytokines and tissue infiltrates, as well as salient changes in histological composition and organization. We note that aging hearts, livers, and kidneys express distinct subsets of inflammatory, interferon-stimulated gene (ISG), and senescence genes, collectively comprising an immune fingerprint for each tissue. These distinctive patterns are largely imprinted by tissue-specific stromal and myeloid cells. Using cellular interaction network analyses, immunofluorescence, and histopathology data, we show that these immune fingerprints shape the tissue architecture and the landscape of cell-cell interactions in aging tissues. These age-associated immune fingerprints are grossly dysregulated with STING-deficiency, with key genes that define aging STING- sufficient tissues greatly diminished in the absence of STING. Changes in immune signatures are concomitant with a restructuring of the stromal and myeloid fractions, whereby cell:cell interactions are grossly altered and resulting in disorganization of tissue architecture in STING-deficient organs. This altered homeostasis in aging STING-deficient tissues is associated with a cross-tissue loss of homeostatic tissue-resident macrophage (TRM) populations in these tissues. Ex vivo analyses reveal that basal STING- signaling limits the susceptibility of TRMs to death-inducing stimuli and determines their in situ localization in tissue niches, thereby promoting tissue homeostasis. Collectively, these data upend the paradigm that cGAS/STING signaling is primarily pathological in aging and instead indicate that basal STING signaling sustains tissue function and supports organismal longevity. Critically, our study urges caution in the indiscriminate targeting of these pathways, which may result in unpredictable and pathological consequences for health during aging.

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

To bridge this gap in knowledge, we undertook complementary cellular and molecular analyses of microglia in the mouse hippocampus across the adult lifespan and in the experimental aging model of heterochronic parabiosis. Single-cell RNA-Seq and pseudotime analysis revealed age-related transcriptional heterogeneity in hippocampal microglia and identified intermediate states of microglial aging that also emerge following heterochronic parabiosis. We tested the functionality of intermediate stress response states via TGF{beta}1 and translational states using pharmacological approaches in vitro to reveal their modulation of the progression to an inflammatory state.

Predicting the underlying resistance mechanisms of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is crucial for understanding and combating this problem. However, existing methods struggle to accurately predict resistance mechanisms for ARGs with low similarity to known sequences and lack sufficient interpretability of the prediction models.

ResultsIn this study, we present a novel approach for predicting ARG resistance mechanisms using Protein-BERT, a protein language model based on deep learning. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on diverse ARG datasets, including those with low homology to the training data, highlighting its potential for predicting the resistance mechanisms of unknown ARGs. Attention analysis of the model reveals that it considers biologically relevant features, such as conserved amino acid residues and antibiotic target binding sites, when making predictions. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular basis of antibiotic resistance and demonstrate the interpretability of protein language models, offering a new perspective on their application in bioinformatics.

Here, we argue that episodic memory (EM) plays an essential role in this process by stabilizing task representations, thereby supporting the accumulation of structured knowledge. We demonstrate this using a neural network model that infers task representations that minimize the current tasks objective function; crucially, the model can retrieve previously encoded task representations from EM and use these to initialize the task inference process. With EM, the model succeeds in learning the underlying task structure; without EM, task representations drift and the network fails to learn the structure. We further show that EM errors can support structure learning by promoting the activation of similar task representations in tasks with similar sensory inputs. Overall, this model provides a novel account of how EM supports the acquisition of structured task representations.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Metabolites from TCA cycle, calcium, ROS and other small molecules are known to mediate retrograde signalling of mitochondria to the nucleus. Recently, the direct transfer of mitochondrial proteins to the nucleus has been described. However, the mechanism for direct transfer of mitochondrial protein complexes to the nucleus is not understood. In this study, we demonstrate the transit of mitochondrial proteins to the nucleus through mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs) which represents a novel intracellular trafficking route. Following an unbiased proteomic approach to detecting cargo proteins in cardiac MDVs, we screen for the presence of MDV cargo in the nucleus. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) and Cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV isoform 1 COX4I1 are packaged into MDVs in cardiomyocytes but only PDH is targeted to the nucleus in this cell type demonstrating that a subset of cargo-selective MDVs fuse with the nucleus. MDV budding and the subsequent nuclear delivery of PDH is actin dependent in cardiomyocytes. Further, several mitochondrial stresses that are known to increase MDV generation triage these MDVs to other cellular destinations thereby reducing the nuclear pool of PDH. The transit of PDH through MDVs to the nucleus is a basal physiological process in cardiomyocytes. Mito-nuclear trafficking thus represents a physiological pathway in cardiac cells to enable cargo shuttle from mitochondria to the nucleus.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of an oral CBD-terpene formulation on sleep physiology in insomniacs.

MethodsIn this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, 125 insomniacs received an oral administration of CBD (300 mg) and terpenes (1 mg each of linalool, myrcene, phytol, limonene, -terpinene, -terpineol, -pinene, and {beta}-caryophyllene) for [&ge;] four days/week over four weeks using a crossover design. The study medication was devoid of {Delta}9-Tetrahydrocannabinol ({Delta}9-THC). The primary outcome measure was the percentage of time participants spent in the combination of slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages, as measured by a wrist-worn sleep-tracking device.

ResultsThis CBD-terpene regimen significantly increased the mean nightly percentage of time participants spent in SWS + REM sleep compared to the placebo [mean (SEM), 1.28% (0.60%), 95% C.I. 0.09 to 2.46, P = 0.03]. More robust increases were observed in participants with low baseline SWS + REM sleep, as well as in day-sleepers. For select participants, the increase in SWS + REM sleep averaged as much as 48 min/night over a four-week treatment period. This treatment had no effect on total sleep time (TST), resting heart rate or heart rate variability, and no adverse events were reported.

ConclusionsSelect CBD-terpene ratios may increase SWS + REM sleep, and have the potential to provide a safe and efficacious alternative to over-the-counter (OTC) sleep aids and commonly prescribed sleep medications.

BRIEF SUMMARYO_ST_ABSCurrent Knowledge/Study RationaleC_ST_ABSPhysicians are increasingly asked by their patients regarding the merits of using CBD for insomnia and other ailments, but lack any rigorous clinical research to support recommending its use. The current study represents the first double-blind, placebo-controlled and randomized crossover clinical trial to investigate how an oral formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and terpenes influences sleep physiology in insomniacs.

Study ImpactIn contrast to many OTC sleep aids and commonly prescribed sleep medicines, the CBD-terpene formulation increased SWS and REM sleep, which are critical for the immune system, tissue regeneration, cognition and memory. These results, if confirmed in larger clinical trials, suggests that CBD might offer a promising alternative to other prescription sleep medications and OTC sleep aids.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196833

Surprisingly, the screen identified very few NL proteins, but revealed roles for dozens of known chromatin regulators. Among these are the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex and interacting factors involved in RNA polymerase pausing, suggesting that regulation of transcription elongation is a mechanism to repress transcription in LADs. Furthermore, the chromatin remodeler complex BAF and the activation complex Mediator can work both as activators and repressors in LADs, depending on the local context and possibly rewiring of heterochromatin.

Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

Here, we extend this framework to decompose evolutionary divergence in gene expression and other quantitative traits into cell-intrinsic, extrinsic, and intrinsic-extrinsic interaction components. Applying this framework to reciprocal rat-mouse chimeras, we found that the majority of gene expression divergence is attributable to cell-intrinsic factors, though extrinsic factors also play an integral role. For example, a rat-like extracellular environment extrinsically up-regulates the expression of a key transcriptional regulator of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response in some but not all cell types, which in turn strongly predicts extrinsic up-regulation of its target genes and of the ER stress response pathway as a whole. This effect is also seen at the protein level, suggesting propagation through multiple regulatory levels. We also demonstrate that our framework is applicable to a cellular trait, neuronal differentiation, and estimated the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to its divergence. Finally, we show that imprinted genes are dramatically mis-expressed in species-mismatched environments, suggesting that mismatch between rapidly evolving intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms controlling gene imprinting may contribute to barriers to interspecies chimerism. Overall, our conceptual framework opens new avenues to investigate the mechanistic basis of evolutionary divergence in gene expression and other quantitative traits in any multicellular organism.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

However, molecular triggers instigating AD, its temporospatial progression, and how vascular cells in each vessel layer interact and participate in the pathological process remain incompletely understood. To unravel the underlying molecular mechanism of AD, we generated a spontaneous AD mouse model.

MethodsWe incorporated a novel missense variant (p.G234D) in FBN1, the gene for fibrillin-1, identified in a non-syndromic familial AD patient into mice using CRISPR/Cas9 system. We performed histopathological analyses of the aortic lesions by histology, immunofluorescence staining, electron microscopy, synchrotron-based imaging and single-cell (sc)RNA-sequencing. Biochemical analysis was performed to examine the binding capacity of mutant human FBN1G234D protein to latent Tgf{beta} binding proteins (LTBPs), and signaling pathways in the mutant aortic wall were examined by western blot analysis.

Results50% of the Fbn1G234D/G234D mutant mice died within 5 weeks of age from multiple intimomedial tears that expanded longitudinally and progressed to aortic rupture accompanied by massive immune cell infiltration. scRNA-sequencing, validated by immunostaining, revealed a significant increase in MHC class II-positive pro-inflammatory macrophages and monocytes at the site of intima tears with upregulation of MMP2/9 and marked disruption of elastic lamina. Subendothelial matrices, such as type IV collagen and laminin, expanded into the medial layer, where fibronectin expression was highly upregulated. Fbn1G234D/G234D endothelial cells exhibited altered mechanosensing with loss of parallel alignment to blood flow and upregulation of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, all of which likely contributed to the infiltration of immune cells. Biochemically, FBN1G234D lost the ability to bind to latent TGF{beta} binding protein (LTBP)-1, -2, and -4, resulting in the downregulation of TGF{beta} signaling in the aortic wall.

ConclusionsWe show that dynamic interactions involving endothelial cells (ECs) and macrophages/monocytes in the intima, where the ECM microenvironment is altered with the reduced TGF{beta} signaling, contributes to the initiation of AD. Our novel AD mouse model provides a unique opportunity to identify target molecules involved in the intimomedial tears that can be utilized for development of therapeutic strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

However, nuclease activity with different gRNAs can vary considerably, in a spacer sequence-dependent manner that can be difficult to predict. While computational tools are helpful in predicting a CRISPR effector's activity and/or potential for off-target mutagenesis with different gRNAs, individual gRNAs must still be validated in vitro prior to their use. Here, we present compartmentalized CRISPR reactions (CCR) for screening large numbers of spacer/target/off-target combinations simultaneously in vitro for both CRISPR effector activity and specificity, by confining the complete CRISPR reaction of gRNA transcription, RNP formation, and CRISPR target cleavage within individual water-in-oil microemulsions. With CCR, large numbers of the candidate gRNAs (output by computational design tools) can be immediately validated in parallel, and we show that CCR can be used to screen hundreds of thousands of extended gRNA (x-gRNAs) variants that can completely block cleavage at off-target sequences while maintaining high levels of on-target activity. We expect CCR can help to streamline the gRNA generation and validation processes for applications in biological and biomedical research.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196833

Here, we present Hist2Cell, a Vision Graph- Transformer framework, to resolve fine-grained cell types directly from histology images and further create cellular maps of diverse tissues at a customizable resolution. Specifically, trained on human lung and breast cancer spatial transcriptome datasets, Hist2Cell accurately predicts the abundance of each cell type across space, effectively capturing their colocalization directly from histology images. Moreover, without the need for model re-training, it robustly generalizes to large-scale histology cohorts of breast cancer samples from TCGA, highlighting recurrent cell type colocalization.

While these communities, defined as cell niches, are fundamentally shaped by interactions between spatially neighboring cells, we lack computational frameworks that can leverage spatial omics data to quantitatively characterize niches based on cell interaction events. To address this, we introduce NicheCompass, a graph deep learning method designed based on the principles of cellular communication. NicheCompass not only identifies cell niches, but also learns and informs about the signaling events shaping the identity of these niches. Unlike existing methods, it uniquely characterizes niches by quantifying their activity of spatial gene programs which represent diverse mechanisms of cell-cell communication and transcriptional regulation, thereby uncovering the underlying cellular processes constituting each niche. We showcase a comprehensive workflow encompassing data integration, niche identification, and functional interpretation, and demonstrate that, with its biologically informed design, NicheCompass outperforms existing methods. NicheCompass is broadly applicable to spatial transcriptomics data, which we illustrate by mapping the architecture of diverse tissues during mouse embryonic development, and delineating basal (KRT14) and luminal (KRT8) tumor niches in human breast cancer. We further introduce fine-tuning-based spatial reference mapping, revealing an SPP1+ macrophage-dominated tumor niche in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Additionally, we extend NicheCompass to multimodal spatial profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility, identifying and characterizing distinct white matter niches in the mouse brain. Finally, we apply NicheCompass to a whole mouse brain spatial atlas with 8.4 million cells demonstrating its scalability and ability to build foundational, interpretable spatial representations for entire organs. Overall, NicheCompass provides a novel approach to the challenge of identifying and analyzing niches, and suggests a more rigorous niche definition grounded in the quantitative characterization of underlying cellular processes.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

In a companion paper (Takemura et al., 2023), we describe the acquisition of a complete fruit fly nerve cord connectome, the first for an animal that can walk or fly. Here, to efficiently navigate and to appreciate the biological significance of this connectome, we categorise and name nearly all neurons systematically and link them to the experimental literature. We employ a system of hierarchical coarse annotations and group similar neurons across the midline and across segments, then define systematic cell types for sensory neurons, intrinsic neurons, ascending neurons, and non-motor efferent neurons. Stereotyped arrays of neuroblasts generate related neuron populations called hemilineages that repeat across the segments of the nerve cord. We confirm that larval-born neurons from a given hemilineage generally express the same neurotransmitter but find that earlier born neurons often express a different one. We match over 35% of intrinsic, ascending, and non-motor efferent neurons across segments, defining serial sets which were crucial for systematic typing of motor neurons and sensory neurons. We assign a sensory modality to over 5000 sensory neurons, cluster them by connectivity, and identify serially homologous cell types and a layered organisation likely corresponding to peripheral topography. Finally, we present selected examples of sensory circuits predicated on programmatic analysis of a complete VNC connectome.

TaDa was employed in larval CNS tissues, while genetically manipulating Alk signaling output. The resulting TaDa data were analysed together with larval CNS scRNA-seq datasets performed under similar conditions, identifying a role for Alk in the transcriptional regulation of neuroendocrine gene expression. Further integration with bulk/scRNA-seq and protein datasets from larval brains in which Alk signaling was manipulated, identified a previously uncharacterized Drosophila neuropeptide precursor encoded by CG4577 as an Alk signaling transcriptional target. CG4577, which we named Sparkly (Spar), is expressed in a subset of Alk-positive neuroendocrine cells in the developing larval CNS, including circadian clock neurons. In agreement with our TaDa analysis, overexpression of the Drosophila Alk ligand Jeb resulted in increased levels of Spar protein in the larval CNS. We show that Spar protein is expressed in circadian (Clock) neurons, and flies lacking Spar exhibit defects in sleep and circadian activity control.

The search for emerging viruses has been aided by the implementation of metagenomic tools, which have also enabled the detection of unprecedented viral diversity. Currently, this search is mainly focused on RNA viruses, which are largely over-represented in databases. To compensate for this research bias, we analyzed fecal samples from 189 Spanish bats belonging to 22 different species using viral metagenomics. This allowed us to identify 50 complete or near-complete viral genomes belonging to the families Adenoviridae, Circoviridae, Genomoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Parvoviridae, Polyomaviridae and Smacoviridae. Of these, 28 could constitute new species, doubling the number of viruses currently described in Europe. These findings open the door to a more thorough analysis of bat DNA viruses and their zoonotic potential.

IMPORTANCEMetagenomics has become a fundamental tool to characterize the global virosphere, allowing us to understand the existing viral diversity and its ecological implications, but also to identify new and emerging viruses. RNA viruses have a higher zoonotic potential, but this risk is also present for some DNA virus families. In our study, we have analyzed the DNA fraction of faecal samples from 22 Spanish bat species, identifying 50 complete or near-complete genomes of different viral families with zoonotic potential. This doubles the number of genomes currently described in Europe. Metagenomic data often produce partial genomes that can be difficult to analyse. Our work, however, has characterised a large number of complete genomes, thus facilitating their taxonomic classification and enabling different analyses to be carried out to evaluate their zoonotic potential. For example, recombination studies are relevant, since this phenomenon could play a major role in cross-species transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Previous work has established that metabolism can determine colonization success in vivo2-4, but relevance of bacterial warfare in preventing engraftment has been less explored. Here, we demonstrate that intraspecies warfare presents a significant barrier to strain transmission in the skin microbiome by profiling 14,884 pairwise interactions between Staphylococcus epidermidis cultured from eighteen human subjects from six families. We find that intraspecies antagonisms are abundant; these interactions are mechanistically diverse, independent of the relatedness between strains, and consistent with rapid evolution via horizontal gene transfer. Ability to antagonize more strains is associated with reaching a higher fraction of the on-person S. epidermidis community. Moreover, antagonisms are significantly depleted among strains residing on the same person relative to random assemblages. Two notable exceptions, in which bacteria evolved to become sensitive to antimicrobials found on the same host, are explained by mutations that provide phage resistance, contextualizing the importance of warfare among other lethal selective pressures. Taken together, our results emphasize that accounting for intraspecies bacterial warfare is essential to the design of long-lasting probiotic therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

While prosocial behavior is more frequently observed towards familiar conspecifics, even within the same social context some individuals are more prone to help than others. For instance, in a rat helping behavior test, rats can release a distressed conspecific trapped inside a restrainer by opening the restrainer door. Typically, rats are motivated to release a trapped cagemate, and consistently release the trapped rat ( openers), yet around 30% do not open the restrainer ( non-openers). To characterize the difference between these populations, behavioral and neural activity were compared between opener and non-opener rats tested with a trapped cagemate in the helping test. Behaviorally, openers showed significantly more social affiliative behavior both before and after door-opening compared to non-openers. Analysis of brain-wide neural activity based on the immediate early gene c-Fos revealed increased activity in openers in the previously identified prosocial neural network compared to non-openers. The network includes regions associated with empathy in humans (somatosensory cortex, insula, cingulate cortex and frontal cortex), and motivation and reward regions such as the nucleus accumbens. Oxytocin receptor mRNA expression levels were higher in the accumbens but not the anterior insula. Several transcription control pathways were also significantly upregulated in openers accumbens. These findings indicate that prosocial behavior may be predicted by affiliative behavior and activity in the prosocial neural network and provide targets for the investigation of causal mechanisms underlying prosocial behavior.

Significance StatementProsocial behavior is observed in many social species, including rodents, yet the determinants underlying why some animals help and others do not is poorly understood. Here, we show behavioral and neural differences between prosocial and non-prosocial pairs in a rat helping behavior test, with increased social interaction and nucleus accumbens oxytocin receptor gene expression in animals that helped.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

There is currently no cure for PD barring treatments to manage symptoms. The reasons might be due to lack of precise understanding of molecular mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Aberrant cell cycle activation has been implicated in neuronal death pathways of various neurodegenerative diseases including PD. This study investigates the role of cell cycle regulator Cell division cycle 25A (Cdc25A) in a PD-relevant neuron death model induced by 6-OHDA treatment. We find Cdc25A is rapidly elevated, activated and is playing a key role in neuron death by regulating Rb phosphorylation and E2F1 activity. Knockdown of Cdc25A via shRNA downregulates the levels of pro-apoptotic PUMA, an E2F1 target and cleaved Caspase-3 levels, suggesting Cdc25A may regulate neuronal apoptosis through these effectors. Our work sheds light on the intricate signaling networks involved in neurodegeneration and highlights Cdc25A as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating aberrant cell cycle re-entry underlying PD pathogenesis. These novel insights into molecular mechanisms provide a foundation for future development of neuroprotective strategies to slow or prevent progression of this debilitating disease.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

The aim of this work is to determine whether purified NCT and NFT, or a hemp hull product containing NCT and NFT (Brightseed(R) Bio Gut Fiber), can impact the gut microbiome using an in vitro fermentation assay. To address this question, we treated three fecal inocula, representative of the human gut microbiome, with Bio Gut Fiber and NCT/NFT and evaluated their respective impact against starch and methylcellulose as controls. We found strong changes exerted by Bio Gut Fiber and NCT/NFT on the gut microbiome relative to starch and methylcellulose, with distinct responses across all microbial communities. Among communities treated with Bio Gut Fiber, we saw increased community productivity and increased community diversity. Further, to determine whether changes found in gut microbiome profiles were dose-dependent, we tested different concentrations of NCT/NFT and found a dose-dependent impact on the resulting microbial compositions.

The latent period is a key viral trait in lytic infections. Defined as the time from viral adsorption to viral progeny release, the latent period of bacteriophage is conventionally inferred via one-step growth curves in which the accumulation of free virus is measured over time in a population of infected cells. Developed more than 80 years ago, one-step growth curves do not account for cellular-level variability in the timing of lysis, potentially biasing inference of viral traits. Here, we use nonlinear dynamical models to understand how individual-level variation of the latent period impacts virus-host dynamics. Our modeling approach shows that inference of latent period via one-step growth curves is systematically biased - generating estimates of shorter latent periods than the underlying population-level mean. The bias arises because variability in lysis timing at the cellular level leads to a fraction of early burst events which are interpreted, artefactually, as an earlier mean time of viral release. We develop a computational framework to estimate latent period variability from joint measurements of host and free virus populations. Our computational framework recovers both the mean and variance of the latent period within simulated infections including realistic measurement noise. This work suggests that reframing the latent period as a distribution to account for variability in the population will improve the study of viral traits and their role in shaping microbial populations.

ImportanceQuantifying viral traits - including the adsorption rate, burst size, and latent period - is critical to characterize viral infection dynamics and to develop predictive models of viral impacts across scales from cells to ecosystems. Here, we revisit the gold standard of viral trait estimation - the one-step growth curve - to assess the extent to which assumptions at the core of viral infection dynamics lead to ongoing and systematic biases in inferences of viral traits. We show that latent period estimates obtained via one-step growth curves systematically under-estimate the mean latent period and, in turn, over-estimate the rate of viral killing at population scales. By explicitly incorporating trait variability into a dynamical inference framework that leverages both virus and host time series we provide a practical route to improve estimates of the mean and variance of viral traits across diverse virus-microbe systems.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

In this study, we investigated the ability of 165 root-associated bacteria to suppress flg22-induced immune activation and growth restriction. We demonstrate that a type II secreted subtilase, which we term Immunosuppressive Subtilase A (IssA), from Dyella japonica strain MF79 cleaves the immune eliciting peptide flg22 and contributes to immune suppression. IssA homologs are found in other plant-associated commensals, with particularly high conservation in the order Xanthomonadales.

However, understanding of the host-parasite interaction has been limited by the rapid loss of functionality in cultured primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). Here, we link loss of hepatic functionality to drastic loss in Pf permissiveness, which we effectively prevent by using a novel medium containing serum-replacement and signal transduction inhibitors. Integrating transcriptomic analysis and phenotypic assessment of infection outcome, we identified several host signalling pathways that influence Pf liver stage development. Inhibition of the Wnt pathway in particular plays a major role in determining the size and maturity of Pf-liver schizonts, via retaining metabolic activity and epithelial nature of hepatocytes.

The effect results from the production of asymmetrical daughters, one with a lower elongation rate, by the division of a mother cell. The slower daughter compared to the faster daughter, denoted respectively as the old and new daughters, has more aggregates of damaged proteins and fewer expressed gene products. We have examined further the degree of asymmetry by measuring the density of ribosomes between old and new daughters and between their poles. We found that ribosomes were denser in the new daughter and also in the new pole of the daughters. These ribosome patterns match the ones we previously found for expressed gene products. This outcome suggests that the asymmetry is not likely to result from properties unique to the gene expressed in our previous study, but rather from a more fundamental upstream process affecting distribution of ribosomal abundance. Because damage aggregates and ribosomes are both more abundant at the poles of E. coli cells, we suggest that competition for space between the two could explain the reduced ribosomal density in old daughters. Using published values for aggregate sizes and the relationship between ribosomal number and elongation rates, we show that the aggregate volumes could in principle displace quantitatively the amount of ribosomes needed to reduce the elongation rate of the old daughters.

IMPORTANCEBacteria exhibit a growth decline in a manner comparable to cellular or biological aging. When a mother bacterium reproduces by binary fission it allocates more damage to one of the two daughters. The extra damage correlates with a slower growth. Thus, a lineage of daughters successively acquiring more damage over generations ages, sometimes even to death under stressful conditions. Aging lineages also have lower levels of expressed gene products. Here we show that the aging process also correlates with lower cellular levels of ribosomes. The identification of a ribosomal effect shows that the aging process is acting at a much more fundamental upstream level. While decreased gene products could have resulted from local regulation of specific genes, a lower ribosomal density affects the entirety of cellular metabolism. Understanding bacterial aging is important because biological aging may have originated in single-celled organisms such as E. coli.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

RUBISCO assimilates Ci (CO2) into the 1-C position of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA). The Calvin-Benson-Basham (CBB) cycle redistributes fixed carbon atoms into 2,3-C2 of the same molecule. PEPC uses phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) derived from 3PGA and assimilates Ci (HCO3-) into 4-C of oxaloacetate (OAA). 1,2,3-C3 of OAA and of its transaminase product aspartate originate directly from 1,2,3-C3 of 3PGA. Positional isotopologue analysis of aspartate, the main downstream metabolite of OAA in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Synechocystis), allows differentiation between PEPC, RUBISCO, and CBB cycle activities within one molecule. We explored in source fragmentation of gas chromatography-electron impact ionization-mass spectrometry (GC-EI-MS) at nominal mass resolution and GC-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-MS (GC-APCI-MS) at high mass resolution. This enabled the determination of fractional 13C enrichment (E13C) at each carbon position of aspartate. Two prevailing GC-MS derivatization methods, i.e. trimethylsilylation and tert-butyldimethylsilylation, were evaluated. The method was validated by 13C-isotopomer mixtures of positional labeled aspartic acid. Combination with dynamic 13CO2 labeling of Synechocystis cultures allowed direct measurements of PEPC activity in vivo alongside analyses of RUBISCO and CBB cycle activities. Accurate quantification of aspartate concentration and positional E13C provided molar Ci assimilation rates during the day and night phases of photoautotrophic Synechocystis cultures. The validated method offers several applications to characterize the photosynthetic Ci fixation in different organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Moreover, while pathological forms of aSyn have been detected outside the brain (e.g., in skin, gut, blood), the functional significance of these peripheral aSyn species is unclear. Here, we developed assays using monoclonal antibodies selective for two different aSyn species generated in vitro -- termed Strain A and Strain B -- and used them to evaluate human brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma, through immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunoassay, and immunoblotting. Surprisingly, we found that plasma aSyn species detected by these antibodies differentiated individuals with PD vs. DLB in a discovery cohort (UPenn, n=235, AUC 0.83) and a multi-site replication cohort (PD Biomarker Program, or PDBP, n=200, AUC 0.72). aSyn plasma species detected by the Strain A antibody also predicted rate of cognitive decline in PD. We found no evidence for aSyn strains in CSF, and ability to template aSyn fibrillization differed for species isolated from plasma vs. brain, and in PD vs. DLB. Taken together, our findings suggest that aSyn conformational differences may impact clinical presentation and cortical spread of pathological aSyn. Moreover, the enrichment of these aSyn strains in plasma implicates a non-central nervous system source.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Missense variants in these genes can result in gain or loss of the NMDAR function, requiring opposite therapeutic treatments. Computational methods that predict pathogenicity and molecular functional effects are therefore crucial for accurate diagnosis and therapeutic applications. We assembled missense variants: 201 from patients, 631 from general population, and 159 characterized by electrophysiological readouts showing whether they can enhance or reduce the receptor function. This includes new functional data from 47 variants reported here, for the first time. We found that pathogenic/benign variants and variants that increase/decrease the channel function were distributed unevenly on the protein structure, with spatial proximity to ligands bound to the agonist and antagonist binding sites being key predictive features. Leveraging distances from ligands, we developed two independent machine learning-based predictors for NMDAR missense variants: a pathogenicity predictor which outperforms currently available predictors (AUC=0.945, MCC=0.726), and the first binary predictor of molecular function (increase or decrease) (AUC=0.809, MCC=0.523). Using these, we reclassified variants of uncertain significance in the ClinVar database and refined a previous genome-informed epidemiological model to estimate the birth incidence of molecular mechanism-defined GRIN disorders.

Epigenetic switches, acting at single gene loci, can generate extended delays in the activation timing of lineage-specifying genes, and thereby impact lineage decisions and cell type output of progenitors. Here, we analyzed a timed epigenetic switch controlling Bcl11b, a transcription factor that drives T cell lineage commitment, but only after a long multi-day time delay in expression. To investigate roles for this delay in controlling lineage decision making, we analyzed progenitors with a deletion in a distal Bcl11b enhancer, that further extends this delay by [~]3 days. Strikingly, delaying Bcl11b activation reduces T cell output but enhances ILC generation in the thymus, and does so by redirecting progenitors to the ILC lineages at the T and ILC developmental branchpoint. Mechanistically, delaying Bcl11b activation promoted ILC redirection by up-regulating a PLZF-dependent ILC transcriptional program in progenitors. Despite up-regulating PLZF, committed ILC progenitors were still capable of later activating Bcl11b, which is also needed for specification of type 2 ILCs. These results show that epigenetic switches, by controlling the activation timing and order of lineage-specifying genes within regulatory networks, can modulate population sizes and proportions of differentiated cell types.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Many cell cycle genes have promoters and enhancers that remain accessible even when cells are terminally differentiated and in a non-cycling state, suggesting their repression must be maintained long term. In contrast, enhancer decommissioning has been observed for rate-limiting cell cycle genes in the Drosophila wing, a tissue where the cells die soon after eclosion, but it has been unclear if this also occurs in other contexts of terminal differentiation. In this study, we show that enhancer decommissioning also occurs at specific, rate-limiting cell cycle genes in the long-lived tissues of the Drosophila eye and brain, and we propose this loss of chromatin accessibility may help maintain a robust postmitotic state. We examined the decommissioned enhancers at specific rate-limiting cell cycle genes and show that they encode dynamic temporal and spatial expression patterns that include shared, as well as tissue-specific elements, resulting in broad gene expression with developmentally controlled temporal regulation. We extend our analysis to cell cycle gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the mammalian retina using a published dataset, and find that the principles of cell cycle gene regulation identified in terminally differentiating Drosophila tissues are conserved in the differentiating mammalian retina. We propose a robust, non-cycling status is maintained in long-lived postmitotic tissues through a combination of stable repression at most cell cycle gens, alongside enhancer decommissioning at specific rate-limiting cell cycle genes.

HighlightsIn long-lived postmitotic Drosophila tissues, most cell cycle genes retain accessible chromatin despite persistent transcriptional downregulation.

Cell cycle genes with accessible enhancers remain activatable during terminal differentiation, suggesting their repression must be continuously maintained in the postmitotic state.

Long-lived postmitotic tissues decommission enhancers at specific, rate-limiting cell cycle genes in a developmentally regulated manner.

Genome-wide enhancer identification performed in cell culture misses many developmentally dynamic enhancers in vivo.

Decommissioned enhancers at cell cycle genes include shared and tissue-specific elements that in combination, result in broad gene expression with temporal regulation.

However, the early diagnosis of endometriosis is still restricted. The purpose of this investigation is to identify and validate the key biomarkers of endometriosis. Next generation sequencing (NGS) dataset GSE243039 was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between endometriosis and normal control samples were identified. After screening of DEGs, gene ontology (GO) and REACTOME pathway enrichment analyses were performed. Furthermore, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and modules were analysed using the Human Integrated Protein-Protein Interaction rEference (HIPIE) database and Cytoscape software, and hub genes were identified. Subsequantely, a network between miRNAs and hub genes, and network between TFss and hub genes were constructed using the miRNet and NetworkAnalyst tool, and possible key miRNAs and TFs were predicted. Finally, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to validate the hub genes. A total of 958 DEGs, including 479 up regulated genes and 479 down regulated genes, were screened between endometriosis and normal control samples. GO and REACTOME pathway enrichment analyses of the 958 DEGs showed that they were mainly involved in multicellular organismal process, developmental process, signaling by GPCR and muscle contraction.

Recent studies have highlighted the existence of sub-micron assemblies, known as nanocondensates or mesoscopic clusters, in the organization of a significant portion of the proteome. However, as smaller condensates are invisible to classical microscopy, new tools must be developed to quantify their numbers and properties. Here, we establish a simple analysis framework using single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy to quantify the formation of nanocondensates diffusing in solution. We used the low-complexity domain of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) as a model system to show that we can recapitulate the phase separation diagram of the protein in various conditions. Single molecule spectroscopy reveals rapid formation of TDP-43 nanoclusters at ten-fold lower concentrations than described previously by microscopy. We demonstrate how straightforward fingerprinting of individual nanocondensates provides an exquisite quantification of their formation, size, density, and their temporal evolution. Overall, this study highlights the potential of single molecule spectroscopy to investigate the formation of biomolecular condensates and liquid-liquid phase separation mechanisms in protein systems.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Probiotic bacteria like many lactobacilli help prevent or repair dysbiosis but it is largely unclear which molecules of these bacteria mediate the probiotic effects. Given the extensive crosstalk between the immune system and microbiome members, we investigated whether lactobacilli activate the formyl-peptide receptor 2 (FPR2), a pattern recognition receptor that is expressed on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells and known to promote wound healing and immune homeostasis. Probiotic strains of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus were isolated from probiotic compounds and sequenced. Calcium influx experiments in FPR1 or FPR2 overexpressing HL60 cells, and primary human neutrophils, along with pharmacological inhibition of FPR2, revealed that culture filtrates of the isolated lactobacilli strongly activate FPR2, promote killing of the methicillin resistant S. aureus USA300 and induce neutrophil chemotaxis. Pretreatment of culture filtrates with proteinase K reduced FPR2 activity, indicating that the FPR2 ligands are peptides. In silico analysis of the amphipathic properties of the signal peptides of lactic acid bacteria identified selected signal peptides of L. plantarum with the ability to predominantly activate FPR2 in vitro. Thereby, via targeted activation of FPR2, peptides released by some lactobacilli are likely to positively influence the outcome of inflammatory gut diseases and could be used to treat inflammatory diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Gestational PFAS exposure is can adversely affect offspring, yet individual and cumulative impacts of PFAS on the placental epigenome remain underexplored. Here, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to examine the relationships between placental PFAS levels and DNA methylation in a cohort of mother-infant dyads in Arkansas. We measured 17 PFAS in human placental tissues and quantified placental DNA methylation levels via the Illumina EPIC Microarray. We tested for differential DNA methylation with individual PFAS, and with mixtures of multiple PFAS. Our results demonstrated that numerous epigenetic loci were perturbed by PFAS, with PFHxS exhibiting the most abundant effects. Mixture analyses suggested cumulative effects of PFOA and PFOS, while PFHxS may act more independently. We additionally explored whether sex-specific effects may be present and concluded that future large studies should explicitly test for sex-specific effects. The genes that are annotated to our PFAS-associated epigenetic loci are primarily involved in growth processes and cardiometabolic health, while some genes are involved in neurodevelopment.

Clonal cellular amplification of some of these mutations can cause cancer and other diseases. However, it is as yet unclear if and to what extent an increased burden of random mutations can affect cellular function without clonal amplification. We tested this in cell culture, which avoids the limitation that an increased mutation burden in vivo typically leads to cancer. We performed single-cell whole-genome sequencing of primary fibroblasts from DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficient Msh2-/- mice and littermate control animals after long-term passaging. Apart from analyzing somatic mutation burden we analyzed clonality, mutational signatures, and hotspots in the genome, characterizing the complete landscape of somatic mutagenesis in normal and MMR-deficient mouse primary fibroblasts during passaging. While growth rate of Msh2-/-fibroblasts was not significantly different from the controls, the number of de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) increased linearly up until at least 30,000 SNVs per cell, with the frequency of small insertions and deletions (INDELs) plateauing in the Msh2-/- fibroblasts to about 10,000 INDELS per cell. We provide evidence for negative selection and large-scale mutation-driven population changes, including significant clonal expansion of preexisting mutations and widespread cell-strain-specific hotspots. Overall, our results provide evidence that increased somatic mutation burden drives significant cell evolutionary changes in a dynamic cell culture system without significant effects on growth. Since similar selection processes against mutations preventing organ and tissue dysfunction during aging are difficult to envision, these results suggest that increased somatic mutation burden can play a causal role in aging and diseases other than cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Mapping these physical properties and biochemical activities genome-wide - through profiling chromatin accessibility and active transcription - are key tools used to understand the logic and mechanisms of transcription and its regulation. However, the relationship between these two states has until now not been accessible to simultaneous measurement. To address this, we developed KAS-ATAC, a combination of the KAS-seq (Kethoxal-Assisted SsDNA sequencing and ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) methods for mapping single-stranded DNA (and thus active transcription) and chromatin accessibility, respectively, enabling the genome-wide identification of DNA fragments that are simultaneously accessible and contain ssDNA. We use KAS-ATAC to evaluate levels of active transcription over different classes of regulatory elements in the human genome, to estimate the absolute levels of transcribed accessible DNA over CREs, to map the nucleosomal configurations associated with RNA polymerase activities, and to assess transcription factor association with transcribed DNA through transcription factor binding site (TFBS) footprinting. We observe lower levels of transcription over distal enhancers compared to promoters, surprisingly high abundance of ssDNA immediately around/within CTCF occupancy footprints, and distinct nucleosomal configurations around transcription initiation sites associated with active transcription. Remarkably, most TFs associate equally with transcribed and non-transcribed DNA but a few factors specifically do not exhibit footprints over ssDNA-containing fragments. We anticipate KAS-ATAC to continue to derive useful insights into chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation in other contexts in the future.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

The nutritional and homeostatic regulators of energy homeostasis have been studied in detail; however, how developmental signals might impinge on these pathways to govern cellular metabolism is poorly understood. Here, we identify a non-canonical role for Hedgehog (Hh), a classic regulator of development, in maintaining intestinal lipid homeostasis in C. elegans. We find that expression of two Hh ligands, GRD-3 and GRD-4, is controlled by the LIN-29/EGR transcription factor in the hypodermis, where the Hh secretion factor CHE-14/Dispatched also facilitates non-cell autonomous Hh signaling. We demonstrate, using C. elegans and mouse hepatocytes, that Hh metabolic regulation does not occur through the canonical Hh transcription factor, TRA-1/GLI, but rather through non-canonical signaling that engages mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) in the intestine. Hh mutants display impaired lipid homeostasis, including reduced lipoprotein synthesis and fat accumulation, decreased growth, and upregulation of autophagy factors, mimicking loss of mTORC2. Additionally, we found that Hh inhibits p38 MAPK signaling in parallel to mTORC2 activation and that both pathways act together to modulate of lipid homeostasis. Our findings show a non-canonical role for Hedgehog signaling in lipid metabolism via regulation of core homeostatic pathways and reveal a new mechanism by which developmental timing events govern metabolic decisions.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

In this study, we utilized a single-cell multi-omics approach to profile the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in Apis mellifera antennal nuclei, aiming to elucidate OR gene expression and its underlying regulatory mechanisms. Our systematical analysis unveiled a similar singular expression pattern of ligand-specific receptors in Apis mellifera OSNs, parallel with those observed in Drosophila melanogaster. Mechanistically, we discovered that promoter activation of OR genes orchestrates receptor expression patterns. For instance, although multiple adjacent OR genes are co-expressed with a single active promoter through polycistronic transcription, only the first OR gene could produce functional receptor protein, as supported by transcriptome quantification in OSNs. Additionally, we found that co-expression of receptor proteins might occur only when co-expressed OR genes possess multiple accessible promoters. This scenario is less common than expected, considering the number and evolutionary age of OR genes in Apis mellifera, suggesting a selection favoring the specialization of rapidly expanded OR genes in Apis mellifera. Overall, our study provides significant insights into the insect olfaction system and the regulatory mechanisms of OR genes expression.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

TP53, TP63, and TP73--the three members of the p53 family--regulate gene expression by binding to their DNA binding sites, many of which are situated within nucleosomes. To thoroughly examine the nucleosome-binding abilities of the p53 family, we used Pioneer-seq, a technique that assesses a transcription factors binding affinity to its DNA binding sites at all possible positions within the nucleosome core particle. Using Pioneer-seq, we analyzed the binding affinity of TP53, TP63, and TP73 to 10 p53-family binding sites across the nucleosome core particle. We found that the affinity of TP53, TP63, and TP73 for nucleosomes was largely determined by the positioning of p53-family binding sites within nucleosomes; p53-family members bind strongly to the more accessible edges of nucleosomes but weakly to the less accessible centers of nucleosomes. We also found that the DNA-helical orientation of p53-family binding sites within nucleosomal DNA impacted the nucleosome-binding affinity of p53-family members. The composition of their binding sites also impacted each p53-family members nucleosome-binding affinities only when the binding site was located in an accessible location. Taken together, our results show that the accessibility, composition, and helical orientation of p53-family binding sites collectively determine the nucleosome-binding affinities of TP53, TP63, and TP73. These findings help explain the rules underlying p53-family-nucleosome binding and thus provide requisite insight into how we may better control gene-expression changes involved in development and tumor suppression.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Through single-cell analysis of extended live imaging, we unveiled how cell cycle-regulated DSB repair guides disparate mitotic catastrophe outcomes. Our data reveal that toxic double Holliday junctions (dHjs) generated during homologous recombination (HR) promote non-immunogenic intrinsic apoptosis in the immediate mitosis after S or G2-phase DSB induction. Conversely, the combined activity of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), microhomology mediated end joining (MMEJ), and single strand annealing (SSA) enable G1 phase cells to tolerate high DSB loads at the cost of aberrant cell division, innate immune response activation and delayed extrinsic lethality. Targeting NHEJ, MMEJ, or SSA promotes HR-dependent mitotic death, while suppressing mitotic death fosters a robust immunogenic response. Together the data indicate that a temporal repair hierarchy, coupled with cumulative DSB load, serves as a reliable predictor of mitotic catastrophe outcomes. In this pathway, HR suppress the innate immune response by promoting mitotic lethality.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Theoretical studies present conflicting findings regarding the relationship between seed size and germination rate. Some analyses suggest that species with larger seeds should exhibit rapid germination, while others point to faster germination in smaller seeds. This discrepancy can, for example, be attributed to the higher vulnerability of larger seeds to post-dispersal seed predation. To assess the correlation between seed mass and seed germination characteristics at a global scale, we performed a rigorous meta-analysis of published data sources, covering a wide range of germination traits across 1877 species with diverse dormancy types and global distribution. Additionally, we investigated the potential relationship between seed mass and dormancy level. Our findings revealed contrasting responses of germination traits to seed mass, suggesting complex eco-evolutionary correlations among these traits. Trade-offs and corelated evolution likely played an important role in the evolutionary history of seed mass, with seed mass displaying notable trait conservation across the phylogeny. Interestingly, our study demonstrated that seed dormancy exhibited trade-offs with post-germination traits and seed mass. The meta-analysis demonstrated that any changes in the relationship between seed mass and dormancy is dependent on dormancy types with physiological dormancy showing lower seed mass while other dormancy types were has a higher seed mass. These results underscore the critical role of seed mass in shaping plant performance and provide valuable insights into plant trait evolution. Our findings clearly indicate that the hypothesis of larger seeds conferring advantages in both pre- and post-germination traits might not be empirically true in all cases as theoretical studies suggest and that this relationship is complex and varies among species and growth forms. We interpret these results within the context of germination strategies and correlated evolution between seed dormancy and seed mass. Considering these traits in future analyses of plant germination strategies and species distributions is crucial. Factors such as lifespan, seed mass, and germination-related traits should be carefully considered to gain a comprehensive understanding of plant adaptation to challenging environmental conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

In this study, we identified Pax7 in Lethentero reissneri and multiple bioinformatics analyses suggested that it may represent the ancestral gene of the Pax7 shared among higher vertebrates. To further elucidate the function and regulatory mechanism of Pax7, we performed transcriptome sequencing analysis after silencing Lr.Pax7 expression which revealed alterations in metabolic processes along with associated genes(Plcy,Jagged2,Hes,Myod,Frizzled2,etc) involved in various immune pathways(Notch, Wnt, IL-17, TNF, etc), myogenesis process, adipocyte formation process consistent with those observed in higher vertebrates.

For each potential pathway between hosts, we calculate the likelihood that such a transmission event occurred. This is informed by an epidemiological model of transmission, and host life history data. By including WGS data, we shrink the number of plausible pathways significantly, relative to those deemed likely on the basis of life history data alone.

Haploinsufficiency of TAB2 causes Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) and rare variants in PKA-C and TAK1 cause cardioacrofacial dysplasia (CAFD), and Frontometaphyseal Dysplasia (FMD) and cardiospondylocarpofacial syndrome (CSCFS), respectively, rare multisystem syndromes, where CHD may appear in the clinical spectrum. We hypothesized that TAK1 plays a significant role in heart development and CHD and addressed this by genetic analysis in CHD patient cohorts and experiments in cell and animal models. Exome sequencing data from 1,471 CHD patients with extracardiac anomalies (syndromic CHD, sCHD), 2,405 patients with nonsyndromic CHD (nsCHD) and 45,082 controls showed increased burden of rare TAB2 and TAK1 variants in sCHD, but not in nsCHD. Detailed characterization of tak1-/- and tab2-/- zebrafish mutants revealed cardiac defects (dilated atrium, trabeculation defects, tachycardia and reduced contractility) as well as extracardiac developmental anomalies. RNA sequencing of tak1-/- mutant hearts showed downregulation of genes encoding core cardiac transcription factors, sarcomeric proteins and extracellular matrix proteins. Experiments with cell cultures and analysis of zebrafish larvae and gastruloids indicated that TAK1 via TAB2 and PKA-C is activated at the primary cilium during cardiomyogenesis and that TAK1 activation at this site is enhanced by cardiomyogenic signaling molecules, including ligands of the TGFB/BMP superfamily. Consistent with these findings, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of TAK1 or administration of small molecule inhibitors targeting TAK1 inhibited ciliary signaling and cardiomyocyte differentiation in vitro, while FMD-causing mutations in TAK1 reduced its ciliary localization. In conclusion, our data establishes a central role for TAK1 and its upstream regulators in cardiac development and syndromic CHD, coordinated via the primary cilium.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Our previous work leveraged a custom-built peristalsis bioreactor to demonstrate that colonic peristalsis led to cancer stem cell enrichment in colorectal cancer cells. However, this malignant mechanotransductive response was confined to select CRC lines that harbored an oncogenic mutation in the KRAS gene. In this work, therefore, we explored the involvement of activating KRAS mutations on peristalsis-associated mechanotransduction in CRC. Peristalsis enriched the cancer stem cell marker LGR5 in KRAS mutant (G13D, etc.) lines, in a Wnt-independent manner. Conversely, LGR5 enrichment in wild type KRAS lines exposed to peristalsis were minimal. LGR5 enrichment downstream of peristalsis translated to increased tumorigenicity in vivo in KRAS mutant vs. wild type lines. Differences in mechanotransduction response was additionally apparent via unbiased gene set enrichment analysis, where many unique pathways were enriched in wild type vs. mutant lines, in response to peristalsis. Interestingly, peristalsis also triggered {beta}-catenin nuclear localization independent of Wnt, particularly in KRAS mutant lines. The central involvement of KRAS in the mechanotransductive responses was validated via gain and loss of function strategies. {beta}-catenin activation and LGR5 enrichment downstream of peristalsis converged to the activation of the MEK/ERK kinase cascade, that remains active in cells that harbor oncogenic KRAS mutations. Taken together, our results demonstrated that oncogenic KRAS mutations conferred a unique peristalsis-associated mechanotransduction response to colorectal cancer cells, resulting in cancer stem cell enrichment and increased tumorigenicity.

These traits include bacterial secretion systems (SSs) that range from Type I (T1SS) to Type IX (T9SS) and can play diverse roles. The best known functions are to secrete various proteins or other compounds into the extracellular space or into neighbouring cells, including toxins to attack other microbes or effectors to suppress plant host immune responses. Here, we aimed to determine which bacterial SS's were associated with the plant rhizosphere. We utilised paired metagenomic datasets of rhizosphere and bulk soil samples from five different plant species grown in a wide variety of soil types, amounting to ten different studies. The T3SS and T6SS were generally enriched in the rhizosphere, as observed in studies of individual plant-associated genera. We also identified additional SS's that have received less attention thus far, such as the T2SS, T5SS and Bacteroidetes-specific T6SSiii and T9SS. The predicted secreted proteins of some of these systems (T3SS, T5SS and T6SS) could be linked to functions such as toxin secretion, adhesion to the host and facilitation of plant-host interactions (such as root penetration). The most prominent bacterial taxa with rhizosphere- or soil-enriched SS's included Xanthomonadaceae, Oxalobacteraceae, Comamonadaceae, Caulobacteraceae, and Chitinophagaceae, broadening the scope of known plant-associated taxa that use these systems. We anticipate that the SSs and taxa identified in this study may be utilised for the optimisation of bioinoculants to improve plant productivity.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity and establishing a predictive model is highly relevant for future agriculture under changing climate. Here, we investigated the genetic basis of leaf width plasticity in a tobacco MAGIC population across four different environments. Environmental changes not only resulted in differences in leaf width mean but also in leaf width plasticity. A total of 45 QTL were identified, including 14 QTL for leaf width mean and 43 for leaf width plasticity, with 12 overlap. Changes in the environment affected the magnitude of several QTL, thereby influencing phenotypic plasticity. We identified a QTL, qLW14, associated with leaf width plasticity and leaf width mean at Zhucheng, but had no significant impact at Guiyang, indicating that changes in the environment contributed to variations in leaf width plasticity. By integrating genetic diversity, environmental variation, and their interactions into a unified model, we were able to build a model for cross-environment predictions, and improved prediction accuracy by 7.2%. Overall, this study reveals complex genetic basis involving multiple alleles, and genotype interactions underlying variations of leaf width mean and plasticity. These findings contribute to assessing the role of plasticity in responding to climate or other environmental changes.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Emerging evidence underscores the significant role of potassium channels in multiple aspects of PD etiology. We recently identified a PD-linked genetic mutation in the KCNJ15 gene (KCNJ15p.R28C), encoding the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.2, within a four-generation family with familial PD. The role of the Kir4.2 channel, especially in neurodegenerative diseases, remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of the KCNJ15p.R28C (Kir4.2R28C) mutation on the biophysical and biochemical properties of Kir4.2. Employing Kir4.2-overexpressing HEK293T cells as our model, we investigated how the mutation affects the channels biophysical properties, total protein expression, endoplasmic reticulum and lysosome processing, and plasma membrane trafficking. Patch clamp studies revealed that the Kir4.2R28C mutation results in loss of channel function, exhibiting a strong dominant-negative effect. This can be partially attributed to the significantly diminished overall expression of the mutant channel protein compared to the wild-type (Kir4.2WT). We observed that both Kir4.2WT and Kir4.2R28C proteins undergo glycosylation during the post-translational modification process, albeit with differing protein turnover efficiencies. Furthermore, the KCNJ15p.R28Cmutation exhibits reduced stability compared to Kir4.2WT and is more susceptible to protein recycling through the lysosomal degradation pathway. Additionally, Kir4.2R28C displayed reduced plasma membrane trafficking capacity compared to Kir4.2WT. These findings suggest that the Kir4.2R28C mutant possesses unique biomolecular and biophysical characteristics distinct from the Kir4.2WT channel, which potentially elucidates its role in the pathogenesis of PD.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

While extensive research has enhanced our understanding of S. cerevisiae, the development of multi-species fermentation starters has led to increased interest in yeast interactions and the role of microbial diversity in winemaking. Consequently, molecular methods have emerged to identify the different species at different stages of the winemaking process. Model microbial communities or consortia, which provide simplified systems resembling natural microbial diversity, offer opportunities to investigate population dynamics and understand the role of community diversity in ecosystem performance.

Here, this work aims to design a yeast consortium reflecting the diversity of wine yeasts and to develop a method for accurately tracking their population dynamics during fermentation. We developed and characterized a six-species consortium, with S. cerevisiae, Hanseniaspora uvarum, Starmerella bacillaris, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Lachancea thermotolerans and Torulaspora delbrueckii. By tagging each yeast species with distinct fluorescent markers, the study enables real-time monitoring of individual species within the consortium using flow cytometry. We have carried out a complete analysis of this consortium, studying the evolution of populations over time and examining factors such as metabolite production and fermentation kinetics.

In addition, the yeast consortium was used to test the diversity-function relationship as a proof of concept. We sought to determine the impact of the initial evenness on communities performances subjected to osmotic stress. To this end, ten randomly designed consortia with varying initial species proportions were followed in enological fermentation with 200 and 280 g/L of initial sugars. Although no demonstrable effect of the initial evenness was shown, the usefulness of this consortium has been demonstrated. Moreover, the initial proportion of certain species on population dynamics and metabolite production were observed.

The consortium presented in this work and available to the scientific community can contribute to future work trying to decipher multispecies dynamics and exploring the role of yeast diversity in wine fermentation.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Here we investigated this question by asking participants to perform a delayed match to sample task for the contrast of visual gratings as cues. In the ""Imagery"" condition, participants were asked to form an accurate mental image of the visual cue, and at the end of the trial, perform a matching task on the mental image contrast. In the ""Memory"" condition, participants were not required to perform visual imagery but merely instructed to perform the delayed contrast-matching task. In Experiment 1, participants were told at the beginning of each block whether to engage in memory or imagery. The results showed that for the relevant contrast feature, matching judgments were more accurately in the ""Memory"" than in the ""Imagery"" condition. Thus imagery did not maintain an accurate representation of the encoded image, even when the visual features could still be maintained in visual short-term memory. In Experiment 2, participants were required to engage in memory and imagery simultaneously, and were told which to base their judgment on after each trial. The key finding was that the superior accuracy for memory over imagery remained, indicating that the contents of VSTM and imagery are based on distinct representations.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

However, the urban setting has received comparatively less focus despite its significance in attracting rural to urban migration. Unplanned urbanization, often overlooked, exacerbates insecticide resistance as Anopheles mosquitoes adapt to the polluted environments of rapidly expanding cities. This study aimed to assess the insecticide susceptibility status of malaria vectors and identify potential underlying mechanisms across three distinct ecological settings characterized by differing levels of urbanization in Kisumu County, Kenya.

MethodsField-derived An. gambiae (s.l.) larvae collected from a long stretch of urban-to-rural continuum were phenotyped as either resistant or susceptible to six different insecticides using the World Health Organization (WHO) susceptibility test. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques were used to identify the species of the An. gambiae complex and screened for mutations at voltage-gated sodium channels (Vgsc-1014F, Vgsc-1014S, Vgsc-1575Y) and acetylcholinesterase Ace1-119S. Metabolic enzymes activities (non-specific {beta}-esterases and monooxygenases) were evaluated in mosquitoes not exposed to insecticides using microplate assays. Additionally, during larval sampling, a retrospective questionnaire survey was conducted to determine pesticide usage by the local inhabitants.

ResultsAnopheles arabiensis dominated in urban (96.2%) and peri-urban (96.8%) areas, while An. gambiae (s.s.) was abundant in rural settings (82.7%). Urban mosquito populations showed high resistance intensity to deltamethrin (Mortality rate: 85.2% at 10x) and suspected resistance to Pirimiphos-methyl and bendiocarb while peri-urban and rural populations exhibited moderate resistance intensity to deltamethrin (mortality rate >98% at 10x). Preexposure of mosquitoes to a synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) significantly increased mortality rates: from 40.7% to 88.5% in urban, 51.9% to 90.3% in peri-urban, and 55.4% to 87.6% in rural populations for deltamethrin, and from 41.4% to 78.8% in urban, 43.7% to 90.7% in peri-urban, and 35% to 84.2% in rural populations for permethrin. In contrast, 100% mortality to chlorfenapyr and clothianidin was observed in all the populations tested. The prevalence of L1014F mutation was notably higher in urban An. arabiensis (0.22) unlike the peri-urban (0.11) and rural (0.14) populations while the L1014S mutation was more prevalent in rural An. gambiae (0.93). Additionally, urban An. arabiensis exhibited elevated levels of mixed function oxidases (0.8/mg protein) and non-specific esterases (2.12/mg protein) compared to peri-urban (0.57/mg protein and 1.5/mg protein, respectively) and rural populations (0.6/mg protein and 1.8/mg protein, respectively). Pyrethroids, apart from their use in public health through LLINs, were being highly used for agricultural purposes across all ecological settings (urban 38%, peri-urban 36% and rural 37%) followed by amidine group, with organophosphates, neonicotinoids and carbamates being of secondary importance.

ConclusionThese findings show high resistance of An. arabiensis to insecticides commonly used for vector control, linked with increased levels of detoxification enzymes. The observed intensity of resistance underscores the pressing issue of insecticide resistance in urban areas, potentially compromising the effectiveness of vector control measures, especially pyrethroid-treated LLINs. Given the species unique behavior and ecology compared to An. gambiae, tailored vector control strategies are needed to address this concern in urban settings.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Notch signaling is a well-known regulator of epidermal differentiation, and has also been shown to be involved in postnatal maintenance of SGs. However, the precise role of Notch signaling in regulating SG differentiation in the adult homeostatic skin remains unclear. While there is evidence to suggest that Notch1 is the primary Notch receptor involved in regulating the differentiation process, the ligand remains unknown. Using monoclonal therapeutic antibodies designed to specifically inhibit of each of the Notch ligands or receptors, we have identified the Jag2/Notch1 signaling axis as the primary regulator of sebocyte differentiation in homeostatic skin. Mature sebocytes are lost upon specific inhibition of the Jag2 ligand or Notch1 receptor, resulting in the accumulation of proliferative stem/progenitor cells in the SG. Most strikingly, this phenotype is reversible, as these stem/progenitor cells re-enter differentiation when the inhibition of Notch activity is lifted. Thus, Notch activity promotes correct sebocyte differentiation, and is required to restrict progenitor proliferation.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Microbial pathogens and invertebrate herbivores such as plant-parasitic nematodes and caterpillars show geographical and temporal variation in activity patterns and may respond differently to certain plant defensive mechanisms. As such, plant interactions with multiple community members may result in conflicting selection pressures on genetic polymorphisms. Here, through assays with different above- and belowground herbivores, the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) and the southern root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita), respectively, and comparison with rice responses to microbial pathogens, we identify potential genetic trade-offs at the KSL8 and MG1 loci on chromosome 11. KSL8 encodes the first committed step towards biosynthesis of either stemarane- or stemodane-type diterpenoids through the japonica (KSL8-jap) or indica (KSL8-ind) allele. Knocking out KSL8-jap and CPS4, encoding an enzyme that acts upstream in diterpenoid synthesis, in japonica rice cultivars increased resistance to S. frugiperda and decreased resistance to M. incognita. Furthermore, MG1 resides in a haplotype that provided resistance to M. incognita, while alternative haplotypes are involved in mediating resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and other pests and pathogens. Finally, KSL8 and MG1 alleles are located within trans-species haplotypes and may be evolving under long-term balancing selection. Our data are consistent with a hypothesis that polymorphisms at KSL8 and MG1 may be maintained through complex and diffuse community interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Long ignored, mouse ultrasonic communication is now considered to be an important aspect of their social life, transferring information such as individual identity or stress levels. However, whether and how mice modulate their acoustic communications is largely unknown. Here we show that a wild mouse species with a complex social system controls its vocal production both qualitatively and quantitatively, depending on social context. We found that the African striped mouse Rhabdomys pumilio, a cooperatively breeding species, has a vocal repertoire consisting of seven call types, which it uses differently depending on whether the individuals encounter another mouse that is familiar, unfamiliar, of the same or different sex. Familiar individuals, whether of the same or different sex, vocalize more than two unfamiliar same-sex individuals. The greatest diversity of vocalisations is recorded when a female and a male first encounter, suggesting that certain calls are reserved for courtship. Our results highlight that familiar mice alternate their vocalisations (turn-taking) while unfamiliar individuals tend to overlap one another. These observations suggest that African striped mice control the production and temporal dynamics of their vocalisations, addressing targeted information to specific receivers via the acoustic channel.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

However, studies investigating the effects of EPA and DHA on colorectal carcinogenesis (CRC) have yielded conflicting results. The factors that determine these discrepant results remain unknown. Resolvins, oxidative metabolites of EPA and DHA, inhibit key pro-tumorigenic cytokine and chemokine signaling of colorectal cancer (e.g., IL-6, IL-1{beta}, and CCL2). 15-lipoxygenase-1 (ALOX15), a critical enzyme for resolvin generation is commonly lost during human CRC. Whether ALOX15 expression, as a host factor, modulates the effects of EPA and DHA on CRC remains unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of ALOX15 transgenic expression in colonic epithelial cells on resolvin generation by EPA and DHA and CRC in mouse models representative of human CRC. Our results revealed that 1) EPA and DHA effects on CRC were diverse, ranging from suppressive to promotive, and these effects were occasionally altered by the formulations of EPA and DHA (free fatty acid, ethyl ester, triglyceride); 2) EPA and DHA uniformly suppressed CRC in the presence of intestinal ALOX15 transgenic expression, which induced the production of resolvins, decreased colonic CCL3-5 and CXCL-5 expression and tumor associated macrophages while increasing CD8 T cell abundance in tumor microenvironment; and 3) RvD5, the predominant resolvin produced by ALOX15, inhibited macrophage generation of pro-tumorigenic cytokines. These findings demonstrate the significance of intestinal ALOX15 expression as a host factor in determining the effects of EPA and DHA on CRC.

SignificanceEicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are widely used as dietary supplements and FDA-approved treatments for hypertriglyceridemia. Studies of EPA and DHA effects on colorectal carcinogenesis (CRC) have revealed inconsistencies; factors determining the direction of their impact on CRC have remained unidentified. Our data show that EPA and DHA effects on CRC were divergent and occasionally influenced by their formulations. More importantly, intestinal 15-lipoxgenase-1 (ALOX15) expression modulated EPA and DHA effects on CRC, leading to their consistent suppression of CRC. ALOX15 promoted EPA and DHA oxidative metabolism to generate resolvins, which inhibited key pro-tumorigenic inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6. IL-1{beta}, and CCL2. ALOX15 is therefore an important host factor in determining EPA and DHA effects on CRC.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Upon infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is deposited in the alveoli and encounters the lung mucosa or alveolar lining fluid (ALF). We previously determined that increased M.tb replication in human macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells (ATs) is mediated by age-associated changes in human ALF. Here we determine the transcriptional profile of M.tb when exposed to healthy ALF from adult (A-ALF) or elderly (E-ALF) individuals before and during infection of ATs.

ResultsPrior to infection, exposure to E-ALF upregulates M.tb genes associated with the ESX-4 secretion system, immunomodulatory proteins from the ESX-5 system, and genes encoding phospholipases, phosphatases, and proteases. During infection, E-ALF exposure upregulates key M.tb genes from the ESX-5 secretion system, genes associated with PDIMs biosynthesis and transport, and genes linked to bacterial oxidative stress defense mechanisms.

ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate how altered ALF in old age can impact the metabolic status of M.tb, enabling greater adaptation to the host and potentially explaining Mtbs increased survival within host cells. Importantly, we present the first transcriptomic analysis on the impact of the elderly lung mucosa on M.tb pathogenesis during intracellular replication in ATs.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

To address this, we asked fifty-two healthy participants undergoing simultaneous EEG and motion tracking recordings (split into two experiments) and ten patients undergoing simultaneous intracranial EEG and motion tracking recordings to complete a series of orientation tasks in which they made physical head rotations to target positions. We then used a series of forward encoding models and linear mixed-effects models to isolate electrophysiological activity that was specifically tuned to heading direction. We identified a robust posterior central signature that predicts changes in veridical head orientation after regressing out confounds including sensory input and muscular activity. Both source localisation and intracranial analysis implicated the medial temporal lobe as the origin of this effect. Subsequent analyses disentangled head direction signatures from signals relating to head rotation and those reflecting location-specific effects. Lastly, when directly comparing head direction and eye gaze-related tuning, we found that the brain maintains both codes while actively navigating, with stronger tuning to head direction in the medial temporal lobe. Together, these results reveal a taxonomy of population-level head direction signals within the human brain that is reminiscent of those reported in the single units of rodents.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Understanding the spatial interplay between the different structures of the nephron and renal vasculature is crucial. Recent efforts have demonstrated the value of three-dimensional (3D) imaging in revealing new insights into the various components of the kidney; however, these studies used antibodies or autofluorescence to detect structures and so were limited in their ability to compare the many subtle structures of the kidney at once. Here, through 3D reconstruction of fetal rhesus macaque kidneys at cellular resolution, we demonstrate the power of deep learning in exhaustively labelling seventeen microstructures of the kidney. Using these tissue maps, we interrogate the spatial distribution and spatial correlation of the glomeruli, renal arteries, and the nephron. This work demonstrates the power of deep learning applied to 3D tissue images to improve our ability to compare many microanatomical structures at once, paving the way for further works investigating renal pathologies.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

Besides the reduction of the fin, the nfr mutant also exhibited other phenotype associated with ectodermal cell lineages including loss of scales, deformation in the gill structure such as decreasing the number of gill filaments, the reduction in the number of jaw teeth, pharyngeal teeth and gill rakers. Illumina RNAseq with 12 embryos each from mutants, siblings and the parental WT strain Hon9 identified a mutation in the edaradd in a highly conserved C-terminal death domain. Edaradd is known as a cytoplasmic accessory protein for the Ectodysplasin A (EDA) signalling pathway. To confirm the crucial role of edaradd during fin development, CRISPR RNAs were designed to knock out the gene in another killifish species, Arabian killifish. Indeed, Arabian killifish edaradd crispants showed a potent reduction of the fin development with 100% frequency. Furthermore, EDA crispants also showed identical phenotypes to that of edaradd crispants, confirming the fin defect in the mutants/crispants is caused by the signalling pathway of the EDA in the killifish species. These data demonstrate a powerful genetic approach using isogenic self-fertilising mangrove killifish as a tool for identifying mutants and their mutation, and revealed the crucial role of edaradd in the fish fin development and other ectoderm derived epithelial tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

During development, cell competition enables healthy cells to eliminate less fit cells that could jeopardize tissue integrity, and facilitates the elimination of pre-malignant cells by healthy cells as a surveillance mechanism to prevent oncogenesis. Malignant cells also benefit from cell competition to promote their expansion. Despite its ubiquitous presence, the mechanisms governing cell competition, particularly those common to developmental competition and tumorigenesis, are poorly understood. Here, we show that in Drosophila, the planar cell polarity (PCP) protein Flamingo (Fmi) is required by winners to maintain their status during cell competition in malignant tumors to overtake healthy tissue, in early pre-malignant cells when they overproliferate among wildtype cells, in healthy cells when they later eliminate pre-malignant cells, and by supercompetitors as they compete to occupy excessive territory within wildtype tissues. ""Would-be"" winners that lack Fmi are unable to over-proliferate, and instead become losers. We demonstrate that the role of Fmi in cell competition is independent of PCP, and that it uses a distinct mechanism that may more closely resemble one used in other less well-defined functions of Fmi.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

This study aims to examine the use of NHI claims database for analyzing CS according to the WHO manual for Robson classification. This study is a cross-sectional analysis using delivery claims from NHI sample set data from 2017 to 2018. We categorized the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 codes in the claims data according to the Robson classification system using the following variables: multiple pregnancy, fetal presentation, previous obstetric record, previous CS record, gestational age, and onset of labor. Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics. A total of 31,375 deliveries were included in the analysis. Overall, mean age of mothers was 29.2{+/-}5.9 years. The CS rate in this population was 37.0% in 2017 and 38.7% in 2018. Highest CS rate was found in nulliparous (group 2: 26.6%) and multiparous women (group 4: 24.8%) if labour induced or had prelabour CS, followed by multiparous women with previous uterine scar (group 5: 22.5%). We found an alarmingly high rate of CS among Indonesian women. Implementation of Robson classification in the National Health Insurance claims data is feasible and should be considered by the policy makers as an audit tool to identify the groups that contributes the most to the CS rate.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196834

Uncooked meat fed to dogs is purchased from stores selling meat primarily for human consumption, or it is a brand of commercial raw dog food (RDF), which is commonly sold frozen and thawed prior to feeding. We tested 58 packets of uncooked meat (beef, chicken, lamb and pork) purchased from large chain grocery stores (15 stores) and 15 packets of thawed, chicken-based RDF (11 brands) for the presence of ABR E. coli. All samples were purchased from the city of Bristol, UK. Among grocery store-purchased meat, chicken samples were significantly more likely to be positive for E. coli resistant to amoxicillin, spectinomycin, streptomycin, and the critically important antibiotics cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin, than other types of meat. When comparing grocery store chicken to chicken-based RDF we found no significant difference in sample-level positivity for resistant E. coli, which, for RDF was 80% (amoxicillin), 80% (spectinomycin), 87% (streptomycin), 27% (amoxicillin-clavulanate), 27% (cefotaxime) and 47% (ciprofloxacin). We conclude that despite it having been purchased frozen and thawed prior to testing according to the manufacturers instructions, contamination of RDF with ABR E. coli is similar to that of uncooked meat primarily intended for human consumption after cooking, and so the same strict hygiene practices are advised when handling RDF as uncooked meat. Our findings provide a rationale to explain why feeding uncooked meat or RDF to dogs in the city of Bristol is associated with them excreting E. coli resistant to critically important antibiotics.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196834

The sun or moon can provide directional information via their position; however, they can often be obstructed by clouds, canopy or the horizon. Despite being hidden, these bodies can still provide compass information through the polarised light pattern they produce/reflect. Sunlight produces polarised light patterns across the overhead sky as it enters the atmosphere, and solar polarised light is a well-known compass cue for navigating animals. Moonlight produces an analogous pattern, albeit a million times dimmer than sunlight. Here we show the first evidence that polarised moonlight forms part of the celestial compass of navigating nocturnal ants. Nocturnal bull ants leave their nest at twilight and rely heavily on the overhead solar polarisation pattern to navigate. Yet many foragers return home overnight when the sun cannot guide them. We demonstrate that these bull ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night, by rotating the ambient polarisation pattern above homing ants, who alter their headings in response. Furthermore, these ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons, when polarised light levels are at their lowest. Finally, we show long-term incorporation of this moonlight pattern into the ants path integration system throughout the night for homing, as polarised sunlight is incorporated throughout the day.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835

Drosophila wing-a flat structure and the globular haltere are two homologous flight appendages emerging from a similar group of progenitor cells. The activity of a single Hox transcription factor, Ultrabithorax (Ubx), governs the development of these two distinct organs-wing and haltere with different cell and organ morphologies. Our work reported here on differential development of wing and haltere suggest that the localisation and abundance of actomyosin complexes, apical cell contractility, properties of extracellular matrix, and cell size and shape, which is a result of various cell intrinsic and extrinsic forces, plausibly influence the flat vs. globular geometry of these two organs. We followed the three-dimensional architecture of developing wing and halteres during early pupal morphogenesis, indicating the role of the above-mentioned factors in force generation and in driving differential morphogenesis, leading to different organ shapes. Loss of Ubx function led to wing cell-like cellular features in haltere discs, and corresponding changes at the level of adult organs. We also observed that RNAi-mediated downregulation of Atrophin or Pten, in the background of downregulated Expanded (or elevated Yki), gave rise to varying degrees of haltere to wing homeotic transformations at the cellular as well as adult organ levels. Finally, we provide simulated scenarios based on computational modelling that propose key ingredients required for producing wing- or haltere-like morphologies in Drosophila.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835

Among them, three novel Sertoli cell subtypes phenotypes were identified, namely SC4/immature, SC7/mature, and SC8/further mature Sertoli cells. For each germ or Sertoli cell subtype, we identified unique new markers, among which immunofluorescence confirmed co-localization of ST3GAL4, A2M, ASB9, and TEX19 and DDX4 (classical marker of germ cell). PRAP1, BST2, and CCDC62 were co-expressed with SOX9 (classical marker of Sertoli cell) in testes tissues also confirmed by immunofluorescence. The interaction between germ cell subtypes and Sertoli cell subtypes exhibits stage-specific-matching pattern, as evidenced by SC1/2/5/7 involving in SSC0-2 development, SC3 participating in the whole process of spermiogenesis, SC4/6 participating in Diffing and Diffed-SPG development, and SC8 involving in the final stage of SPT3. This pattern of specific interactions between subtypes of germ cell and Sertoli cell was confirmed by immunofluorescence of novel markers in testes tissues. The interaction was mainly contributed by Notch1/2/3 signaling. Our study profiled the single-cell transcriptome of human spermatogenesis and provided many potentials molecular markers for developing testicular puncture specific marker kits for NOA patients.

The study of mechanical stress on health and aging is a continuously growing field, as major changes to the extracellular matrix and cell-to-cell adhesions can result in dramatic changes to tissue stiffness during aging and diseased conditions. For example, during normal aging, many tissues including the ovaries, skin, blood vessels, and heart exhibit increased stiffness, which can result in a significant reduction in function of that organ. As such, numerous model systems have recently emerged to study the impact of mechanical and physical stress on cell and tissue health, including cell-culture conditions with matrigels and other surfaces that alter substrate stiffness and ex vivo tissue models that can apply stress directly to organs like muscle or tendons. Here, we sought to develop a novel method in an in vivo, model organism setting to study the impact of mechanical stress on aging, by increasing substrate stiffness in solid agar medium of C. elegans. To our surprise, we found shockingly limited impact of growth of C. elegans on stiffer substrates, including limited effects on cellular health, gene expression, organismal health, stress resilience, and longevity.

Whether morphological and kinematic traits always jointly respond to size variation is however poorly known. Here, we examine the relative importance of morphological and kinematic changes in mitigating the consequence of size on aerodynamic force production for weight support in flying insects, focusing on hovering flight of hoverflies (Syrphidae). We compared the flight biomechanics, aerodynamics, and morphology of eight hoverfly species varying from 5 to 100 mg. Our study reveals no effect of body size on wingbeat kinematics among species, suggesting that morphological rather than kinematic changes may compensate for the reduction in weight support associated with an isometric reduction in size. Computational fluid dynamics simulations confirmed that variations in wing morphology, and not kinematics, allow species of different sizes to generate weight support. We specifically show that relatively larger wings and aerodynamically more effective wing shape have evolved in smaller hoverflies, mitigating the reduction in aerodynamic weight support with decreasing size. Altogether, these results suggest that hovering flight of hoverflies underpins highly specialised wingbeat kinematics, which have been conserved throughout evolution; instead, wing morphological adaptations have enabled the evolutionary miniaturisation of hoverflies.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835

We identified low and high doses of DXR compatible with long-term organoid survival. Similar fISC gene activation was observed between organoids treated with low vs high DXR, despite significantly decreased survival at the higher dose. aISCs exhibit dose-dependent loss after DXR but survive at doses compatible with organoid survival. We ablated residual aISCs after DXR using a Lgr52A-DTR allele and observed that aISC survival of the initial genotoxic insult is required for organoid survival following DXR. These results suggest that while typical fISC genes are activated by DXR injury in organoids, functional stemness remains dependent on the aISC pool. Our data establish a reproducible model of DXR injury in intestinal organoids and reveal differences in in vitro responses to an established in vivo damage modality.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835

NCC give rise to a variety of cell types within the developing organism, including neurons and glia of the sympathetic nervous system. It has been suggested that failure in correct NCC differentiation leads to several diseases, including neuroblastoma (NB). During normal NCC development, MYCN is transiently expressed to promote NCC migration, and its downregulation precedes neuronal differentiation. Overexpression of MYCN has been linked to high-risk and aggressive NB progression. For this reason, understanding the effect overexpression of this oncogene has on development of NCC-derived sympathoadrenal progenitors (SAP), which later give rise to sympathetic nerves, will help elucidate the developmental mechanisms that may prime the onset of NB. Here, we found that overexpressing human EGFP-MYCN within SAP lineage cells in zebrafish led to the transient formation of an abnormal SAP population which displayed expanded and elevated expression of NCC markers, while paradoxically also co-expressing SAP and neuronal differentiation markers. The aberrant NCC signature was corroborated with in vivo time lapse confocal imaging in zebrafish larvae, which revealed transient expansion of sox10 reporter expression in MYCN overexpressing SAPs during the early stages of SAP development. In these aberrant MYCN overexpressing SAP cells, we also found evidence of dampened BMP signaling activity, indicating that BMP signaling disruption occurs following elevated MYCN expression, and suggesting BMP is functionally important for the NCC to SAP differentiation transition. In agreement, we discovered that pharmacological inhibition of BMP signaling was sufficient to create an aberrant NCC gene signature in SAP cells, phenocopying MYCN overexpression. Together, our results suggest that MYCN overexpression in SAPs disrupts their differentiation by eliciting abnormal NCC gene expression programs, and dampening BMP signaling response, having developmental implications for the priming of NB in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835

Timely identification of the fetal red blood cell antigen genotype for the antigen to which the pregnant person is alloimmunized is vital for determining fetal risk for HDFN and guiding management. Presently in the US, recommended care is to determine fetal antigen genotype with reproductive partner testing and/or amniocentesis. This approach has many limitations, including availability of reproductive partner testing, risk of nonpaternity, and low uptake of invasive testing such as amniocentesis. These barriers to obtaining fetal antigen genotype information lead to pregnancies not at risk for HDFN undergoing burdensome monitoring and, in some cases, unnecessary intervention. PCR-based qualitative cfDNA analysis for fetal antigen genotyping is available in Europe, however, it is offered at later gestational ages, may require a repeat sample, has a higher frequency of inconclusive results for individuals of non-European ancestry, and entails logistical challenges related to shipping and insurance coverage for patients in the US. The availability of a NGS-based quantitative cfDNA analysis for fetal antigen genotyping in the US that is robust for diverse populations and applicable for singleton and twin pregnancies starting at 10 weeks gestation presents an opportunity to assess performance.

MethodsPatients with alloimmunized pregnancies undergoing clinical fetal antigen cfDNA analysis were recruited to the study along with the neonates resulting from the pregnancies. The laboratory issued the results prospectively as a part of clinical care. After delivery, neonatal buccal swabs were sent to an outside laboratory, blinded to the fetal cfDNA results, for antigen genotyping, and the results were compared. Concordance was reported for the fetal antigen cfDNA analysis for antigens to which the pregnant person was alloimmunized as well as for all antigens for which the pregnant person was genotype negative.

ResultsWe observed complete concordance between the fetal antigen cfDNA analysis result and neonatal genotypes for 503 calls, for 100% sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV across a racial and ethnically diverse cohort.

ConclusionThis study demonstrates that cfDNA analysis for determining fetal antigen genotype is more accurate than real-life application of the current recommendations, ie., partner testing and amniocentesis, in a diverse US population. In addition, this noninvasive approach reduces barriers to obtaining timely, accurate information about fetal antigen genotype. These results support the routine implementation of fetal antigen cfDNA analysis to guide care of alloimmunized pregnancies in the US.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196835

While RdRp is the target of several viral inhibitors, the active site has several pitfalls when translating in vitro inhibitors to the clinic. The highly polar residues within the active site often necessitate the use of highly polar or charged compounds, especially when designing nucleoside analog inhibitors, posing significant challenges in optimizing drug-likeness and membrane permeability for clinical efficacy. Here, we investigated the broad-spectrum potential of the allosteric Thumb-1 cryptic site of the RdRp, which to date has only been adequately studied in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). To explore this potential antiviral target, we used a suite of bioinformatics techniques, including homology modeling and multiple sequence alignments, to reveal the conserved landscape of the Thumb-1 site across +ssRNA viruses. We then used ChemPrint, our Mol-GDL (Molecular-Geometric Deep Learning) machine learning model to predict drug inhibition of the Thumb-1 site in RdRp across +ssRNA viruses. Here, we identify MDL-001 as a promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidate with favorable properties that enable oral and once-a-day dosing. We also show how the cryptic nature of the Thumb-1 site masks itself to conventional virtual screening techniques, like docking, where activity prediction is heavily based on solving or predicting an accurate structure of the open pocket. This study demonstrates the utility of this approach in drug discovery for broad-spectrum antivirals that target the Thumb-1 site.

Lay SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThis paper addresses the challenge of developing broad-spectrum antivirals against +ssRNA viruses, which include pathogens like HCV and SARS-CoV-2. The highly conserved RdRp Thumb-1 site across these viruses is identified as a potential target for broad spectrum antiviral drugs, which would be vital tools in prophylactic and therapeutic responses to future viral threats.

MethodologyUtilizing bioinformatics and deep learning (through our proprietary AI platform called GALILEO), the study maps the conserved landscape of the RdRp Thumb-1 site across a range of human pathogenic +ssRNA viruses and screens for potential inhibitory compounds.

Key DiscoveriesMDL-001 emerges as a potential broad-spectrum non-nucleoside antiviral drug candidate and the RdRp Thumb-1 site exists as a family of targets, many of which may be targetable by a single drug.

Impact and ImplicationsThe discovery that the Thumb-1 site of RdRp can be targeted by small molecules for antiviral activity against a range of +ssRNA viruses.

Future DirectionsThis work paves the way for further development of MDL-001 and research for other broad-spectrum antiviral compounds that target the RdRp Thumb-1 domain.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196835

We investigated the association between long-term exposure to wildfire smoke PM2.5 and all-cause mortality and mortality from a wide range of specific causes in all 3,108 counties in the contiguous U.S., 2007-2020. Monthly county-level mortality data were collected from the National Center for Health Statistics. Wildfire smoke PM2.5 concentration was derived from a 10x10 km2 resolution spatiotemporal model. Controlling for non-smoke PM2.5, air temperature, and unmeasured spatial and temporal confounders, we found a non-linear association between 12-month moving average concentration of smoke PM2.5 and monthly all-cause mortality rate. Relative to a month with the long-term smoke PM2.5 exposure below 0.1 g/m3, all-cause mortality increased by 0.40-1.54 and 3.65 deaths per 100,000 people per month when the 12-month moving average of PM2.5 concentration was of 0.1-5 and 5+ g/m3, respectively. Cardiovascular, ischemic heart disease, digestive, endocrine, diabetes, mental, suicide, and chronic kidney disease mortality were all found to be associated with long-term wildfire smoke PM2.5 exposure. Smoke PM2.5 contributed to approximately 30,180 all-cause deaths/year (95% CI: 21,449, 38,910) in the contiguous U.S. Higher smoke PM2.5-related increases in mortality rates were found for people aged 65 above and racial minority populations. Positive interaction effects with extreme heat were also observed. Our study identified the detrimental effects of long-term exposure to wildfire smoke PM2.5 on a wide range of mortality outcomes, underscoring the need for public health actions and communication to prepare communities and individuals to mitigate smoke exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196835

Natural infection by influenza, measles, or mumps viruses generates bone marrow (BM) LLPC similar to tetanus vaccination which affords safeguards for decades. Although the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines protect from severe disease, the serologic half-life is short-lived even though SARS-CoV-2-specific plasma cells can be found in the BM. To better understand this paradox, we enrolled 19 healthy adults at 1.5-33 months after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine and measured influenza-, tetanus-, or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody secreting cells (ASC) in LLPC (CD19-) and non-LLPC (CD19+) subsets within the BM. All individuals had IgG ASC specific for influenza, tetanus, and SARS-CoV-2 in at least one BM ASC compartment. However, only influenza- and tetanus-specific ASC were readily detected in the LLPC whereas SARS-CoV-2 specificities were mostly excluded. The ratios of non-LLPC:LLPC for influenza, tetanus, and SARS-CoV-2 were 0.61, 0.44, and 29.07, respectively. Even in five patients with known PCR-proven history of infection and vaccination, SARS-CoV-2-specific ASC were mostly excluded from the LLPC. These specificities were further validated by using multiplex bead binding assays of secreted antibodies in the supernatants of cultured ASC. Similarly, the IgG ratios of non-LLPC:LLPC for influenza, tetanus, and SARS-CoV-2 were 0.66, 0.44, and 23.26, respectively. In all, our studies demonstrate that rapid waning of serum antibodies is accounted for by the inability of mRNA vaccines to induce BM LLPC.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196835

Stress-induced exposure of ribosome-free mRNA following translational shutoff is thought to cause condensation by allowing new multivalent RNA-dependent interactions, with RNA length and associated interaction capacity driving increased condensation. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all mRNA species condense in response to multiple unrelated stresses in budding yeast, length plays a minor role, and instead, stress-induced transcripts are preferentially excluded from condensates, enabling their selective translation. Using both endogenous genes and reporter constructs, we show that translation initiation blockade, rather than resulting ribosome-free RNA, causes condensation. These translation initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are biochemically detectable even when stress granules, defined as microscopically visible foci, are absent or blocked. TIICs occur in unstressed yeast cells, and, during stress, grow before the appearance of visible stress granules. Stress-induced transcripts are excluded from TIICs primarily due to the timing of their expression, rather than their sequence features. Together, our results reveal a simple system by which cells redirect translational activity to newly synthesized transcripts during stress, with broad implications for cellular regulation in changing conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835

Here we show that in Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, simple animals with just 302 neurons, memories are preserved on ice and in lithium salt. C. elegans nematodes can form associative memories, which are typically forgotten quickly. We discovered that when placed on ice, worms delay forgetting of specific olfactory memories by at least 8-fold. Delayed forgetting was canceled completely when the worms were gradually adapted to low temperatures, owing to a genetically-encoded program that turns acclimated worms cold-tolerant. RNA-seq, mutant analyses, and pharmacological assays revealed that regulation of membrane properties switches cold-induced delayed forgetting ON and OFF, and, remarkably, that lithium delays forgetting only in cold-sensitive but not cold-tolerant worms. We found that downregulation of the diacylglycerol pathway in the AWC sensory neurons is essential for lithium-mediated delayed forgetting, and using neuronal activity recordings located the memory trace to the downstream AIY interneurons. We suggest that the awesome genetic tractability of C. elegans might be harnessed to study the effects of lithium and cold temperatures on the brain, why it influences psychiatric disorders, and even more fundamentally how memory is stored and lost.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835

We find that condensin disassembles interphase chromatin loop organization by evicting or displacing extrusive cohesin. In contrast, condensin bypasses cohesive cohesins, thereby maintaining sister chromatid cohesion while separating the sisters. Studies of mitotic chromosomes formed by cohesin, condensin II and condensin I alone or in combination allow us to develop new models of mitotic chromosome conformation. In these models, loops are consecutive and not overlapping, implying that condensins do not freely pass one another but stall upon encountering each other. The dynamics of Hi-C interactions and chromosome morphology reveal that during prophase loops are extruded in vivo at [~]1-3 kb/sec by condensins as they form a disordered discontinuous helical scaffold within individual chromatids.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835

We collected behavioural data on several facets of music reward sensitivity, music perceptual ability, and general reward sensitivity from a large sample of Swedish twins (N = 9,169). We found that genetic factors substantially explain variance in music reward sensitivity above and beyond genetic influences shared with music perception and general reward sensitivity. Furthermore, multivariate analyses showed that genetic influences on the different facets of music reward sensitivity are partly distinct, uncovering distinct pathways to music enjoyment and different patterns of genetic associations with objectively assessed music perceptual abilities. These results paint a complex picture in which partially distinct sources of genetic variation contribute to different aspects of musical enjoyment and open up new possibilities for using inter-individual differences to gain insights into the biology of a key aspect of human behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835

Microalgae, which are responsible for [~]50% of global photosynthesis, compartmentalize their Rubisco into a specialized structure known as the pyrenoid when the cells experience limiting CO2 conditions; this compartmentalization appears to be a component of the CO2 Concentrating Mechanism (CCM), which facilitates photosynthetic CO2 fixation as environmental levels of inorganic carbon (Ci) decline. Changes in the spatial distribution of mitochondria in green algae have also been observed under CO2 limiting conditions, although a role for this reorganization in CCM function remains unclear. We used the green microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to monitor changes in the position and ultrastructure of mitochondrial membranes as cells transition between high CO2 (HC) and Low/Very Low CO2 (LC/VLC). Upon transferring cells to VLC, the mitochondria move from a central to a peripheral location, become wedged between the plasma membrane and chloroplast envelope, and mitochondrial membranes orient in parallel tubular arrays that extend from the cells apex to its base. We show that these ultrastructural changes require protein and RNA synthesis, occur within 90 min of shifting cells to VLC conditions, correlate with CCM induction and are regulated by the CCM master regulator CIA5. The apico-basal orientation of the mitochondrial membrane, but not the movement of the mitochondrion to the cell periphery, is dependent on microtubules and the MIRO1 protein, which is involved in membrane-microtubule interactions. Furthermore, blocking mitochondrial electron transport in VLC acclimated cells reduces the cells affinity for inorganic carbon. Overall, our results suggest that CIA5-dependent mitochondrial repositioning/reorientation functions in integrating cellular architecture and energetics with CCM activities and invite further exploration of how intracellular architecture can impact fitness under dynamic environmental conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835

CAR T cell therapy has enjoyed success in the clinic for hematological cancer indications, giving rise to decade-long remissions in some cases. However, CAR T therapy for patients with solid tumors has not seen similar success. Solid tumors constitute 90% of adult human cancers, representing an enormous unmet clinical need. Current approaches do not solve the central problem of limited ability of therapeutic cells to migrate through the stromal matrix. We discover that T cells at low and high density display low- and high-migration phenotypes, respectively. The highly migratory phenotype is mediated by a paracrine pathway from a group of self-produced cytokines that include IL5, TNF, IFN{gamma}, and IL8. We exploit this finding to ""lock-in"" a highly migratory phenotype by developing and expressing receptors, which we call velocity receptors (VRs). VRs target these cytokines and signal through these cytokines cognate receptors to increase T cell motility and infiltrate lung, ovarian, and pancreatic tumors in large numbers and at doses for which control CAR T cells remain confined to the tumor periphery. In contrast to CAR therapy alone, VR-CAR T cells significantly attenuate tumor growth and extend overall survival. This work suggests that approaches to the design of immune cell receptors that focus on migration signaling will help current and future CAR cellular therapies to infiltrate deep into solid tumors.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835

We experimentally confirm binders to four disease-relevant epitopes, and the cryo-EM structure of a designed VHH bound to influenza hemagglutinin is nearly identical to the design model both in the configuration of the CDR loops and the overall binding pose.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835

Here, we applied a new technology that generates contiguous long reads via tagmentation and sequencing by synthesis to a small cohort of patients with undiagnosed disease from the Undiagnosed Diseases Network. We first compare sequencing from the HG002 benchmark sample from Genome In A Bottle using nanopore sequencing (R10.4.1, duplex reads, Oxford Nanopore), single molecule real time sequencing (Revio SMRT cell, Pacific Biosciences) and complete long read sequencing (S4 flowcell, Novaseq, Illumina). Coverage was 33-35x across platforms. Read length N50 was 6.5kb (ICLR), 16.9kb (SMRT), and 33.8kb (ONT). We noted small differences in single nucleotide variant F1 scores across long read technologies with single nucleotide variant F1 scores (0.985-0.999) exceeding indel scores (0.78-0.99) and structural variant scores (0.74-0.96). We applied CLR sequencing to seven undiagnosed patients. In one patient, we detected and prioritized a novel 16kb intragenic duplication encompassing exons 5 and 6 in EHMT1. Resolution of the breakpoints and examination of flanking sequences revealed that the duplication was present in tandem and was predicted to result in a frameshift of the amino acid sequence and an early termination codon. It resulted in a diagnosis of Kleefstra syndrome. The variant was confirmed with targeted EHMT1 clinical testing and detected via nanopore and SMRT sequencing. In summary, we report the early clinical application of complete long read sequencing to a small cohort of undiagnosed patients.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196835

The detailed synaptic-level circuitry of such a neuronal network of about 104 neurons is still unknown. Here, using 3-dimensional electron microscopy, AI-based image processing and automated proofreading, we report the connectomic reconstruction of a defined cortical column in mouse barrel cortex. The cortical column appears as a structural feature in the connectome, without need for geometrical or morphological landmarks. We then used the connectome for definition of neuronal cell types in the column, to determine intracolumnar circuit modules, analyze the logic of inhibitory circuits, investigate the circuits for combination of bottom-up and top-down signals in the column and the specificity of bottom-up and top-down cortical input, search for higher-order circuit structure within homogeneous neuronal populations, and estimate the degree and symmetry of Hebbian learning in the various connection types. With this, we provide a first column-level connectomic description of the cerebral cortex, the likely substrate for a synaptic-level mechanistic understanding of sensory-conceptual integration and learning.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835

Now, the more difficult challenge is to properly annotate a draft genome assembly once it has been constructed. The primary challenge to annotation is how to select from the myriad gene prediction tools that are currently available, determine what kinds of data are necessary to generate high quality annotations, and evaluate the quality of the annotation. To determine which methods perform the best and determine whether the inclusion of RNA-seq data is necessary to obtain a high-quality annotation, we generated annotations with 10 different methods for 21 different species spanning vertebrates, plants, and insects. We found that the RNA-seq assembler Stringtie and the annotation transfer method TOGA were consistently top performers across a variety of metrics including BUSCO recovery, CDS length, and false positive rate, with the exception that TOGA performed less in plants with larger genomes. RNA-seq alignment rate was best with RNA-seq assemblers. HMM-based methods such as BRAKER, MAKER, and multi-genome AUGUSTUS mostly underperformed relative to Stringtie and TOGA. In general, inclusion of RNA-seq data will lead to substantial improvements to genome annotations, and there may be cases where complementarity among methods may motivate combining annotations from multiple sources.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835

One technical challenge when investigating adaptive locomotion is measuring behavioral responses to precise perturbations during naturalistic walking; another is that manipulating neural activity in sensorimotor circuits often reduces spontaneous locomotion. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce miniature treadmill systems for coercing locomotion and tracking 3D kinematics of walking Drosophila. By systematically comparing walking in three experimental setups, we show that flies compelled to walk on the linear treadmill have similar stepping kinematics to freely walking flies, while kinematics of tethered walking flies are subtly different. Genetically silencing mechanosensory neurons alters step kinematics of flies walking on the linear treadmill across all speeds, while inter-leg coordination remains intact. We also found that flies can maintain a forward heading on a split-belt treadmill by adapting the step distance of their middle legs. Overall, these new insights demonstrate the utility of miniature treadmills for studying insect locomotion.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835

Due to the importance of regulatory elements, various sequencing methods have been developed to localise them in genomes, for example using ChIP-seq profiling of the histone mark H3K27ac that marks active regulatory regions. Moreover, multiple tools have been developed to predict TF binding to these regulatory elements based on DNA sequence. As altered gene expression is a hallmark of disease phenotypes, identifying TFs driving such gene expression programs is critical for the identification of novel drug targets.

In this study, we curated 84 chromatin profiling experiments (H3K27ac ChIP-seq) where TFs were perturbed through e.g., genetic knockout or overexpression. We ran nine published tools to prioritize TFs using these real-world data sets and evaluated the performance of the methods in identifying the perturbed TFs. This allowed the nomination of three frontrunner tools, namely RcisTarget, MEIRLOP and monaLisa. Our analyses revealed opportunities and commonalities of tools that will help to guide further improvements and developments in the field.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835

In this study, we examined whether treatment with Paxlovid in the acute phase of COVID-19 helps prevent the onset of PASC. We used electronic health records from the National Covid Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 426,352 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation (TTE) framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured the onset of novel cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment did not have a significant effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] = 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-1.01). However, it had a protective effect on cognitive (RR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.96) and fatigue (RR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.91-0.98) symptom clusters, which suggests that the etiology of these symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1715379196835

It achieves localization precision down to nanometers in the lateral direction. However, its routine axial localization precision is approximately three-fold lower as compared to the lateral localization precision. Recently, a technique known as Metal-Induced Energy Transfer (MIET) has been introduced, offering excellent axial resolution at the nanometer scale up to 200 nm above a surface. MIET is characterized by a low entry barrier, as its sole technical requirement is the availability of a fluorescence lifetime imaging modality. In this study, we harness the synergy between the exceptional axial resolution provided by MIET and the lateral resolution achieved with DNA-PAINT (MIET-PAINT) to accomplish multitarget 3D super-resolution imaging. We implemented MIET-PAINT using a wide-field fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope. We validated our technique by measuring the height of emitters placed on top of spacers of known thicknesses. We then demonstrated multiplexed MIET-PAINT imaging of fixed cells to visualize mechanotransduction proteins in the focal adhesion complex (FAC) and the cytoskeleton. We explored the structural arrangement of paxillin, zyxin, and actin stress fibers in U2OS cells and discovered that MIET-PAINT can reliably address multiple targets, providing lateral and axial nanometerscale resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1715379196835
