However, it is not well understood whether personal light exposure patterns predicts and individuals risk of cardiovascular diseases.

ObjectiveTo assess whether day and night light exposure predicts incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and whether relationships of light with cardiovascular diseases differ according to genetic susceptibility, sex, and age.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

ParticipantsN=88,905, age (M{+/-}SD) = 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 56.9% female.

ExposureApproximately 13 million hours of personal light exposure data, tracked by wrist-worn light sensors (one week each).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, derived from UK National Health Service records, across a 9.5-year follow-up after light tracking.

ResultsPeople with the brightest nights (90-100th percentiles) had significantly higher risks of developing coronary artery disease (adjusted-HR range: 1.23-1.32), myocardial infarction (aHRs: 1.42-1.47), heart failure (aHRs: 1.45-1.56), atrial fibrillation (aHRs: 1.28-1.32), and stroke (aHRs: 1.28-1.30), compared to people with dark nights (0-50th percentiles). These relationships were robust after adjusting for established risk factors for cardiovascular health, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol, diet, sleep duration, socioeconomic status, and polygenic risk. Relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and coronary artery disease were stronger for women, and relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation were stronger for younger individuals in this cohort.

Conclusions and RelevanceNight light exposure was a significant risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases in this cohort. In addition to current preventative measures, avoiding light at night may be a useful strategy for reducing risks of cardiovascular diseases.

Key Points

QuestionDoes personal light exposure predict incidence of cardiovascular diseases?

FindingsIn this study of [~]89,000 adults aged >40 years, exposure to brighter light at night predicted higher incidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors.

MeaningAvoiding exposure to night light may lower risk for cardiovascular diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1752531077697

MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1752531077697

Viruses can inhibit nucleotide immune signaling by producing proteins that sequester or cleave the immune signals. Here we analyzed evolutionarily unrelated signal-sequestering viral proteins, finding that they share structural and biophysical traits in their genetic organization, ternary structures and binding pocket properties. Based on these traits we developed a structure-guided computational pipeline that can sift through large phage genome databases to unbiasedly predict phage proteins that manipulate bacterial immune signaling. Numerous previously uncharacterized proteins, grouped into three families, were verified to inhibit the bacterial Thoeris and CBASS signaling systems. Proteins of the Sequestin and Lockin families bind and sequester the TIR-produced signaling molecules 3'cADPR and His-ADPR, while proteins of the Acb5 family cleave and inactivate 3'3'-cGAMP and related molecules. X-ray crystallography and structural modeling, combined with mutational analyses, explain the structural basis for sequestration or cleavage of the immune signals. Thousands of these signal-manipulating proteins were detected in phage protein databases, with some instances present in well-studied model phages such as T2, T4 and T6. Our study explains how phages commonly evade bacterial immune signaling, and offers a structure-guided analytical approach for discovery of viral immune-manipulating proteins in any database of choice.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

Upon activation, they oligomerize into inflammasome like resistosomes to initiate immune signaling, yet the dynamics of resistosome assembly remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the virulence effector AVRcap1b from the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans suppresses immune activation by directly engaging oligomerization intermediates of the tomato helper NLR SlNRC3. CryoEM structures of SlNRC3 in AVRcap1b bound and unbound states reveal that AVRcap1b bridges multiple protomers, stabilizing a stalled intermediate and preventing formation of a functional resistosome. Leveraging AVRcap1b as a molecular tool, we also capture an additional SlNRC3 resistosome intermediate showing that assembly proceeds in a stepwise manner from dissociated monomers. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized vulnerability in NLR activation and reveal a pathogen strategy that disrupts immune complex assembly. This work advances mechanistic understanding of resistosome formation and uncovers a previously unrecognized facet of pathogen-plant coevolution.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

During the tumult of war they are, however, challenging to obtain due to the conflicts themselves. The Gaza Ministry of Health (GMoH) has provided regular updates to their post-October-7 violent death tally for the Gaza Strip. However, GMoH reports have attracted both criticism and support. Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. Our findings suggest that violent mortality has significantly exceeded official figures. Our central estimate for the extent of GMoH undercount closely matches a separate estimate made using capture-recapture methods. We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden. These results underscore the feasibility of mortality surveillance methodologies in some highly challenging war-affected settings and provide a crucial empirical foundation for assessing the true human cost of the war.","NA","medrxiv",1752531077697

Due to a lack of authoritative literature, many also overlook potentially important steps, such as thinning contig over-assembly or identifying transcript consensus across samples, which reduce resource demands during annotation and increase the accuracy of final transcripts. Results: We developed TATAT, a modular, Dockerized software that contains all the tools necessary to generate an annotated coding transcriptome from raw RNA-seq data. The tools remain in a static state and can be coordinated with bash and python scripts provided therein, making TATAT a standardized, reproducible workflow that can easily be shared and installed. We preferentially incorporate tools that are not only accurate, but are fast and require less RAM, and subsequently show TATAT can generate a comprehensive transcriptome for a non-model organism, the Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), in ~8 hours in a high-performance computing (HPC) environment.

This method limits measurements of free-swimming organisms without boundary effects or movement restrictions. We present energy consumption measurements of free-swimming jellyfish based on 3D morphological reconstructions of the animal during the process of catabolysis utilizing a non-invasive technique. We used a 6-meter tall, 13,600 liter water tank for swimming experiments without food present in the water column. To study continuous swimming, we implemented an onboard microelectronic swim controller that externally stimulated jellyfish swimming for 50 hours. Computer vision-based feedback control was used to enable continuous swimming against a flow current without encountering the vertical limits of the tank over a distance of 2.55 km or 15,000 body lengths. Using a 3D laser scanning system, we created morphological reconstructions of the jellyfish before, during, and after swimming experiments. Changes in animal volume were converted to energy consumption using the body chemical composition determined with elemental analysis. Free-swimming, electrically stimulated animals were found to consume 2.5 times more energy than similarly stimulated animals in a constrained environment, likely due in part to additional hydrodynamic drag associated with free-swimming. Simplified drag models could not fully account for the increased energy consumption. This highlights the need for hydrodynamic models that more effectively capture these dynamics. These measurements suggest that this technique could be applied more broadly to measuring free-swimming metabolic rates of other gelatinous invertebrates.

Plecia longiforceps, a species of lovebug flies native to southeast China and Taiwan, has recently been expanding in Okinawa in Japan and Seoul in South Korea, where massive outbreaks are garnering public attention. Here we analyzed whole-genome sequences of 150 individuals across China, Korea, Okinawa, and Taiwan, including a newly identified northern Chinese population from Qingdao. We found a deep divergence between continental (Korea-China) and insular (Okinawa-Taiwan) populations and specify northern China and Taiwan as sources for Korea and Okinawa, respectively. Severely reduced genetic diversity in Korea and Qingdao suggests serial founder events during their northward expansion. An old split time between Qingdao and Korea ([~]3,500 generations ago) and multiple gene flows into Qingdao reject a simple scenario of a single recent northward migration. Selection signals in northern groups include genes associated with pigmentation, thermal sensing, lipid metabolism, and immunity. We observed a markedly reduced genetic diversity on X chromosome in northern populations, indicating ongoing strong sex-biased selection. Our findings portrait details of the northward range expansion in the species and highlight the role of adaptation for successful invasion at higher latitudes.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

A key component of social behavior is approach, where animals actively move to-ward social partners to maintain group cohesion, establish affiliations, and coordinate actions. While a continuous stream of social information is encoded across sensory modalities, it remains unclear whether a distinct neural process underlies social approach. Here, we developed a novel assay in which a head-fixed, tail-free zebrafish interacts with a freely swimming conspecific, enabling precise quantification of social behavior alongside whole-brain functional imaging at cellular resolution. We demonstrate that zebrafish approach behavior is jointly shaped by spatial and temporal information from conspecifics rather than by these features acting independently. Social approach behavior is preceded by distinct brain-wide neural activity patterns emerging seconds before movement onset, characterized by increased activity in a small subset of forebrain neurons and decreased activity in midbrain and hindbrain neuronal populations. These activity patterns reliably predict upcoming approach movements from each of these regions separately. Moreover, the extent to which neural activity distinguishes approach from non-approach movements predicts individual differences in social behavior, directly linking neural dynamics to behavioral variability. Together, our findings reveal a neural mechanism underlying social approach behavior, highlighting how a distributed yet functionally coordinated network facilitates social interaction.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

In this study, we identify a host-adapted enzymatic module in the root endophyte Serendipita indica that targets acetylated xylan, a major structural component of monocot cell walls. The glycoside hydrolase SiGH11 cleaves the xylan backbone and releases O-acetylated oligosaccharides, which are subsequently deacetylated by the XynE-like esterase SiAXE. These enzymes are co-expressed within a monocot-specific transcriptional program that is enriched in carbohydrate-active enzymes and sugar transporters. Their combined activity enhances enzymatic degradation and facilitates downstream hydrolysis by exo-xylanases, which reduces the production of apoplastic reactive oxygen species triggered by damage-associated molecular patterns. Functional analysis shows that overexpression of SiAXE promotes early root colonization, while deletion of the gene compromises fungal proliferation during later stages. These findings define a coordinated and immune-compatible strategy for host cell wall deconstruction that enables fungal adaptation and endophytic colonization of monocot roots.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

The plant natural product (-)-englerin A (EA) is a potent, selective TRPC4/5 agonist that has transformed fundamental and translational research on TRPC4/5 channels. However, the structural basis of interactions between EA and TRPC4/5 proteins has remained elusive, limiting our ability to fully understand and exploit mechanisms of TRPC4/5 channel activation by this intriguing natural product. Here, we present nine high-resolution cryo-EM structures (2.4-3.2 [A]) of human TRPC5 - representing different states and ligand occupancies - which show that EA binds to a conserved lipid binding site between transmembrane domains of adjacent TRPC5 subunits. Our structural models are consistent with the effects of mutagenesis of nearby residues on EA's potency, efficacy and activation kinetics, and allow us to rationalise competitive inhibition by other TRPC4/5 modulators as well as EA's selectivity profile within the TRPC family. Comparison of structures containing various TRPC5:EA stoichiometries revealed key structural and molecular determinants of EA-mediated TRPC5 activation - most notably the aromatic interaction network around Phe520 - underscoring the critical function of Met-aromatic motifs in ion channel structure and function. Binding of EA causes conformational changes of nearby amino acid residues, resulting in rearrangement of the pore helices into a pre-open state. Collectively, we provide structural insight into the mode-of-action of the most widely used TRPC4/5 agonist, which will underpin fundamental TRPC4/5 channel research as well as ongoing drug discovery programmes.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through peptides designed for copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), and zinc (Zn), which retain key features such as net charge and hydrophobicity, while significantly reducing sequence length and molecular weight compared to known metal-binding proteins. Metalorian-generated peptides exhibit stable conformations and favorable binding energetics, as confirmed through molecular dynamics simulations. To validate binding in vitro, we developed a streamlined SUMO-fusion expression and cleavage system coupled with ELISA-based quantification, confirming robust Cu and Zn binding by multiple Metalorian-generated peptides. Overall, our work establishes a foundational platform for engineering heavy metal-binding peptides tailored to diverse and underrepresented targets, and highlights the potential of well-trained continuous latent spaces for diffusion-based de novo peptide design.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

Aminoglycosides kill bacteria by disrupting translation fidelity, leading to the synthesis of aberrant proteins. Surprisingly, mutations in fusA, a gene encoding translation elongation factor G (EF-G), frequently confer resistance, even though EF-G neither participates in mRNA decoding nor blocks aminoglycoside binding. Here, we show that EF-G resistance variants selectively slow ribosome movement along mRNA when aminoglycosides are bound. This delay increases the chance that the drug dissociates before misreading occurs. Over several elongation cycles, this selective silencing of drug-bound ribosomes prevents error cluster formation, preserving proteome and membrane integrity. As a result, fusA mutations confer resistance early in treatment by preventing self-promoted aminoglycoside uptake. Translation on drug-free ribosomes remains sufficiently rapid to sustain near-normal bacterial growth. This previously unrecognized resistance mechanism-- selective silencing of corrupted targets--reveals a novel antibiotic resistance strategy with potential therapeutic implications.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

It is essential for viability in Staphylococcus aureus and regulates genes that encode the autolysins and other critical proteins. The sensor kinase WalK phosphorylates WalR at aspartic acid residue 53 (D53) in the receiver domain, stimulating promoter DNA binding. Unlike other response regulators, WalR is thought to have a second kinase, the serine/threonine kinase PknB, which phosphorylates the receiver domain at threonine residue 101. We previously reported that a walR mutation that changed T101 to a methionine conferred low level resistance to vancomycin and greatly increased susceptibility to tunicamycin along with several other phenotypic traits. In this work we demonstrate similarities between pknB null and the WalRT101M mutants that support a regulatory role for PknB-mediated phosphorylation of WalR. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, we confirm the specificity of this posttranslational modification and confirm that phosphorylation at both D53 and T101 is important for dimer formation. Importantly, using an in silico approach, we have discovered that phosphorylation at T101 creates an intermolecular hydrogen bond between the phosphate group and E108, that strengthens contacts along the WalR dimerization interface. This is the first time that a clear molecular role has been assigned to this posttranslational modification and it is the strongest molecular evidence to date for a direct functional relationship between PknB and WalR. We propose that, together with primary activation by WalK, PknB serves as a second potentiating input into the WalKR system, stimulating WalR dimer formation, and target DNA binding and tethering this transcriptional event to important extracellular stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

While high-content imaging-based genetic screens have transformed functional genomics, they have remained largely limited to static or binary phenotypes. Here, we present DynaScreen, an imaging-based, pooled CRISPR screening platform that enables high-throughput investigation of dynamic cellular phenotypes at single-cell resolution. By integrating Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) biosensors with photoactivation-based single-cell tagging and pooled CRISPR screening technology, we establish a scalable system to identify genes that regulate the timing, amplitude, and duration of signaling responses. As proof of principle, we applied this approach to the cAMP signaling pathway, a key regulator of cellular physiology. Using a custom guide RNA (gRNA) library, we tracked real-time cAMP dynamics in response to agonist stimulation and identified genes that modulate its basal levels and response kinetics. Cells with aberrant signaling were selectively photoactivated, isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and subjected to next-generation sequencing to pinpoint causal genetic perturbations. This strategy successfully uncovered known and novel regulators of cAMP dynamics. In conclusion, the integration of FLIM microscopy, CRISPR technology and open-source software to handle image analysis, automated hit identification and data representation, enables real-time exploration of dynamic phenotypes in a wide range of biological settings.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

We review evidence for the evolution of arboreality within lineages of early mammals and their stem relatives (Synapsida) while also emphasizing the uncertainty of locomotor inferences of fossil lineages. An improved understanding of the evolutionary origins and prevalence of arboreality in early mammals requires robust links between morphological traits and locomotor behaviors that can be applied to fossils. To this end, we use a large comparative dataset of linear measurements taken on extant mammalian postcranial specimens to evaluate the skeletal proxies that best differentiate arboreality from other locomotor modes. Consistent with previous research, we find that measures of digit length and elbow proportions are especially powerful predictors of climbing. Locomotor predictions based on single measurements or ratios are improved when phylogeny is incorporated into models. Nonetheless, combining multiple functionally relevant traits into our models yields robust predictions of locomotor mode even without incorporating phylogenetic information--this is especially encouraging for fossil groups with unstable phylogenies. We test these locomotor proxies in three early-mammalian case studies--Multituberculata, Plesiadapiformes, and early Theria. We find that multituberculates had a wide locomotor breadth whereas plesiadapiforms all had a high probability of climbing, consistent with previous studies. However, some Mesozoic therians in our sample are predicted to be ground-dwellers, conflicting with the hypothesis that the ancestral therian was scansorial or arboreal. The predictive tools presented here will improve locomotor inferences for small mammals, further illuminating the prevalence and importance of arboreality in early mammalian evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

Here, we demonstrate that SMN deficiency results in downregulation of KIF5A in human neurons and in a mouse model of SMA. We provide evidence that reduced SMN levels impair axon regeneration, which is rescued by KIF5A overexpression and that the RNA-binding protein SMN functions to stabilize KIF5A mRNA.

Participants performed reaching movements toward auditory, proprioceptive, or audio-proprioceptive targets. Electromyography and movement kinematics were recorded to examine the effects of sensory modality on sensory encoding and motor coordination during movement preparation, as well as online control at 5%, 50%, and 100% of movement time. Results revealed a modality-dependent sensory encoding phase and a modality-independent motor coordination. Movement variability was greater for auditory targets than for proprioceptive and audio-proprioceptive targets at 50% and 100% of movement. Only motor coordination influenced early online control (5%), but this effect was modality-independent. These findings demonstrate that the influence of sensory modality extends beyond execution to the preparatory phase of movement. The results support a four-stage model of action control: a modality-dependent sensory encoding phase of preparation and late online control, alongside a modality-independent motor coordination phase and early online control. These findings offer new insight into the temporal dynamics of sensorimotor control without vision, indicating that non-visual sensory information is differentially used during distinct phases of movement preparation and execution.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

Many PA enzymes are regulated post-transcriptionally, making traditional transcript-based methods ineffective in determining their abundance, highlighting the need for alternative approaches to study PA homeostasis. Here, we refined a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC MS) based method to simultaneously quantify activities of two key PA synthesizing enzymes - arginine decarboxylase (ADC) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) - from plant tissues using stable isotope substrates. By optimizing substrate concentrations, we increased assay sensitivity >10-fold in tomato leaf tissue. We further adapted this protocol for Nicotiana benthamiana, a model plant widely used for transient recombinant protein expression. Expression of epitope-tagged ADCs in this system revealed a direct correlation between protein abundance and enzymatic activity, demonstrating that ADC activity can infer its protein abundance in native tissues. Proof-of-principle experiments with the N. benthamiana expression system, confirm substrate specificity of tomato ADC and ODC enzymes and essential catalytic residues of tomato ADCs. Beyond enzymatic activities, our LCMS-based method also permits quantification of 11 PA network metabolite concentrations from the same LCMS sample. Visualizing this data as a heatmap pathway diagram, alongside ADC/ODC activities provides a comprehensive overview of PA metabolism in plant tissues. We also studied tomato CRISPR-Cas9-induced mutants deficient in ADC or ODC, complemented by phenotypic analysis. LC-MS analysis of an adc1/adc2 double mutant - an embryo lethal genotype in Arabidopsis - had no detectable agmatine, the product of ADCs. Additionally, despite a reduction in putrescine, no impact on the downstream PAs, spermidine and spermine, was found. The adc1/adc2 double mutant showed severe developmental abnormalities, including complete flower loss, demonstrating the indispensable role of ADCs in flower development. In summary, our optimized LC-MS approach for simultaneous quantification of ADC/ODC enzyme activity and PA-pathway metabolites, the ability to transiently express and functionally analyze recombinant ADC/ODC proteins in planta, and a collection of tomato CRISPR mutants deficient in these enzymes collectively establish a versatile new experimental toolkit to dissect PA homeostasis and PA-dependent developmental processes in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

To solve this problem, we present here a phylogenetic classification following the PhyloCode for the Solanaceae. Traditional taxon names previously recognized at the ranks of tribe, genus, and section were maintained when associated with clades. We base our clade definitions on a newly constructed phylogeny of the family using 10 plastid and nuclear markers with a broad sampling of 1,474 species, roughly half of the diversity of the family. We complement this marker-based analysis with a phylogenomic analysis of 110 taxa (including 97 of the 102 genera in the family) using the Angiosperms353 probe set. This pair of analyses produced highly concordant phylogenies and provides strong support for the clades included in the classification. In total, we propose and define rank-free names for 38 major clades, including 16 infrageneric taxa within the mega-diverse Solanum. This rank-free system intends to promote name stability as new data become available, avoiding name changes to well-known groups.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

The reason often invoked is the dysregulation of the immune system, which is both cause and consequence of ageing. However, we do not all age in the same way, and increased susceptibility may not be solely due to immune dysregulation affecting resistance to infection. There are many possible ways to make a host less tolerant to infection by dysregulating key physiological or metabolic processes. We hypothesised that the increase in susceptibility to infection over age can be linked to both immune ageing and decreased tolerance, and importantly, that it will depend on genotype and sex of the host. We assessed susceptibility to Gram-negative bacterial challenge in both sexes in 22 Drosophila isolines at young and old ages, and leveraged variation between genotypes to investigate how frequently an increase in susceptibility to infection was more associated with a decline in resistance or disease tolerance mechanisms. To achieve this, we assessed pathogen load to report on host immune decline. Strikingly, in most cases, greater infection susceptibility at old age was driven by reduced tolerance, although we also frequently identify cases that suffered bona fide immunosenescence, e.g. impaired resistance. We screened across bacterial pathogens during systemic and oral infections and found sex-specific signatures in survival in young and old individuals, but increased susceptibility with age occurred in both sexes. Pairing infection survival with lifespan data, we find that transcending genotype variation, susceptibility at old age predicts lifespan in males only, regardless of the existence or direction of sex bias in longevity. This work highlights that increased infection susceptibility is an early-arising ageing phenotype that occurs in both sexes, but only predicts lifespan in males, paralleling burgeoning evidence in mammals for male-biased effects of age on infection and its connection with mortality. Our data support a model where infection susceptibility increases with age following the same multiplicative pattern as organismal mortality, with existing failures making new failures more consequential. We propose that the term ""immunosenescence"" be used specifically to describe proven dysregulation of immune tissue resistance mechanisms. We argue that to fully understand the drivers of age-related susceptibility to infection, it is essential to consider genotype, sex, and their interaction, as well as the dysregulation of non-immune functions that influence the ability to control pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

However, the influence of local immunometabolic cues on the intracellular fate and translational efficiency of mRNA-LNPs remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}), a potent inducer of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), and tryptophan (Trp) deprivation independently and combinatorially affect mRNA-LNP function in DC2.4 dendritic cells. These two cues are canonical drivers of immunoregulatory microenvironments, particularly those that favor tolerogenic dendritic cell programming and the induction of regulatory T cells. Using dual-reporter mRNA constructs and high-resolution confocal imaging, we show that IFN-{gamma} stimulation reduces total cellular mRNA uptake and lysosomal accumulation without affecting translation efficiency and endosomal escape efficiency. Whereas Trp deprivation also reduces the overall cellular uptake of mRNA-LNPs, it also significantly impairs protein synthesis from mRNA-LNPs and modestly reduces endosomal escape, despite having minimal impact on lysosomal mRNA levels. Spatial compartmentalization analysis revealed that IFN-{gamma} and Trp limitation disrupt distinct steps in the delivery-translation cascade, acting independently but additively to suppress the ultimate protein translation from mRNA-LNPs in DC2.4 dendritic cells. These findings highlight the importance of considering local metabolic and cytokine contexts when deploying mRNA-LNPs for immunological applications.

We sought to connect escape response performance to genotype and phenotype across ontogenetic stages within a single population of Threespine Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.), to determine if a gene of major effect (Ectodysplasin; Eda) on adaptive lateral armour plate phenotype and fitness conveys a performance advantage in brackish and saltwater environments. We predicted that possession of one or more low-plated alleles would result in better escape performance in brackish environments across ontogeny, and that Eda genotype would result in variation in shape phenotype that would be predictive of escape performance before the completion of lateral plate development. We assessed three kinematic variables derived from C-start escape responses in wild-caught, F1 juvenile, and F1 adults, and found that Eda genotypes did not directly impact maximum velocity or curvature coefficient, but linked phenotypes contributed to an increase in total distance traveled in F1 adults. We further showed that Eda genotype impacted growth, producing variation in size which in turn influenced escape performance variables across age groups, with a particular focus on total distance traveled. The influence of Eda genotype on shape was confounded by sexual dimorphism, indicating that further sex-specific studies on shape and performance are needed. The presence of at least one low-plated allele conferred a growth advantage, particularly in a freshwater rearing environment, consistent with known pleiotropic effects of Eda, including on skeletal development, that may be modulating anti-predator responses before plate phenotype is fully expressed. Altogether, more ontogenic studies are needed to ensure the influence of development on adaptive traits is more clearly understood.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

However, the m6A dynamics at single-nucleotide resolution in preimplantation development remain uncharacterized, and the functional significance of site specific m6A modifications in key developmental regulators is largely unknown. Here, using SAC-seq, a single-base resolution, antibody-independent m6A profiling method, we generate the first comprehensive m6A landscape in bovine oocytes and preimplantation embryos. We identify a previously uncharacterized m6A site in RPL12 transcript that is essential for embryonic development. Loss of m6A at this site leads to reduced protein synthesis, disrupted expression of translation-related genes, and impaired zygotic genome activation and blastocyst formation. Notably, supplementation with wild-type RPL12 mRNA fails to rescue the developmental arrest, indicating that m6A regulation extends beyond transcript abundance. Our findings provide a valuable resource of m6A at single-nucleotide resolution in mammalian embryogenesis and uncover a critical mechanism by which precise, site-specific m6A regulates translation and developmental competence in early embryos.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

Despite its pivotal role in reproductive health, the cellular states and interactions that coordinate this process are incompletely defined. Here, we establish an in vitro menstrual cycle (IVMC) protocol using human endometrial organoids that faithfully recapitulates the epithelium across the key phases of the menstrual cycle including differentiation, hormonal withdrawal, breakdown and regeneration. This IVMC protocol enables intricate study of the early phases of the cycle, which remain difficult to access in vivo. Using this system, we define transcriptional transitions in ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells during regeneration, revealing immediate stress-responsive states followed by wound-responsive ones that precede proliferation. We demonstrate that, in response to breakdown, organoids acquire a transcriptomic signature resembling the in vivo luminal epithelium in the menstrual and proliferative phases of the cycle. Luminal epithelial cells are crucial for this re-epithelialization and express factors such as WNT7A which we show to be required for long-term epithelial maintenance. Moreover, cell-cell communication analyses identify luminal epithelium as a signaling hub, interacting with endothelial and immune cells via pathways including CXCL8, consistent with promotion of angiogenesis and immune recruitment during the regenerative window. Taken together, our study establishes a physiologically relevant paradigm to dissect epithelial renewal and cell-cell interactions during menstruation with potential to extend towards modelling common and distressing conditions such as menstrual disorders and endometriosis.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

We expressed in mice of both sexes an AppNL-G-F allele, harboring familial AD mutations, specifically in cholinergic medial septum (MS) neurons, and compared the phenotype to mice with global AppNL-G-F expression. Over the course of 14 months, as mice reached late middle age, targeted expression led to the loss of about one-third of MS cholinergic neurons and widespread amyloid deposition in their terminal fields, especially in the hippocampus and, to a lesser extent, on blood vessels. This selective vulnerability of ageing cholinergic cells to amyloid, markedly reduced REM sleep and caused cognitive and emotional alterations resembling those in mice with the mutation expressed throughout the brain. Mice with global AppNL-G-F expression also had a previously unreported selective death of about 20% of their medial septal cholinergic cells. Although the broadcasting of amyloid by medial septal cholinergic cells is a notable feature, and potentially important in human pathology, selective genetic lesioning of about one third of the medial septal cholinergic cells, independently of amyloid, gave the same REM sleep, cognitive and emotional phenotypes. Thus, it is the killing of the cholinergic cells by amyloid, and therefore the missing acetylcholine, and not the secreted/deposited amyloid in the hippocampus and other areas that is the critical feature. These findings underscore the interest in revitalizing the classic cholinergic hypothesis of AD. Restricting pathological amyloid expression to MS cholinergic neurons, so that their health is compromised by amyloid, is sufficient to reproduce many AD-like symptoms, highlighting the critical role of these cells in early AD pathogenesis, REM sleep regulation, emotion and cognition.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

In typically post-mitotic neurons, abnormal reactivation of cell cycle regulators and DNA replication licensing factors is observed in ALS pathogenesis. Emerging evidence links components of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, notably MCM2, to replication stress and genomic instability, implying a mechanistic role in ALS pathogenesis. Objective: To determine whether ALS-associated mutations in FUS and SOD1 influence MCM2 expression and localisation in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived spinal motor neurons (MNs). Methods: We differentiated isogenic hiPSC lines carrying FUS P525L-GFP and R495QfsX527, a SOD1 mutant line, and matched wild-type controls into spinal MNs ([&ge;]28 days in vitro). QRT-PCR quantified MCM2 mRNA levels ({Delta}{Delta}Ct method; n=3 biological replicates, technical triplicates). Protein expression was assessed by Western blot densitometry (n=3). Subcellular distribution of MCM2 in FUS mutants was evaluated by immunofluorescence (pilot, N=1; [&ge;]50 cells quantified). Results: FUS P525L MNs exhibited a modest, non-significant increase in MCM2 mRNA (1.3-fold vs. WT; p=0.1319) but a significant 1.8-fold elevation in MCM2 protein levels (p=0.034). The R495QfsX527 line showed a comparable trend at the transcript level (1.2-fold; p > 0.05) and a 1.6-fold increase in protein (p = 0.041). SOD1 mutant MNs demonstrated a pronounced 2.3-fold MCM2 protein upregulation (p=0.008). Immunofluorescence in FUS mutant MNs revealed no significant nuclear-to-cytoplasmic shift in MCM2 localisation, indicating that elevated MCM2 levels are not driven by subcellular mislocalization. Conclusion: ALS-linked FUS and SOD1 mutations upregulate MCM2 protein in human spinal MNs, suggesting post-transcriptional or stability-driven regulation. The absence of relocalisation in FUS mutants shows that this impact is caused by overexpression rather than mislocalisation. MCM2 may be a biomarker of disease-associated replication stress. Future studies will explore whether MCM2 overexpression exacerbates DNA damage or serves as a compensatory response, clarifying its role in ALS pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

This process depends on the ability to learn reciprocal relationships and to select the best option available when making a choice. In such forms of decision-making, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a crucial role in encoding the relative value of alternatives as a decision is formed. Higher-order cognitive abilities are influenced by genetic factors that affect dopamine availability in the PFC, potentially contributing to individual differences. Here, we examined the performance of 83 participants in a transitive inference task (TI), grouped by genotype based on the Val158Met single-nucleotide polymorphism in the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) gene. The task included a learning phase in which participants acquired the reciprocal relationships among a set of hierarchically ranked items (A>B>C>D>E>F), followed by a test phase in which they were required to compare all possible item pairs and select the higher-ranked one. While genotype did not significantly influence test-phase performance, it did affect learning efficiency. Specifically, Val homozygotes took a longer learning procedure than both heterozygotes and Met homozygotes during the learning phase. Drift diffusion modelling (DDM) revealed that task performance was explained by the efficiency of evidence accumulation, which was lower in Val homozygotes, accounting for their poorer performance not only during initial learning but also when required to switch to a reversed hierarchical structure (A<B<C<D<E<F). These findings suggest that individual differences in inferential decision-making and cognitive flexibility may be partially driven by genetically determined variations in prefrontal dopamine availability.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

To elucidate the evolutionary dynamics underlying {beta}-lactam resistance, we constructed a comprehensive combinatorial mutant library comprising all 55,296 possible TEM-1 {beta}-lactamase variants integrating 18 clinically observed mutations across 13 key residues. Over eight million empirical fitness measurements were obtained under selection pressure with both a native antibiotic substrate (ampicillin) and a novel antibiotic (aztreonam), establishing the largest experimentally determined fitness landscape for antibiotic resistance to date. Through graph-theoretic and epistatic analyses, we discovered that selection with ampicillin resulted in weak epistasis, with mutants rarely surpassing the fitness of the wild-type enzyme. Conversely, aztreonam selection elicited extensive higher-order epistasis, generating a rugged fitness landscape characterized by increased phenotypic unpredictability. Interpretable machine-learning analyses identified context-dependent epistatic interactions necessary for achieving high-level aztreonam resistance. Further evolutionary statistical analyses, including direct coupling analysis and latent generative landscapes, showed that top-performing TEM-1 variants consistently adhered to conserved epistatic patterns found in naturally occurring {beta}-lactamases. Our findings demonstrate that higher-order epistasis critically shapes fitness landscape ruggedness when enzymes adapt to novel substrates, whereas adaptations to native substrates exhibit predictably smoother landscapes. This integrated experimental and computational framework provides a foundation for predictive evolutionary pharmacology, enabling assessments of newly developed {beta}-lactams or emerging {beta}-lactamase variants for their potential contribution to ESBL evolution. Importantly, incorporating graph-theoretically informed evolutionary constraints can strategically disrupt evolutionary pathways, presenting a viable approach to mitigate the rise of antibiotic resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

This primary genetic cue is often located on a single locus--referred to as sex chromosomes--and can be limited to females (in a ZZ/ZW system) or males (in an XX/XY system). One trademark of sex chromosomes is a restriction or cessation of recombination surrounding the sex-limited region (to prevent its inheritance in the homogametic sex). This may lead to--through a variety of mechanisms--higher amounts of genetic divergence within this region, i.e. between the X/Z and Y/W chromosomes, especially when compared to their autosomal counterparts. Recent advances in genome sequencing and computation have brought with them the ability to resolve haplotypes within a diploid individual, permitting assembly of previously challenging genomic regions like sex chromosomes. Leveraging these advances, we identified replicable diagnostic characteristics between typical autosomes and sex chromosomes (within a single genome assembly). Under this framework, we can use this information to identify putative sex chromosome linkage groups across divergent vertebrate taxa and simultaneously curate misassembled regions on autosomes.

This study evaluates the impact of RDs on these outcomes and examines the effectiveness of vaccination and antiviral treatments among individuals with and without RDs.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using harmonized electronic health records (EHRs) from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), encompassing 21,704,702 individuals, including 4,825,605 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between Jan 1, 2020, and Jan 4, 2024. RDs were defined using 12,003 conditions curated from GARD and Orphanet, mapped to OMOP concepts, and classified into 18 RD classes based on medical specialty involvement. Primary outcomes included: (1) COVID-19 severity (hospitalization and life-threatening disease), (2) long COVID, and (3) SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. We applied multivariable logistic regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting and reported adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and associated p-values. Models were controlled for demographics, comorbidities, and exposure to vaccination and antiviral treatments.

FindingsOf 21,704,702 individuals, we identify 4,825,605 COVID-19 positive individuals, 6.36% had RDs, with markedly higher rates of rare disease (RD) patients that have life-threatening illness (16% vs. 6.1% without life-threatening illness) and that are hospitalized (13% vs. 6.0% without hospitalization). Otorhinolaryngologic diseases showed the highest risk of life-threatening outcomes (OR 4.51; 95% CI 3.81-5.33), followed by developmental defect during embryogenesis (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.72-1.98) and cardiac conditions (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.51-2.11). Hospitalization risk was highest for otorhinolaryngologic (OR 2.90; 95% CI 2.61-3.23), developmental defect during embryogenesis (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.97-2.16), and hematologic and endocrine diseases (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.75-1.87 and OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.64-1.99, respectively).

In patients with RDs, vaccination alone or antiviral treatment alone was associated with reduced odds of life-threatening COVID-19 disease compared to non-vaccinated individuals (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.66-0.77 and OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.26-0.42, respectively). The combination of both vaccination and antiviral treatment showed the greatest reduction in odds ratio (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.20-0.27). Similar results were observed in patients without RDs. In contrast, vaccination or antiviral therapy alone, compared to no intervention, did not significantly reduce long COVID risk in RD patients, although these interventions alone did result in a lower odds ratio in patients without RD. However, their combination was protective in both groups. Vaccination alone, compared to no vaccination, also reduced the risk of reinfection across RD and non-RD populations.

InterpretationRD patients face elevated risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes. While vaccination and antivirals significantly reduce the acute severity of illness, their impact on long COVID appears limited in this population. Notably, vaccination was protective against COVID-19 reinfection in both RD and non-RD populations. These findings highlight the need for targeted strategies to protect RD patients beyond current interventions, particularly in preventing long-term complications.

Human genetic data and functional experimentation have demonstrated that H2AK119ub is required for cortical development, however the molecular mechanism for this remains unknown. Here, we show that mouse embryos expressing catalytically deficient RING1B exhibit intact early neurogenesis but display impaired neuroectodermal fate restriction. Using in vivo, primary, and in vitro models, we demonstrate that reduced H2AK119ub leads to ectopic activation of lineage-inappropriate transcriptional programmes, including mesodermal and endodermal gene expression during neural differentiation. This transcriptional deregulation is not solely attributable to H2AK119ub or H3K27me3 loss but instead reflects sensitisation of PRC1 target genes to inappropriate transcription factor (TF)-mediated activation. Synthetic induction of candidate TFs, including GATA6, SOX7, and SNAI1, phenocopies the fate-skewing effects of PRC1 catalytic dysfunction, confirming their causal role. Our results uncover a buffering role for PRC1-catalysed H2AK119ub in safeguarding neural progenitor identity by preventing inappropriate TF-driven transcription and provides a mechanistic framework for understanding the cellular heterogeneity and phenotypic variability observed in Polycomb-associated neurodevelopmental disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

Here, we show that Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1 (FSP1/Aifm2) is critically required for regulatory T cell (Treg) resistance to ferroptosis and their immunosuppressive function within the TME. Compared to other canonical ferroptosis regulators such as GPX4, GCH1, and NRF2, only FSP1 was induced upon T cell activation. Deletion of Aifm2 in all T cells, or Tregs specifically, enhanced tumor control by selectively disrupting Treg immunosuppression within tumors without inciting autoimmune pathology in mice. As opposed to deletion of Gpx4 in all T cells, T cell deletion of Aifm2 did not impair antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. These results reveal a unique opportunity for targeting a regulator of ferroptosis that can not only directly target cancer cells, but also simultaneously enhance anti-cancer immune responses without inciting autoimmunity.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

We aimed to map the production of scientific publications worldwide in terms of democracy and freedom of press ratings of countries. Democracy ratings used the Democracy Index in 2024 and in 2006 (when first released by the Economist Intelligence Unit) and Freedom of Press ratings used the 2024 index by Reports Without Borders. The Scopus database was used for publications from each country. Fractional counts were assigned for publications co-authored by authors from different countries. Full articles, reviews, conference papers, books and book chapters were included. In 2024, countries characterized as full democracies produced only 22% of the Scopus-indexed publications, versus 66% in 2006. There was no correlation between the ratio of publications indexed in 2024 versus 2006 and the absolute or relative change in Democracy Index between 2006 and 2024 (r=0.02 and r=0.00, respectively). 78% of publications in 2024 came from countries with problematic (including USA) or worse (including China) freedom of press.

Whether computational prediction tools can identify amyloid-forming potential in thrombus proteomes remains unclear.

MethodsAmyloGram is a computational tool that estimates amyloid-forming potential based on n-gram sequence encoding and random forest classification. Using AmyloGram, we analyzed 204 proteins tagged by humans as amyloidogenic in UniProt. We then applied the same approach to proteins identified in thrombi retrieved using mechanical thrombectomy from patients with cardioembolic and atherothrombotic stroke. In addition we used AmyloGram to analyse the amyloidogenicity of 83,567 canonical human protein sequences.

ResultsAmong the UniProt-annotated  amyloid set, nearly all proteins received AmyloGram scores above 0.7, including 23 of the 24 human proteins. Even the lowest-scoring human protein, lysozyme (scoring 0.675), is known to form amyloid under certain conditions. In thrombi from both stroke subtypes, all detected proteins had AmyloGram scores above 0.7, suggesting a high likelihood of amyloid content. A majority of unannotated proteins also achieve AmyloGram scores exceeding 0.7.

ConclusionsAmyloGram reliably identifies known amyloid-forming proteins and reveals that stroke thrombi are enriched for proteins with high amyloidogenic potential. These findings support the hypothesis that thrombus formation in stroke involves amyloid-related mechanisms and warrant further investigation using histological and functional validation.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

Class 4 antibodies represent an intriguing case: they target a deeply conserved, cryptic epitope on the receptor-binding domain yet exhibit variable neutralization potency across subgroups F1 (CR3022, EY6A, COVA1-16), F2 (DH1047), and F3 (S2X259). In this study, we employed a multi-modal computational approach combining atomistic and coarse-grained simulations, mutational scanning of binding interfaces, binding free energy calculations, and allosteric modeling using dynamic network analysis to map the allosteric landscapes and binding hotspots of these antibodies. Through this approach, our data revealed that distal binding can influence ACE2 engagement and immune escape traits through the confluence of direct interfacial interactions and allosteric effects. We found that group F1 antibodies can operate via classic allostery by modulating flexibility in the receptor binding domain loop regions and indirectly interfering with ACE2 binding using long-range effects. Group F2 antibody DH1047 represents an intermediate mechanism, engaging residues T376, R408, V503, and Y508 hotspots which are both critical for ACE2 binding and under immune pressure. Mutational scanning and rigorous binding free energy calculations highlight the synergy between hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, while dynamic network modeling reveals a shift toward localized communication pathways connecting the cryptic site to the ACE2 interface. Our results demonstrate how group F3 antibody S2X259 achieves efficient synergistic mechanism through confluence of direct competition with ACE2 and localized allosteric effects leading to stabilization of the spike protein at the cost of increased escape vulnerability. Dynamic network analysis identifies a shared ""allosteric ring"" embedded in the core of the receptor binding domain and serving a conserved structural scaffold mediating long-range signal propagation with antibody-specific extensions propagating toward the ACE2 interface. The findings of this study support a modular model of antibody-induced allostery where neutralization strategies evolve via refinement of peripheral network connections, rather than complete redesign of the epitope itself. Taken together, this study establishes a robust computational framework for atomistic understanding of mechanisms underlying neutralization activity and immune escape for class 4 antibodies which harness conformational dynamics, binding energetics, and allosteric modulation to influence viral entry. The findings highlight the modular evolution of neutralization strategies, where progressive refinement of peripheral interactions enhances potency but increases susceptibility to immune pressure.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

Fluorescence microscopy revealed that tonal stimuli with coherent low-frequency patterns enhanced actin polymerization and shmoo formation, both markers of polarity and mating. In contrast, broadband noise disrupted actin integrity, while consonants produced no measurable effects. These results suggest that rhythmic continuity and spectral coherence, key features of speech, can modulate cytoskeletal organization in non-auditory cells.

Here, using confocal microscopy and genetically encoded fluorescent sensors targeted to mitochondria and cytosol, we visualized beat-to-beat ATP dynamics in ventricular myocytes from adult male and female mice. These probes showed fluctuations in mitochondrial ATP levels with each contraction, revealing two distinct, spatially localized waveforms--ATP ""gain"" and ATP ""dip""--representing transient increases or decreases in matrix ATP levels, respectively. These waveforms were tightly phase-locked to intracellular Ca2+ transients and organized into energetic microdomains. Although female myocytes exhibited larger local mitochondrial ATP transients than their male counterparts, their total mitochondrial volume was lower. Female myocytes also exhibited tighter coupling between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria and showed a higher concentration of mitofusin 2 and ATP synthase catalytic -subunit per unit volume, suggesting more efficient ATP production. Cytosolic ATP transients mirrored mitochondrial waveforms and domain structure in both male and female myocytes. During faster pacing, diastolic cytosolic ATP rose more rapidly in female myocytes, whereas the accompanying beat-locked ATP transients increased in both sexes but did so proportionally more in males than in females. These findings demonstrate that ATP is synthesized on demand--beat by beat--in a modular, microdomain-specific manner. We propose that male myocytes rely on greater mitochondrial mass for energetic scaling, whereas female cells employ architectural precision to optimize ATP delivery.

Excitation of ventricular myocytes triggers Ca2+ entry through T-tubular L-type CaV1.2 channels (red), activating type-2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) clusters in the adjoining sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Released Ca2+ traverses the 12-nm cleft and enters subsarcolemmal mitochondria via mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) tethers (magenta), accelerating oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP (red ovals). In female myocytes (left), a select subset of tightly SR-coupled mitochondria produces large, beat-locked ATP surges that create localized energetic micro-domains. In male myocytes (right), looser SR-mitochondrial spacing and a greater mitochondrial density distribute the Ca2+ load evenly, yielding smaller but spatially uniform ATP transients. Thus, sex-specific differences in SR-mitochondrial nano couplingnot the excitation-contraction sequence itselfdetermine the amplitude and heterogeneity of beat-to-beat ATP supply in the heart.

How these networks are altered at the cellular level remains unclear owing to challenges of bridging data across scales. Here, we integrate in vivo cortical similarity networks with whole brain spatial transcriptomics to characterize the aging brain in a lifespan cohort of macaques (N=64, ages 1-26 years). Deep-layer excitatory neurons and oligodendrocytes emerged as dominant correlates of cortical similarity, linking infragranular cell type composition to macroscopic network structure. Age-related declines in network strength were most pronounced in transmodal networks, including default mode and limbic, and aligned with regions enriched in inhibitory and glial cell types. Parvalbumin-enriched chandelier cells showed the strongest association with regional vulnerability, suggesting a role in network disconnection. Cell-type enrichment was conserved across species, with both human and macaque transcriptomic data aligning with the cortical functional hierarchy. These findings uncover a cellular basis for cortical network aging and highlight the value of imaging-transcriptomic integration across scales.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

Within allopolyploids, duplicated genes across subgenomes, called homeologs, are thought to enhance environmental robustness by shifting their expression ratios depending on environmental and developmental changes. However, existing methods for detecting such ratio shifts, including HomeoRoq and Fishers exact test, are limited to allopolyploids with two subgenome sets inherited from two progenitors, and thus cannot handle more complex cases (e.g., allohexaploid wheat). Here, we present the HOmeolog Bias Identification Test (HOBIT), a statistical method for detecting shifts in homeolog expression ratios across different conditions using RNA-Seq count data. HOBIT performs a likelihood ratio test for each homeolog, comparing a full model allowing homeolog expression ratios to vary across conditions with a reduced model assuming constant ratios. Simulation benchmarks for allotetraploids and allohexaploids demonstrated that HOBIT outperforms existing methods in both area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and F1 score. Application to real RNA-Seq datasets from allotetraploid Cardamine flexuosa, allotriploid Cardamine insueta, and Triticum aestivum (wheat) produced biologically consistent results reflecting experimental settings.

Overall, long-distance input patterns for these feedforward and feedback neurons were largely similar, as all received the majority of their inputs from VISp, the primary visual cortex, along with substantial inputs from various other cortical and visual thalamic regions.

Spatial profiling of DNA methylation, which is a canonical epigenetic mark extensively implicated in transcriptional regulation, remains an unmet demand. Here, we introduce a method for whole genome spatial co-profiling of DNA methylation and transcriptome of the same tissue section at near single-cell resolution. Applying this technology to mouse embryogenesis and postnatal brain resulted in rich DNA-RNA bimodal tissue maps. These maps revealed the spatial context of known methylation biology and its interplay with gene expression. The two modalities concordance and distinction in spatial patterns highlighted a synergistic molecular definition of cell identity in spatial programming of mammalian development and brain function. By integrating spatial maps of mouse embryos at two different developmental stages, we reconstructed the dynamics of both epigenome and transcriptome underlying mammalian embryogenesis, revealing details in sequence, cell type, and region-specific methylation-mediated transcriptional regulation. This method extends the scope of spatial omics to DNA cytosine methylation for a more comprehensive understanding of tissue biology over development and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

Residential CD8 T cells, in particular, are identified as having prolonged residence in the tissues and key functions in recall responses at tissue-environmental interfaces, although the dwell time in individual tissues has yet to be resolved. Residential CD4 T cells, regulatory T cells, B cells, and NK cells have been demonstrated to share phenotypic properties with residential CD8 T cells, but the migratory kinetics are even more poorly defined. Here we used probabilistic modelling on a large parabiosis dataset, covering multiple time-points and tissues, to calculate migration kinetics and dwell times of multiple lymphocyte subsets across a diverse set of tissues. Markov chain modelling identified distinct cell type-specific and tissue-specific residency patterns. The liver and gut were prone to prolonged residency compared to other tissue types, and a hierarchy of residency was observed with CD8 T cells and NK cells demonstrating longer residency than CD4 conventional T cells and regulatory T cells, which in turn resided in tissues longer than B cells. With few exceptions, however, average residency was at least an order of magnitude shorter than the life-span of the mouse, indicating a more dynamic form of steady-state tissue residency than usually assumed.

The majority of described species are arthropods, which tend to be small and require taxonomic expertise to identify to species level. Therefore, the ability to collect and preserve specimens in a suitable way for long read and Hi-C data generation using very simple approaches with minimal infrastructure is certain to be important in scaling up reference genome generation. Using Anopheles mosquitoes as an insect representative we evaluate how well different preservation liquids protect high molecular weight DNA, RNA, and nuclei for Hi-C when mosquitoes are held intact versus slightly squished. We find that squished samples stored in 100% ethanol and Allprotect held at room temperature for one week result in excellent preservation of both high molecular weight DNA and nuclei for Hi-C. Other tested buffers, including RNAlater, EDTA at several pHs, and DMSO Salt Solution (DESS) performed satisfactorily for long read data generation and RNA retrieval, but less ideally for Hi-C, which may have bigger negative impacts when aiming to generate data for organisms with larger genomes. Field collections requiring dry ice or dry shippers can be logistically challenging to arrange, are notoriously expensive, and DNA degrades rapidly if ultra-cold temperature is not maintained, which is devastating given how expensive and time consuming field work can be. Here we present multiple viable options for room temperature collection and/or shipment for arthropod samples. Further exploration across a broader range of species will hopefully enable cheaper and more widely available reference genome generation globally.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

The viral S protein evolved towards highly efficient antibody evasion and replicative capacity in the upper respiratory tract resulting in high transmissibility. At the same time, the mutations acquired in the S protein diminish infection of the lung epithelium and pathogenic potential. The changing entry requirements for Omicron sub-lineages that lead to this shift in tropism remain poorly understood. We resolve the changing replication requirements of SARS-CoV-2 to be related to two distinct pools of ACE2. The first pool relates to ACE2s role in the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and this pool can complex with TMPRSS2 (RAS-ACE2). The second pool relates to ACE2s role as a protein solute carrier chaperone than cannot complex with TMPRSS2 (Chaperone ACE2). Here, we demonstrate that pre-Omicron lineages replicate in a TMPRSS2 dependent manner across both ACE2 pools, whilst Omicron lineages can only spread and replicate using chaperone ACE2. This provides a mechanistic basis for the evolving infectivity requirements of SARS-CoV-2 and furthermore provides approaches to track and monitor ACE2 utilizing coronaviruses.

Graphical AbstractMechanistic basis for shift in SARS-CoV-2 tropism with the arrival of Omicron. A. Chaperone ACE2 is defined structurally as a heterodimer of dimers with a solute carrier protein-SLC6A19 or SLC6A20. Here this ACE2 structure can exist uncomplexed from TMPRSS2 and enables TMPRSS2 use by both pre-Omicron and Omicron lineages. B. Renin Angiotensin ACE2 is defined by ACE2 with an exposed collectrin-like domain (CLD), which enables binding of TMPRSS2 or ADAM-17. Here ACE2 can form a complex with TMPRSS2 in a manner that allows pre-Omicron but not Omicron lineages to utilize TMPRSS2 to facilitate infection. Here Omicron lineages are heavily attenuated as they cannot use TMPRSS2 to spread. C. to E. Based on single cell profiles, ACE2 can exist as a chaperone with SLC6A20 in C. the Nasal Cavity or D. primarily as RAS-ACE2 in the lung to respond to acute lung injury. E. The largest pool of ACE2 in our body resides within the small intestine on enterocytes and this further facilitates replication in this tissue by pre-Omicron and Omicron lineages.

Here we present the first direct evidence that H3K4me3 is not a cause but a consequence of transcriptional activation, functioning as a downstream epigenetic response. Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription. Together, these findings redefine H3K4me3 as a post-transcriptional histone mark, revealing an unexpected layer of epigenetic regulation with broad implications for gene expression control.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

Relatedly, we discover species-specific biases of chemokine expression networks, factors which drive TMEs assembly. Further, assessing coarse cellular networks, we find conserved correlations between some immune cell frequencies, while other relationships only appear conserved in the huTMEs matching muTME profiles. Despite this variable alignment, we define robust cell type-specific gene expression programs conserved in TMEs across species and cohorts and identify ones that are coordinated between cell populations in both species. Together, we isolate and offer methods to study the multiple areas of hazard and opportunities for using mice to model human cancer.

As early-branching metazoans, cnidarians can offer insights into the early evolution of cell type-specific genome regulation. Here, we profiled chromatin accessibility in 60,000 cells from whole adults and gastrula-stage embryos of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We identified 112,728 CREs and quantified their activity across cell types, revealing pervasive combinatorial enhancer usage and distinct promoter architectures. To decode the underlying regulatory grammar, we trained sequence-based models predicting CRE accessibility and used these models to infer ontogenetic relationships among cell types. By integrating sequence motifs, transcription factor expression, and CRE accessibility, we systematically reconstructed the gene regulatory networks that define cnidarian cell types.

Most current methods fall at one of two extremes: either opaque deep learning models that obscure biological meaning, or simplified frameworks that treat genes as isolated units. As such, these approaches overlook a crucial insight: gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cellular states can be harnessed to model perturbation responses. Here we present CIPHER (Covariance Inference for Perturbation and High-dimensional Expression Response), a conceptual framework leveraging linear response theory from statistical physics to predict transcriptome-wide perturbation outcomes using gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cells. We validated CIPHER on synthetic regulatory networks before applying it to 11 large-scale single-cell perturbation datasets covering 4,234 perturbations and over 1.36M cells. CIPHER robustly recapitulated genome-wide responses to single and double perturbations by exploiting baseline gene covariance structure. Importantly, eliminating gene-gene covariances, while retaining gene-intrinsic variances, reduced model performance by 11-fold, demonstrating the rich information stored within baseline fluctuation structures. Moreover, gene-gene correlations transferred successfully across independent experiments of the same cell type, revealing stereotypic fluctuation structures. Furthermore, CIPHER outperformed conventional differential expression metrics in identifying true perturbations while providing uncertainty-aware effect size estimates through Bayesian inference. Finally, most genome-wide responses propagated through the covariance matrix along approximately three independent and global gene modules. CIPHER underscores the importance of theoretically-grounded models in capturing complex biological responses, highlighting fundamental design principles encoded in cellular fluctuation patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

Here we measure fluctuations in neuronal activity and blood volume associated with the same events across the mouse brain, and find that their relationship is consistent across brain regions but differs in two opposing brainwide neural populations. Functional Ultrasound Imaging (fUSI) revealed that whisking, a marker of arousal, is associated with brainwide fluctuations in blood volume. Simultaneous fUSI and Neuropixels recordings in cortex and hippocampus showed that neurons that increase vs. decrease activity with whisking have distinct hemodynamic response functions. Brainwide Neuropixels recordings revealed that these two opposing populations are present in the entire brain. When summed, their contributions predicted blood volume across brain regions better than predictions from bulk neural activity. The mouse brain thus contains two neural populations with opposite relation to brain state and distinct relationships to blood supply, which together account for brainwide fluctuations in blood volume.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

However, recent studies have uncovered their role in antigen surveillance and immune signalling initiation. To investigate how membrane protrusions initiate and contribute to signalling, from the first cell-cell contact to immunological synapse formation, we performed dynamic imaging experiments of endogenously tagged signalling proteins in T cells. To quantitatively capture the early dynamics of cell-cell interactions, we employed HER2-CAR-expressing T cells targeting HER2+breast cancer cells. By harnessing live-cell imaging and super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy we were able to capture topological membrane changes and their correlation with mesoscale protein rearrangements over time. Our findings indicate that, prior to activation, key molecular players in T cell activation, including the kinase Lck, the phosphatase CD45 and the adaptor LAT, as well as the exogenously expressed CAR, lack any enrichment in actin-rich protrusions. However, upon initial contact of the T cell with the target cell, a dynamic and fast rearrangement of the surface receptors, phosphatases, and kinases occurs within the protrusions, ensuring a rapid and effective initiation of the immune signalling cascade. The rapid clustering of the HER2-CAR occurs preferentially within protrusions rather than flat membrane regions and is accompanied by enhanced recruitment of the kinase ZAP-70 and LAT. While the localisation of the kinase Lck remained unchanged, protrusion-cell contacts trigger a pronounced exclusion of the phosphatase CD45, an effect observed both with and without the cytosolic signalling domain of the CAR. Overall, the signalling machinery rearranged more rapidly and efficiently at contacts mediated by protrusive structures compared to non-protrusive regions.

Using Staphylococcus aureus as a model, we found that gene transfer via various mechanisms is significantly restricted between strains from different clonal complexes (CCs), with the notable exception of lateral transduction, which occurs at high frequency. Interestingly, some strains exhibited a ""promiscuous"" ability to accept diverse mobile genetic elements. These strains were defective in the key immune defences of S. aureus, specifically the Type I restriction-modification systems that normally protect against foreign DNA. A broader analysis revealed that such immune-deficient mutants are widespread within S. aureus populations. Our study uncovered a trade-off that explains their persistence in nature: although these mutants are more susceptible to phage attack, they gain an evolutionary advantage by acquiring beneficial genes - such as those conferring antibiotic resistance - which enhance survival under selective pressure. These immune-deficient cells act as gateways for foreign DNA, which, once integrated and advantageous, can spread within the same CC. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for immune-deficient bacteria in facilitating the emergence of novel virulence factors and antibiotic resistance, emphasising their importance in shaping bacterial evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

How these cancer-specific methylation changes are established in the decades before cancer, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we use a unique collection of longitudinal blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia to sensitively track the dynamics of DNA methylation changes at high temporal resolution. We identify thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that exhibit altered patterns of methylation up to 10 years before acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) diagnosis. Most of these DMRs are strongly associated with expanding clones carrying somatic driver mutations. We identify a subset of  epigenetic driver DMRs characterised by recurrent CpG alterations that are highly shared across pre-AML cases. These are likely to reflect early epigenetic reprogramming associated with AML development. We also reveal large numbers of stochastic  passenger CpGs whose differential methylation results from hitch-hiking with clonal expansions driven by somatically acquired genetic events. These passenger CpGs can be exploited for lineage tracing to discover clonal expansions driven by missing driver mutations. Our findings show widespread changes in methylation patterns during the early stages of cancer development which could be utilised for risk prediction and therapeutic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

We combined chemically imposed immune activation with single-cell transcriptomics to profile ETI responses across all leaf cell types in Arabidopsis. Despite uniform ETI perception, we find striking divergence between transcriptional outputs: a core set of defense genes is broadly induced, while distinct cell types activate specialized immune modules. We infer that downstream immune execution is shaped not only by immune receptor activation, but also by cell identity and its associated transcriptional regulatory context, including local transcription factor availability and chromatin accessibility. We further demonstrate that transcriptional regulators preferentially induced in epidermal cells are required to restrict invasion by non-adapted pathogens. Their absence permits pathogen entry into deeper tissues despite intact recognition, revealing a spatial division of immune functions. Our findings uncover a layered immune architecture in plants, challenges the assumption of uniform immune execution, and provides a framework for exploring cell-type-specific resistance logic in multicellular hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

The success of motor augmentation devices, such as supernumerary robotic limbs, hinges on users capacity for generalised motor performance.

We trained participants over seven days to use an extra robotic thumb (Third Thumb, Dani Clode Design), worn on the right hand and controlled via the toes. We tested whether motor learning was confined to the specific tasks and body parts involved in controlling and interacting with the Third Thumb, or whether it could generalise beyond them.

Participants showed broad skill generalisation across tasks, body postures, and even when either the Third Thumb or the controller was reassigned to a different body part, suggesting the development of abstract, body-independent motor representations.

Training also reduced cognitive demands and increased the sense of agency over the device. However, participants still preferred using their biological hand over the Third Thumb when given the option, suggesting that factors beyond motor skill generalisation, cognitive effort, and embodiment must be addressed to support the real-world adoption of such technologies.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

In Caenorhabditis elegans, favorable conditions promote dispersal, while stressors like food scarcity or overcrowding trigger aggregation. Here, we describe a distinct behavior termed as swarming, where C. elegans move and feed in aggregates despite abundant food availability. While environmental factors have been implicated in this behavior, the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We identify a novel role for the conserved calsyntenin protein CASY-1 in regulating swarming. Through genetic, behavioral, and optogenetic approaches, we show that CASY-1 functions in sensory neurons to modulate the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) signaling. Mutants in casy-1 show impaired PDF-1 signaling and reduced inhibition of the serotonin pathway, a known regulator of social behaviors. This dysregulation, along with its associated mechanosensory and foraging defects, likely contributes to the swarming phenotype. Our findings reveal a putative neuromodulatory pathway critical for swarming behavior in C. elegans.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077697

Genomic exploration continually reveals novel microbial lineages, often exhibiting extreme genome reduction, particularly within symbiotic relationships. Here, we report the discovery of Candidatus Sukunaarchaeum mirabile, a novel archaeon with an unprecedentedly small genome of only 238 kbp --less than half the size of the smallest previously known archaeal genome-- from a dinoflagellate-associated microbial community. Phylogenetic analyses place Sukunaarchaeum as a deeply branching lineage within the tree of Archaea, representing a novel major branch distinct from established phyla. Environmental sequence data indicate that sequences closely related to Sukunaarchaeum form a diverse and previously overlooked clade in microbial surveys. Its genome is profoundly stripped-down, lacking virtually all recognizable metabolic pathways, and primarily encoding the machinery for its replicative core: DNA replication, transcription, and translation. This suggests an unprecedented level of metabolic dependence on a host, a condition that challenges the functional distinctions between minimal cellular life and viruses. The discovery of Sukunaarchaeum pushes the conventional boundaries of cellular life and highlights the vast unexplored biological novelty within microbial interactions, suggesting that further exploration of symbiotic systems may reveal even more extraordinary life forms, reshaping our understanding of cellular evolution.

Its detoxification by superoxide dismutase (SOD) is essential for redox homeostasis. We report the structure of the PSI-SOD supercomplex from Chromera velia (C. velia), revealing a direct coupling between energy conversion and oxidative stress protection. The heterodimeric SOD comprises a catalytic SOD2 and a non-catalytic SOD1 anchoring it to the conserved stromal PSI surface near the ferredoxin-binding site with four contact areas. Structural comparison with plants and algae shows that SOD could occupy a similar position via interactions with PsaD. C. velia PSI displays several distinct features, including a split subunit PsaA linked by PsaV, a unique iso-fucoxanthin bound to PsaB, and an extended PsaF coordinating an extra chlorophyll in the membrane. The antenna includes five fucoxanthin-chlorophyll family proteins (FCPs) stabilized by adaptations unique to each antenna protein. These findings reveal the structural basis for the integration of a photoprotective mechanism with energy metabolism in photosynthetic membranes.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077698

Microtubule-binding components of the human outer kinetochore, such as Ndc80 and Ska complexes, are present in multiple copies and together bind several microtubule ends, creating a highly multivalent binding interface. Whereas Ndc80:Ndc80 and Ndc80:microtubule binding is crucial for interface stability, Ndc80 alone in absence of Ska is unable to support stable kinetochore-attachments. Using cryoET, we demonstrate that oligomeric Ndc80:Ska assemblies stabilise microtubule ends against shortening by strengthening lateral contacts between tubulin protofilaments at microtubule plus-ends. We further identify a point mutation within the SKA1 microtubule-binding domain that does not affect microtubule-binding of individual Ska molecules, but does abolish Ska:Ska interactions. Finally, we report that oligomerisation of Ska, in a cooperative fashion together with the Ndc80, is necessary to maintain stable microtubule attachments both in vivo and in vitro.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077698

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

However, achieving precise control over tissue mechanics to direct specific morphogenetic outcomes remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a strategy to program tissue shape transformations through the nematic organization of cellular forces. By precisely controlling nematic order and topological defects, we generate millimeter-scale tissues programmed with specific multicellular tension fields. Using a theoretical framework that integrates contractile nematics with thin sheet mechanics, we explore the role of nematically guided tensions in shape morphogenesis. Experimentally, upon tissue detachment, nematically guided tension fields drive out-of-plane deformations, generating reproducible 3D shapes.

Here, we demonstrate that cryo-fixation combined with ultrastructural expansion microscopy (cryo-ExM) can overcome the silica barrier across diverse diatom species spanning over 80 million years of evolutionary time. We illustrate the potential of cryo-ExM to provide scalable, cost-effective volumetric imaging of diatom ultrastructure in laboratory cultures, as well as field-collected samples from the pan-European TREC expedition. We first reveal striking similarities in interphase microtubule organization across diverse diatom species by characterizing cytoskeletal arrangements throughout cell cycles and populations, uniting both pennate and centric morphologies under shared principles. We further unveil diatom photosynthetic diversity through qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis of chloroplast and pyrenoid morphologies, demonstrating that each diatom species architects unique photosynthetic machinery. Using cryo-ExM on environmental samples further exposes intricate diatom symbioses, revealing tight spatial organisation of ecological interactions. This methodology makes diatoms more accessible for modern and comparative cell biology research, providing new opportunities to investigate the cellular mechanisms of one of Earths most successful photosynthetic groups.

The viral non-structural protein NS3 is a membrane-bound AAA+ ATPase of superfamily 3 (SF3) with multiple proposed roles in the norovirus replication cycle. However, the structure of NS3, and the mechanisms by which it contributes to genome replication and membrane remodeling, have remained unknown. We engineered a soluble, hexameric, and catalytically active form of NS3 and determined its cryo-EM structure in the presence of a nucleotide analogue at 2.9 [A] resolution. The structure adopts a split lock-washer architecture characteristic of AAA+ motors that operate via a hand-over-hand translocation mechanism2. Modeling of the nucleotide-binding site reveals conserved features governing ATP binding and hydrolysis. Using integrative modeling with AlphaFold3, we generated a full-length, membrane-associated model of NS3, in which an N-terminal transmembrane domain, central helical bundle, and AAA+ motor form a continuous conduit. This model supports a role for NS3 as a candidate membrane-spanning RNA translocase that couples ATP hydrolysis to genome movement. This structural framework helps address long-standing gaps in our understanding of norovirus replication and establishes a basis for mechanistic studies and structure-guided antiviral design.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077698

Despite transient expressions prevalence in disciplines such as synthetic biology, little work has been done to describe and address the variability inherent in this system, a concern for experiments that rely on highly quantitative readouts. In a comprehensive analysis of N. benthamiana agroinfiltration experiments, we model sources of variability that affect transient expression. Our findings emphasize the need to validate normalization methods under the specific conditions of each study, as distinct normalization schemes do not always reduce variation either within or between experiments. Using a dataset of 1,813 plants collected over three years, we develop a comprehensive model of variation in N. benthamiana transient expression, using power analysis to determine the number of individual plants required for a given effect size. Drawing on our longitudinal data, these findings inform practical guidelines for minimizing variability through strategic experimental design and power analysis, providing a foundation for more robust and reproducible use of N. benthamiana in quantitative plant biology and synthetic biology applications.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077698

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077698

As part of a broader long-term study on African leopard (Panthera pardus) population ecology in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda, we deployed camera traps on animal trails and at Python Cave, a known roost site of Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and a confirmed Marburg and virus reservoir. This serendipitous deployment yielded the first visual documentation of a multi-trophic predator and scavenger guild interacting at a filovirus reservoir site. Over a five month period (February 16th - June 5th 2025) across 304 trap nights, we recorded at least 14 different vertebrate species, including leopards, primates, raptors, and small carnivores, engaging in bat predation, scavenging on bat remains, guano foraging, or cave exploration across 261 temporally and spatially independent events (>1 hour apart). These instances were structured, repeated and the species continuously made contact with the bats or entered their roosting space. Camera traps also recorded an estimated 400 human individuals visiting the cave -- including school groups, tourists, and local trainees -- the majority with no personal protective equipment. The shallow, accessible structure of Python Cave appears to collapse the typical spatial buffers between reservoir species and both predators and humans. These observations constitute the first ecological confirmation of a dynamic, multispecies exposure network at a known Marburg virus site, and may represent a Rosetta Stone for interpreting the real-time mechanics of zoonotic spillover.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077698

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

While these have the potential to significantly accelerate scientific discoveries by creating AI-driven virtual cell models, their progress has been greatly limited by the lack of large-scale high-quality perturbation data, which remains constrained due to scalability bottlenecks and assay variability. Here, we introduce ""Fix-Cryopreserve-ScRNAseq"" (FiCS) Perturb-seq, an industrialized platform for scalable Perturb-seq data generation. We demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq exhibits high sensitivity and low batch effects, effectively capturing perturbation-induced transcriptomic changes and recapitulating known biological pathways and protein complexes. In addition, we release X-Atlas: Orion edition (X-Atlas/Orion), the largest publicly available Perturb-seq atlas. This atlas, generated from two genome-wide FiCS Perturb-seq experiments targeting all human protein-coding genes, comprises eight million cells deeply sequenced to over 16,000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell. Furthermore, we show that single guide RNA (sgRNA) abundance can serve as a proxy for gene knockdown (KD) efficacy. Leveraging the deep sequencing and substantial cell numbers per perturbation, we also show that stratification by sgRNA expression can reveal dose-dependent genetic effects. Taken together, we demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq is an efficient and scalable platform for high-throughput Perturb-seq screens. Through the release of X-Atlas/Orion, we highlight the potential of FiCS Perturb-seq to address current scalability and variability challenges in data generation, advance foundation model development that incorporates gene-dosage effects, and accelerate biological discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077698

Can these divergent perspectives on cortical organization be reconciled within a unifying framework? Using data-driven decomposition of fMRI responses in face-, body-, and scene-selective areas, we identified overlapping activity patterns shared across individuals. Each area encoded multiple interpretable dimensions tuned to both finer subcategory features and coarser cross-category distinctions beyond its preferred category, even in the most category-selective voxels. These dimensions formed distinct clusters within category-selective areas but were also sparsely distributed across the broader visual cortex, supporting both locally selective, category-specific, and globally distributed, feature-based coding. Together, these findings suggest multidimensional tuning as a fundamental organizing principle that integrates feature-selective clusters, category-selective areas, and large-scale tuning maps, providing a more comprehensive understanding of category representations in human visual cortex.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077698

The protein C2CD3 is critical for distal appendage assembly, with mutations linked to orofaciodigital syndrome and other ciliopathies. However, its precise molecular role in appendage recruitment remains unclear. Using Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-ExM), iterative U-ExM, and in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), we reveal that C2CD3 adopts a radially symmetric 9-fold organization within the centrioles distal lumen. We show that the C-terminal region of C2CD3 localizes close to a [~]100 nm luminal ring structure consisting of [~]27 nodes, while its N-terminal region localizes close to a hook-like structure that attaches to the A-microtubule as it extends from the centriole interior to exterior. This hook structure is adjacent to the DISCO complex (MNR/CEP90/OFD1), which marks future appendage sites. C2CD3 depletion disrupts not only the recruitment of the DISCO complex via direct interaction with MNR but also destabilizes the luminal ring network composed of C2CD3/SFI1/centrin-2/CEP135/NA14, as well as the distal microtubule tip protein CEP162. This reveals an intricate ""in-to-out"" molecular hub connecting the centriolar lumen, distal microtubule cap, and appendages. Although C2CD3 loss results in shorter centrioles and appendage defects, key structural elements remain intact, permitting continued centriole duplication. We propose that C2CD3 forms the luminal ring structure and extends radially to the space between triplet microtubules, functioning as an architectural hub that scaffolds the distal end of the centriole, orchestrating its assembly and directing appendage formation.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077698

However, a unifying set of physical principles underlying these varied interactions and their implications for chromatin organization remains elusive. Here, we develop and experimentally validate a mesoscopic model that bridges the physics of phase separation and chromatin mechanics. Specifically, by integrating computational modeling with experiments using two canonical condensate proteins, the heterochromatin protein HP1, and the euchromatin protein BRD4, we demonstrate that wetting properties and chromatin stiffness shape condensate morphology, while condensates remodel chromatin mechanics and organization. This two-way interplay is governed by elastocapillarity--the deformation of chromatin by condensate interfacial tension -- and resolves discrepancies in nuclear condensate behavior, with emergent behaviors that deviate from the simplest liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) models5-8. Our findings underscore that nuclear condensates and chromatin cannot be studied in isolation, as they are fundamentally interdependent, impacted by biomolecularly-defined wetting properties, with implications for genome organization, transcriptional regulation, and epigenetic control in diverse phenotypes, including cancer2,9,10.

The mechanism by which ectopic gene activation occurs through these gain-of-function enhancer mutations remains poorly understood. Using the ZRS, a benchmark disease-associated enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), as a model, we demonstrate that poised (i.e., accessible but inactive) chromatin sensitizes Shh to aberrant activation in anterior limb bud, leading to polydactyly. In the anterior limb cells of wild-type mice, Shh is inactive, but the ZRS is accessible and marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. We demonstrate that this poising signature explains how over 20 independent rare variants within the ZRS cause Shh misexpression in the same anterior limb bud cell population, resulting in similar limb malformations, despite affecting binding sites for different activators and repressors. Disabling pioneer transcription factor binding to the ZRS suppresses its poised state in anterior cells, prevents aberrant activation of the ZRS by rare variants, and fully rescues limb malformations in variant knock-in mice. A thorough examination of other disease-associated enhancers with pathogenic gain-of-function variants revealed that they are all poised in tissues with ectopic activity. We use this poising signature to predict and validate in vivo ectopic forebrain activity of previously uncharacterized autism-associated non-coding variants. Our findings suggest that spatial enhancer poising, likely a byproduct of development, creates a susceptibility to non-coding mutations and offers a potential mechanistic explanation for the burden of disease-associated non-coding variants.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077698

However, these methods are inherently specialized, relying on predefined assumptions and/or limited scalability. Recent advances in simulation and deep learning provide an alternative approach: learning directly to generalize from synthetic genetic data to infer specific hidden evolutionary processes. Here we reframe the inference of coalescence times as a problem of translation between two biological languages: the sparse, observable patterns of mutation along the genome and the unobservable ancestral recombination graph (ARG) that gave rise to them. Inspired by large language models, we develop cxt, a decoder-only transformer that autoregressively predicts coalescent events conditioned on local mutational context. We show that cxt performs on par with state-of-the-art MCMC-based likelihood models across a broad range of demographic scenarios, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Trained on simulations spanning the stdpopsim catalog, the model generalizes robustly and enables efficient inference at scale, producing over a million coalescence predictions in minutes. In addition cxt produces a well calibrated approximate posterior distribution of its predictions, enabling principled uncertainty quantification. Our work moves towards a foundation model for population genetics, bridging deep learning and coalescent theory to enable flexible, scalable inference of genealogical history from genomic data.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077698

While the virus itself contributes to pathogenesis, disease severity is primarily influenced by the hosts response to infection. One factor observed to impact the host response is sex, as epidemiological data indicates that male persons have a higher case fatality rate than females infected with MERS-CoV. However, the mechanism underlying this sex bias is unknown and disease course remains difficult to predict. This study investigates how male and female transgenic mice expressing humanized dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (hDPP4) respond to MERS-CoV infection following exposure to either a tolerance-inducing low dose or lethal high dose. We observed that female hDPP4 mice display dose-dependent tolerance to infection and males experienced uniformly lethal disease in both dosing groups. Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis revealed that males suppress innate and inflammatory responses early after infection, causing delayed induction of the host antiviral response. In contrast, high dose females mount an immediate and sustained interferon and inflammatory response, activating antiviral effectors and interferon-stimulated genes. Tolerant females displayed the greatest transcriptional control, showing no pathway enrichment and minimal changes in weight throughout infection. Our results suggest that the magnitude of the response is driven by dose while the nature of the response in shaped by sex. Females mount a more robust response to MERS-CoV infection, allowing females to tolerate low-dose infection but causing uncontrolled inflammation after high dose infection. In contrast, males experienced lethal outcomes regardless of dose. By examining the dynamics of sex-biased host transcriptional responses in determining disease severity, this study highlights the importance of sex as a biological variable in coronavirus pathogenesis research.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077698

Here we report evolutionary analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data of male and female human, marmoset (New World monkey), and mouse gonadal cells spanning key prenatal stages. We find that the two primates and mouse share similar X chromosome expression dynamics, including X chromosome reactivation (XCR), and that in Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) testes, germ cells undergo female-like XCR and escape of X inactivation. New male-specific regulatory regions have emerged progressively during mammalian evolution, especially on the X following sex chromosome origination. Further analyses revealed that male-specific regulatory regions evolved faster than female-specific ones in both supporting and pre-meiotic germ cells. However, female meiotic germ cells show even higher rates of molecular evolution and exhibit a permissive chromatin state that facilitates the birth of new genes, thus resembling their adult spermatogenic counterparts. Finally, we traced both conserved and species-specific gene expression trajectories across the three mammals, uncovering candidate genes for disorders of sex development that are typically central to cell-type-specific regulatory networks. Together, our study unveils both ancestral mammalian and recently evolved gene regulatory programs that control human- and primate-specific aspects of gonadal development in both sexes.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077698

Nevertheless, regeneration remains a bottleneck and alternative morphogenic genes are highly desired. Here, we co-expressed BABY BOOM and WUSCHEL2 in zygotic maize (Zea mays L.) embryos and studied gene regulatory networks in induced somatic embryos at the single-cell level. By inferring cell-type-specific regulons, we prioritized candidate regulators and confirmed functionality of four transcription factors, bHLH48, EREB152, GRF4, and HB77, for enhanced maize transformation frequency, leading to fertile, transgenic plants. Interestingly, the basic helix-loop-helix and homeodomain-leucine zipper families had previously not been associated with induced somatic embryogenesis.

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2. These structural predictions were based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database, together with corresponding protein sequences obtained from UniProt. We then assessed the predicted interaction structures through various confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we performed a limited evaluation against experimentally determined human protein complex structures not included in the Boltz-2 training regimen, which indicated prediction accuracy consistent with AlphaFold3. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, while highlighting both strengths and limitations. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077698

Correspondingly, current theories describe muscle activity as a function of cortical dynamics. Tasks like speech and locomotion, however, require the integration of voluntary commands with ongoing movements orchestrated by largely independent subcortical centers. In such cases, motor cortex must receive inputs representing the state of the environment and the state of subcortical networks, then transform these inputs into commands that modulate the rhythmic motor pattern. Here, we study this transformation in mice performing an obstacle traversal task, which combines a spinal locomotor pattern with voluntary cortical adjustments. Cortical dynamics contain a prominent representation of motor preparation that is linked to obstacle proximity and robust to removal of somatosensory or visual input, and also maintain a representation of the state of the spinal pattern generator. Readout signals resembling commands for obstacle traversal are consistent across trials, but small in amplitude. Using computational modeling, we identify a simple algorithm that generates the appropriate commands through phase-dependent gating. Together, these results reveal a regime in which motor cortex does not fully specify muscle activity, but must sculpt an ongoing, spinally-generated program to flexibly control behavior in a complex and changing environment.","NA","biorxiv",1752531077698

Its speed is due to (a) a carefully engineered architecture involving only cache-coherent MSD radix sorts and merges, (b) a novel algorithm for finding adaptive seed hits in a linear merge of sorted k-mer tables, and (c) a variant of the Myers adaptive wave algorithm [1] to find alignments around a chain of seed hits that detects alignments with up to 25-30% variation. It further does not require pre-masking of repetitive sequence, and stores millions of alignments in a fraction of the space of a conventional CIGAR-string [2] using a trace-point encoding that is further compressed by the ONEcode data system [3] introduced here.

As an example, two bat genomes of size 2.2Gbp and 2.5Gbp can be compared in a little over 2 minutes using 8 threads on an Apple M4 Max laptop using 5.7GB of memory and producing 1.05 million alignments totaling 1.63Gbp of aligned sequence that cover about 60% of each genome.

ObjectiveTo estimate the impacts of federal policy changes on PrEP coverage, new HIV infections and costs associated with new HIV infections

DesignEstimation of excess HIV infections under different policy impacts were conducted using parameters from a previously published ecological model of the relationship between PrEP coverage and new HIV infections. Costs were estimated for the treatment of infections not averted under different scenarios.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsThere was no individual participation in research activities; population-based data sources were used to describe the population-level PrEP use and new diagnoses under different hypothetical changes in PrEP coverage.

ExposuresPercent of people with indications for PrEP who are taking PrEP

Main Outcome and MeasuresEstimated change in new HIV infections under different assumptions of change in PrEP coverage; costs of treatment for avoidable HIV infections and net costs of avoidable infections after accounting for costs of PrEP medications.

ResultsEven modest reductions in PrEP coverage would result in thousands of avoidable HIV infections. An absolute 3.3% annual reduction in PrEP coverage over the next decade would result in 8,618 avoidable HIV infections, with lifetime medical costs of over $3.6 billion (discounted) for treatment of the unaverted HIV infections.

Conclusions and RelevanceChanges in policy that reduce PrEP uptake would result in avoidable HIV infections and increased costs for HIV treatment. Maintaining policies and programs that support PrEP uptake offers benefits for health and is estimated to result in net cost savings.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the likely impacts on HIV transmissions and healthcare costs if policy changes result in decreased PrEP utilization in the United States?

FindingsUnder assumptions of even modest reductions in PrEP use, we estimated thousands of HIV infections would fail to be averted over the next decade, and billions of dollars of additional treatment costs would accrue to the healthcare system.

Results of the studyWe used historical descriptive data on the US HIV epidemic to quantify the relationship between PrEP coverage and trends in HIV diagnoses and to estimate future trends in HIV infections if PrEP coverage were to be rolled back. If PrEP use declines modestly - about 3% annually - we estimate that 8,618 new infections would fail to be averted in a decade because of lowered PrEP uptake, and the estimated lifetime medical costs of these unaverted infections would be $3.6 billion (discounted) and $9.3 billion (undiscounted).

MeaningChanges in healthcare priorities and policies, especially those that increase out of pocket costs of PrEP or reduce the convenience of engaging in PrEP care, risk rolling back our progress in ending the HIV epidemic, accruing avertable HIV infections, and incurring increased costs for medical care of people whose HIV infections were avoidable.","NA","medrxiv",1752531077698
