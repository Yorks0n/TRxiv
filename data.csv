We sought to investigate whether symptom severity is influenced by changes in sex hormones over the menstrual cycle, or by hormonal contraception.

MethodsWe carried out a retrospective analysis of menstrual and symptom data, prospectively collected via the Visible app from individuals with long COVID, ME/CFS, or both, who had regular menstrual cycles, between 7th September 2022 and 6th March 2024. Mixed-effects models were used to examine associations between symptom severity, menstrual cycle phase and contraception type.

Findings948 users were included; 100% of users were female and 92.6% identified as women. The most tracked symptoms were fatigue (99{middle dot}5% of users), brain fog (88{middle dot}3%), headaches (85{middle dot}1%) and muscle aches (78{middle dot}6%). All menstrual cycle phases showed a modest, but significant, improvement compared to the menstrual phase, most markedly the early luteal (IRR = 0{middle dot}963, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}958-0{middle dot}968), but also the follicular (IRR = 0{middle dot}985, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}981-0{middle dot}990) and late luteal phases (IRR = 0{middle dot}980, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}974- 0{middle dot}985). Crashes (sudden and severe worsening of symptoms following exertion) were significantly more frequent during menstruation than in other phases. Users of combined hormonal contraception (n=70) had a statistically significant reduction in overall symptom score (OR = 0{middle dot}827, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}690-0{middle dot}992) and crash incidence (OR = 0{middle dot}548, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}350-0{middle dot}856) compared to those not using contraception (n=786).

InterpretationMenstruation is associated with worsened symptoms in long COVID and ME/CFS. Users of combined hormonal contraception report a lower symptom burden than non-users, suggesting a modulatory role of ovarian hormones. These findings could empower menstruating people living with long COVID and ME/CFS to anticipate cyclical changes in symptoms and plan their activities accordingly, and could also inform their use of contraception.

It has often been considered as a source of novel genes but quantitative assessments of this claim are lacking. To investigate the potential role of natural transformation in gene acquisition, we analysed a large collection of genomes of Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) and Legionella pneumophila (Lp) for which transformation rates were experimentally determined. Natural transformation rates are weakly correlated with genome size. But they are negatively associated with gene flow in both species. This might result from a negative balance between transformations ability to cure the chromosome from mobile genetic elements (MGEs), resulting in gene loss, and its facilitation of gene acquisition. By focusing on the latter, we found that transformation was significantly associated with small gene acquisition events while MGEs-driven gene acquisition tend to be associated with larger ones. Events of gene gain by transformation were spread more evenly in the chromosome than MGEs encoding the ability to integrate autonomously. We estimated the contribution of natural transformation to gene gains by comparing recombination-driven gene acquisition rates between transformable and non-transformable strains. Natural transformation may have caused the acquisition of up to 6.4% (Ab) and 1.1% (Lp) of the novel genes. This low contribution of natural transformation to the acquisition of novel genes implies that most novel genes must have been acquired by other means. Interestingly, the ones potentially acquired by transformation include almost 15% of the recently acquired antibiotic resistance genes in A. baumannii. Hence, natural transformation may drive the acquisition of relatively few novel genes but these may have a high fitness impact.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

Influential theories based on prediction errors explain numerous behavioral and neurobiological observations but do not account for how animals measure the passage of time. Here, we propose a Bayesian theory for temporal causal learning, where the structure of inter-stimulus intervals is used to infer the singular cause of a rewarding stimulus. We show that a single assumption of timescale invariance, formulated as an hierarchical generative model, is sufficient to explain a puzzling set of learning phenomena, including the power-law dependence of acquisition on inter-trial intervals and timescale invariance in response profiles. A biologically plausible algorithm for inference recapitulates salient aspects of both timing and prediction error theories. The theory predicts neural signals with distinct dynamics that encode causal associations and temporal structure.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

In the insect mushroom body (MB), odours are encoded by the activity of Kenyon cells (KCs). The random wiring of olfactory projection neurons (PNs) and KCs in the MB calyx is thought to enhance odour discrimination. Here, we examined the impact of deviations from random wiring and demonstrated their significant roles in shaping odour representations. We confirm that different KC types have distinct PN input biases correlated with the contextual relevance of the odour information delivered by the PNs. By recording the functional responses of different KC types to ethologically defined odour categories, we found that the {beta} and {beta} KCs produce segregated representations of relevant odour groups, potentially enhancing the categorisation of odours based on ethological relevance. Simultaneously, these same KC types displayed distinct representations for food-related odours, supporting precise discrimination. In contrast, {gamma} KCs lacked significant segregation of odour representations by ethological category. Computational simulations refined with our functional data indicated that the specific PN input connection pattern of individual KC types largely accounts for the observed representations. Taken together, we propose that individual KC types process odour information with distinct objectives, supporting both ethological categorisation and discrimination.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

We address this challenge through the lens of continuous-attractor networks, which model how neural circuits may represent continuous variables, such as head direction or spatial location, through collective dynamics. In classical continuous-attractor models, a continuous symmetry of the connectivity generates a manifold of stable states, resulting in tuning curves that are identical up to shifts. However, mouse head-direction cells show substantial heterogeneity in their responses that appears incompatible with this classical picture. To understand the mechanistic origin of these data, we use an optimization principle to construct recurrent-network models that match the observed responses while exhibiting quasi-continuous-attractor dynamics. To study how such systems scale with increasing numbers of neurons N, we develop a statistical generative process that produces artificial tuning curves that match many features of the experimental data quantitatively. Due to a continuous symmetry in the generative process, the connectivity matrix exhibits doublet degeneracy in its spectrum at large N, reflecting an underlying circular geometry. Unlike classical models, where the ring structure is embedded in the neuronal space through a structured Fourier embedding, our model uses a random, disordered embedding. Analysis of the network dynamics in the large-N limit through dynamical mean-field theory reveals that the system becomes equivalent to a classical ring-attractor model. We extend this approach to higher-dimensional symmetries, applying it to grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex and showing that the mean-field description recovers classical continuous-attractor models. Our work implies that large mammalian neural circuits could represent continuous variables using continuous-attractor dynamics, complete with continuous symmetry, in a way that is fully compatible with their heterogeneity and disorder.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

Atherosclerosis is driven by the accumulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the formation of foam cells, accompanied by oxidative stress and the deposition of oxidized LDL (OxLDL), a pro-inflammatory molecule. Lowering LDL is the mainstay of current medical treatment in addition to blood pressure control and lifestyle changes, but to date, specifically targeting the inflammatory pathways contributing to plaque development without significant systemic side effects has not been feasible. Over the past decade, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have treated cancer and restored immune imbalance in autoimmune diseases in patients and resolved cardiac fibrosis in preclinical models. Using an inducible T regulatory cell (Treg) platform, we created an anti-OxLDL-specific CAR Treg therapy that exerts cell- and cytokine-mediated immunosuppression to reduce macrophage-foam cell formation in vitro. Murine anti-OxLDL CAR Tregs inhibited 80% of atherosclerotic plaque formation in immunocompetent mouse models of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. These studies illustrate the potential of anti-OxLDL CAR Tregs to mitigate the inflammation and plaque deposition associated with OxLDL, potentially offering a new therapeutic option for atherosclerosis.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

However, only a minority of patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) benefit from ICI, and the determinants of response remain largely unknown. To better understand the factors influencing patient outcome, we assembled a longitudinal cohort with tissue from multiple timepoints, including primary tumor, pre-treatment metastatic tumor, and on-treatment metastatic tumor from 117 patients treated with ICI (nivolumab) in the phase II TONIC trial. We used highly multiplexed imaging to quantify the subcellular localization of 37 proteins in each tumor. To extract meaningful information from the imaging data, we developed SpaceCat, a computational pipeline that quantifies features from imaging data such as cell density, cell diversity, spatial structure, and functional marker expression. We applied SpaceCat to 678 images from 294 tumors, generating more than 800 distinct features per tumor. Spatial features were more predictive of patient outcome, including features like the degree of mixing between cancer and immune cells, the diversity of the neighboring immune cells surrounding cancer cells, and the degree of T cell infiltration at the tumor border. Non-spatial features, including the ratio between T cell subsets and cancer cells and PD-L1 levels on myeloid cells, were also associated with patient outcome. Surprisingly, we did not identify robust predictors of response in the primary tumors. In contrast, the metastatic tumors had numerous features which predicted response. Some of these features, such as the cellular diversity at the tumor border, were shared across timepoints, but many of the features, such as T cell infiltration at the tumor border, were predictive of response at only a single timepoint. We trained multivariate models on all of the features in the dataset, finding that we could accurately predict patient outcome from the pre-treatment metastatic tumors, with improved performance using the on-treatment tumors. We validated our findings in matched bulk RNA-seq data, finding the most informative features from the on-treatment samples. Our study highlights the importance of profiling sequential tumor biopsies to understand the evolution of the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the temporal and spatial dynamics underlying patient responses and underscoring the need for further research on the prognostic role of metastatic tissue and its utility in stratifying patients for ICI.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

To investigate the genetic basis of these differences, an interspecific recombinant hybrid (rUSH) with the mating type system of S. reilianum was generated. rUSH exhibited extensive in-planta proliferation, showing a S. reilianum-like phenotype at all developmental stages except teliospore formation. Transcriptome profiling revealed that expression of pathogenicity-related effector gene orthologs was induced in rUSH, but not in a wild-type hybrid control. Multiple transcriptome comparisons identified 253 differentially expressed one-to-one effector orthologs with distinct regulatory patterns, including cis-, trans-, and rUSH-specific regulation. Functional analysis via CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis uncovered three novel virulence factors among the rUSH-specific regulated effectors. Ultimately, rUSH facilitated to identify the transcription factor UmHdp2 as key regulator of U. maydis-induced tumorigenesis.

To better understand the diversity of S. haemolyticus among preterm infants, we generated genome sequences of S. haemolyticus strains (n=140), which were isolated from 44 stool samples of 22 preterm infants from four different hospitals in the United Kingdom. Core genome phylogenetic analyses, incorporating 126 publicly available S. haemolyticus genome sequences, showed that 85/140 (60.1%) of the isolates, from three different hospitals, formed a clonal group with 79/85 (92.9%) strains being assigned to Multi-Locus Sequence Type (ST) 49. Antibiotic resistance genes were highly prevalent in the genome sequences. Using logistic regression, we found a strong association between the presence of the gene mecA and phenotypic resistance to oxacillin (odds ratio [OR]: 158.00, p<0.0001), and the aacA-aphD gene and phenotypic resistance to gentamicin aacA-aphD (OR: 162.00, p<0.001). None of the strains from the preterm infant cohort had a complete Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec (SCCmec) element. The aacA-aphD gene was associated with the transposon Tn4001. Using hybrid genome assemblies, we found it to be present on the chromosome (54.5% of strains) or on diverse plasmids (27.3%). Four strains (18.2%) had Tn4001 copies on both plasmid and chromosome. Our data suggest the existence of a distinct sub-population of S. haemolyticus that has adapted to colonise the gut of preterm infants. Prevalent resistance to antibiotics is of clinical concern and the diversity of genetic contexts of mecA and Tn4001 suggests widespread horizontal gene transfer and recombination in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

Coinfection is restricted by a mechanism known as superinfection exclusion (SIE), which prohibits the infection of a previously infected cell by a related virus after a period of time. SIE regulates coinfection for many different viruses, but its relevance to the infection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was unknown. In this study, we investigated this using a pair of SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses encoding distinct fluorescent reporter proteins. We show for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 coinfection of individual cells is limited temporally by SIE. We defined the kinetics of the onset of SIE for SARS-CoV-2 in this system, showing that the potential for coinfection starts to diminish within the first hour of primary infection, and then falls exponentially as the time between the two infection events is increased. We then asked how these kinetics would affect the potential for coinfection with viruses during a spreading infection. We used plaque assays to model the localised spread of SARS-CoV-2 observed in infected tissue, and showed that the kinetics of SIE restrict coinfection, and therefore sites of possible genetic exchange, to a small interface of infected cells between spreading viral infections. This indicates that SIE, by reducing the likelihood of coinfection of cells, likely reduces the opportunities for genetic exchange between different strains of SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is an underappreciated factor in shaping SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

Cilia structures rely on intraflagellar transport (IFT), which involves dynein-2 for retrograde and kinesin-2 for anterograde movements along doublet microtubules. Unlike dynein-1, which works on singlet microtubules within the cytoplasm, dynein-2 specifically works on the doublet microtubules inside the cilia. Previous cryo-electron tomography studies have shown that retrograde IFT, driven by dynein-2, occurs on the A-tubule of the doublet, suggesting a specialized regulatory mechanism involving dynein-2. However, the molecular basis of this specificity remains unclear. Here, we investigated this mechanism using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) with Volta Phase Plate (VPP), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and biochemical analysis. Our biochemical assay revealed that the microtubule-binding domain of dynein-2 exhibits a higher affinity for the ciliary doublet microtubule compared to dynein-1. Cryo-ET with VPP further visualized the preferential binding of dynein-2 to the A-tubule of the doublet microtubule. MD simulations suggest that the preferential binding of dynein-2 is attributed to the tyrosinated tubulin in the A-tubule. These findings uncover a tyrosination-dependent regulatory mechanism that governs the bidirectional transport of IFT on doublet microtubules, providing new insights into the spatial and functional specialization of ciliary transport systems.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

We found that SARS-CoV-2 Beta and Omicron variants passaged through IFITM3-deficient versus wild type mice exhibit enhanced replication and pathogenesis in this new host species. Enhancements associated with amino acid substitutions in the viral genome, suggesting that IFITM3 limits accumulation of adaptive mutations. Mouse-adapted viruses enabled comparative studies of variants in mice. Beta caused lung dysfunction and altered cilia-associated gene programs, consistent with broad viral antigen distribution in lungs. Omicron, which shows low pathogenicity and upper respiratory tract preference in humans, replicated to high nasal titers while showing restrained spatial distribution in lungs and diminished lung inflammatory responses compared to Beta. Our findings demonstrate that IFITM3 deficiency accelerates coronavirus adaptation and reveal that intrinsic SARS-CoV-2 variant traits shape tropism, immunity, and pathogenesis across hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

While somatic hallucinations and misperceptions are common, the underlying disruptions in basic bodily self-processing remain unclear. We aimed to investigate alterations in bodily self-processing, including touch and interoception, in psychosis using a multimodal, multi-method approach. A total of 70 participants were included (35 patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders [DSM-IV F20-29], 35 age- and sex-matched controls) . Participants performed self-/other-touch-tasks and interoceptive assessments during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), evoked potentials (EP) measurements, and/or behavioral and psychophysical tests. Primary outcomes included neural and behavioral responses to self- and externally-generated sensations (touch and heartbeat). Brain activation (fMRI), spinal responses (EPs), heartbeat perception and processing (EPs), and behavioral measures were analyzed, with preregistered hypotheses. Patients demonstrated heightened neural activity during touch tasks, including increased right superior temporal gyrus activation during self-touch and heightened activity in a right temporoparietal cluster during social touch. Tactile self-other distinction impairments were evident at the spinal cord level (EPs). Behaviorally, patients showed reduced differentiation in tactile thresholds for self- vs. other-touch. Interoceptive impairments included diminished cortical responses to heartbeat signals (EPs), lower interoceptive accuracy (heartbeat detection), and reduced self-reported interoceptive sensitivity. These findings reveal pervasive sensory and self-related disturbances in psychotic disorders. Impairments in differentiating self- and externally-evoked responses, detectable as early as the spinal cord level, may contribute to higher-order symptoms of psychosis.","NA","medrxiv",1738188480989

Ecdysone hormones play a crucial role in regulating the molting process of different ecdysozoan taxa. Interestingly, despite this highly conserved function of ecdysone, the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has lost the ecdysone receptor (ECR) genes and their molting appears to be ecdysone-independent. The loss of ecr has only been reported in Caenorhabditis within ecdysozoans, and the evolutionary background behind this loss has remained enigmatic. Here, we show that loss of ecr is not exceptional in Caenorhabditis, but has occurred at least three times in Rhabditina and Tylenchina nematodes. Our genome-wide analysis of 160 nematode species revealed the multiple losses of ecr and its typical heterodimer partner usp during nematode evolution. Furthermore, using genomic and transcriptomic analyses, we identified two factors that likely underlie and buffer the loss of ECR gene/function: molting regulation by an alternative nuclear receptor HR3 (NHR-23) and a lineage-specific expansion of nuclear receptors in the ecr-deficient taxa. Taken together, it is suggested that ecdysone/ECR function in nematodes is only minor or redundant. We propose a novel scenario for the evolution of molting regulation, highlighting the importance of HR3 as the potential core regulator.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

Despite the high efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in preventing HIV, its accessibility and uptake remain uneven across countries. This study examines the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different PrEP policies across 20 EU countries. Methods We employed a stochastic agent-based model of HIV transmission among MSM. The model incorporated data on sexual behavior, PrEP adherence and healthcare costs to evaluate the impact of five distinct PrEP eligibility policies. Outcomes included HIV infections averted, HIV-related deaths prevented, PrEP coverage, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Findings Policies by the US CDC and Belgian authorities were the most effective in reducing HIV infections and deaths, driven by higher PrEP coverage. However, the WHO policy emerged as the most costeffective across the 20 countries, despite its current use being limited to Denmark. The European AIDS Clinical Society guidelines also showed potential, although not currently implemented. In countries without PrEP reimbursement, reducing drug costs would significantly expand the range of cost-effective policy options. Interpretation Optimizing PrEP policies is crucial for reducing HIV incidence among MSM in the EU. Broad eligibility criteria maximize effectiveness, while WHO guidelines offer a cost-effective alternative in constrained economic contexts. Our findings highlight the need for policy adjustments to enhance PrEP accessibility, inform national health strategies, and achieve sustainable HIV prevention across diverse settings.","NA","medrxiv",1738188480989

A case in point is of the highly conserved SOS response that is regulated by the LexA repressor. Studies have proposed that affinity of LexA towards promoters of SOS response genes is the primary determinant of its expression dynamics. Here, we describe an additional level of regulation beyond LexA properties that modulates the SOS response gene expression pattern. Using transcriptomic analyses, we reveal a distinct temporal hierarchy in the induction of SOS-regulated genes in Caulobacter crescentus. We observe that LexA properties are insufficient in predicting the temporal hierarchy of these genes. Instead, we find that intrinsic promoter strength underlies the order of gene activation, with differential sigma factor association as a key factor in modulating gene expression timing.

The approach has been successful in pinpointing risk genes for various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and different types of cancers. TWAS typically involves two key steps: imputation and association analysis. In the imputation step, the original PrediXcan employs the elastic-net model, while subsequent research endeavors have delved into more intricate models such as FUSION and TIGAR. Despite these advancements, the existing individual methods may not capture the intricate genotype-expression relationships in a comprehensive way. Given the complexity of genetic contributions of genotypes to gene expression, sophisticated modeling techniques are imperative. In response to this, we have introduced Aggregated-TWAS (A-TWAS), a comprehensive tool that amalgamates multiple imputation models to accommodate diverse genetic architectures. A-TWAS utilizes several continuous shrinkage priors, including Laplace, Horseshoe, and Horseshoe+, to ensure precise imputation results while incorporating the benefits of Bayesian variable selection methods. In the association phase of TWAS, we employ the aggregated Cauchy association test (ACAT) to obtain an omnibus p-value. Result: We demonstrate the effectiveness of A-TWAS through comprehensive simulations and real data analyses. Simulation studies highlight that A-TWAS produces substantial improvements in predictive R^2 and statistical power, while maintaining the type error I at a low level. Furthermore, TWASs are conducted on schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive symptoms datasets. In comparison to standard methods, the Bayesian imputation model demonstrates superior accuracy, and A-TWAS, by integrating multiple Bayesian priors, identifies a notably greater number of disease-relevant genes.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

However, functional characterization of smRNAs remains limited by the scale and simplicity of phenotypic readouts. Recently, single-cell perturbation screening methods, which link CRISPR-mediated genetic perturbations to rich transcriptomic profiling, have emerged as foundational and scalable approaches for understanding gene functions, mapping regulatory networks, and revealing genetic interactions. However, a comparable approach for probing the regulatory consequences of smRNA perturbations is lacking. Here, we present Decoy-seq as an extension of this approach for high-content, single-cell perturbation screening of smRNAs. This method leverages U6-driven tough decoys (TuD), which form stable duplexes with their target smRNAs, for inhibition in the cell. Lentiviral-encoded TuDs are compatible with conventional single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, allowing joint identification of the smRNA perturbation in each cell and its associated transcriptomic profile. We applied Decoy-seq to 336 microRNAs (miRNAs) and 196 tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) in a human breast cancer cell line, demonstrating its ability to uncover complex regulatory pathways and novel functions of these smRNAs. Notably, we show that tRFs influence mRNA polyadenylation and regulate key cancer-associated processes, such as cell cycle progression and proliferation. Therefore, Decoy-seq provides a powerful framework for exploring the functional roles of smRNAs in normal physiology and disease, and holds promise for accelerating future discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

Salmonella Typhimurium, a key human pathogen, exploits host and environmental pH cues to transition between planktonic, biofilm, and virulence-associated states. However, precise tools to monitor bacterial pH dynamics at subcellular resolution have been limited. Herein, we report the development and application of mCherryTYG, a genetically encoded pH-sensitive fluorophore optimized for fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), enabling robust and high-resolution pH measurements across diverse conditions. mCherryTYG demonstrated exceptional sensitivity across a broad pH range (5.5-8.5) with consistent lifetime responses, and was unaffected by temperature, buffer composition, or ionic strength. Using FLIM, we characterized the pH dynamics of Salmonella across in vitro, host, and biofilm contexts. Under acidic stress in vitro, Salmonella maintained a uniform intracellular pH (~6.04), providing clarity on previously debated heterogeneity. In infections of HeLa cells, Salmonella existed in distinct pH environments: acidic vacuolar pH (~5.89) and neutral cytoplasmic pH (~7.10). During the late infection stage, ~17% of the bacterial population retained an acidic pH. Biofilm studies revealed stratified pH profiles, with acidic pH near the bottom and neutral pH at the surface, mirroring patterns observed in other pathogens. In heterologous host models, pH gradients shaped bacterial adaptation strategies. In C. elegans, Salmonella experienced a progressive pH gradient from neutral pH (~7.10) in the anterior lumen to acidic pH (~6.45) in the posterior. Similarly, in zebrafish, Salmonella encountered acidic lysosome-rich enterocytes (~5.84) and neutral regions (~7.33) in the anterior gut. This study establishes mCherryTYG-FLIM as a transformative tool for studying bacterial pH regulation, revealing pH as a critical modulator of Salmonella lifestyle transitions: virulence, and persistence. Our findings provide new insights into host-microbe interactions and present pH as a promising target for therapeutic interventions against bacterial infections.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

Here we characterized the immune related cell program in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, a model organism representing the phylum Cnidaria that diverged [~]600 million years ago from the rest of animals. By using a Nematostella transgenic reporter line expressing mCherry under the RLRb antiviral promoter we show that cells fluorescent upon stimulation with the viral mimic poly(I:C) are morphologically and transcriptomically distinct. These cells exhibit upregulation of immune effector and regulator genes. Cellular assays revealed an increase in phagocytic activity upon poly(I:C) treatment in this cell population. Lastly, we used a combination of immunofluorescent staining followed by FACS and bulk RNA sequencing, accompanied by single-cell transcriptomic analysis, to reveal the gene regulatory programs associated with immune cells in Nematostella. Comparing the sea anemone immune expression profile with gene expression of stony corals treated with the immunostimulant 2131-Cyclic GMP-AMP revealed remarkable similarity, suggesting that the immune response to viral challenge is conserved across the cnidarian class Hexacorallia. Altogether, this research uncovers the characteristics of a novel cnidarian immune cell type involved in antiviral immunity and offers insights into the evolutionary history of the innate immune system.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

A key obstacle is the extracellular matrix (ECM) in solid tumors, which significantly impedes CART cell infiltration. In clinical trials, neuroblastoma (NB) has shown responsiveness to GD2-directed CART therapy, however, the failure of GD2.CARTs to effectively clear bulky disease - characterized by dense ECM - highlights the critical challenge of infiltration.

In this study, we demonstrate that GD2.CARTs exhibit a unique infiltration-restriction compared to other CARTs and endogenous T cells. A separate analysis of clinical datasets identified MMP7 and SPP1 (OPN) as candidate genes to improve the infiltration of GD2.CARTs as these were upregulated in tumor-infiltrating leukocytes.

MMP-7 and OPN overexpression enhanced CART extravasation (p < .001) and interstitial movement (p < .05) in ECM-dense environments in vitro. Overexpression of either OPN (p < .0001) or MMP-7 (p < .001) improved tumor infiltration in a xenograft model of NB. This resulted in improved tumor control (94% reduction in tumor burden, p < .05) and a survival extension in OPN-GD2.CART treated mice compared to unmodified GD2.CARTs (median of 148 days, p < .05). OPN overexpression did not increase off-target infiltration into healthy tissues or promote tumor metastasis, highlighting its potential for safe therapeutic application. Our study provides a framework for further exploration of gene modifications to improve CART infiltration and efficacy in solid tumors and identifies SPP1 as a candidate gene to improve GD2.CART treatment of bulky tumors.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

Long-lived, resident tissue macrophages concentrated in the trabecular meshwork and Schlemms canal, whereas short-lived monocyte-derived macrophages, instead, were abundant around distal vessels. Specific depletion of resident tissue macrophages triggered elevated intraocular pressure and outflow resistance, linked to aberrant extracellular matrix turnover in the resistance-generating tissues of the trabecular meshwork. This dysregulated physiology and tissue remodeling were not observed when we depleted monocyte-derived macrophages. Results show ontogeny and tissue-specific macrophage function within the outflow tract, uncovering the integral homeostatic role of resident tissue macrophages in resistance-generating tissues whose dysfunction is responsible for glaucoma.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

Tn916 is an ICE found in several Gram-positive genera, including Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Clostridum. In contrast to the many ICEs that preferentially integrate into a single site, Tn916 can integrate into many sites in the host chromosome. The consensus integration motif for Tn916, based on analyses of approximately 200 independent insertions, is an approximately 16 bp AT-rich sequence. Here, we describe the identification and mapping of approximately 105 independent Tn916 insertions in the Bacillus subtilis chromosome. The insertions were distributed between 1,554 chromosomal sites, and approximately 99% of the insertions were in 303 sites and 65% were in only ten sites. One region, between ykuC and ykyB (kre), was a 'hotspot' for integration with ~22% of the insertions in that single location. In almost all of the top 99% of sites, Tn916 was found with similar frequencies in both orientations relative to the chromosome and relative to the direction of transcription, with a few notable exceptions. Using the sequences of all insertion regions, we determined a consensus motif which is similar to that previously identified for Clostridium difficile. The insertion sites are largely AT-rich, and some sites overlap with regions bound by the nucleoid-associated protein Rok, a functional analog of H-NS of Gram-negative bacteria. Rok functions as a negative regulator of at least some horizontally acquired genes. We found that the presence or absence of Rok had little or no effect on insertion site specificity of Tn916.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

In contrast, spatial transcriptomics captures both spatial and transcriptional information but is limited by resolution, sensitivity, or feasibility. No single technology combines both the high spatial resolution and deep transcriptomic profiling at the single-cell level without trade-offs. Spatial mapping tools that integrate scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data are crucial to bridge this gap. However, we found that Tangram, one of the most prominent spatial mapping tools, provides inconsistent results over repeated runs. Results: We refine Tangram to achieve more consistent cell mappings and investigate the challenges that arise from data characteristics. We find that the mapping quality depends on the gene expression sparsity. To address this, we (1) train the model on an informative gene subset, (2) apply cell filtering, (3) introduce several forms of regularization, and (4) incorporate neighborhood information. Evaluations on real and simulated mouse datasets demonstrate that this approach improves both gene expression prediction and cell mapping. Consistent cell mapping strengthens the reliability of the projection of cell annotations and features into space, gene imputation, and correction of low-quality measurements. Our pipeline, which includes gene set and hyperparameter selection, can serve as guidance for applying Tangram on other datasets, while our benchmarking framework with data simulation and inconsistency metrics is useful for evaluating other tools or Tangram modifications.

However, seeds stored for long periods of time slowly deteriorate and lose viability. While seed longevity is known to vary between species, the extent of variability within species and the factors driving it remain unclear. Methods: We focused on both inter- and intraspecific variability in seed longevity and its determinants. We studied 41 common grassland species and 188 seed accessions from across Europe. We exposed the seeds to artificial ageing conditions (60% RH, 45C) and estimated the seed longevity (p50), defined as the time required for viability to decline to 50% of the initial viability. We then tested the relationships between seed longevity and both species- and origin-specific factors. Results: Variability in seed longevity was only slightly greater between species than within species, with species identity explaining 51.9% of the total variation in seed longevity among seed accessions, leaving 48.1% of the variation within species. In interspecific species comparison, seed viability was predicted only by initial seed viability, but unrelated to species-specific seed mass or seed chemical composition. Within species, seed longevity increased with the initial viability of the seed accession and mean annual temperature at the accession origin, but was unrelated to seed mass or precipitation in the origin, and the residual variance was substantial. Conclusion: Our findings highlight that seed longevity on the level of individual seed accessions remains challenging to predict.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

However, its spontaneous evolution during general adaptation remains uncertain, with mixed evidence across model systems. Here, we studied the effects of highly pleiotropic point mutations in Escherichia coli over a 15,000-generation adaptive trajectory. The fitness effects of both beneficial and deleterious mutations were attenuated with increased adaptation over time. In contrast, pleiotropic effects in new environments became more severe and widespread with greater adaptation. These results show that trade-offs between robustness and fragility can rapidly evolve in regulatory networks, regardless of whether driven by adaptive or non-adaptive processes. More broadly, these results show that adaptation can generate a hidden potential for phenotypic diversity, unpredictably shaping evolutionary prospects in new environments.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

These tasks demand considerable manual effort from bioinformaticians, creating inefficiencies and limiting scalability. Recent advancements in large language model (LLM)-powered agents offer promising solutions to streamline and automate these workflows. However, existing automated systems, while effective for short, well-defined tasks, often struggle with long, multi-step workflows due to challenges such as error propagation, limited adaptability to emerging tools, and the inability of LLMs to generalize to niche bioinformatics tasks. Achieving effective workflow automation requires robust task coordination, dynamic knowledge retrieval, and mechanisms to ensure errors are identified and resolved before they impact downstream processes.

ResultsWe present BioMaster, a multi-agent framework designed to automate and streamline complex bioinformatics workflows. BioMaster incorporates specialized agents with role-based responsibilities, enabling precise task decomposition, execution, and validation. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to dynamically retrieve domain-specific knowledge, improving adaptability to new tools and niche analyses. BioMaster also introduces enhanced control over input and output validation to ensure pipeline consistency and employs a memory management strategy optimized for handling long workflows. Experiments across diverse bioinformatics tasks, including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, single-cell analysis, and Hi-C processing, demonstrate that BioMaster significantly outperforms existing methods in accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. By addressing key limitations in workflow automation, BioMaster offers a robust solution for modern bioinformatics challenges.

This study investigated the short- and long-term effects of the lytic phage Barc2635 on the functional plasticity of Bacteroides fragilis, a gut commensal. Germ-free mice were colonized with B. fragilis and exposed to Barc2635 to identify genomic alterations driving phenotypic changes. Phage exposure triggered dynamic and prolonged bacterial responses, including significant shifts in phase-variable regions (PVRs), particularly in promoter orientations of polysaccharide biosynthesis loci. These shifts coincided with increased entropy in PVR inversion ratios, reflecting heightened genomic variability. In contrast, B. fragilis in control mice exhibited stable genomic configurations after gut adaptation. The phase-variable Type 1 restriction-modification system, which affects broad gene expression patterns, showed variability in both groups. However, phage-exposed bacteria displayed more restrained variability, suggesting phage-derived selection pressures. Our findings reveal that B. fragilis employs DNA inversions to adapt rapidly to phage exposure and colonization, leveraging genomic variability for resilience.

Here, we utilize high-pressure NMR of lipid nanodiscs paired with molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate at the atomic scale the allosteric dialog between the lipid bilayer and a bacterial model membrane protein, OmpX. We discover that OmpX delays the gelation process by liquefying the annular shell of lipids through hydrophobic and roughness matching processes at the protein surface. Furthermore, the alteration of the mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer directly impacts the energy landscape of amino acid side chains at the lipid/protein interface, but also, unexpectedly, at the protein core. Our work highlights a potential thermodynamically coupled but kinetically uncoupled allosteric pathway linking lipid dynamics with the interior of membrane proteins, directly impacting our understanding of membrane function.

We established genome acceptability criteria and determined the performance characteristics of the panel including assay sensitivity, specificity, breadth of genome recovery, accuracy, and precision using contrived and remnant clinical specimens. High-quality genomes (>95% genome completeness; >500X and >1000X average depth for whole genome and fusion gene respectively) were recovered from samples with Ct [&le;] 30 (~594 and 2,004 copies per reaction for RSV-A and RSV-B respectively). Minor variants were accurately identified in sample mixtures of 5:95 and higher. The assay showed high accuracy when compared against Sanger, shotgun metagenomic, and hybridization capture-based sequencing; and high repeatability and reproducibility. The UW-ARTIC RSV panel has utility in genomic surveillance, clinical and research applications. It has been used to generate FDA-reportable data for clinical trials of RSV antiviral products, with robust performance characteristics in samples from around the globe from as recently as the 2023/24 season. Continued genomic surveillance and future updates to primer sets will be essential for continued recovery of genomes as RSV continues to evolve.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480989

The mechanism underlying this stalling, however, is unresolved. Using single-molecule assays that monitor DNA loop extrusion (LE) in the presence of NTR fragments, we identify two amino acid motifs, YDF and KTYQR, that hinder LE. KTYQR is found to fully impede LE activity, while YDF hinders cohesin to complete LE step cycles and converts cohesin into a unidirectional extruder by strengthening the affinity of STAG1 to DNA. We thus identify two distinct NTR motifs that stall LE via different yet synergistic mechanisms, highlighting the multifaceted ways employed by CTCF to modulate LE to shape and regulate genomes.

Compared to their shallower counterpart, MCEs have been traditionally understudied, primarily due to their inaccessibility with traditional monitoring methodologies. In this study, we aim to provide an interdisciplinary assessment of the biodiversity of Bermudan reef fish communities from the upper/lower mesophotic interface (60 m) by utilising a combination of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding and baited remote underwater videos (BRUVs). In total, 155 species from 137 genera were detected by eDNA metabarcoding whilst a total of 85 species from 53 genera were detected by BRUVs. The combined species detections totalled 182 species with approximately half of those detections unique to this study when compared to previous studies. Both methodologies found differences in -diversity between study locations, with each method independently detecting the highest species richness at the same location. The species assemblage at each location was dominated ([~]80%) by species known to occur throughout the shallow reef system and the upper mesophotic, whilst species only known to inhabit mesophotic ecosystems accounted for [~]6% at each location. These findings suggest a high level of species continuity with the adjacent shallower reef systems. The complementary nature of eDNA metabarcoding and BRUVs allows for a more accurate characterisation of fish biodiversity at the upper/lower mesophotic interface, which can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of ecosystem structure and more informed management decisions.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480990

In zebrafish, by contrast, fibroblast-derived extracellular matrix deposition and inflammation are tightly regulated to facilitate regeneration. However, the regulatory cross-talk between fibroblasts and the innate immune system in the regenerating CNS remains poorly understood. Here, we show that zebrafish fibroblasts possess a dual role in inducing and resolving inflammation, which are both essential for regeneration. We identify a transient, injury-specific cthrc1a+ fibroblast state with an inflammation-associated, less differentiated, and non-fibrotic profile. Induction of this fibroblast state precedes and contributes to the initiation of the inflammatory response. At the peak of neutrophil influx, cthrc1a+ fibroblasts coordinate the resolution of inflammation. Disruption of these inflammation dynamics alters the mechano-structural properties of the lesion environment and inhibits axon regeneration. This establishes the biphasic inflammation control by dedifferentiated fibroblasts as a pivotal mechanism for CNS regeneration.

Neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits also occur during aging, and notably in the absence of disease. The cerebellum, which modulates movement and cognition, is susceptible to cell loss in both aging and disease. Here, we demonstrate that cerebellar Purkinje cell loss in aged mice is not spatially random but rather occurs in a pattern of parasagittal stripes. We also find that aged mice exhibit impaired motor coordination and more severe tremor compared to younger mice. However, the relationship between patterned Purkinje cell loss and motor dysfunction is not straightforward. Examination of postmortem samples of human cerebella from neurologically typical individuals supports the presence of selective loss of Purkinje cells during aging. These data reveal a spatiotemporal cellular substrate for aging in the cerebellum that may inform about how neuronal vulnerability leads to neurodegeneration and the ensuing deterioration of behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480990

To study the effects of age, participants were sorted into 34 age groups. We show that neural states become significantly longer with increasing age, particularly in visual and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. Perceived event boundaries overlapped with state changes in superior temporal and dorsomedial prefrontal regions, but there was no effect of age on this relationship. Our results suggest reduced temporal differentiation of successive neural states with increasing age.

MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial, several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia. In the sotrovimab comparison, eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either usual care alone or usual care plus a single 1g dose of sotrovimab, using web-based unstratified randomisation. Participants were retrospectively categorised according to their baseline serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen concentration as  high-antigen or  low-antigen, using the median concentration as a cut-off. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed by intention to treat. Secondary outcomes were time to discharge alive from hospital, and, among those not on invasive ventilation at baseline, progression to invasive ventilation or death. Recruitment closed on 31 March 2024 when funding ended. ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsFrom 4 January 2022 to 19 March 2024, 1723 patients were recruited to the sotrovimab comparison. 720 (42%) were classified as high-antigen, 717 (42%) as low-antigen, and 286 (17%) had unknown antigen status. Over 80% of patients were vaccinated, over 80% had anti-spike antibodies at randomisation, and almost all were infected with Omicron variants. In the prespecified primary efficacy population of high-antigen patients, 82/355 (23%) allocated sotrovimab versus 106/365 (29%) allocated usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.75; 95% CI 0.56-0.99; p=0.046). In an analysis of all randomised patients (regardless of antigen status), 177/828 (21%) allocated sotrovimab versus 201/895 (22%) allocated usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.95; 95% CI 0.77-1.16; p=0.60).

InterpretationIn patients hospitalised with COVID-19, sotrovimab was associated with reduced mortality in the primary analysis population of patients with a high serum SARS-CoV-2 antigen concentration at baseline, but not in the overall population.

Mtb exhibits heterogeneity in redox metabolism inside macrophages to evade killing by anti-TB drugs. If and how macrophage physiology correlates with bacterial redox heterogeneity and drug tolerance remains unclear. Using a fluorescent reporter of mycobacterial redox potential, flow sorting, and RNA sequencing of infected macrophages, we characterized transcriptional and metabolic responses of macrophages harboring redox-diverse Mtb populations. We found that macrophages with suppressed glycolysis and elevated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) correlated with Mtb populations exhibiting reductive stress and drug tolerance. Conversely, macrophages with elevated glycolysis and suppressed OXPHOS displayed higher mitochondrial reactive oxygen species through reverse electron transport, resulting in oxidative stress in Mtb and enhancing drug efficacy. Computational and genetic approaches identified Nrf2 as a key regulator of macrophage bioenergetics driving redox heterogeneity and drug tolerance in Mtb. Redirecting macrophage metabolism from OXPHOS to glycolysis using an FDA- approved antiemetic drug, meclizine, subverted redox heterogeneity and diminished drug tolerance in macrophages and mice. The pharmacological profile of meclizine (Cmax and AUClast) indicated no adverse interactions with first-line anti-TB drugs in mice.

However, existing computational models often struggle to incorporate essential biological knowledge, handle sparse and noisy data, and scale effectively across large datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce RegFormer, a novel foundation model specifically designed for scRNA-seq analysis. RegFormer integrates hierarchical relationships from gene regulatory networks (GRNs) through an innovative architecture based on Mamba Blocks, enabling more effective modeling of gene interactions and cellular states. Pretrained on a vast dataset of 22 million human cells and comprising approximately 50 million parameters, RegFormer employs dual embeddings to separately capture gene expression levels and gene identities. This approach enhances interpretability by aligning gene expression data with regulatory hierarchies, offering more precise biological insights. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that RegFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, such as scGPT, Geneformer, scFoundation, and scBERT, across a wide range of tasks, including cell annotation, GRN construction, genetic perturbation prediction, and drug response prediction. By combining cutting-edge deep learning techniques with biological knowledge, RegFormer not only improves accuracy and interpretability but also provides deeper insights into cellular processes and regulatory mechanisms, positioning it as a powerful tool for advancing biological discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1738188480990

However, key regulators of these pleotropic traits have yet to be identified. Here, we discovered a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), FAM151B-DT, that is reduced in a stem cell model of frontotemporal dementia with tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and in brains from FTLD-tau, progressive supranuclear palsy, Alzheimers disease, and Parkinsons disease patients. We show that silencing FAM151B-DT in vitro is sufficient to enhance tau aggregation. To begin to understand the mechanism by which FAM151B-DT mediates tau aggregation and contributes to several neurodegenerative diseases, we deeply characterized this novel lncRNA and found that FAM151B-DT resides in the cytoplasm where it interacts with tau, -synuclein, HSC70, and other proteins enriched in protein homeostasis. When silenced, FAM151B-DT blocks autophagy, leading to the accumulation of tau and -synuclein. Importantly, we discovered that increasing FAM151B-DT expression is sufficient to promote autophagic flux, reduce phospho-tau and -synuclein, and reduce tau aggregation. Overall, these findings pave the way for further exploration of FAM151B-DT as a promising molecular target for several neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1738188480990

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1738188480990
