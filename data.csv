The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of long COVID on working memory using a single rapid online anonymous survey and working memory quiz. We analyzed working memory scores in relation to long COVID status (clinically diagnosed, self-reported, and non-long COVID), age, number of COVID-19 infections and long COVID duration, and subjective ratings of brain fog severity and overall life impact of symptoms. The study recruited 1064 participants aged 16 to over 85 years (83% from the United Kingdom) with 39% reporting long COVID. The results demonstrate that long COVID significantly impairs working memory, with the greatest deficits observed in clinically diagnosed cases. In addition, we found that working memory declined with age and multiple COVID-19 infections particularly in the diagnosed long COVID group. Moreover, individuals in the diagnosed long COVID group reported experiencing the most severe brain fog and the greatest impact of long COVID symptoms on their lives, and both of these factors were strongly correlated with lower memory scores. Participants who had been living with long COVID for a longer duration had lower memory scores. However, this relationship was likely influenced by the SARS-CoV-2 variant, as individuals with prolonged long COVID symptoms were more likely to have been infected with earlier variants (alpha and wild-type) which are linked to more severe disease outcomes. Our results suggest that long COVID is associated with significant working memory impairments, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions and support strategies for those with long COVID to address memory problems.","NA","medrxiv",1738534098093

Increasingly that goal is understood as requiring huge numbers of people to be sequenced from every broadly-defined genetic ancestry group, so as not to miss ""ancestry-specific variants."" Here, we argue that this focus is unwarranted. We start with first principles considerations, based on models of mutation-drift-selection balance, which suggest highly pathogenic mutations should be at similarly low frequencies across ancestry groups. Severe disease mutations tend to be strongly deleterious, and thus evolutionarily young, and are kept at relatively constant frequency through recurrent mutation. Therefore, highly pathogenic alleles are shared identical by descent within extended families, not broad ancestry groups, and sequencing more people should yield similar numbers regardless of ancestry. We illustrate these points using gnomAD genetic ancestry groupings, and show that the classes of variants most likely to be highly pathogenic, notably sets of loss of function alleles at strongly constrained genes, conform well to these predictions. While there are many important reasons to diversify genomic research, strongly deleterious alleles will be found at comparable rates in people of all ancestries, and the information they provide about human biology is shared across ancestries.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

This is largely a consequence of the inherent biological and technical variation that cannot be captured with small numbers of replicates. When thresholds for p-values and log fold changes are introduced, this variability can propagate an incomplete description of the data, leading to differing interpretations. Here, we compare traditional binary DEG classification with a rank-based method, grounded in Bayesian statistics, using a published yeast dataset comprising over 40 replicates. This analysis reveals how the choice of thresholds and number of replicates results in discrepancies between studies and potentially interesting genes being overlooked. Furthermore, by comparing wild-type with wild-type samples, we show how variability in gene expression can be mistaken for differential expression. Evaluating current practices for navigating the accuracy-error trade-off in the search for differentially expressed genes leads us to advocate rank-based methods and Bayesian statistics to mitigate the limitations of binary classifications and communicate uncertainty.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

To enable a more reliable and rigorous evaluation of NPIs based on time series data, we reanalyse the data for the original official evaluation of NPIs in Germany using an ensemble of 9 competitive statistical methods for estimating the effects of NPIs and other determinants of disease spread on the effective reproduction number [R](t) and the associated error bars. A proper error analysis for time series data leads to significantly wider confidence intervals than the official evaluation. In addition to vaccination and seasonality, only few NPIs - such as restrictions in public spaces - can be confidently associated with variations in [R](t), but even then effect sizes have large uncertainties. Furthermore, due to multicollinearity in NPI activation patterns, it is difficult to distinguish potential effects of NPIs in public spaces from other interventions that came into force early, such as physical distancing. In future, NPIs should be more carefully designed and accompanied by plans for data collections to allow for a timely evaluation of benefits and harms as a basis for an effective and proportionate response.","NA","medrxiv",1738534098093

Substantial work over the past century has pursued the generation of ever-more accurate maps of regional boundaries, using either expert judgement or data-driven clustering of functional, connectional, and/or architectonic properties. However, these approaches are often purely descriptive, have limited generalizability, and do not elucidate the underlying generative mechanisms that shape the regional organization of the brain. Here, we develop a novel approach that leverages a simple, hierarchical principle for generating a multiscale parcellation of any brain structure in any mammalian species using only its geometry. We show that this approach yields regions at any resolution scale that are more homogeneous than those defined in nearly all existing benchmark brain parcellations in use today across hundreds of anatomical, functional, cellular, and molecular brain properties measured in humans, macaques, marmosets, and mice. We additionally show how our method can be generalized to previously unstudied mammalian species for which no parcellations exist. Finally, we demonstrate how our approach captures the essence of a simple, hierarchical reaction-diffusion mechanism, in which the geometry of a brain structure shapes the spatial expression of putative patterning molecules linked to the formation of distinct regions through development. Our findings point to a highly conserved and universal influence of geometry on the regional organization of the mammalian brain.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Here, we present the discovery and engineering of NanoCas, an ultracompact CRISPR nuclease capable of extending CRISPR's reach in vivo beyond liver targets. We experimentally screened 176 ultracompact CRISPR systems found in metagenomic data and applied protein engineering approaches to enhance the editing efficiency of NanoCas. The optimized NanoCas exhibits potent editing capabilities across various cell systems and tissues in vivo when administered via adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. This is accomplished despite NanoCas being approximately one-third the size of conventional CRISPR nucleases. In proof-of-concept experiments, we observed robust editing with our optimized NanoCas in mouse models targeting Pcsk9, a gene involved in cholesterol regulation, and targeting exon splice sites in dystrophin to address Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mutations. We further tested the efficacy of our NanoCas system in vivo in non-human primates (NHPs) resulting in editing levels above 30% in muscle tissues. The compact size of NanoCas, in combination with robust nuclease editing, opens the door for single-AAV editing of non-liver tissues in vivo, including the use of newer editing modalities such as reverse transcriptase (RT) editing, base editing, and epigenetic editing.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Based on Proteobacteria, bacterial BAM is also structurally conserved, with an essential BamAD core and up to three auxiliary periplasmic lipoproteins of poorly defined function. Here we show, using structural biology, quantitative proteomics and functional assays, that the BAM complex is radically different within the Bacteroidetes, a large and important phylum widely distributed within the environment and animal microbiomes. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of BAM complexes from the human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and the human oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis show similar, seven-component complexes of ~325 kDa in size with most of the mass in the extracellular space. In addition to canonical BamA and BamD, the complexes contain an integral OM protein named BamF that is essential and intimately associated with BamA, as well as four surface-exposed lipoproteins (SLPs) named BamG-J. Together, BamF-J form a large, extracellular dome that likely serves as an assembly cage for the {beta}-barrel-SLP complexes that are a hallmark of the Bacteroidetes. Our data suggest that BAM functionality in Bacteroidetes is substantially expanded from that in Proteobacteria and underscores the importance of studying other phyla for a more complete understanding of fundamental biological processes.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Transmission is enabled through the movement of cattle between herds, as indicated from Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI) data. We estimate the rates of under-reporting by state and present the anticipated rates of positivity for cattle tested at the point of exportation over time. We investigate the likely impact of intervention methods to date on the underlying epidemiological dynamics, demonstrating that current interventions have had insufficient impact, preventing only a mean 175.2 reported outbreaks.

We quantify the extent of uncertainty in the scale of the epidemic, highlighting the most pressing data streams to capture, and which states are most expected to see outbreaks emerge next, with Arizona and Wisconsin at greatest risk. Our model suggests that dairy herd outbreaks will continue to be a significant public health challenge in 2025, and that more urgent, farm-focused, biosecurity interventions and targeted surveillance schemes are sorely needed.","NA","medrxiv",1738534098093

Fine-mapping of such variants has become a priority and since most associations are located within regulatory regions, it is also assumed that they colocalize with regulatory variants that influence the expression of nearby genes. Here we examine these assumptions by using a moderate throughput expression CROPseq protocol in which Cas9 nuclease is used to induce small insertions and deletions across the credible set of SNPs that may account for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for genes associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Of the 4,384 SNPs targeted in 88 loci (an average of 50 per locus), 439 were significant and further examined for validation. From these, 98 significantly altered target gene expression in HL-60 myeloid cell line, 74 in induced macrophages from these HL-60 cells, and 78 in induced neutrophils for a total of 201 validated effects (46%), 43 of which were observed in at least two of the cell types. Considering the observed sensitivity and specificity of the controls, we estimate that there are at least 150 true positives per cell type, an average of almost 2.4 for each of the 64 eQTL for which putative causal variants have been fine-mapped. This implies that haplotype effects are likely to explain many of the associations. We also demonstrate that the same approach can be used to investigate the activity of very rare variants in regulatory regions for 89 genes, providing a rapid strategy for establishing clinical relevance of non-coding mutations.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Alternative transcription start site usage generates two isoforms of BNT1: BNT1.2, which is targeted to the plastid envelope via an N-terminal signal-anchored mechanism, and BNT1.1, which resides in the cytoplasm. Moreover, BNT1.2 is predominantly expressed in epidermal cells, where it localizes to the so-called sensory plastids. Functional analysis revealed that bnt1 mutants exhibit compromised PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) responses, including impaired callose deposition and reduced flg22-induced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, while flg22-induced apoplastic reactive oxygen species production remains unaffected. Notably, only the plastid-localized BNT1.2 isoform is required for these PTI responses.

B cell MHCII was also sufficient to induce a unique population of T-bet+ follicular helper T (TFH1) cells which were crucial for RV-specific IgA+ LLPC accumulation in the gut via IFN{gamma}- and CXCR3-dependent mechanisms. Similar to RV infection, TFH1 cells were required for influenza-specific IgA response.

To address this, we developed 2 um phagocytic Ag conjugated bead targets that target phagocytic pathways including the BCR, scavenger, Fc, and complement receptors to study potential pathways by which B cells phagocytose both cognate and non-cognate Ags. We found that while follicular B2 (Fo B), marginal zone, and B1 B cells are highly phagocytic of BCR-engaging targets through their BCR, only peritoneal cavity B1 cells could uptake non-cognate Ag-coated beads or bacteria. Despite this, B1 cells were not effective at presenting Ag to activate cognate T cells or at killing phagocytosed bacteria. Finally, analysis of scRNA-seq data revealed that these differences in phagocytic capacity could not be explained by differential expression of relevant phagocytic receptors, implying that there is likely some form of regulation in place preventing non-cognate Ag uptake by Fo B cells. Our work will help contribute to a better understanding of non-classical Ag uptake mechanisms employed by B cells and their relevance to inflammation.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Coinfection is restricted by a mechanism known as superinfection exclusion (SIE), which prohibits the infection of a previously infected cell by a related virus after a period of time. SIE regulates coinfection for many different viruses, but its relevance to the infection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was unknown. In this study, we investigated this using a pair of SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses encoding distinct fluorescent reporter proteins. We show for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 coinfection of individual cells is limited temporally by SIE. We defined the kinetics of the onset of SIE for SARS-CoV-2 in this system, showing that the potential for coinfection starts to diminish within the first hour of primary infection, and then falls exponentially as the time between the two infection events is increased. We then asked how these kinetics would affect the potential for coinfection with viruses during a spreading infection. We used plaque assays to model the localised spread of SARS-CoV-2 observed in infected tissue, and showed that the kinetics of SIE restrict coinfection, and therefore sites of possible genetic exchange, to a small interface of infected cells between spreading viral infections. This indicates that SIE, by reducing the likelihood of coinfection of cells, likely reduces the opportunities for genetic exchange between different strains of SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is an underappreciated factor in shaping SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

This study presents a comprehensive benchmark by evaluating 38 classic and state-of-the-art gene embedding methods across a spectrum of functional prediction tasks. These embeddings, derived from data sources such as amino acid sequences, gene expression profiles, protein-protein interaction networks, and biomedical literature, are assessed for their performance in predicting individual gene attributes, paired gene interactions, and gene set relationships. Our analysis reveals that biomedical literature-based embeddings consistently excel in general predictive tasks, amino acid sequence embeddings outperform in functional and genetic interaction predictions, and gene expression embeddings are particularly well-suited for disease-related tasks. Importantly, we find that the type of training data has a greater influence on performance than the specific embedding construction method, with embedding dimensionality having only minimal impact. By elucidating the strengths and limitations of various gene embeddings, this work provides guidance for selecting and successfully leveraging gene embeddings for downstream biological prediction tasks.

These features are typically studied in isolation using controlled experimental stimuli, making it difficult to assess the relative importance of different kinds of features that tend to overlap during natural vision. In the current study, we evaluated the relative contributions of action, agent, and scene features in predicting cortical activity while participants viewed a 1-hour nature documentary. We tested four sets of model features: semantic vectors capturing the observed action, agent, and scene features derived from an annotation of the stimulus, as well as low-level visual motion-energy features. We used banded ridge regression to fit vertex-wise encoding models from the combination of all four sets of features. While each set of features predicted neural activity in the expected areas, the action features predicted more widespread activity. A variance partitioning analysis revealed that the action features captured the most unique variance in neural activity across ten times as many cortical vertices as the agent or scene features. Our findings suggest that cortical activity during dynamic, natural vision is dominated by features for understanding the actions of others.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

More education was associated with better memory, larger intracranial volume and slightly larger volume of memory-sensitive brain regions.

While education has numerous benefits, the notion that it provides protection against cognitive or brain decline is not supported.","NA","medrxiv",1738534098093

ChatGPT O1 employs ""chain-of-thought reasoning"" (CoT) to enhance structured problem-solving, while DeepSeek-R1 introduces self-reflection capabilities through reinforcement learning. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of these models in pediatric scenarios using the MedQA dataset.

Materials and MethodsA total of 500 multiple-choice pediatric questions from the MedQA dataset were presented to ChatGPT O1 and DeepSeek-R1. Each question included four or more options, with one correct answer. The models were evaluated under uniform conditions, with performance metrics including accuracy, Cohens Kappa, and chi-square tests applied to assess agreement and statistical significance. Responses were analyzed to determine the models effectiveness in addressing clinical questions.

ResultsChatGPT O1 achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 92.8%, significantly outperforming DeepSeek-R1, which scored 87.0% (p < 0.00001). The CoT reasoning technique used by ChatGPT O1 allowed for more structured and reliable responses, reducing the risk of errors. Conversely, DeepSeek-R1, while slightly less accurate, demonstrated superior accessibility and adaptability due to its open-source nature and emerging self-reflection capabilities. Cohens Kappa (K=0.20) indicated low agreement between the models, reflecting their distinct reasoning strategies.

ConclusionsThis study highlights the strengths of ChatGPT O1 in providing accurate and coherent clinical reasoning, making it highly suitable for critical pediatric scenarios.

DeepSeek-R1, with its flexibility and accessibility, remains a valuable tool in resource-limited settings. Combining these models in an ensemble system could leverage their complementary strengths, optimizing decision support in diverse clinical contexts. Further research is warranted to explore their integration into multidisciplinary care teams and their application in real-world clinical settings.","NA","medrxiv",1738534098093

The trafficking of cargoes, such as organelles and proteins, is particularly challenging within the long projections of neurons, which, in the case of axons, can be more than four orders of magnitude longer than cell bodies. It is therefore unsurprising that disruptions in axonal transport have been reported across neurological diseases. A decline in this essential process has also been identified in many aging models, perhaps compounding age-related neurodegeneration. Via intravital imaging, we recently determined that, despite a reduction in overall motility, the run speed and displacement of anterograde mitochondrial transport were unexpectedly enhanced in aged mouse peripheral nerves. Here, to determine how aging impacts a different axonal cargo, we evaluated in vivo trafficking of signalling endosomes in motor axons of mouse sciatic nerves from 3 to 22 months. Contrasting with mitochondria, we did not detect alterations in signalling endosome speed, but found a consistent rise in pausing that manifested after 18 months. We then treated muscles with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which regulates axonal transport of signalling endosomes in motor neurons; however, we observed no change in the processivity defect at 22 months, consistent with downregulation of the BDNF receptor TrkB at the neuromuscular junction. Together, these findings indicate that aging negatively impacts signalling endosome trafficking in motor axons likely through dampened BDNF signalling at the motor neuron-muscle interface.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

The availability of tools that can reliably and efficiently generate and store sequencing read summary statistics has become critical. Results: As part of the effort by the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) to generate high-quality reference genomes at scale, we sought to address the community need for efficient sequencing data evaluation by developing rdeval, a standalone tool to quickly compute and dynamically display sequencing read metrics. Rdeval can either run on the fly or store key sequence data metrics in read 'sketches', with dramatic compression gains. Statistics can then be efficiently recalled from sketches for additional processing. Rdeval can convert fa*[.gz] files to and from other popular formats including BAM and CRAM for better compression. Overall, while CRAM achieves the best compression, the gain is marginal, and BAM achieves the best compromise between data compression and accessing speed. Rdeval also generates a detailed visual report with multiple data analytics that can be exported in various formats. We showcase rdeval's functionalities using human and VGP read data from different sequencing platforms and species. For PacBio long-read sequencing, our analysis shows dramatic improvements both in read length and quality over time, and a benefit of additional coverage for genome assembly. Availability and implementation: Rdeval is implemented in C++ for data processivity and in R for data visualization.

Yet, even isogenic cells in a homogenous environment show heterogeneity in their intracellular ""cell-state"", as well as their response to extracellular signals. Here, we aimed to better understand this relation between these phenomena by investigating how information flows through the EGF-receptor centered network upon targeted drug treatment, and how this is affected by cell-to-cell-state differences. Using single-cell ID-seq, we profiled the cell-state and signaling activity of primary human epidermal stem cells by measuring 69 (phospho-)proteins upon inhibition of the Erk/MAPK (p90RSK) and Akt/mTOR (p70S6K) routes downstream of the EGF pathway. We found that the effects of drug treatment propagated from the EGF-signaling pathway to other connected parts of the cellular signaling network, indicating altered signaling flow. We identified nine distinct cell-states that show pervasive state-dependent drug-responses for many (phospho-)proteins. Computational modeling of the signaling network using single-cell Comparative Network Reconstruction showed that many interactions between phospho-proteins (i.e. network wiring) were quantitatively different between cell-states. Furthermore, (phospho-)proteins with a cell-state dependent drug response, were more likely to be involved in interactions that showed a cell-state dependent strength. Overall, our results indicate that drug treatment response and signaling interactions between proteins are closely related and modulated by cell-state.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

In previous work, we predicted a fourth RBD epitope based on allosteric conformational perturbations measured by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) upon complexation with the canonical spike protein target, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). We subsequently identified a pan-neutralizing antibody (ICO-hu104) with the predicted epitope, however, as the epitope was somewhat distant from the hACE2 binding interface, and our previous work limited to the spike RBD, the neutralization mechanism was unclear. Using HDX-MS, we investigated the binding of ICO-hu104 to the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from Wuhan, Delta and Omicron variants. We demonstrate that binding of ICO-hu104 at its epitope results in an increase in deuterium uptake in the distant HR1 domain for variants of concern, which in a biological context could be indicative of destabilisation of the helices within this region, promoting S1 shedding or failure of helical extension during S2-mediated fusion. This is supported by our computational modelling, highlighting propagation of allosteric effects to the S2 coiled-coil region. Collectively, this work demonstrates an alternative neutralization mechanism for ICO-hu104 which is distinct from its first-generation predecessors and thus opens alternative avenues targeting non-RBD epitopes through assessment of allosteric perturbations.

Here, we identify vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons as key regulators of this plasticity. Using all-optical methods in mice navigating virtual reality, we show that novel environments trigger a transient increase in VIP interneuron activity, which facilitates rapid place field formation and stable spatial map construction. Bidirectional optogenetic manipulation -suppressing or upregulating VIP interneuron activity- modulates the speed of spatial map formation and alters signatures of behavioral timescale plasticity (BTSP), a mechanism critical for place field induction. Both insufficient and excessive VIP interneuron activity impair reward-seeking behavior specifically in novel environments, revealing that a precise balance of VIP activity is essential for spatial learning. Our findings demonstrate that VIP interneurons gate a temporal window for place cell plasticity, mediating the impact of environmental novelty on hippocampal remapping and spatial memory.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

In particular, it allows inference of the unfolded site-frequency spectrum (uSFS). The most widely used approaches are based on outgroup data. However, for studies on species for which closely related outgroups are difficult to obtain, information on many sites of interest may be missed due to alignment problems. Here, we present PolarBEAR (Polarization By Estimation of the Ancestral recombination graph), a method that uses the local genealogies from the ancestral recombination graph (ARG) to infer ancestral states. We show that PolarBEAR can reach high accuracy in polarization and uSFS estimation using simulations under several scenarios. This accuracy, however, heavily depends on the ARG used as input. It is maximal when the true ARGs is used, but can be very low depending on the ARG reconstruction method employed. We also applied our method to human population data and compared it with the outgroup-based method est-sfs. Although our method could not infer the ancestral state with high confidence at certain positions, it obtained results for positions that est-sfs could not polarize due to missing outgroup data. The polarization results of the two methods were highly consistent at positions inferred by both methods. The two methods inferred similar uSFS, with PolarBEAR estimating slightly fewer high-frequency derived alleles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PolarBEAR is robust to the mutation model used, while est-sfs exhibits a bias in the presence of heterogeneous base composition. PolarBEAR can complement outgroup-based methods, or replace them when no appropriate outgroup sequence is available.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

FastCCC relies on fast Fourier transformation-based convolution to compute p-values analytically without permutations, introduces a modular algebraic operation framework to capture a broad spectrum of CCC patterns, and can leverage atlas-scale single cell references to enhance CCC analysis on user-collected datasets. To support routine reference-based CCC analysis, we constructed the first human CCC reference panel, encompassing 19 distinct tissue types, over 450 unique cell types, and approximately 16 million cells. We demonstrate the advantages of FastCCC across multiple datasets, most of which exceed the analytical capabilities of existing CCC methods.

This switch is ""flipped"" by the expression of genes that promote male- or female-specific development. Many lineages have evolved sex chromosomes that act as primary signals for sex determination. However, haplodiploidy (males are haploid and females are diploid), which occurs in ca. 12% of animal species, is incompatible with sex chromosomes. Haplodiploid taxa must, therefore, rely on other strategies for sex determination. One mechanism, ""complementary sex determination"" (CSD), uses heterozygosity as a proxy for diploidy. In CSD, heterozygosity at a sex determination locus triggers female development, while hemizygosity or homozygosity permits male development. CSD loci have been mapped in honeybees and two ant species, but we know little about their evolutionary history. Here, we investigate sex determination in the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi. We identified a 46kb candidate CSD locus at which all females are heterozygous, but diploid males are homozygous for either allele. As expected for CSD loci, the candidate locus has more alleles than most other loci, resulting in a peak of nucleotide diversity. This peak negligibly affects the amino acid sequences of protein-coding genes, suggesting that heterozygosity of a non-coding genomic sequence triggers female development.

While oligogalacturonides from homogalacturonan are well-studied DAMPs, the immune-signaling potential of other cell wall components remains largely unexplored. Conventional genetic and biochemical approaches aimed at identifying ligand-receptor pairs in plant immunity have been limited by the vast diversity of potential ligand molecules and functional redundancy of putative receptors. Here, we developed a high-throughput screening pipeline that simultaneously examines multiple interactions between plant cell wall-derived glycans and >350 extracellular domains (ECDs) of receptor kinases and receptor like proteins in Arabidopsis, resulting in the screening of >40,000 interactions. We discovered a group of leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases named ARMs (AWARENESS of RG-I MAINTENANCES) that interact with rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I), a major component of pectin. RG-I treatment induced pattern-triggered immunity responses, with distinct kinetics compared to oligogalacturonide responses. We identified RG-I oligosaccharide structures required for interaction with ARM receptors and immune activation, and found that ARM receptors are redundantly involved in plant immunity. Thus, our approach provides a powerful platform for discovering glycan-receptor pairs in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Nature has provided several classes of nucleoside inhibitors of MraY and scientists have modified these structures further to obtain natural product-like inhibitors of MraY. The natural products and their synthetic analogs suffer from non-optimal in vivo efficacy, and the synthetic complexity of the structures renders the synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of these molecules particularly challenging. In this study, we present our findings on the discovery of first-in-class 1,2,4-triazole-based MraY inhibitors that are not nucleoside-derived. A series of 1,2,4-triazole analogous were identified by a structure-activity-relationship (SAR) study using a structure-based drug design strategy. Compound 1, with an IC50 of 171 {micro}M against MraY from Staphylococcus aureus (MraYSA), was optimized to compound 12a, exhibiting an IC50 of 25 {micro}M. Molecular docking studies against MraYSA provided insights into these compounds' binding interactions and activity. Furthermore, screening against the ESKAPE bacterial panel was also conducted, through which we discovered compounds demonstrating broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against E. faecium, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) strains and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The novel, first-in-class non-nucleoside inhibitors of MraY highlighted in this work provide a strong proof-of-concept of how to leverage structural information of the protein to develop future antibacterial agents targeting MraY.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Recent developments in Natural Language Processing, particularly in multilingual neural network language models, offer a promising avenue to answer this question by providing a theory-agnostic way of representing linguistic content across languages. Our study leverages these advances to ask how the brains of native speakers of 21 languages respond to linguistic stimuli, and to what extent linguistic representations are similar across languages. We combined existing (12 languages across 4 language families; n=24 participants) and newly collected fMRI data (9 languages across 4 language families; n=27 participants) to evaluate a series of encoding models predicting brain activity in the language network based on representations from diverse multilingual language models (20 models across 8 model classes). We found evidence of cross-lingual robustness in the alignment between language representations in artificial and biological neural networks. Critically, we showed that the encoding models can be transferred zero-shot across languages, so that a model trained to predict brain activity in a set of languages can account for brain responses in a held-out language, even across language families. These results imply a shared component in the processing of different languages, plausibly related to a shared meaning space.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Brain motion was primarily rostrally and laterally directed, and was tightly correlated with locomotion, but not with respiration or the cardiac cycle. Electromyography recordings in abdominal muscles and microCT reconstructions of the trunk and spinal vasculature showed that brain motion was driven by abdominal muscle contractions that activate a hydraulic-like vascular connection between the nervous system and the abdominal cavity. Externally-applied abdominal pressure generated brain motion similar to those seen during abdominal muscle contractions. Simulations showed that brain motion drives substantial volumes of interstitial fluid through and out of the brain (at volumetric rates several times higher than production) into the subarachnoid space, in the opposite direction of fluid flow seen during sleep. The brain is hydraulically linked to the abdominal compartment, and fluid flow in the brain is coupled to body movements, providing a mechanism by which the mechanics of the viscera directly impact brain health.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Current treatments for OA-related pain often fail and may worsen the disease. The sodium channel subtype NaV1.8 has emerged as a potential target for treating pain, leading to the development of NaV1.8 inhibitors in clinical trials. We previously identified Magi-1, a WW domain-containing scaffold protein, as a regulator of NaV1.8 at the plasma membrane of nociceptive neurons. Disrupting the interaction between NaV1.8 and Magi-1 facilitated channel degradation in neurons, reducing pain behavior in multiple animal models. In this study, we investigated the impact of disrupting NaV1.8 scaffolding on an animal model of OA pain using genetic and pharmacological approaches. Genetic Magi-1 knockdown effectively attenuated established OA pain in mice. Pharmacological targeting of the NaV1.8-Magi-1 interaction in rats with a lipidated NaV1.8 WW binding domain decoy peptide inhibited pain behavior for multiple weeks. MicroCT imaging revealed minimal alterations in subchondral bone remodeling in animals injected with the lipidated decoy peptide compared to those receiving scrambled peptide-control animals. This suggested that the NaV1.8 peptidomimetic not only alleviated OA pain but also delayed joint degeneration. Our preclinical studies indicate that intraarticular injection of lipidated peptides capable of disrupting ion channel scaffolding in neurons can provide effective and sustained analgesia for several weeks after a single administration.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

In areas with lower UV radiation, light pigmentation alleles increased in frequency because of their adaptive advantage and of other contingent factors such as migration and drift. However, the tempo and mode of their spread is not known. Phenotypic inference from ancient DNA is complicated, both because these traits are polygenic, and because of low sequence depth. We evaluated the effects of the latter by randomly removing reads in two high-coverage ancient samples, the Paleolithic Ust-Ishim from Russia and the Mesolithic SF12 from Sweden. We could thus compare three approaches to pigmentation inference, concluding that, for subop-timal levels of coverage (<8x), a probabilistic method estimating genotype likelihoods leads to the most robust predictions. We then applied that protocol to 348 ancient genomes from Eura-sia, describing how skin, eye and hair color evolved over the past 45,000 years. The shift to-wards lighter pigmentations turned out to be all but linear in time and place, and slower than ex-pected, with half of the individuals showing dark or intermediate skin colors well into the Copper and Iron ages. We also observed a peak of light eye pigmentation in Mesolithic times, and an accelerated change during the spread of Neolithic farmers over Western Eurasia, although local-ized processes of gene flow and admixture, or lack thereof, also played a significant role.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

To understand the basis for this, we determined a 3 [A] resolution structure of human SPIN90-Arp2/3 complex nucleating actin filaments. Our structure shows that SPIN90 dimerises via a 3-helix bundle and interacts with two Arp2/3 complexes. Each SPIN90 molecule binds both Arp2/3 complexes to promote their activation. Our analysis demonstrates that single filament nucleation by Arp2/3 is mechanistically more like branch formation than previously appreciated. The dimerisation domain in SPIN90 orthologues is conserved in metazoans, suggesting that this mode of bidirectional nucleation is a common strategy to generate anti-parallel actin filaments.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Recurrence happens often with metastasis, for which cancer cells must adapt to isolation stress to successfully colonize distant organs. While the fibronectin-integrin axis has been implicated in this adaptation, its regulatory mechanisms require further elaboration. Here, we identify c-Rel as an oncogenic driver in PDAC, promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plasticity, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and resistance to isolation stress. Mechanistically, c-Rel directly regulates fibronectin (Fn1) and CD61 (itgb3) transcription, enhancing cellular plasticity and survival under anchorage-independent conditions. Fibronectin is not essential for EMT, but its absence significantly impairs metastatic colonization, highlighting a tumor-autonomous role for FN1 in isolation stress adaptation. These findings establish c-Rel as a key regulator of PDAC metastasis by controlling circulating tumor cell (CTC) niche and survival, suggesting that targeting the c-Rel-fibronectin-integrin axis could provide new therapeutic strategies to mitigate disease progression and recurrence.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Retrons typically comprise a reverse transcriptase, a template noncoding RNA that is partially reverse transcribed into RT-DNA, and a toxic effector. The reverse transcriptase, noncoding RNA, and RT-DNA complex sequester the toxic effector until triggered by phage infection, at which point the toxin is released to induce cell death. Due to their ability to produce single-stranded DNA in vivo, retrons have also been engineered to produce donor templates for genome editing in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the current repertoire of experimentally characterized retrons is limited, with most retrons sourced from clinical and laboratory strains of bacteria. To better understand retron biology and natural diversity, and to expand the current toolbox of retron-based genome editors, we developed a pipeline to isolate retrons and their bacterial hosts from a variety of environmental samples.

This non-uniformity is present in both bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq and is observed even when the sample contains only full-length transcripts. This issue dramatically affects the accuracy of isoform-level quantification of multi-isoform genes. Understanding the sources of this non-uniformity is critical to developing improved protocols and analysis methods. Here we explore eight potential sources of non-uniformity.

This study aimed to precisely control bacterial movement by modulating gene expression using engineered promoters in Escherichia coli. We focused on Escherichia coli, a model organism, and manipulated its motility by engineering the expression of flagellin, a crucial protein for bacterial movement. To achieve this, specific genetic promoters were employed to regulate the production of flagellin, thereby dictating the movement capabilities of these bacteria. The promoters enabled targeted adjustments to flagellin expression, which in turn allowed for the enhancement or suppression of bacterial locomotion. Interestingly, the relationship between promoter design parameters and gene expression levels was non-linear, highlighting complex underlying dynamics. Optimal bacterial motility occurred at 30 C, illustrating the influence of environmental factors. Our findings demonstrate the ability to effectively regulate complex microbial phenotypes like motility using genetic engineering strategies.

We find that the close proximity of flowers has significant effects on reproductive investment and output of B. terrestris colonies in a small-scale rooftop experiment. Moreover, we find that small shifts in the timing of pollen availability (5 days) shape the behaviour and development of the first generation of offspring, with significant carry-over effects on reproductive fitness for B. terrestris microcolonies. This suggests that small changes in the distribution of food may have significant impacts on colony success that cannot be compensated for over the course of the season. Furthermore, our findings suggest bumble bee colonies can feasibly profit by altering the timing of pollen resources, even by a few days.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

However, the mechanisms that underlie dedifferentiation are poorly understood. Building on prior evidence that exploratory eye movements differ with age, we investigated the role that eye movement might play in age-related declines in neural selectivity. Healthy young and older adults of both sexes underwent fMRI with simultaneous eye-tracking as they viewed words paired with images of scenes and objects prior to a memory test. Consistent with numerous prior reports, multivoxel pattern similarity analysis (PSA) of the fMRI data revealed age-related neural dedifferentiation in scene-selective, but not object-selective cortex. Eye movements, operationalized as the number of gaze fixations made during stimulus viewing, were elevated in older adults. Analyses examining the relationship between trial-wise estimates of neural selectivity and fixation count revealed an age-invariant positive relationship in the object-selective lateral occipital complex. However, this association was found to be age-dependent in scene-selective cortex, such that there was a robust positive relationship between scene selectivity and fixation count in young, but not older adults. Lastly, scene-related selectivity in the parahippocampal place area predicted subsequent memory performance independently of age group and fixation counts at encoding. These findings suggest that age-related neural dedifferentiation in scene-selective cortex may relate to declines in the functional specialization of exploratory eye movements during scene viewing.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

The helicase RECQL5 has been proposed as an important factor to help safeguard the genome, and is the only member of the human RecQ helicase family that directly binds to RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) and affects its progression. RECQL5 mitigates transcription stress and genome instability in cells, yet the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unclear. Here, we employ cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of stalled Pol II elongation complexes (ECs) bound to RECQL5. Our structures reveal the molecular interactions stabilizing RECQL5 binding to the Pol II EC and highlight its role as a transcriptional roadblock. Additionally, we find that RECQL5 can modulate the Pol II translocation state. In its nucleotide-free state, RECQL5 mechanically twists the downstream DNA in the EC, and upon nucleotide binding, it undergoes a conformational change that allosterically induces Pol II towards a post-translocation state. We propose this mechanism may help restart Pol II elongation and therefore contribute to reduction of transcription stress.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Trait experiments have generated data for many known and potential vector species, but the terminology used across studies is inconsistent, and accompanying publications may share data with insufficient detail for reuse or synthesis.

Efforts have been made to experimentally define the escape mutations from specific antibodies in specific viral strains, but it remains unclear how much the effects of mutations on neutralization differ among HIV strains. Here, we use pseudovirus deep mutational scanning to comprehensively map escape mutations from the V3 loop targeting antibody 10-1074 and the CD4-binding site targeting antibody 3BNC117 for both a clade A (BF520) and a clade B (TRO.11) HIV Envelope (Env). Mutations that escape neutralization by antibody 10-1074 are largely similar for the two Envs, but mutations that escape 3BNC117 differ greatly between Envs. Some differences in the effects of mutations on escape between Envs can be explained by strain-to-strain variation in mutational tolerance or glycosylation patterns, but other mutations have different effects on escape for unclear reasons. Overall, the extent that measurements of mutational effects on antibody neutralization can be generalized across HIV strains differs among antibodies.

ImportanceBroadly neutralizing antibodies are promising candidates as prophylactics and therapeutics for HIV. This study uses pseudoviruses to map all escape mutations for antibodies 10-1074 and 3BNC117 for the Envelope proteins from two different HIV strains. These maps can inform analyses of viral mutations observed in clinical trials, and help understand how the escape mutations from these antibodies differ across HIV strains.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

We find that the previously identified open-interface trimer conformation is sampled in all eVLP-displayed spike variants studied including sequences from engineered vaccine constructs and native viral sequences. The D614G mutation, which arose early in the pandemic, favors the canonical  closed-interface prefusion conformation, potentially mitigating premature S1 shedding in the presence of a cleaved furin site and providing an evolutionary advantage to the virus. Remarkably, furin cleavage at the S1/S2 boundary allosterically increases the flexibility of the S2 site, which may facilitate increased TMPRSS2 processing, enhancing viral infectivity.

Herein, we address these challenges by developing covalent fluorescent probes for endogenous tubulin, a critical cytoskeletal protein involved in processes such as cell movement, division, and biomolecule trafficking. Using well-known tubulin binder cabazitaxel and cell permeable fluorophore silicon-rhodamine--as a basis, we introduce a novel biocompatible cleavable linker containing a sulfonium center.

Profiling of RNA splicing-related genes revealed stage-preferential expression of several factors, including RS2Z36, a serine/arginine-rich splicing factor highly expressed during the early stages of fruit development. Mutations in RS2Z36 lead to smaller ellipsoid fruits than the wild type, with histological analysis showing elongated pericarp cells in the ovaries along the longitudinal axis.

Complementary proteome analysis identified proteins with altered abundance and peptides corresponding to novel RNA splice isoforms, underscoring the role of RS2Z36 in shaping both transcriptome and proteome diversity.

Sparse infection of epithelial monolayers by L. monocytogenes results in the formation of distinct infectious foci, where each focus originates from the initial infection of a single host cell followed by multiple rounds of active bacterial cell-to-cell spread into neighboring host cells in the monolayer. We used time-lapse microscopy to measure changes in bacterial growth rate in individual foci over time and found that intracellular bacteria initially replicate exponentially, but then bacterial growth rate slows later in infection, particularly in the center of the infectious focus. We found that the intracellular replication rate of L. monocytogenes is measurably decreased by limiting host cell glucose availability, by decreasing the rate of intracellular bacterial oligopeptide import, and, most interestingly, by alterations in host cell junctional proteins that limit bacterial spread into neighboring cells without directly affecting bacterial growth or metabolism. By measuring the carrying capacity of individual host cells, we found that the nutritional density of cytoplasm is comparable to rich medium. Taken together, our results indicate that the rate of intracellular L. monocytogenes growth is governed by a balance of the rate of nutrient depletion by the bacteria, the rate of nutrient replenishment by the metabolically active host cells, and the rate of bacterial cell-to-cell spread which enables the bacteria to seek out ""greener pastures"" before nutrient availability in a single host cell becomes limiting.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

However, functional characterization of smRNAs remains limited by the scale and simplicity of phenotypic readouts. Recently, single-cell perturbation screening methods, which link CRISPR-mediated genetic perturbations to rich transcriptomic profiling, have emerged as foundational and scalable approaches for understanding gene functions, mapping regulatory networks, and revealing genetic interactions. However, a comparable approach for probing the regulatory consequences of smRNA perturbations is lacking. Here, we present Decoy-seq as an extension of this approach for high-content, single-cell perturbation screening of smRNAs. This method leverages U6-driven tough decoys (TuD), which form stable duplexes with their target smRNAs, for inhibition in the cell. Lentiviral-encoded TuDs are compatible with conventional single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, allowing joint identification of the smRNA perturbation in each cell and its associated transcriptomic profile. We applied Decoy-seq to 336 microRNAs (miRNAs) and 196 tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) in a human breast cancer cell line, demonstrating its ability to uncover complex regulatory pathways and novel functions of these smRNAs. Notably, we show that tRFs influence mRNA polyadenylation and regulate key cancer-associated processes, such as cell cycle progression and proliferation. Therefore, Decoy-seq provides a powerful framework for exploring the functional roles of smRNAs in normal physiology and disease, and holds promise for accelerating future discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

However, excessive NET formation may damage organs during sepsis. We investigated the association between NETs and sepsis outcomes, including mortality and acute kidney injury (AKI).

MethodsWe analysed levels of H3.1 nucleosomes in 971 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock from the SISPCT trial (Effect of Sodium Selenite Administration and Procalcitonin-Guided Therapy on Mortality in Patients With Severe Sepsis or Septic Shock). We evaluated associations between H3.1 levels and mortality and the need for renal replacement therapy using multivariable Cox regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses.

ResultsWe analysed 971 critically ill patients with complete data including admission H3.1 levels. 443 patients (45.6%) presented with sepsis, 520 (53.6%) had septic shock, and eight patients had an unknown diagnosis as defined by Sepsis-3. Admission H3.1 levels were higher in patients with septic shock than with sepsis (median 921.84 vs 432.71 ng/mL; p<0.001). Admission H3.1 levels were higher in non-survivors, and in a univariate Cox analysis, each log-10 increase in H3.1 was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.86 (95% confidence interval 1.41-2.47, p<0.05). H3.1 was also higher in patients requiring renal replacement therapy with septic shock vs sepsis (1832 ng/mL vs 801.4 ng/mL, p=0.01) and demonstrated a dose-response relationship with the severity of AKI.

ConclusionElevated levels of H3.1 nucleosomes at admission are independently associated with mortality and severe kidney dysfunction requiring renal replacement therapy.

Their complex mode of inheritance and diverse clinical presentations render the diagnosis of MDs challenging and, to date, most lack a cure. Here, we build on previous efforts to discover genes necessary for OXPHOS and report a highly complementary galactose-sensitized CRISPR-Cas9 ""growth"" screen, presenting an updated inventory now with 481 OXPHOS genes, including 157 linked to MDs. We further focus on FAM136A, a gene associated with Menieres disease, and show that it supports inter-membrane space protein homeostasis and OXPHOS in cell lines, mice, and patients. Our study identifies a mitochondrial basis in a familial form of Menieres disease (fMD), provides a comprehensive resource of OXPHOS-related genes, and sheds light on the pathways involved in mitochondrial disorders, with the potential to guide future diagnostics and treatments for MDs.

We hypothesized that sensory-evoked awakenings are predominantly regulated by specific LC-NE efferent pathways. Anatomical, physiological, and functional modularities of LC-NE pathways involving the mouse basal forebrain (BF) and pontine reticular nucleus (PRN) were tested. We found partial anatomical segregation between the LC->PRN and LC->BF circuits. Extracellular NE dynamics in BF and PRN exhibited distinct sound-evoked activation during sleep, including a fast sound-evoked NE peak specific to PRN. Causal optogenetic interrogation of LC efferent pathways, by retro-ChR2 activation or PdCO silencing of synapses in target regions, revealed a pivotal role for early LC->PRN activity in driving arousal and sound-evoked awakenings. Together, our results uncover a prominent role for early LC-NE PRN activity in connecting sensory and arousal pathways and establish LC heterogeneity in regulating arousal.

Whilst aspects of quantitative agreement have been achieved for flat monolayers, the most striking features of tissue morphogenesis -- such as symmetry breaking, folding and invagination -- concern surfaces with complex curved geometries. As yet, however, characterizing such complex behaviors in three dimensions has been frustrated due to the absence of proper image analysis methods; current state-of-the-art methods almost exclusively rely on two-dimensional (2D) intensity projections of multiple image planes, which superimpose data and lose geometric information that can be crucial. Here, we describe an analysis pipeline that properly captures the nematic order of tissue surfaces of arbitrary geometry, which we demonstrate in the context of in vitro multicellular aggregates, and in vivo zebrafish hearts. For the former, we correlate the number of topological defects with the aggregates surface area and verify theoretical predictions, whilst for the latter, we link biological properties to physical concepts (Laplace pressure) through spatio-temporal correlations of the heart geometry with fluorescence signals of intracellular proteins. Our analysis enables access to the  hidden third dimension of conventional image acquisition via stacked 2D planes and highlights how such characterizations can deliver meaningful physical insight.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Although micro-arousals are an inherent feature of both human and animal sleep, knowledge about the neural correlates of micro-arousals across the cortical column is sparse. We here developed an algorithm for automatic detection of micro-arousals based on EMG activity and used it to explore how micro-arousals modulate laminar neural activity in the motor cortex, and how this relationship is affected by sleep pressure in mice. Our analysis showed that micro-arousals were associated with a general suppression of local field potential (LFP) power across the cortical column. Slow wave activity (SWA, 1-4 Hz) immediately after micro-arousals was tightly correlated with sleep pressure and even surpassed average SWA levels during NREM sleep in sleep deprived animals. In addition, analysis of single-channel firing showed that some channels exhibited increased activity immediately prior to micro-arousals, while others exhibited decreased activity. This study provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying micro-arousals and identifies a new link between micro-arousals and sleep homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

We find that the growth of up to 50% of all community members depended essentially on supplementation with amino acids, vitamins, or nucleotides. In 73% of cases, supplementation with multiple amino acids was necessary. Genomic analysis of 62 strains revealed that accumulation of insertion sequences and specific gene loss was associated with the observed auxotrophies. Finally, genome-scale metabolic models, computational analyses, and cocultivation experiments demonstrated that other co-occurring genotypes complemented the metabolic needs of auxotrophs, thus facilitating their growth.

Atherosclerosis is driven by the accumulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the formation of foam cells, accompanied by oxidative stress and the deposition of oxidized LDL (OxLDL), a pro-inflammatory molecule. Lowering LDL is the mainstay of current medical treatment in addition to blood pressure control and lifestyle changes, but to date, specifically targeting the inflammatory pathways contributing to plaque development without significant systemic side effects has not been feasible. Over the past decade, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have treated cancer and restored immune imbalance in autoimmune diseases in patients and resolved cardiac fibrosis in preclinical models. Using an inducible T regulatory cell (Treg) platform, we created an anti-OxLDL-specific CAR Treg therapy that exerts cell- and cytokine-mediated immunosuppression to reduce macrophage-foam cell formation in vitro. Murine anti-OxLDL CAR Tregs inhibited 80% of atherosclerotic plaque formation in immunocompetent mouse models of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. These studies illustrate the potential of anti-OxLDL CAR Tregs to mitigate the inflammation and plaque deposition associated with OxLDL, potentially offering a new therapeutic option for atherosclerosis.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Yet, modern recording probes have limited power to resolve neuron type. Here, we leverage the well-characterized architecture of the cerebellar circuit to perform expert identification of neuron type from extracellular recordings in behaving non-human primates. Using deep-learning classifiers we evaluate the information contained in readily accessible extracellular features for neuron identification. Waveform, discharge statistics, anatomical layer, and functional interactions each can inform neuron labels for a sizable fraction of cerebellar units. Together, as inputs to a deep-learning classifier, the features perform even better. Our tools and methodologies, validated during smooth pursuit eye movements in the cerebellar floccular complex of awake behaving monkeys, can guide expert identification of neuron type during cerebellar-dependent tasks in behaving animals across species. They lay the groundwork for characterization of information processing in the cerebellar cortex.

Impact statementTo understand how the brain performs computations in the service of behavior, we develop methods to link neuron type to functional activity within well-characterized neural circuits.

Enhancements associated with amino acid substitutions in the viral genome, suggesting that IFITM3 limits accumulation of adaptive mutations.

A protein language model was fine-tuned on this data to correlate sequence variation with ligand binding behavior. This modeling was then used to characterize Pik-1 variants found in the 3,000 Rice Genomes Project dataset. Two variants scored highly for binding against Avr-PikC, and in vitro analyses confirmed their improved ligand binding over the wild-type Pik-1 receptor.

The scanning statistics in selection studies are often too complicated to theoretically derive a genome-wide significance level or empirically validate control of the family-wise error rate (FWER). By modeling the autocorrelation of identity-by-descent (IBD) rates, we propose a computationally efficient method to determine genome-wide significance levels in an IBD-based scan for recent positive selection. In whole genome simulations, we show that our method has approximate control of the FWER and can adapt to the spacing of tests along the genome. We also show that these scans can have more than fifty percent power to reject the null model in hard sweeps with a selection coefficient s >= 0.01 and a sweeping allele frequency between twenty-five and seventy-five percent. A few human genes and gene complexes have statistically significant excesses of IBD segments in thousands of samples of African, European, and South Asian ancestry groups from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine project and the United Kingdom Biobank.

FER is required for the perception of endogenous RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides to control various aspects of plant growth, development and immunity. RALFs are perceived by FER-LORELEI-LIKE GPI-ANCHORED PROTEIN (LLG) heterocomplexes to induce cellular responses and bind to LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT EXTENSIN (LRX) proteins as structural components of the cell wall. We show that FER`s RALF ligands are necessary for full success of powdery mildew colonization. Our data reveals that LLGs and LRXs are also powdery mildew susceptibility factors, and that the susceptibility function of RALFs is best explained by a combination of peptide signalling and cell wall-related effects. We further reveal that cell wall and apoplastic pH homeostasis, hallmark features of RALF function, support powdery mildew reproductive success. The function of host RALF peptides is underlined by the fact that, in contrast to previously described pathogens that hijack FER for colonization, powdery mildew fungi do not produce functional RALF mimics. Surprisingly, RALF-dependent powdery mildew pathogenesis is partially independent of FER. The resistance phenotype of ralf and fer mutants is not associated with de-regulated salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signalling, important defense-related phytohormones.

Bivalves, a diverse class of molluscs with a variety of reproductive modes, represent an ideal yet challenging clade for investigating SD and the evolution of sexual systems. However, the absence of a comprehensive framework has limited progress in this field, particularly regarding the study of sex-determination related genes (SRGs). In this study, we performed a genome-wide sequence evolutionary analysis of the Dmrt, Sox, and Fox gene families in more than 40 bivalve species. For the first time, we provide an extensive and phylogenetic-aware dataset of these SRGs, and we find support to the hypothesis that Dmrt-1L and Sox-H may act as primary sex-determining genes, by showing their high levels of sequence diversity within the bivalve genomic context. To validate our findings, we studied the same gene families in two well-characterized systems, mammals and Drosophila. In the former, we found that the male sex-determining gene Sry exhibits a pattern of amino acid sequence diversity similar to that of Dmrt-1L and Sox-H in bivalves, consistent with its role of master SD regulator. In contrast, no such pattern was observed among genes of the fruit fly SD cascade, which is controlled by a chromosomic mechanism. Overall, our findings highlight similarities in the sequence evolution of some mammal and bivalve SRGs, possibly driven by a comparable architecture of SD cascades. This work underscores once again the importance of employing a comparative approach when investigating understudied and non-model systems.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

This study investigates the role of plasmid mobility types in disseminating antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence genes (VGs). By analyzing 142,492 fully sequenced plasmids from bacterial isolates and metagenomes, we offer a comprehensive representation of plasmid distribution in microbial communities. Our findings reveal that conjugative plasmids (pCONJ) are less common than previously estimated, comprising only 4.14% of the dataset. Mobilizable plasmids (pMOB) are the most prevalent (66.82%), followed by non-transmissible plasmids (pNT) at 29.04%. Although plasmids are recognized as key drivers of ARG dissemination, only 3.8% of plasmids encode ARGs. Among pCONJ plasmids, 6.9% harbor ARGs, and just 0.18% carry VGs. These findings contrast with earlier estimates, which overrepresented clinically associated plasmids. Interestingly, ARGs are more frequently associated with pMOB plasmids, which exhibit higher ARG density. In contrast, VGs are primarily found in pCONJ plasmids. This study highlights the significance of pMOB plasmids in ARG dissemination, emphasizing their role in resistance spread. Our results challenge prevailing assumptions about plasmid-mediated gene transfer and underscore the need to prioritize pMOB plasmids in future epidemiological studies. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of plasmid dynamics and their implications for public health.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Despite their evolutionary importance, the drivers of their diversity dynamics remain poorly understood. This study investigates the diversification patterns of Demospongiae, the largest class of sponges with a well-documented fossil record throughout the Phanerozoic Eon (541-0 Ma). Using fossil occurrence data and a Bayesian framework, we modeled origination and extinction rates to understand their evolutionary history.

Our findings reveal key extinction events, including three previously unrecognized events in the Cambrian, Late Silurian, and Late Jurassic, alongside known events such as the Permian-Triassic and Triassic-Jurassic extinctions. Notably, there was no statistical evidence for mass extinction during the Late Ordovician or Late Devonian. Additionally, Demosponges underwent a significant decline prior to the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction.

To explore abiotic influences, we applied the Multivariate Birth-Death (MBD) model across all extinction events. This analysis identified correlations between major speciation and extinction events and key variables, including temperature, continental fragmentation, oxygen levels, and sea level, as well as geochemical proxies such as sulfur and strontium, which may reflect underlying drivers like anoxia, weathering, or tectonic activity. Temperature and oxygen levels, in particular, correlated with speciation and extinction during the Permian-Triassic extinction.

These findings underscore the role of environmental fluctuations in shaping demosponge diversity and highlight the complex interplay between changes in abiotic factors and sponge evolution. Our work provides critical insights into the factors driving sponge biodiversity and offers perspectives on how modern sponges might respond to ongoing climate change.

Significance StatementSponges are ancient and ecologically pivotal marine organisms that have persisted through Earths major environmental upheavals. Despite their resilience, the mechanisms driving their evolutionary responses to past climate shifts remain unclear. By leveraging the fossil record of Demospongiae, this study identifies previously unrecognized extinction events and elucidates how abiotic factors, including temperature and oxygen levels, shaped their diversity during these crises. These findings enhance our understanding of sponge evolutionary dynamics and resilience, offering critical insights into the vulnerability of marine ecosystems under current and future climate change scenarios.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

While significant advances have been made in elucidating the anterior-posterior (AP) axis patterning across well-studied bilaterian lineages, our understanding of the conservation of AP-patterning gene expression in underexplored protostomes with a phylogenetically informative position remains limited. Chaetognaths, a group of marine invertebrates, form a clade with Gnathifera as a sister to the remaining Lophotrochozoa, occupying an early-diverging branch of the spiralian lineage. Their phylogenetic position provides potentially valuable evolutionary insights into whether the AP patterning reflects conserved bilaterian mechanisms or reveals distinct lineage-specific adaptations. Here, we investigate the expression patterns of anterior nervous system markers (otx, nk2.1, six3/6) and Hox genes in post-embryonic stages of the chaetognath Spadella cephaloptera using fluorescence whole-mount in situ hybridization. We identify expression domains of anterior-patterning genes in the cerebral ganglion and head structures, consistent with their conserved role in anterior central nervous system (CNS) specification in bilaterians. Additionally, we describe a staggered expression pattern of Hox genes, including previously undescribed central (Sce-med6) and posterior class (Sce-postC and Sce-postD), along the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and post-anal tail. Our results demonstrate that chaetognaths exhibit the most extensive repertoire of Hox genes among protostomes, within metazoans only surpassed by chordates. All AP patterning genes are expressed in a staggered manner, with Hox gene expression absent in the head region. This pattern resembles the conserved expression profile inferred for the last common bilaterian ancestor and is only rudimentarily visible in other spiralians, including annelids and mollusks. Posterior Hox genes including the newly discovered postC and postD genes are absent in the hitherto investigated gnathiferan sister groups such as rotifers. The absence of a postanal tail in rotifers and other gnathiferans, combined with the expression of posterior Hox genes in the elongated postanal tail region, suggests their involvement in the formation of this unique chaetognath structure. Posterior flexibility of Hox genes, as previously hypothesized for chordates, likely contributed to the formation of the chaetognath tail during the early Cambrian period.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Here we report the synthesis and chemical proteomic characteri-zation of stereoprobes bearing a P(V)-oxathiaphospholane (OTP) reactive group. ABPP experiments identified numerous proteins in human cancer cells that showed stereoselective reactivity with OTP stereoprobes, and we confirmed several of these liganding events with recombinant proteins. OTP stereoprobes engaging the poorly characterized transmembrane protein TLCD1 impaired the incorporation of monounsaturated fatty acids into phosphatidylethanolamine lipids in cells, a lipidomic phenotype that mirrored genetic disruption of this protein. Using AlphaFold2, we found that TLCD1 structurally resembles the ceramide synthase and fatty acid elongase families of coenzyme A-dependent lipid processing enzymes. This structural similarity included conservation of catalytic histidine residues, the muta-tion of which blocked the OTP stereoprobe reactivity and lipid remodeling activity of recombinant TLCD1. Taken together, these data indicate that TLCD1 acts as a lipid acyltransferase in cells, and that OTP stereoprobes function as inhibitors of this enzymatic activity. Our findings thus illuminate how the chemical proteomic analysis of electrophilic compounds can facilitate the functional annotation and chemical inhibition of a key lipid metabolic enzyme in human cells.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Coupling a polarizable force-field to enhanced sampling, we explored at high-resolution the long-timescale structural dynamics of a complete 1M-atom STMV. RNA-free capsids exhibit remarkable stability at physiological salt concentrations, suggesting an evolutionary adaptation for capsid reuse during the viral life cycle. This observation challenges the notion that empty capsids are exclusively products of abortive assembly, positioning them instead as functional intermediates in viral reproduction. Additionally, RNA encapsidation creates electrostatic dependencies that magnesium ions mitigate, stabilizing both RNA and capsid through long-residence-time interactions with phosphate groups. Chloride ions further influence capsid permeability by modulating salt-bridge disruptions and interprotomeric interactions, with these effects being pH-dependent: enhanced at pH < 7, preserving nucleocapsid integrity, or weakened at pH = 7, facilitating disassembly and RNA release.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

Here, we fine-tune the mechanical environment of murine gastruloids, three-dimensional in vitro models of early embryogenesis, by embedding them in bioinert hydrogels with precisely tunable stiffness and timing of application. This approach reveals that external constraints can selectively influence transcriptional profiles, patterning, or morphology, depending on the level and timing of mechanical modulation. Gastruloids embedded in ultra-soft hydrogels (< 30 Pa) elongate robustly, preserving both anteroposterior patterning and transcriptional profiles. In contrast, embedding at higher stiffness disrupts polarization while leaving gene expression largely unaffected. Conversely, earlier embedding significantly impacts transcriptional profiles independently of polarization defects, highlighting the uncoupling of patterning and transcription. These findings suggest that distinct cellular states respond differently to external constraints. Live imaging and cell tracking demonstrate that impaired cell motility underlies polarization defects, underscoring the role of mechanical forces in shaping morphogenesis independently of transcriptional changes. By allowing precise control over external mechanical boundaries, our approach provides a powerful platform to dissect how physical and biochemical factors interact to orchestrate early embryonic development.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098093

We sought to investigate whether symptom severity is influenced by changes in sex hormones over the menstrual cycle, or by hormonal contraception.

MethodsWe carried out a retrospective analysis of menstrual and symptom data, prospectively collected via the Visible app from individuals with long COVID, ME/CFS, or both, who had regular menstrual cycles, between 7th September 2022 and 6th March 2024. Mixed-effects models were used to examine associations between symptom severity, menstrual cycle phase and contraception type.

Findings948 users were included; 100% of users were female and 92.6% identified as women. The most tracked symptoms were fatigue (99{middle dot}5% of users), brain fog (88{middle dot}3%), headaches (85{middle dot}1%) and muscle aches (78{middle dot}6%). All menstrual cycle phases showed a modest, but significant, improvement compared to the menstrual phase, most markedly the early luteal (IRR = 0{middle dot}963, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}958-0{middle dot}968), but also the follicular (IRR = 0{middle dot}985, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}981-0{middle dot}990) and late luteal phases (IRR = 0{middle dot}980, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}974- 0{middle dot}985). Crashes (sudden and severe worsening of symptoms following exertion) were significantly more frequent during menstruation than in other phases. Users of combined hormonal contraception (n=70) had a statistically significant reduction in overall symptom score (OR = 0{middle dot}827, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}690-0{middle dot}992) and crash incidence (OR = 0{middle dot}548, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}350-0{middle dot}856) compared to those not using contraception (n=786).

InterpretationMenstruation is associated with worsened symptoms in long COVID and ME/CFS. Users of combined hormonal contraception report a lower symptom burden than non-users, suggesting a modulatory role of ovarian hormones. These findings could empower menstruating people living with long COVID and ME/CFS to anticipate cyclical changes in symptoms and plan their activities accordingly, and could also inform their use of contraception.

However, only a minority of patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) benefit from ICI, and the determinants of response remain largely unknown. To better understand the factors influencing patient outcome, we assembled a longitudinal cohort with tissue from multiple timepoints, including primary tumor, pre-treatment metastatic tumor, and on-treatment metastatic tumor from 117 patients treated with ICI (nivolumab) in the phase II TONIC trial. We used highly multiplexed imaging to quantify the subcellular localization of 37 proteins in each tumor. To extract meaningful information from the imaging data, we developed SpaceCat, a computational pipeline that quantifies features from imaging data such as cell density, cell diversity, spatial structure, and functional marker expression. We applied SpaceCat to 678 images from 294 tumors, generating more than 800 distinct features per tumor. Spatial features were more predictive of patient outcome, including features like the degree of mixing between cancer and immune cells, the diversity of the neighboring immune cells surrounding cancer cells, and the degree of T cell infiltration at the tumor border. Non-spatial features, including the ratio between T cell subsets and cancer cells and PD-L1 levels on myeloid cells, were also associated with patient outcome. Surprisingly, we did not identify robust predictors of response in the primary tumors. In contrast, the metastatic tumors had numerous features which predicted response. Some of these features, such as the cellular diversity at the tumor border, were shared across timepoints, but many of the features, such as T cell infiltration at the tumor border, were predictive of response at only a single timepoint. We trained multivariate models on all of the features in the dataset, finding that we could accurately predict patient outcome from the pre-treatment metastatic tumors, with improved performance using the on-treatment tumors. We validated our findings in matched bulk RNA-seq data, finding the most informative features from the on-treatment samples.

Here we characterized the immune related cell program in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, a model organism representing the phylum Cnidaria that diverged [~]600 million years ago from the rest of animals. By using a Nematostella transgenic reporter line expressing mCherry under the RLRb antiviral promoter we show that cells fluorescent upon stimulation with the viral mimic poly(I:C) are morphologically and transcriptomically distinct. These cells exhibit upregulation of immune effector and regulator genes. Cellular assays revealed an increase in phagocytic activity upon poly(I:C) treatment in this cell population. Lastly, we used a combination of immunofluorescent staining followed by FACS and bulk RNA sequencing, accompanied by single-cell transcriptomic analysis, to reveal the gene regulatory programs associated with immune cells in Nematostella. Comparing the sea anemone immune expression profile with gene expression of stony corals treated with the immunostimulant 2131-Cyclic GMP-AMP revealed remarkable similarity, suggesting that the immune response to viral challenge is conserved across the cnidarian class Hexacorallia. Altogether, this research uncovers the characteristics of a novel cnidarian immune cell type involved in antiviral immunity and offers insights into the evolutionary history of the innate immune system.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098094

Cilia structures rely on intraflagellar transport (IFT), which involves dynein-2 for retrograde and kinesin-2 for anterograde movements along doublet microtubules. Unlike dynein-1, which works on singlet microtubules within the cytoplasm, dynein-2 specifically works on the doublet microtubules inside the cilia. Previous cryo-electron tomography studies have shown that retrograde IFT, driven by dynein-2, occurs on the A-tubule of the doublet, suggesting a specialized regulatory mechanism involving dynein-2. However, the molecular basis of this specificity remains unclear. Here, we investigated this mechanism using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) with Volta Phase Plate (VPP), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and biochemical analysis. Our biochemical assay revealed that the microtubule-binding domain of dynein-2 exhibits a higher affinity for the ciliary doublet microtubule compared to dynein-1. Cryo-ET with VPP further visualized the preferential binding of dynein-2 to the A-tubule of the doublet microtubule. MD simulations suggest that the preferential binding of dynein-2 is attributed to the tyrosinated tubulin in the A-tubule. These findings uncover a tyrosination-dependent regulatory mechanism that governs the bidirectional transport of IFT on doublet microtubules, providing new insights into the spatial and functional specialization of ciliary transport systems.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098094

However, the spatiotemporal mechanisms of how surface receptor interactions achieve high efficiency and sustain plant immune signaling remain unclear. Here, we synthetically engineered the Arabidopsis pattern recognition receptor FLS2 to control its oligomerization precisely. We investigated the dynamic FLS2 nanoscale assemblies at the single-molecule level and their corresponding rewired immune signaling. Engineered FLS2 exhibits enhanced defense mechanisms in an oligomerization status-dependent manner. FLS2 dimerization significantly enhances immune responses, while the over-assembled tetrameric version impairs receptor endocytosis, disrupting its timely turnover and weakening sustained immune signaling. Our results reveal precise control of immune receptor assemblies for initial activation and long-lasting immune signaling, offering insights for engineering plant defense receptors.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098094

While U. maydis induces tumors locally at sites of infection, S. reilianum systemically colonizes the host and causes symptoms in the inflorescences. To investigate the genetic basis of these differences, an interspecific recombinant hybrid (rUSH) with the mating type system of S. reilianum was generated. rUSH exhibited extensive in-planta proliferation, showing a S. reilianum-like phenotype at all developmental stages except teliospore formation. Transcriptome profiling revealed that expression of pathogenicity-related effector gene orthologs was induced in rUSH, but not in a wild-type hybrid control. Multiple transcriptome comparisons identified 253 differentially expressed one-to-one effector orthologs with distinct regulatory patterns, including cis-, trans-, and rUSH-specific regulation. Functional analysis via CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis uncovered three novel virulence factors among the rUSH-specific regulated effectors. Ultimately, rUSH facilitated to identify the transcription factor UmHdp2 as key regulator of U. maydis-induced tumorigenesis. Together, these findings highlight the utility of a recombinant, interspecific hybrid in unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenic differences in closely related fungal pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098094

Upon exposure to genotoxic stress, these transcriptional networks are induced in a temporally structured manner. A case in point is of the highly conserved SOS response thwat is regulated by the LexA repressor. Studies have proposed that affinity of LexA towards promoters of SOS response genes is the primary determinant of its expression dynamics. Here, we describe an additional level of regulation beyond LexA properties that modulates the SOS response gene expression pattern. Using transcriptomic analyses, we reveal a distinct temporal hierarchy in the induction of SOS-regulated genes in Caulobacter crescentus. We observe that LexA properties are insufficient in predicting the temporal hierarchy of these genes. Instead, we find that intrinsic promoter strength underlies the order of gene activation, with differential sigma factor association as a key factor in modulating gene expression timing. Our findings highlight a novel regulatory layer in SOS dynamics and underscore the importance of promoter properties in shaping bacterial stress responses.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098094

To address this, we introduce CellPhenoX, an eXplainable machine learning method to identify cell-specific phenotypes that influence clinical outcomes. CellPhenoX integrates classification models, explainable AI techniques, and a statistical framework to generate interpretable, cell-specific scores that uncover cell populations associated with relevant clinical phenotypes and interaction effects. We demonstrated the performance of CellPhenoX across diverse single-cell designs, including simulations, binary disease-control comparisons, and multi-class studies. Notably, CellPhenoX identified an activated monocyte phenotype in COVID-19, with expansion correlated with disease severity after adjusting for covariates and interactive effects. It also uncovered an inflammation-associated gradient in fibroblasts from ulcerative colitis. We anticipate that CellPhenoX holds the potential to detect clinically relevant phenotypic changes in single-cell data with multiple sources of variation, paving the way for translating single-cell findings into clinical impact.","NA","biorxiv",1738534098094

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1738534098094

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1738534098094
