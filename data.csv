We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1718229846915

Morphogens are key examples, where the concentration and duration of morphogen exposure produce distinct cell fates that drive tissue patterning. Studying the dynamics of these processes has been challenging. Here, we establish an optogenetic system for morphogen production that enables the investigation of developmental patterning in vitro. Using a tunable light-inducible gene expression system, we generate long-range Shh gradients that pattern neural progenitors into spatially distinct progenitor domains mimicking the spatial arrangement of neural progenitors found in vivo during vertebrate neural tube development. With this system, we investigate how biochemical features of Shh and the presence of morphogen-interacting proteins affect the patterning length scale. We measure tissue clearance rates, revealing that Shh has an extracellular half-life of about 1h, and we probe how the level and duration of morphogen exposure govern the acquisition and maintenance of cell fates. The rate of Shh turnover is substantially faster than the downstream gene expression dynamics, indicating that the gradient is continually renewed during patterning. Together the optogenetic approach establishes a simple experimental system for the quantitative interrogation of morphogen patterning. Controlling morphogen dynamics in a reproducible manner provides a framework to dissect the interplay between biochemical cues, the biophysics of gradient formation, and the transcriptional programmes underlying developmental patterning.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

The research leverages a unique natural experiment created by the policy's stringent measures, which led to a significant reduction in virus circulation from 2020 to early 2023. The study highlights two distinct periods: pre-COVID-19 and post-mask mandate. We used pediatric hospitalization records from January 2015 to December 2019 and March 2023 to February 2024 to reveal a notable rebound in respiratory viruses. The age-stratified analysis indicated a shift in virus susceptibility. The odds ratio of having a co-infection was significantly increased in hospitalized children aged <1 to 12 years old during the post-COVID-19 mask mandate. Moreover, the adenovirus infection in younger children was more prominent, while RSV expanded its prevalence to older children aged>6 years old and raised health concerns. The study underscores the potential long-term impacts of interrupted virus exposure on children's immune development and the need for vigilant monitoring of respiratory virus trends. It calls for further research to elucidate the causal relationships between SARS-CoV-2 exposure, subsequent respiratory virus susceptibility, and the implications for paediatric health in the post-pandemic era.","NA","medrxiv",1718229846915

Here we show that nanopore sequencing-based metagenomics can robustly assess the air microbiome in combination with active air sampling through liquid impingement and tailored computational analysis. We provide fast and portable laboratory and computational approaches for air microbiome profiling, which we leverage to robustly assess the taxonomic composition of the core air microbiome of a controlled greenhouse environment and of a natural outdoor environment. We show that long-read sequencing can resolve species-level annotations and specific ecosystem functions through de novo metagenomic assemblies despite the low amount of fragmented DNA used as an input for nanopore sequencing. We then apply our pipeline to assess the diversity and variability of an urban air microbiome, using Barcelona, Spain, as an example; this randomized experiment gives first insights into the presence of highly stable location-specific air microbiomes within the city's boundaries, and showcases the robust microbial assessments that can be achieved through automatable, fast, and portable nanopore sequencing technology.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

Despite the need for speed, animals appear to only slowly learn to associate rewarded actions with predictive cues. This slow learning is thought to be supported by a gradual expansion of predictive cue representation in the sensory cortex. However, evidence is growing that animals learn more rapidly than classical performance measures suggest, challenging the prevailing model of sensory cortical plasticity. Here, we investigated the relationship between learning and sensory cortical representations. We trained mice on an auditory go/no-go task that dissociated the rapid acquisition of task contingencies (learning) from its slower expression (performance). Optogenetic silencing demonstrated that the auditory cortex (AC) drives both rapid learning and slower performance gains but becomes dispensable at expert. Rather than enhancement or expansion of cue representations, two-photon calcium imaging of AC excitatory neurons throughout learning revealed two higher-order signals that were causal to learning and performance. First, a reward prediction (RP) signal emerged rapidly within tens of trials, was present after action-related errors only early in training, and faded at expert levels. Strikingly, silencing at the time of the RP signal impaired rapid learning, suggesting it serves an associative and teaching role. Second, a distinct cell ensemble encoded and controlled licking suppression that drove the slower performance improvements. These two ensembles were spatially clustered but uncoupled from underlying sensory representations, indicating a higher-order functional segregation within AC. Our results reveal that the sensory cortex manifests higher-order computations that separably drive rapid learning and slower performance improvements, reshaping our understanding of the fundamental role of the sensory cortex.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

SARS-CoV-2 internalization occurs via S-protein-mediated cell binding followed either by direct fusion with the plasma membrane or endocytosis and subsequent fusion with the endosomal membrane. Despite the crucial role of virus internalization, the precise kinetics of the processes involved remains elusive. We developed a pipeline, which combines live-cell microscopy and advanced image analysis, for measuring the rates of multiple internalization-associated molecular events of single SARS-CoV-2-virus-like particles (VLPs), including endosome ingression, pH change, and nucleocapsid release. Our live-cell imaging experiments demonstrate that only a few minutes after binding to the plasma membrane, VLPs ingress into Rab5-negative endosomes via Dynamin-dependent scission. Less than two minutes later, the pH of VLPs drops below 5 followed by an increase in VLP speed, yet these two events are not interrelated. Nucleocapsid release from the VLPs occurs with similar kinetics to the pH drop, suggesting that VLP fusion occurs during endosome acidification. Neither Omicron mutations nor abrogation of the S protein polybasic cleavage site altered the rate of VLP internalization events, indicating that they do not affect these processes. Finally, we observe that VLP internalization occurs two to three times faster in VeroE6 than in A549 cells, which may contribute to the greater susceptibility of the former cell line to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, our precise measurements of the kinetics of VLP internalization-associated processes shed light on their contribution to the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cells. Time-lapse videos of the studied internalization events can be accessed in the dedicated COVIDynamics database.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

Until recently the hippocampus appeared to implement a simple coding scheme for position, in which each neuron is assigned to a single region of space in which it is active. Recently, new experiments revealed that the tuning of hippocampal neurons to space is much less stereotyped than previously thought: in large environments, place cells are active in multiple locations and their fields vary in shape and size across locations, with distributions that differ substantially in different experiments. It is unknown whether these seemingly diverse observations can be explained in a unified manner, and whether the heterogeneous statistics can reveal the mechanisms that determine the tuning of neural activity to position. Here we show that a surprisingly simple mathematical model, in which firing fields are generated by thresholding a realization of a random Gaussian process, explains the statistical properties of neural activity in quantitative detail, in bats and rodents, and in one-, two-, and three-dimensional environments of varying sizes. The model captures the statistics of field arrangements, and further yields quantitative predictions on the statistics of field shapes and topologies, which we verify. Thus, the seemingly diverse statistics arise from mathematical principles that are common to different species and behavioral conditions. The underlying Gaussian statistics are compatible with a picture in which the synaptic connections between place cells and their inputs are random and highly unstructured.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

To simultaneously monitor different types of proteins at the single-molecule level, orthogonal fluorescent labeling methods with different photostable dyes are required. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), a major class of drug targets, are prototypical membrane receptors that have been studied using single-molecule imaging techniques. Here we developed a method for labeling cell-surface GPCRs inspired by the HiBiT system, which utilizes the high affinity complementation between LgBiT and HiBiT fragments of the NanoLuc luciferase. We synthesized four fluorescence-labeled HiBiT peptides (F-FiBiTs) with a different color dye (Setau-488, TMR, SaraFluor 650 and SaraFluor 720). We constructed a multicolor total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy system that allows us to track four color dyes simultaneously. As a proof-of-concept experiment, we labeled an N-terminally LgBiT-fused GPCR (Lg-GPCR) with a mixture of the four F-FiBiTs and successfully tracked each dye within a cell at the single molecule level. The F-FiBiT-labeled Lg-GPCRs showed agonist-dependent changes in the diffusion dynamics and accumulation into the clathrin-coated pits as observed with a conventional method using a C-terminally HaloTag-fused GPCR. Taking advantage of luciferase complementation by the F-FiBiT and Lg-GPCRs, the F-FiBiT was also applicable to bioluminescence plate-reader-based assays. By combining existing labeling methods such as HaloTag, SNAP-tag, and fluorescent proteins, the F-FiBiT method will be useful for multicolor single-molecule imaging and will enhance our understanding of GPCR signaling at the single-molecule level.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

Growing evidence supports a likely causal association between cardiovascular diseases and the presence of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), a cellular transdifferentiation process in which endothelial cells (ECs) partially lose their identity and acquire additional mesenchymal phenotypes. EC reprogramming represents an innovative strategy in regenerative medicine to prevent deleterious effects induced by cardiovascular diseases.

MethodsUsing a partial reprogramming of ECs, via overexpression of Oct-3/4, Sox-2, and Klf-4 (OSK) transcription factors, we aimed to bring ECs back to a youthful phenotype in hypertensive mice. Primary ECs were infected with lentiviral vectors (LV) containing the specific EC marker cadherin 5 (Cdh5) and the fluorescent reporter enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) with empty vector (LVCO) or with OSK (LV-OSK). Confocal microscopy and western blotting analysis were used to confirm the OSK overexpression. Cellular migration, senescence, and apoptosis were evaluated. Human aortic ECs (HAoECs) from male and female normotensive and hypertensive patients were analyzed after OSK or control treatments for their endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) levels, nitric oxide (NO), and genetic profile. Male and female normotensive (BPN/3J) and hypertensive (BPH/2J) mice were treated with an intravenous (i.v.) injection of LVCO or LV-OSK and evaluated 10 days post-infection. The blood pressure, cardiac function, vascular reactivity of small arteries, in vivo EGFP signal and EndMT inhibition were analyzed.

ResultsOSK overexpression induced partial EC reprogramming in vitro, and these cells showed endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-like features with lower migratory capability. OSK treatment of hypertensive BPH/2J mice normalized blood pressure and resistance arteries hypercontractility, via the attenuation of EndMT and elastin breaks. EGFP signal was detected in vivo in the prefrontal cortex of both BPN/3J and BPH/2J-treated mice, but OSK induced angiogenesis only in male BPN/3J mice. OSK-treated human ECs from hypertensive patients showed high eNOS activation and NO production, with low ROS formation. Single-cell RNA analysis showed that OSK alleviated EC senescence and EndMT, restoring their phenotypes in human ECs from hypertensive patients.

ConclusionOverall, these data indicate that OSK treatment and EC reprogramming can decrease blood pressure and reverse hypertension-induced vascular damage.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

However, existing applications often lack the ability to probe chemical composition and molecular specificity without the need for contrast agents. Here, we present a SWIR imaging approach that visualizes spontaneous Raman scattering with remarkable chemical contrast deep within tissue across large fields of view. Our results demonstrate that Raman scattering overcomes autofluorescence as the predominant source of endogenous tissue background at illumination wavelengths as short as 892 nm. We highlight the versatility of SWIR Raman imaging through in vivo monitoring of whole-body tissue composition dynamics and non-invasive detection of fatty liver disease in mice, and identification of calcification and lipids in unfixed human atherosclerotic plaques. Moreover, our approach facilitates the visualization of nerves embedded in fatty tissue, a major advancement for surgical applications.

The nature of this contextual information is difficult to study, as responses to feedforward and top-down inputs overlap in time and are difficult to disentangle experimentally. To address this issue, we measured responses to natural images and partially occluded versions of these images in the visual cortex of mice. Assessing neuronal responses before and after familiarizing mice with the non-occluded images allowed us to study experience-dependent and stimulus-specific contextual responses in pyramidal cells (PyCs) in cortical layers 2/3 and 5 in the absence of feedforward input. Surprisingly, in the same retinotopic region of cortex, we found that separate populations of PyCs in layer 2/3 responded to occluded and non-occluded images. Responses of PyCs selective for occluded images were strengthened upon familiarization and decoding analysis revealed they contained image-specific information, suggesting that they signaled the absence of predicted visual stimuli. Responses of PyCs selective for non-occluded scenes were weaker for familiarized images but stronger for unfamiliar images, suggesting that these neurons signaled the presence of unpredicted visual stimuli. Layer 5 also contained PyCs preferring either feedforward or contextual inputs, but their responses were more complex and strengthening of responses to occluded images required task engagement. The results show that visual experience decreases the activity of neurons responding to known feedforward inputs but increases the activity of neurons responding to contextual inputs tied to expected stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

Our data show that the increase in mitochondrial activity during embryogenesis does not require mitochondrial biogenesis, is not limited by metabolic substrates at early stages, and occurs without an increase in the abundance of respiratory chain complexes or their in vitro activity. Our analyses pinpoint a previously unexplored increase in mitochondrial-ER association during early stages in combination with changes in mitochondrial morphology at later stages as possible contributors to the rise in mitochondrial activity during embryogenesis.

To uncover these rules, it is first necessary to find the binding sites within a regulatory region with high precision, and then to systematically modulate this binding site arrangement while simultaneously measuring the effect of this modulation on output gene expression. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), where the gene expression stemming from 10,000s of in vitro-generated regulatory sequences is measured, have made this feat possible in high-throughput in single cells in culture. However, because of lack of technologies to incorporate DNA libraries, MPRAs are limited in whole organisms. To enable MPRAs in multicellular organisms, we generated tools to create a high degree of mutagenesis in specific genomic loci in vivo using base editing. Targeting GFP integrated in genome of Drosophila cell culture and whole animals as a case study, we show that the base editor AIDevoCDA1 stemming from sea lamprey fused to nCas9 is highly mutagenic. Surprisingly, longer gRNAs increase mutation efficiency and expand the mutating window, which can allow the introduction of mutations in previously untargetable sequences. Finally, we demonstrate arrays of >20 gRNAs that can efficiently introduce mutations along a 200bp sequence, making it a promising tool to test enhancer function in vivo in a high throughput manner.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

Microviruses are highly abundant in aquatic ecosystems and are prominent members of the mammalian gut microbiome, where their diversity has been linked to various chronic health disorders. Despite the clear importance of microviruses, little is known about the molecular mechanism of host infection. Here, we have characterized an exceptionally large microvirus, Ebor, and provide crucial insights into long-standing mechanistic questions. Cryogenic electron microscopy of Ebor revealed a capsid with trimeric protrusions that recognise lipopolysaccharides on the host surface. Cryogenic electron tomography of the host cell colonized with virus particles demonstrated that the virus initially attaches to the cell via five such protrusions, located at the corners of a single pentamer. This interaction triggers a stargate mechanism of capsid opening along the 5-fold symmetry axis, enabling delivery of the virus genome. Despite variations in specific virus-host interactions among different Microviridae family viruses, structural data indicate that the stargate mechanism of infection is universally employed by all members of the family. Startlingly, our data reveal a mechanistic link for the opening of relatively small capsids made out of a single jelly-roll fold with the structurally unrelated giant viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

Proposed drivers of remarkable longevity include high vegetable intake, strong social connections, and genetic markers. Here, we reveal new predictors of remarkable longevity and  supercentenarian status. In the United States, supercentenarian status is predicted by the absence of vital registration. The state-specific introduction of birth certificates is associated with a 69-82% fall in the number of supercentenarian records. In Italy, England, and France, which have more uniform vital registration, remarkable longevity is instead predicted by poverty, low per capita incomes, shorter life expectancy, higher crime rates, worse health, higher deprivation, fewer 90+ year olds, and residence in remote, overseas, and colonial territories. In England and France, higher old-age poverty rates alone predict more than half of the regional variation in attaining a remarkable age. Only 18% of  exhaustively validated supercentenarians have a birth certificate, falling to zero percent in the USA, and supercentenarian birthdates are concentrated on days divisible by five: a pattern indicative of widespread fraud and error. Finally, the designated  blue zones of Sardinia, Okinawa, and Ikaria corresponded to regions with low incomes, low literacy, high crime rate and short life expectancy relative to their national average. As such, relative poverty and short lifespan constitute unexpected predictors of centenarian and supercentenarian status and support a primary role of fraud and error in generating remarkable human age records.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

Currently, some of the most efficient random forest methods, in terms of computational speed, are implemented in Python. However, many biologists use R for genomic data analysis, as R offers a unified platform for performing additional statistical analysis and visualization. Here we present an R package, pyRforest, which integrates Python scikit-learn `RandomForestClassifier` algorithms into the R environment. pyRforest inherits the efficient memory management and parallelization of Python, and is optimized for classification tasks on large genomic datasets, such as those from RNA-seq. pyRforest offers several additional capabilities, including a novel rank-based permutation method for biomarker identification. This method can be used to estimate and visualize p-values for individual features, allowing the researcher to identify a subset of features for which there is robust, statistical evidence of an effect. In addition, pyRforest includes methods for the calculation and visualization of SHapley ADditive Explanations (SHAP) values. Finally, pyRforest includes support for comprehensive downstream analysis for gene ontology and pathway enrichment. pyRforest thus improves the implementation and interpretability of random forest models for genomic data analysis by merging the strengths of Python with R. pyRforest can be downloaded at: https://www.github.com/tkolisnik/pyRforest with an associated vignette at https://github.com/tkolisnik/pyRforest/blob/main/vignettes/pyRforest-vignette.pdf.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

In this work, we sought to develop Galleria mellonella as a model organism to replicate the dissemination of pathogens in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU). By combining this model organism with 3D printed models of a real hospital ICU, we are able to demonstrate that larvae do disseminate the multidrug resistant pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii within this ICU model and that it is possible to use this model to identify infection hotspots. Importantly, this model can also be used for intervention strategy testing as we also show that bacterial dissemination can be significantly mitigated by the introduction of antimicrobial wall surface coatings. This model provides a robust platform for the testing of antimicrobial surface coatings as well as the study of genetic determinants with a role in pathogen dissemination.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

This suggests a critical need to model the interaction between sensory feedback and intrinsic dynamics. Such models would also benefit the design of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that decode neural activity in real time, where both user learning and proficient control require feedback. Here we investigate the flexible feedback modulation of cortical dynamics and demonstrate its impact on BCI task performance and short-term learning. By training recurrent network models with real-time sensory feedback on a simple 2D reaching task, analogous to BCI cursor control, we show how previously reported M1 activity patterns can be reinterpreted as arising from feedback-driven dynamics. Next, by incorporating adaptive controllers upstream of M1, we make a testable prediction that short-term learning for a new BCI decoder is facilitated by plasticity of inputs to M1, including remapping of sensory feedback, beyond the plasticity of recurrent connections within M1. This input-driven dynamical structure also determines the speed of adaptation and learning outcomes, and explains a continuous form of learning variability. Thus, our work highlights the need to model input-dependent latent dynamics for motor control and clarifies how constraints on learning arise from both the statistical characteristics and the underlying dynamical structure of neural activity.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

The opposite was observed at temperatures reflecting inactive physiological states. This behavior was not observed for IgG antibodies of human and other mammals, or antibodies of birds. Importantly, diversification of bat antibody specificities resulted in preferential recognition of damaged endothelial and epithelial cells, indicating an anti-inflammatory function. The temperature-sensitivity of bat antibodies was mediated by the variable regions of immunoglobulin molecules.

Reproductive aging is associated with decreased ovarian reserve, decreased quality of the remaining oocytes, and decreased production of the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone. With aging, both mouse and human ovaries become pro-fibrotic and stiff. However, whether stiffness directly impairs ovarian function, folliculogenesis, and oocyte quality is unknown. To answer this question, we cultured mouse follicles in alginate gels that mimicked the stiffness of reproductively young and old ovaries. Follicles cultured in stiff hydrogels exhibited decreased survival and growth, decreased granulosa cell viability and estradiol synthesis, and decreased oocyte quality. We also observed a reduction in the number of granulosa cell-oocyte transzonal projections. RNA sequencing revealed early changes in the follicle transcriptome in response to stiffness. Follicles cultured in a stiff environment had lower expression of genes related to follicle development and greater expression of genes related to inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling than follicles cultured in a soft environment. Altogether, our findings suggest that ovarian stiffness directly modulates folliculogenesis and contributes to the progressive decline in oocyte quantity and quality observed in women of advanced maternal age.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

The integrated stress response (ISR) - comprising the four eIF2alpha kinases PERK, GCN2, PKR, and HRI - is a prominent stress-responsive signaling pathway that regulates mitochondrial morphology and function in response to diverse types of pathologic insult. This suggests that pharmacologic, stress-independent activation of the ISR represents a potential strategy to mitigate pathologic mitochondrial fragmentation associated with human disease. Here, we show that pharmacologic, stress-independent activation of the ISR kinases HRI or GCN2 promotes adaptive mitochondrial elongation and prevents mitochondrial fragmentation induced by the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Further, we show that stress-independent activation of these ISR kinases reduces mitochondrial fragmentation and restores basal mitochondrial morphology in patient fibroblasts expressing the pathogenic D414V variant of the pro-fusion mitochondrial GTPase MFN2 associated with neurological dysfunctions including ataxia, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss. These results identify pharmacologic, stress-independent activation of ISR kinases as a potential strategy to prevent pathologic mitochondrial fragmentation induced by disease-relevant chemical and genetic insults, further motivating the pursuit of highly selective ISR kinase-activating compounds as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction implicated in diverse human diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

We trained artificial intelligence (AI) models to predict the codons given their amino acid sequence in the eukaryotes Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, to study the extent to which we can learn patterns in naturally occurring codons to improve predictions. We trained our models on a subset of the proteins, and evaluated their predictions on large, separate sets of proteins of varying lengths and expression levels. Our models significantly outperformed naive frequency-based approaches, demonstrating that there are dependencies between codons that can be learned to better predict evolutionary-selected codon usage. The prediction accuracy advantage of our models is greater for highly expressed genes and it is greater in bacteria than eukaryotes, supporting the hypothesis that there is a monotonic relationship between selective pressure for complex codon patterns and effective population size. Also, in S. cerevisiae and bacteria, our models were more accurate for longer proteins, suggesting that the AI system may have learned patterns related to co-translational folding. Gene functionality and conservation were also important determinants that affect the performance of our models. Finally, we showed that using information encoded in homologous proteins has only a minor effect on prediction accuracy, perhaps due to complex codon-usage codes in genes undergoing rapid evolution. In summary, our study employing contemporary AI methods offers a new perspective on codon usage patterns and a novel tool to optimize codon usage in endogenous and heterologous proteins.

Significance statementCan one predict codon sequences used by an organism to encode a given amino acid sequence? This is difficult, because there are exponentially many codon sequences that can encode the same amino acid sequence and evolution is stochastic. Indeed, codons frequencies vary, a phenomenon known as codon-bias, yet we improve upon frequency-based predictions using contemporary AI tools that learn complex patterns and capture interactions between codons. Because our predictions are tested fairly, on cases not seen during the training process, accurate predictions suggest that these learned patterns are not random, and may be related to the evolutionary process. Thus, studying where our predictions are more accurate, is expected to reveal novel insights related to the way evolution shapes coding regions.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

At the core of this pathway is the cGAS-dependent production of the intra- and extra-cellular messenger 2-3-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which activates STING and leads to IRF3-dependent expression of cytokines and interferon. Despite its relevance to monitor viral and bacterial infections, cell death, and genome instability, the lack of specific live reporters has precluded spatio-temporal analyses of cGAS-STING signalling. Here, we generate a fluorescent cGAMP biosensor by engineering the functional interaction of activated STING and IRF3 at the Golgi. We show that cells encoding for the cGAMP biosensor react within 45 minutes, and in a time- and concentration-dependent manner to STING agonists and cGAMP. We demonstrate that the cGAMP biosensor is suitable for single cell characterisation of the dynamics of Herpes Simplex Virus 1 infection, mtDNA release upon apoptosis, and other sources of cytoplasmic dsDNA. Intriguingly, we show that STING signalling is not activated by ruptured micronuclei, suggesting that other cytosolic pattern recognition receptors underlie the interferon response upon chromosomal instability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the biosensor sensitivity is sufficient to report microenvironmental cGAMP, allowing to analyse how STING signalling spreads through neighbouring cells, including upon viral infection. Taken together, we provide a tool to easily monitor the activation cGAS-STING signalling pathway by live cell imaging, plate reader or immunofluorescence analyses; and to capture the spatio-temporal and heterogenous dynamics of the response to cGAMP.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

Our approach utilizes deep neural networks to learn features from such raw nanopore signal data that can distinguish DNA from viable and dead microorganisms in a controlled experimental setting. The application of explainable AI tools then allows us to robustly pinpoint the signal patterns in the nanopore raw data that allow the model to make viability predictions at high accuracy. Using the model predictions as well as efficient explainable AI-based rules, we show that our framework can be leveraged in a real-world application to estimate the viability of pathogenic Chlamydia, where traditional culture-based methods suffer from inherently high false negative rates. This application shows that our viability model captures predictive patterns in the nanopore signal that can in principle be utilized to predict viability across taxonomic boundaries and indendent of the killing method used to induce bacterial cell death. While the generalizability of our computational framework needs to be assessed in more detail, we here demonstrate for the first time the potential of analyzing freely available nanopore signal data to infer the viability of microorganisms, with many applications in environmental, veterinary, and clinical settings.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

The mechanisms of Vcor coral colonization, coral microbiome interactions, and virulence factor production are understudied. In other model Vibrio species, virulence factors like biofilm formation, toxin secretion, and protease production are controlled through a density-dependent communication system called quorum sensing (QS). Comparative genomics indicated that V. coralliilyticus genomes share high sequence identity for most of the QS signaling and regulatory components identified in other Vibrio species. Here, we identify an active QS signaling pathway in two V. coralliilyticus strains with distinct infection etiologies: type strain BAA-450 and coral isolate OCN008. The inter-species AI-2 autoinducer signaling pathway in both strains controls expression of the master QS transcription factor VcpR to regulate >300 genes, including protease production, biofilm formation, and two conserved type VI secretion systems (T6SSs). Activation of T6SS1 by QS results in secretion of effectors and enables interbacterial competition and killing of prey bacteria.

The mono-allelic CSF1R mutation causes adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), a lethal neurological disease and no rational cure in clinical trials. There are no animal models mimicking human ALSP. In this study, we first developed mouse models based on human ALSP hotspot mutations. We then utilized microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (Mr BMT) to replace the Csf1r-deficient microglia in ALSP mice by Csf1r-normal donor cells. With pathogenic gene correction, Mr BMT efficiently attenuated the pathologies. Previously, an ALSP patient received traditional bone marrow transplantation (tBMT) due to a misdiagnosis of metachromatic leukodystrophy. The disease progress was halted for 15 years with unknown reasons. We demonstrated that tBMT in ALSP is equivalent to or close to Mr BMT, achieving efficient microglia replacement and therefore attenuating the ALSP progress in the mouse model. Next, we applied tBMT to replace CSF1R-deficient microglia in human patients. Our clinical results show that after microglia replacement, the ALSP course is effectively halted. Together, microglia replacement corrects the pathogenic gene and thus halts the disease progress in the mouse model and human patients.

Beyond environmental factors, intragenomic conflict between genes inherited from the mother (matrigenes) versus the father (patrigenes) is also hypothesized to generate this plasticity. In honey bees, the Kinship Theory of Intragenomic Conflict predicts selection on patrigenes to enhance traits that result in fitness gained through reproduction, and thus patrigenes should favor the queen caste fate. Here, we conducted allele-specific transcriptome analyses on queen-destined larvae (QL) and worker-destined larvae (WL) at 192 hours post-fertilization (hpf), a critical stage for caste determination. Our findings reveal hundreds of genes with parent-of-origin effects (POEs), with significant patrigene-biased transcription in QL. Genes with POEs in honey bees resemble imprinted genes in other taxa in terms of genomic clustering, recombination rate, intron length and CpG density, and a subset are maintained from 24hpf eggs. Previous studies demonstrated that DNA methylation, the canonical regulatory mechanism underlying transcriptional POEs in placental mammals, angiosperms, and some insects, is not operating in honey bees or other social insects. We use allele-specific ChIP-seq analyses to demonstrate that POEs on caste-specific histone post-translational modification (HPTM) profiles of H3K27me3, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac are associated with POEs on transcription. Together, these findings suggest that parent-of-origin intragenomic conflicts may contribute broadly to phenotypic plasticity and may be associated with HPTMs, suggesting a ""non-canonical"" genomic imprinting-like system in social insects.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

In particular, intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) are subject to phosphorylation as a means to modulate their interactions and functions. Toward understanding the relationship between phosphorylation in IDRs and specific functional outcomes, we must consider how phosphorylation affects the IDR conformational ensemble. Various experimental techniques are suited to interrogate the features of IDR ensembles; molecular simulations can provide complementary insights and even illuminate ensemble features that may be experimentally inaccessible. Therefore, we sought to expand the tools available to study phosphorylated IDRs by all-atom Monte Carlo simulations. To this end, we implemented parameters for phosphoserine (pSer) and phosphothreonine (pThr) into the OPLS version of the continuum solvent model, ABSINTH, and assessed their performance in all-atom simulations compared to published findings. We simulated short (< 20 residues) and long (> 80 residues) phospho-IDRs that, collectively, survey both local and global phosphorylation-induced changes to the ensemble. Our simulations of four well-studied phospho-IDRs show near-quantitative agreement with published findings for these systems via metrics including changes to radius of gyration, transient helicity, and persistence length. We also leveraged the inherent advantage of sequence control in molecular simulations to explore the conformational effects of diverse combinations of phospho-sites in two multi-phosphorylated IDRs. Our results support and expand on prior observations that connect phosphorylation to changes in the IDR conformational ensemble. Herein, we describe phosphorylation as a means to alter sequence chemistry, net charge and charge patterning, and intramolecular interactions, which can collectively modulate the local and global IDR ensemble features.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

In addition, we observe that a pool of the Rab-specific, PPM1H phosphatase, is transcriptionally up-regulated and recruited to damaged mitochondria, independent of PINK1 or LRRK2 activity. Parallel signalling of LRRK2 and PINK1 pathways is supported by assessment of motor behavioural studies that show no evidence of genetic interaction in crossed mouse lines.

This is not exacerbated in double mutant LRRK2 and PINK1 mice. Overall, our analysis indicates that LRRK2 activation or loss of PINK1 function along parallel pathways to impair ciliogenesis, suggesting a convergent mechanism towards PD.

However, the detection and quantification processes are noisy; in particular, peptides may be erroneously detected, and most peptides, known as shared peptides, are associated to multiple protein isoforms. As a consequence, studying individual protein isoforms is challenging, and inferred protein results are often abstracted to the gene-level or to groups of protein isoforms. Here, we introduce IsoBayes, a novel statistical method to perform inference at the isoform level. Our method enhances the information available, by integrating mass spectrometry proteomics and transcriptomics data in a Bayesian probabilistic framework. To account for the uncertainty in the measurement process, we propose a two-layer latent variable approach: first, we sample if a peptide has been correctly detected (or, alternatively filter peptides); second, we allocate the abundance of such selected peptides across the protein(s) they are compatible with. This enables us, starting from peptide-level data, to recover protein-level data; in particular, we: i) infer the presence/absence of each protein isoform (via a posterior probability), ii) estimate its abundance (and credible interval), and iii) target isoforms where transcript and protein relative abundances significantly differ. We benchmarked our approach in simulations, and in two multi-protease real datasets: our method displays good sensitivity and specificity when detecting protein isoforms, its estimated abundances highly correlate with the ground truth, and can detect changes between protein and transcript relative abundances.

Overall task performance was markedly poorer during low arousal, but not for high arousal.

Here we bridge this gap with an automated marker identification method that works for bulk RNA sequencing data.

ResultsWe developed mastR, a novel computational tool for accurate marker identification from omics data. It leverages robust pipelines from edgeR and limma R/Bioconductor packages, performing pairwise comparisons between groups, and aggregating the results through rank-product-based permutation test. A signal-to-noise ratio approach is implemented to minimize background signals. We assess the performance of a mastR-derived NK cell signature against curated published signatures and find our derived signature performs as well if not better than published signatures.

We used Mendelian randomization and colocalization to identify variants predicted to increase KS risk via increased serum calcium or decreased serum phosphate (odds ratios for genomic regions=4.30-13.83 per 1 standard deviation alteration) that account for 11-19% of KS due to reduced calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR)-signal transduction, increased urinary phosphate excretion, and impaired 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D inactivation via diacylglycerol kinase delta (DGKD), solute carrier family 34 member 1 (SLC34A1), and cytochrome P450 family 24 subfamily A member 1 (CYP24A1), respectively. In silico analyses revealed that targeting CASR, DGKD, or CYP24A1 to decrease serum calcium, or SLC34A1 to increase serum phosphate may reduce KS risk, and in vitro studies demonstrated that positive CaSR-allosteric modulation ameliorates CaSR-signal transduction impaired by reduced DGK{delta} expression or KS-associated DGKD missense variants. These studies suggest that genotyping individuals with KS may facilitate personalized risk stratification and pharmacomodulation.","NA","medrxiv",1718229846915

However, the high-yield biochemical isolation and visualization of endogenous NLGNs have been hampered by the lack of efficient antibodies to these proteins. Thus, to reveal their sub-cellular distribution, binding partners, and synaptic function, NLGNs have been extensively manipulated using knock-down, knock-out, or over-expression approaches, overall leading to controversial results. As an alternative to the manipulation of NLGN expression level, we describe here the generation of a new transgenic mouse strain in which native NLGN1 was N-terminally tagged with a small biotin acceptor peptide (bAP) that can be enzymatically biotinylated by the exogenous delivery of biotin ligase. After showing that knock-in mice exhibit normal behavior as well as similar synaptic number, ultrastructure, transmission properties, and protein expression levels when compared to wild type counterparts, we exploited the fact that biotinylated bAP-NLGN1 can be selectively isolated or visualized using high-affinity streptavidin conjugates. Using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, we show that bAP-NLGN1 binds both PSD-95 and gephyrin and distributes equally well at excitatory and inhibitory synapses, challenging the historical view that NLGN1 is exclusively localized at excitatory synapses. Using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy, we further highlight that bAP-NLGN1 forms in the synaptic cleft a subset of nanodomains each containing a few NLGN1 dimers, while the number of nanodomains per synapse positively scales with the post-synapse size. Overall, our study not only provides a novel, extensively characterized transgenic mouse model which will be made available to the scientific community, but also an unprecedented view of the nanoscale organization of endogenous NLGN1.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

This study provides direct evidence linking the cerebellum, an evolutionarily ancient and non-classic auditory structure, to vocalization and hearing. We report that in the fruit-eating bat Carollia perspicillata, external sounds can evoke cerebellar responses with latencies below 20 ms. Such fast responses are indicative of early inputs to the bat cerebellum. In vocalizing bats, distinct spike train patterns allow the prediction with over 85% accuracy of the sound they are about to produce, or have just produced, i.e., communication calls or echolocation pulses. Taken together, our findings provide evidence of specializations for vocalization and hearing in the cerebellum of an auditory specialist.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

Poor outcomes for osteosarcoma patients are intricately linked with the development of lung metastasis. While lung metastasis is responsible for nearly all deaths caused by osteosarcoma, identification of biologically defined, metastasis-targeting therapies remains elusive because the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern metastatic colonization of circulating tumor cells to the lung remains poorly understood. While thousands of tumor cells are released into circulation each day, very few can colonize the lung. Herein, using a combination of a novel organotypic metastasis in vitro model, single-cell RNA sequencing, human xenograft, and murine immunocompetent osteosarcoma models, we find that metastasis is initiated by a subpopulation of hypo-proliferative cells with the unique capacity to sustain production of metastasis promoting cytokines such as IL6 and CXCL8 in response to lung-epithelial derived IL1alpha. Critically, genomic and pharmacologic disruption of IL1 signaling in osteosarcoma cells significantly reduces metastatic progression. Collectively, our study supports that tumor-stromal interactions are important for metastasis, and suggests that metastatic competency is driven, in part, by the tumor cell ability to respond to the metastatic niche. Our findings support that disruption of tumor-stromal signaling is a promising therapeutic approach to disrupt metastasis progression.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

Understanding the temporal and spatial dynamics of proteolysis and the activation of proteases is crucial for elucidating their roles in biological pathways. Here, we introduce a suite of genetically encoded FRET reporters designed to detect various proteolytic activities in plants. These sensors effectively reported in planta the specific activity of both Tobacco Etch Virus protease and caspase-3. Furthermore, we developed sensors for detecting plant metacaspase activity, validated through both in vitro and in planta experiments. These experiments revealed the spatial dynamics of proteolysis triggered by metacaspase activation following wounding and programmed cell death in roots. The implementation of these tools in plant biology research opens new avenues for investigating proteolytic mechanisms, significantly enhancing the potential for in-depth studies. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using these sensors to detect diverse protease activities in vivo with high spatiotemporal resolution. These plant proteolytic biosensors hence represent a valuable toolbox for understanding protease functions within their natural context, paving the way for future advancements in plant biology research.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

However, the contribution of other checkpoints is unknown. Here, we reveal that Lag3 and PD-L1 pathways are the major regulators of TCR signalling in adaptively tolerised CD4+ T cells. Lag3 and PD-L1 co-blockade (CB) drove additive and synergistic changes in T cell activation, resulting in a transcriptional profile dominated by a NFAT-biased/ T follicular helper cell signature. Mechanistically, CB led to an enhanced duration of TCR signalling, which drove a transcriptional motif of TCR signal duration-sensitive genes. In addition, CB synergistically upregulated CCR6, leading to enhanced CCL20-dependent migration. Analysis of datasets from humans on anti-PD-1 and anti-Lag3 immunotherapy revealed upregulation of CCR6 and ICOS in blood effector memory CD4+ T cells, underscoring the translational relevance of our findings. The PD-L1 and Lag3 pathways, therefore, are major regulators of TCR signal duration in adaptively tolerised CD4+ T cells in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

The best studied bacterial protein gradient is the Min system of Escherichia coli. In rod-shaped bacteria the MinCD proteins prevent formation of minicells by inhibiting FtsZ polymerization close to the cell poles. In E. coli these proteins oscillate between cell poles within a minute, resulting in an increased MinCD concentration at the poles. This oscillation is caused by the interaction between MinD and the protein MinE, which form an ATP-driven reaction-diffusion system, whereby the ATPase MinD cycles between a monomeric cytosolic and a dimeric membrane attached states. Bacillus subtilis also has MinCD, but lacks MinE. In this case MinCD form a static gradient that requires the transmembrane protein MinJ, located at cell poles and cell division sites. A recent reaction-diffusion model was successful in recreating the MinD gradient in B. subtilis, assuming that MinD cycles between cytosol and membrane, like in E. coli. Here we show that the monomeric and dimeric states of B. subtilis MinD have comparable membrane affinities, that MinD interacts with MinJ as a dimer, and that MinJ is not required for membrane localization of MinD. Based on these new findings we tested different models, using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, and found that a difference in diffusion rate between the monomer and dimer, rather than a difference in membrane affinity, is important for B. subtilis MinCD gradient formation.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

Despite its widespread impact, very little is known about the molecular strategies it employs to induce the characteristic clubs in the roots of susceptible hosts during infection, nor about the mechanisms it uses to overcome genetic resistance. Here, we provide the first telomere-to-telomere complete genome of Plasmodiophora brassicae.

The BUSCO score, the highest reported for any member of the group Rhizaria (Eukaryota: 88.2%), highlights the limitations within the Eukaryota database for members of this lineage. Using available transcriptomic data and protein evidence, we annotated the Pb3A genome, identifying 10,521 protein-coding gene models.

In the gliding bacterium Mycoplasma mobile, a dimeric F1-like ATPase forms a chain structure with a glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), within the cell. This unique dimeric ATPase is proposed to drive the gliding motility. However, the mechanisms of force generation and transmission remain unclear. Here we present a 3.2 [A] resolution structure of the dimeric ATPase complex obtained by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM). The structure reveals an assembly distinct from known dimeric forms of F1Fo-ATPase, despite containing conserved F1-ATPase structures. The two ATPase units are interconnected by dimers of GliD, previously identified as MMOB1620. Gli{beta}, a homolog of the F1-ATPase catalytic subunit, displays a specific N-terminal region that incorporates PGK into the complex. The ATPase shows strong similarities to F1-ATPase in terms of structural conformations of the catalytic subunits, catalytically important residues, and nucleotide-binding pattern of the catalytic sites, suggesting a rotation based on the rotary catalytic mechanism conserved in rotary ATPases.

Besides eliminating mutant alleles in familial disease, gene-editing can also be used to favorably manipulate upstream pathophysiologic events and alter disease-course in wider patient populations, but few such feasible therapeutic avenues have been reported. Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the last exon of amyloid precursor protein (App), relevant for Alzheimers disease (AD). Our strategy effectively eliminates an endocytic (YENPTY) motif at APP C-terminus, while preserving the N-terminus and compensatory APP-homologues. This manipulation favorably alters events along the amyloid-pathway - inhibiting toxic APP-{beta}-cleavage fragments (including A{beta}) and upregulating neuroprotective APP--cleavage products. AAV-driven editing ameliorates neuropathologic, electrophysiologic, and behavioral deficits in an AD knockin mouse model. Effects persist for many months, and no abnormalities are seen in WT mice even after germline App-editing; underlining overall efficacy and safety. Pathologic alterations in the glial-transcriptome of App-KI mice, as seen by single nuclei RNA-sequencing (sNuc-Seq), are also normalized by App C-terminus editing. Our strategy takes advantage of innate transcriptional rules that render terminal exons insensitive to nonsense-decay, and the upstream manipulation is expected to be effective for all forms of AD.

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3, which convergently acquired S protein substitutions such as S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Furthermore, JN.1 subvariants such as LB.1 and KP.2.3, which convergently acquired S:S31del in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. Here we investigated the virological properties of KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

These range from the benign (white eyelashes) to the deadly (respiratory failure). The Human Phenotype Ontology has categorised all human phenotypic variation into a unified framework that defines the relationships between them (e.g. missing arms and missing legs are both abnormalities of the limb). This has made it possible to perform phenome-wide analyses, e.g. to prioritise which make the best candidates for gene therapies. However, there is currently limited metadata describing the clinical characteristics / severity of these phenotypes. With >17500 phenotypic abnormalities across >8600 rare diseases, manual curation of such phenotypic annotations by experts would be exceedingly labour-intensive and time-consuming. Leveraging advances in artificial intelligence, we employed the OpenAI GPT-4 large language model (LLM) to systematically annotate the severity of all phenotypic abnormalities in the HPO. Phenotypic severity was defined using a set of clinical characteristics and their frequency of occurrence. First, we benchmarked the generative LLM clinical characteristic annotations against ground-truth labels within the HPO (e.g. phenotypes in the ""Cancer"" HPO branch were annotated as causing cancer by GPT-4). True positive recall rates across different clinical characteristics ranged from 89-100% (mean=96%), clearly demonstrating the ability of GPT-4 to automate the curation process with a high degree of fidelity. Using a novel approach, we developed a severity scoring system that incorporates both the nature of the clinical characteristic and the frequency of its occurrence. These clinical characteristic severity metrics will enable efforts to systematically prioritise which human phenotypes are most detrimental to human health, and best targets for therapeutic intervention.","NA","medrxiv",1718229846915

However, development of such models has been hampered by the shortage of large expert-annotated datasets. Here, we used information from free-text radiology reports, rather than manual annotations, to develop a deep-learning-based pipeline for comprehensive detection of abdominal CT abnormalities. Methods In this multicenter retrospective study, we developed a deep-learning-based pipeline to detect abnormalities in the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and kidneys. Abdominal CT exams and related free-text reports obtained during routine clinical practice collected from three institutions were used for training and internal testing, while data collected from six institutions were used for external testing. A multi-organ segmentation model and an information extraction schema were used to extract specific organ images and disease information, CT images and radiology reports, respectively, which were used to train a multiple-instance learning model for anomaly detection. Its performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score against radiologists' ground-truth labels. Findings We trained the model for each organ on images selected from 66,684 exams (39,255 patients) and tested it on 300 (295 patients) and 600 (596 patients) exams for internal and external validation, respectively. In the external test cohort, the overall AUC for detecting organ abnormalities was 0.886. Whereas models trained on human-annotated labels performed better with the same number of exams, those trained on larger datasets with labels auto-extracted via the information extraction schema significantly outperformed human-annotated label-derived models. Interpretation Using disease information from routine clinical free-text radiology reports allows development of accurate anomaly detection models without requiring manual annotations. This approach is applicable to various anatomical sites and could streamline diagnostic processes. Funding Japan Science and Technology Agency.","NA","medrxiv",1718229846915

Central to this, are the computational approaches of de novo assembly and genome binning that enable large-scale reference-independent recovery of microbial genomes from the metagenomic sequencing data. Despite the advancements in bioinformatics approaches to address the computational challenges inherent to these tasks, the limitation of computational resources continues to be a significant barrier to harvesting the full potential of these techniques. Consequently, there is a stressed need to devise strategies involving the fine-tuning of the employed parameters for the effective utilization of the available metagenomic tools. As most of the available metagenome assembly tools are based on the de Bruijn graph framework that relies on a parameter k, selecting an appropriate subset of k-mers has become a common approach in bioinformatics for efficient computations. In this study, we propose a reduced set of k-mers, optimized to strike a balance between computational efficiency and the quality of the high- and low-complexity metagenome assemblies. Utilizing this set of k-mers with MEGAHIT reduces the metagenome assembly time by half compared to the default set, thus greatly reducing the associated computational cost. In addition, it also brings the promise to improve large-scale genome binning studies that adopt this set in the future as we observed an increase in the total number of the recovered genomes as well as obtained higher proportions of high- and medium-quality genomes recovered from the reduced k-mers-based metagenome assemblies.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

We identify inhibitors of RAS-MAPK signaling, especially MEK inhibitors, strongly synergizing with radiation response. Mechanistically, MEK inhibitors suppressed radiation-induced activation of RAS-MAPK signaling, and selectively downregulated the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway component RAD51, thereby achieving radio-enhancement. Through testing drug-drug-radiation combinations in organoids and cell lines, we identified synergism between PARP and MEK inhibitors to further enhance the effect of radiation.

Nevertheless, little is known about how Abetao affect OL differentiation and myelination in vivo, and the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we explored the effects of a brain intraventricular injection of Abetao on OLs and myelin in the developing spinal cord of zebrafish larvae. Using quantitative fluorescent in situ RNA hybridization assays, we demonstrated that Abetao altered myrf and mbp mRNA levels and the regional distribution of mbp during larval development, suggesting an early differentiation of OLs. Through live imaging of Tg(myrf:mScarlet) and Tg(mbp:tagRFP) zebrafish lines, both crossed with Tg(olig2:EGFP), we found that Abetao increased the number of myrf+ and mbp+ OLs in the dorsal spinal cord at 72 hpf and 5 dpf, respectively, without affecting total cell numbers. Furthermore, Abetao also increased the number of myelin sheaths per OL and the number of myelinated axons in the dorsal spinal cord compared to vehicle-injected control animals. Interestingly, the treatment of Abetao-injected zebrafish with the pan-PKC inhibitor Go6983 restored the aforementioned alterations in OLs and myelin to control levels. Altogether, not only do we demonstrate that Abetao induce a precocious oligodendroglial differentiation leading to dysregulated myelination, but we also identified PKC as a key player in Abetao-induced pathology.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

In response, naked mole-rats have evolved a suite of molecular and physiological adaptations to survive extreme hypoxia. Yet, how naked mole-rats rewire their metabolism to protect the heart has not been comprehensively addressed. Here, we performed comparative analyses of naked mole-rat and mouse organs exposed to ischaemic conditions. We show that naked mole-rats have retained features of foetal cardiac metabolism replacing fatty acid utilisation for a unique type of carbohydrate metabolism largely dependent on glycogen. We found that naked mole-rats have co-opted specialised liver-like glycogen handling mechanisms in the heart. Amongst these is the expression of liver-specific enzyme isoforms and amylase, a digestive enzyme known for starch breakdown in saliva and intestine but whose biological role in glycogen processing has not been fully recognised. We show that amylase is rapidly activated in ischaemia and hydrolyses internal glycosidic bonds for more efficient downstream processing. This biochemical adaptation occurred in both mouse and naked mole-rat livers but exclusively in the naked mole-rat heart, which retained higher ATP levels by maintaining an increased glycolytic flux in an amylase-dependent mechanism. Overall, we discovered a previously unknown type of glycogen metabolism in the naked mole-rat that holds relevance to pathologies where glycogen plays a role. Furthermore, we describe a novel type of metabolic plasticity in the heart which may be harnessed for cardiac disease.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1.

Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1718229846915

Here, we present VILOCA, a method for mutation calling and reconstruction of local haplotypes from short- and long-read viral sequencing data. Local haplotypes refer to genomic regions that have approximately the length of the input reads. VILOCA recovers local haplotypes by using a Dirichlet process mixture model to cluster reads around their unobserved haplotypes and leveraging quality scores of the sequencing reads. We assessed the performance of VILOCA in terms of mutation calling and haplotype reconstruction accuracy on simulated and experimental Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore data. On simulated and experimental Illumina data, VILOCA performed better or similar to existing methods. On the simulated long-read data, VILOCA is able to recover on average 82% of the ground truth mutations with perfect precision compared to only 64% recall and 90% precision of the second-best method. In summary, VILOCA provides significantly improved accuracy in mutation and haplotype calling, especially for long-read sequencing data, and therefore facilitates the comprehensive characterization of heterogeneous within-host viral populations.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846915

Most cases of PD are believed to arise from gene-environment interactions. Microbiome composition is altered in PD, and gut bacteria are causal to symptoms and pathology in animal models. To explore how the microbiome may impact PD-associated genetic risks, we quantitatively profiled nearly 630 metabolites from 26 biochemical classes in the gut, plasma, and brain of -synuclein-overexpressing (ASO) mice with or without microbiota. We observe tissue-specific changes driven by genotype, microbiome, and their interaction. Many differentially expressed metabolites in ASO mice are also dysregulated in human PD patients, including amine oxides, bile acids and indoles. Notably, levels of the microbial metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) strongly correlate from the gut to the plasma to the brain, identifying a product of gene-environment interactions that may influence PD-like outcomes in mice.

Then, we developed a transgenic zebrafish line expressing the KFERQ-Dendra2 CMA reporter, enabling the real-time tracking of CMA activity in vivo. This model revealed heterogeneous CMA responses within tissues, highlighting the zebrafish as a valuable model for investigating tissue-specific and cell-scale variations in CMA. Moreover, a novel role for CMA has been uncovered, acting as a gatekeeper of sperm cell proteostasis, thereby playing a crucial role in the production of active and high-quality spermatozoa. Overall, these findings emphasize the zebrafish as a pivotal model for advancing our comprehension of the fundamental mechanisms underlying CMA.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846916

RNA sequencing on purified AML patient samples show TP53mut AML has higher expression of mevalonate pathway genes. We retrospectively identified a survival benefit in TP53mut AML patients who received chemotherapy concurrently with a statin, which inhibits the mevalonate pathway. Mechanistically, TP53mut AML resistance to standard AML chemotherapy, cytarabine (AraC), correlates with increased mevalonate pathway activity and a mitochondria stress response with increased mitochondria mass and oxidative phosphorylation. Pretreatment with a statin reverses these effects and chemosensitizes TP53mut AML cell lines and primary samples in vitro and in vivo. Mitochondria-dependent chemoresistance requires the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) branch of the mevalonate pathway and novel GGPP-dependent synthesis of glutathione to manage AraC-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Joint dimensionality reduction methods can be applied to multi-omics datasets to derive a global sample embedding analogous to single-omic techniques such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Multiple co-inertia analysis (MCIA) is a method for joint dimensionality reduction that maximizes the covariance between block- and global-level embeddings. Current implementations for MCIA are not optimized for large datasets such such as those arising from single cell studies, and lack capabilities with respect to embedding new data.

ResultsWe introduce nipalsMCIA, an MCIA implementation that solves the objective function using an extension to Non-linear Iterative Partial Least Squares (NIPALS), and shows significant speed-up over earlier implementations that rely on eigendecompositions for single cell multi-omics data. It also removes the dependence on an eigendecomposition for calculating the variance explained, and allows users to perform out-of-sample embedding for new data. nipalsMCIA provides users with a variety of pre-processing and parameter options, as well as ease of functionality for down-stream analysis of single-omic and global-embedding factors.

We have limited understanding on how plants adapt to such variable conditions. Here, we exposed Arabidopsis thaliana plants to naturally fluctuating light regimes alongside traditional square light regimes such as those often found in control environment growth chambers. The physiological response was highly consistent across experiments, indicating the involvement of an epigenetic mechanism, leading us to investigated differences in DNA methylation. Our results identified a large number of alterations in DNA methylation patterns between fluctuating light acclimated plants, and square light acclimated plants, demonstrating natural fluctuations in light impacts the plant epigenetic mechanisms. Most importantly, there are more differences in DNA methylation patterns between different light pattern regimes than between different light intensities. These differences in DNA methylation were accompanied by significant changes in gene expression, some of which correlated with altered DNA methylation. Interestingly, several transposable elements which displayed differential methylation were found to be differentially expressed between light regimes. Our data suggests DNA methylation plays a role in acclimation to natural light which may directly regulate gene expression and impact transposable element activation.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846916

Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state.

Two actionable variants in these genes have reached much higher frequencies than in cosmopolitan UK populations. Here, we report a BRCA2 splice acceptor variant, c.517-2A>G, found in breast and ovarian cancer families from Shetland. We investigated the frequency and origin of this variant in a population-based research cohort of people of Shetland ancestry, VIKING I. The variant segregates with female breast and ovarian cancer in diagnosed cases and is classified as pathogenic. Exome sequence data from 2,108 participants with three or more Shetlandic grandparents in VIKING I was used to estimate the population prevalence of c.517-2A>G in Shetlanders. Nine VIKING I research volunteers carry this variant, on a shared haplotype (carrier frequency 0.4%). This frequency is [~]130-fold higher than in UK Biobank, where the small group of carriers has a different haplotype. Records of birth, marriage and death indicate genealogical linkage of VIKING I carriers to a founder from the Isle of Whalsay, Shetland, similar to our observations for the BRCA1 founder variant from Westray, Orkney. In total, 93.5% of pathogenic BRCA variant carriers in Northern Isles exomes are accounted for by these two drifted variants. We thus provide the scientific evidence of an opportunity for screening people of Orcadian and Shetlandic origins for each drifted pathogenic variant, particularly women with Westray or Whalsay ancestry.","NA","medrxiv",1718229846916

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846916

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3).

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1718229846916

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846916

This is a case of sound-symbolism, known as the Bouba-Kiki effect. Studies on four-months infants suggest that this effect might constitute a predisposed perceptual mechanism. However, these studies suffered from the impossibility of ruling out a fast experience-driven origin of the effect resulting from infants speed of learning, their sensitivity to environmental regularities, and the large number of sound-symbolic associations to which they are precociously exposed when interacting with adults. To better describe its ontogeny and fill in this gap, we tested the Bouba-Kiki effect in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus). Being a precocial species, chicks can be tested on the very early days of life, allowing for a virtually total control of their experience before test. Three-day-old chicks (n=42) first learned to circumnavigate a panel to obtain a food reward. Then, they were presented with two identical panels, one depicting a spiky shape, and one depicting a round shape, while hearing either the sound  Bouba or  Kiki. We recorded which panel chicks chose with either sound, in a total of 24 trials. Chicks preferred the panel with the spiky shape when hearing the  Kiki sound, and that with the round shape when hearing the  Bouba sound. Results from naive baby chicks hint at a predisposed mechanism for matching the two dimensions of shape and sound that may be widespread across species.","NA","biorxiv",1718229846916
