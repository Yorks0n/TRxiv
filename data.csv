ME diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME patients' low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n<100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME cases' restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the 'healthy volunteer' selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1724969330862

Addressing this gap, we generated extensive RNA-sequencing data for multiple organs across 22 representative species over the fern phylogeny, assembling high-quality transcriptomes. These data facilitated the construction of a time-calibrated fern phylogeny covering all major clades, revealing numerous whole-genome duplications and highlighting the uniqueness of fern genetics, with half of the uncovered gene families being fern-specific. Our investigation into fern cell walls through biochemical and immunological analyses identified occurrences of the lignin syringyl unit and its independent evolution in ferns. Moreover, the discovery of an unusual sugar in fern cell walls hints at a divergent evolutionary path in cell wall biochemistry, potentially driven by gene duplication and sub-functionalization. We provide an online database preloaded with genomic and transcriptomic data for ferns and other land plants, which we used to identify an independent evolution of lignocellulosic gene modules in ferns. Our data provide a framework for the unique evolutionary path that ferns have navigated since they split from the last common ancestor of euphyllophytes more than 360 million years ago.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

This study aimed to analyse any possible connection between these factors.

MethodsThe top performing 18 nations from 2012, 2016 and 2020 Olympics (after Russia and Ukraine were excluded) had their relative Gold medals, total medals and medal points (Gold =3, Silver=2, Bronze=1) for Paris 2024 analysed using a backward stepwise linear regression model. Initial input factors included previous medal tallies, home city advantage, time zone effects, national excess deaths 2020-2023, average GDP growth 2020-2023 and number of country signatories to the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD), with factors >P=0.10 removed sequentially.

ResultsTotal medals were best predicted by previous total medals (t=21.0, P<0.001) and home city advantage (t=4.1, P<0.001). Gold medals were best predicted by previous Gold medals (t=10.3, P<0.001), low national excess deaths (t=-3.2, P<0.007) and low signatories to the GBD (t=-2.2, P<0.05). Medal points were best predicted by previous medal points (t=18.1, P<0.001), home city advantage (t=3.2, P<0.007) and low national excess deaths (t=-1.8, P<0.09).

DiscussionThe Western Pacific countries with a COVID-cautious national perspective (Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea) tended to win more Gold medals than expected in Paris, compared to countries with a COVID-stoical national perspective (e.g. Great Britain, United States) which won fewer Golds than expected. This suggests that a COVID-cautious mentality may have contributed to better performance than a COVID-stoical approach. It is unclear whether any mechanism was physiological (less infectious disease impact before or during the Olympics) or psychological. If this effect existed for Golds, it did not appear to have any effect on Silver and Bronze medals.

The five countries with lower than 6% Excess mortality over the time period 2020-2023 all won more Gold medals than expected in Paris. The relationship between Excess mortality and change in Gold medals was negative and moderately strong. In the linear regression for prediction of Gold medals in Paris, Excess mortality was a highly significant predictor (t=-3.2, P<0.007). The exact mechanism of this relationship (physiological via reduced infection or psychological or via unassessed confounders) is unclear, but it can be confidently stated that in the countries which had tighter pandemic restrictions in 2020-21 and lower excess mortality, athletes have not suffered any ""immunity debt"" relative to the rest of the world.","NA","medrxiv",1724969330862

To explore it, we analyzed deep proteomic and transcriptomic data from over 1,000 human samples, including 6 cancer types and 26 healthy human tissues. This global analysis identified 60,024 high confidence substitutions corresponding to 8,801 unique sites in 1,990 proteins. Some substitutions are shared across samples, while others exhibit strong tissue-type and cancer specificity. Surprisingly, products of alternate translation are more abundant than their canonical counterparts for hundreds of proteins, suggesting sense codon recoding. Recoded proteins include transcription factors, proteases, signaling proteins, and proteins associated with neurodegeneration. Mechanisms contributing to substitution abun-dance include protein stability, codon frequency, codon-anticodon mismatches, and RNA modifications. We characterize sequence motifs around alternatively translated amino acids and how substitution ratios vary across protein domains, tissue types and cancers. Both the sequence and the tissue-specificity of alternatively translated proteins are conserved between human and mouse. These results demonstrate the contribution of alternate translation to diversifying mammalian proteomes, and its association with protein stability, tissue-specific proteomes, and diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

This study aims to determine cost-saving risk thresholds for statin use in Germany to inform better prescription practices and healthcare policies.

MethodsA decision-analytic approach was employed, using secondary data to compare statin use with no statin use from the perspective of German sickness fund insurees. The analysis focused on cost savings from avoided cardiovascular (CV) events, translating these avoided events into net savings after accounting for treatment costs and potential side effects. The study considered the German adult population insured by sickness funds and used a lifetime horizon for the analysis.

ResultsThe maximum number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve cost savings over 10 years was found to be 40, leading to a minimum risk threshold for savings of 9.8%. It was estimated that approximately 22% of the adult population in Germany has a 10-year CV risk of [&ge;]9.8%, potentially avoiding between 307,049 and 705,537 CV events over 10 years, with net population savings of approximately {euro}18 billion.

ConclusionsThe current official threshold for statin prescription in Germany, set at a 20% 10-year risk, is too stringent. Lowering the threshold to 9.8% could significantly increase the number of patients benefiting from statin therapy, reducing CV events and generating substantial cost savings. These findings suggest that adjustments to prescription guidelines could improve cardiovascular outcomes and economic efficiency within the German healthcare system.","NA","medrxiv",1724969330862

Here, we develop an assay to measure hydropatterning in maize and reveal substantial differences between tropical/subtropical and temperate maize breeding germplasm that likely resulted from divergent selection.

This sgRNA codes both ORF3a and E and can be detected throughout the viral life cycle in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with high copy numbers. ORF3a-E-sgRNA guides more ORF3a translation and promotes the expression of cellular ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3) and the binding of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). Single-cell sequencing of a SARS-CoV-2-infected human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE) revealed that maintenance of this stable translational environment by ORF3a-E-sgRNA is important for the SARS-CoV-2 assembly and release capabilities and is also beneficial for viral evasion of host innate immunity.

While the mechanisms by which soluble cargo receptors recruit the autophagy machinery are becoming increasingly clear, the principles governing how organelle-localized transmembrane cargo receptors initiate selective autophagy remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that transmembrane cargo receptors can initiate autophagosome biogenesis not only by recruiting the upstream FIP200/ULK1 complex but also via a WIPI-ATG13 complex. This latter pathway is employed by the BNIP3/NIX receptors to trigger mitophagy. Additionally, other transmembrane mitophagy receptors, including FUNDC1 and BCL2L13, exclusively use the FIP200/ULK1 complex, while FKBP8 and the ER-phagy receptor TEX264 are capable of utilizing both pathways to initiate autophagy. Our study defines the molecular rules for initiation by transmembrane cargo receptors, revealing remarkable flexibility in the assembly and activation of the autophagy machinery, with significant implications for therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

We asked whether BTSP could also be a plasticity mechanism for generation of non-spatial responses in the hippocampus and what roles the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex (MEC and LEC) play in driving non-spatial BTSP. By performing simultaneous calcium imaging of dorsal CA1 neurons and chemogenetic inhibition of LEC or MEC while mice performed an olfactory working memory task, we discovered BTSP-like events which formed stable odor-specific fields. Critically, the success rate of calcium events generating a significant odor-field increased with event amplitude, and large events exhibited asymmetrical formation with the newly formed odor-fields preceding the timepoint of their induction event. We found that MEC and LEC play distinct roles in modulating BTSP: MEC inhibition reduced the frequency of large calcium events, while LEC inhibition reduced the success rate of odor-field generation. Using two-photon calcium imaging of LEC and MEC temporammonic axons projecting to CA1, we found that LEC projections to CA1 were strongly odor selective even early in task learning, while MEC projection odor-selectivity increased with task learning but remained weaker than LEC. Finally, we found that LEC and MEC inhibition both slowed representational drift of odor representations in CA1 across 48 hours. Altogether, odor-specific information from LEC and strong odor-timed activity from MEC are crucial for driving BTSP in CA1, which is a synaptic plasticity mechanism for generation of both spatial and non-spatial responses in the hippocampus that may play a role in explaining representational drift and one-shot learning of non-spatial information.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

Recent developments of computer vision tools enable the automatic quantification of behaviours, supplementing or even replacing manual annotations. However, widespread adoption of these methods is still limited, due to the lack of annotated training datasets and domain-specific knowledge required to optimize these models for animal research. Here, we present YOLO-Behaviour, a flexible framework for identifying visually distinct behaviours from video recordings. The framework is robust, easy to implement, and requires minimal manual annotations as training data. We demonstrate the flexibility of the framework with case studies for event-wise detection in house sparrow nestling provisioning, Siberian jay feeding, human eating behaviours, and frame-wise detections of various behaviours in pigeons, zebras, and giraffes. Our results show that the framework reliably detects behaviours accurately, and retrieve comparable accuracy metrics to manual annotation. However, metrics extracted for event-wise detection were less correlated with manual annotation, and potential reasons for the discrepancy between manual annotation and automatic detection are discussed. To mitigate this problem, the framework can be used as a hybrid approach of first detecting events using the pipeline and then manually confirming the detections, saving annotation time. We provide detailed documentation and guidelines on how to implement the YOLO-Behaviour framework, for researchers to readily train and deploy new models on their own study systems. We anticipate the framework can be another step towards lowering the barrier of entry for applying computer vision methods in animal behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

While major signalling pathways critical for this control have been identified3, how they achieve such a tight balance in cell type composition remains unclear. Here, we uncover dynamic expression of Hes1, a direct NOTCH target3, in intestinal stem and progenitor cells, and investigate its role in vivo and in vitro. A knock-in reporter4 reveals distinct, cell-specific period lengths in Hes1 oscillations that form a gradient along the crypt-villus axis. Whereas secretory precursors oscillate at low periods, absorptive precursors oscillate at higher periods before transitioning to a differentiated state. To test the function of different oscillation periods, we innovated a microfluidic system that modulates Hes1 oscillations in organoids. We find that varying the oscillation period modulates secretory cell differentiation: While 90-min oscillations promote Paneth cells, 130-min oscillations increase formation of other secretory subtypes. Moreover, low-period oscillations support stemness and a proliferative state. Our study provides the first clear evidence that information for tissue homeostasis in the intestine is encoded in the temporal dynamics of signalling components.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

Mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction is associated with lack of physical activity and considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs) aflicting our societies such as T2D, CVD, metabolic syndrome, and even AD.

To our knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies on the metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular characteristics of ""healthy sedentary"" individuals living without clinical symptoms. Hence, the main aim of our study herein was to characterize multiple metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular bioenergetic signatures in ""healthy sedentary"" individuals which could already be downregulated compared to moderately active individuals.

Nineteen subjects, 9 sedentary (SED) and 10 moderately active (AC) volunteered for multiple assessments including muscle biopsies, in order to assess muscle metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics both at rest and during exercise.

For our exercise studies, we performed graded exercise testing (GXT) to assess carbohydrate and fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity according to our previously developed methodology.

Resting studies showed decreased mitochondrial respiration including decreases in complex I (-36%) and II (-28%) as well as total electron system capacity (-34%) and electron system capacity coupled to ATP production via ATP synthase (-30%). Regarding muscle carbohydrate metabolism, SED individuals showed a decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation (-37%) as well as reduced expression (-49%) of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Regarding fatty acid metabolism, SED showed decreased activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1)(-51%) and CPT2 (-44%) as well as decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (-35%). Metabolomics analysis also confirmed downregulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) identified distinct metabolic phenotypes through intermediates of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Further, we found significant differences in cardiolipin (CL) species expression between SED and AC groups, which, due to the important role of CL in mitochondrial structure, function, biogenesis and bioenergetics, deserves further attention.

Exercise studies also showed significant differences in substrate utilization between groups where SED possessed a significantly lower fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity. The correlation of different bioenergetic parameters between resting and exercise conditions were robust, suggesting the possibility of performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) as a non-invasive methodology to indirectly assess metabolic function in multiple populations. In summary, in our study herein, we show that ""healthy sedentary"" individuals already possess a significant decrease in cellular metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics compared to moderately active individuals both during resting and exercising conditions.

Since large numbers of sedentary individuals evolve to develop cardiometabolic disease, a better understanding of decreased cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial function is needed in order to improve both diagnosis and treatment of multiple metabolic diseases.

- Despite similar GLUT-4 concentrations, sedentary individuals show significant decreased pyruvate oxidation as well as expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC).
- During exercise studies, sedentary individuals show significantly decreased levels of fat oxidation and lactate clearance capacity which correlate with mitochondrial and bioenergetics parameters from resting muscle biopsies. Hence, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) accompanied by measuring blood lactate levels could be a practical manner to assess muscle mitochondrial function and bioenergetics in a non-invasive and ambulatory manner.
- Identifying early signatures of decreased mitochondrial function and bioenergetics capacity could be an important approach to prevent or improve different metabolic diseases through lifestyle changes mainly from exercise and nutrition.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

This is revealed by genomic data from over 400 samples across Eurasia. We found over 30 previously undescribed autotetraploid populations in Siberia with a minimum of two separate origins, independent of those previously reported in Central Europe. The establishment of Siberian tetraploids is mediated by meiotic adaptation at the same genes as in European tetraploid A. lyrata and Arabidopsis arenosa, despite high divergence and geographical separation. Haplotype analysis based on synthetic long-read assemblies supports the long-range introgression of adaptive alleles from the tetraploid interspecific pool of European A. lyrata and A. arenosa to tetraploid Siberian A. lyrata. Once evolved, adaptation to polyploidy promotes the establishment of new polyploid lineages through adaptive inter- and intraspecific introgression.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

Extreme publishing behavior was defined as having >60 full articles (original articles, reviews, conference papers) in a single calendar year and indexed in Scopus. We identified 3,191 authors with extreme publishing behavior across science excluding Physics and 12,624 such authors in Physics. While Physics had much higher numbers of extreme publishing authors in the past, in 2022 extreme publishing authors was almost as numerous in non-Physics and Physics disciplines (1,226 vs. 1,480). Excluding Physics, China had the largest number of extreme publishing authors, followed by the USA. The largest fold-wise increases between 2016 and 2022 (5-19-fold) occurred in Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Spain, India, Italy, Russia, Pakistan, and South Korea. Excluding Physics, most extreme publishing authors were in Clinical Medicine, but from 2016 to 2022 the largest relative increases (>6-fold) were seen in Agriculture, Fisheries & Forestry, Biology, and Mathematics and Statistics. Extreme publishing authors accounted for 4,360 of the 10,000 most-cited authors (based on raw citation count) across science. While most Physics authors with extreme publishing behavior had modest citation impact in a composite citation indicator that adjusts for co-authorship and author positions, 67% of authors with extreme publishing behavior in non-Physics fields remained within the top-2% according to that indicator among all authors with >=5 full articles. Extreme publishing behavior has become worryingly common across scientific fields with rapidly increasing rates in some countries and settings and may herald a rapid depreciation of authorship standards.","10.1007/s11192-024-05117-w","biorxiv",1724969330862

Genes encoding many of these weapons can be transmitted horizontally, but the impact on bacterial warfare is not understood. Here, we develop an ecological model of bacterial warfare where there is potential for horizontal gene transfer. Our model predicts that weapon gene transfer from an attacker to a target strain is possible, but at a low rate such that transfer has a negligible impact on competition outcomes. We tested the model empirically using a transmissible plasmid encoding colicin E2, a potent antibacterial toxin produced by Escherichia coli. As predicted by the model, we find that toxin plasmid transfer is feasible during warfare, but the resulting transconjugants remain rare. However, exploring the model further reveals realistic conditions where transfer has major impacts. Specifically, the model predicts that whenever competing strains have access to some unique nutrients, transconjugants can proliferate and reach high abundances. In support of these predictions, short- and long-term experiments show that transconjugants can thrive when nutrient competition is relaxed. Our work shows how horizontal gene transfer can reshape bacterial warfare in a way that can benefit a weapon gene but not the bacteria that carries it.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

However, fundamental questions about the causes and consequences of L1 activity in cancer genomes remain unresolved, primarily due to the limitations of short-read sequencing technologies. Here, we employ multiplatform sequencing, with an emphasis on long reads, to analyse a fine selection of 10 tumours exhibiting high rates of somatic retrotransposition, encompassing over 6000 events. The analysis of L1 locus-specific single-nucleotide variants reveals a novel panorama of L1 loci activity. Furthermore, examination of the internal structure of somatic L1s uncovers the mechanisms behind their inactivation. A hidden landscape of chromosomal aberrations emerges in the light of long reads, where reciprocal translocations mediated by L1 insertion represent frequent events. Resolution of L1 bridges configuration elucidates the mechanisms of their formation, where typically two independent, but synchronous, somatic L1 insertions drive the reciprocal exchange between non-homologous chromosomes. Timing analyses indicate that L1 retrotransposition is an early driver of chromosomal instability, active before the first whole-genome doubling event. Overall, these findings highlight L1 activity as a more significant contributor to tumour genome plasticity than previously recognized, extending its impact beyond simple insertional mutagenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

We analysed the Y-chromosome Short Tandem Repeats haplotypes from 8153 males from India and Eurasia to explore the impact of Holocene migration on the Indian gene pool. We used haplotype variation and date estimates to understand the characteristics of each haplogroup with respect to the different grouping models. Our findings show that the Neolithic agricultural expansion has had a strong influence in shaping the male gene pool of the Indian subcontinent. Haplogroups F, L and R1a contribute greatly towards stratifying Indian populations as hunter-gatherer related, farming-related and priestly groups respectively. Although the caste system enforced endogamy, a traditional occupation based admixture existed since the Neolithic times. Dispersal of haplogroup L from the Near East played a major role in the formation of an agriculturist population that formed an intermediary between the primitive tribes and the R1a-rich priestly group.

They are involved in the biosynthesis of primary and specialized metabolites, including salicylic acid (SA), a key defense phytohormone synthesized via the conserved chorismate biosynthetic pathway. However, the identity of the signal(s) that ultimately triggers SA induction in chloroplasts upon perception of a biotic threat has remained elusive. Here, we provide evidence of a functional link between chloroplast-derived reactive oxygen species (cROS) and SA production. We observe that inhibiting ROS bursts generated from photosystem II during plant immune activation completely abrogates the induction of SA synthesis in response to immunity-inducing signals, without affecting SA-independent immune responses. Indeed, time course analyses show that the induction of SA marker genes parallels that of cROS production during an immune response. Consistent with this, preventing cROS induction is sufficient to nullify the immune protection normally conferred by activating immunity prior to an infection. Analyses of transcriptomes and photosynthetic efficiency show that two conserved effectors from the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae, HopM1 and AvrE1, redundantly disrupt photosynthesis and cROS bursts. These effects reduce SA accumulation and are mediated via the impact of HopM1 and AvrE1 in inducting host abscisic acid signaling. Our results suggest that a change in chloroplastic redox homeostasis induced by biotic stressors acts as an initiator of plant immunity through the production of SA, and that this response is targeted by conserved pathogen effector proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

However, the vast complexity of regulatory DNA impedes the identification of the underlying cis-regulatory rules. Here, we have characterized 62,126 fully synthetic DNA sequences to bottom-up dissect design principles of cell-state specific enhancers in the context of the differentiation of blood stem cells to seven myeloid lineages. Focusing on binding sites for 38 TFs and their pairwise interactions, we found that identical sites displayed both repressive and activating function, as a consequence of cellular context, site combinatorics, or simply predicted occupancy of a TF on an enhancer. Surprisingly, we found that combinations of activating sites frequently neutralized each other or even gained repressive function. These negative synergies convert quantitative imbalances in transcription factor expression into binary downstream activity patterns, a principle that can be exploited to build differentiation-state specific enhancers from scratch.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

A central question is how individual subunits within these complexes can evolve novel functions while maintaining the integrity of the original assembly. Here, we explore this question by tracing the evolutionary trajectory of the plant exocyst, an octameric complex essential for exocytosis in eukaryotes. Remarkably, the Exo70 subunit underwent dramatic expansion and functional divergence in plants. We demonstrate that electrostatic alterations in the N-terminal region of the Exo70 subunit precipitated its dissociation from the exocyst complex. This release mitigated paralog interference, thereby facilitating the subunits extensive functional co-option. Our findings reveal a nuanced mechanism by which a protein subunit, ancestrally constrained within a multimeric complex, can escape those constraints and evolve novel functions, shedding light on the molecular underpinnings of cellular innovation.

These price caps may reduce revenue for the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) that negotiate the actual price paid for medicines in the US. To offset the resulting pressure on their profit margins, it is possible that PBMs would, in turn, increase patients out-of-pocket costs for medicines with capped prices. The model presented here evaluates how such increased out-of-pocket costs for the anticoagulants Eliquis (apixaban) and Xarelto (rivaroxaban) could impact patients financially and clinically.

MethodsCopay distributions for all 2023 prescription fills for Eliquis and Xarelto managed by the three largest PBMs were used to approximate current copay costs. Increased out-of-pocket costs were modeled as a shift of all Eliquis and Xarelto prescriptions to the highest copay tier. The known linear relationship between copay costs and treatment abandonment was used to calculate the potential resulting increase in treatment abandonment. Known rates of morbidity and mortality due to abandoning anticoagulants were used to estimate resulting increases in morbidity and mortality.

ResultsIf the three largest PBMs all shifted costs onto patients by moving all Eliquis and Xarelto prescriptions to the highest formulary tier, Tier 6, patients copay amount would increase by $235 to $482 million for Eliquis and $105 to $206 million for Xarelto. Such an increase could lead to 169,000 to 228,000 patients abandoning Eliquis and 71,000 to 93,000 abandoning Xarelto. The resulting morbidity and mortality could include up to an additional 145,000 major cardiovascular events and up to 97,000 more deaths.

ConclusionThe Medicare Price Negotiation Program could impact patients negatively if it causes PBMs to increase patients out-of-pocket costs for medicines. Policymakers should closely monitor changes in overall affordability, including all patient out-of-pocket expenditures, for medications in the program. Preemptive measures to ensure that the most vulnerable citizens are not placed in precarious situations leading to poorer health outcomes should be considered.","NA","medrxiv",1724969330862

We observed subtelomeric fold structures that facilitate interactions amongst heterochromatinized genes involved in antigenic variation. In addition, we identified long-range intra- and interchromosomal interactions amongst active, stage-specific genes. Both structures are mediated by AP2-P, an ApiAP2 transcription factor, and a putative MORC chromatin remodeler, and functional specificity is achieved via combinatorial binding with other sequence-specific DNA-binding factors.

We investigated how acute enhancer-driven activation affects neighbouring non-target genes within the same TAD. Using single-molecule RNA FISH (smFISH), we tracked the transcription of TFF1 (enhancer-targeted) and TFF3 (non-targeted) during estrogen stimulation. We observed mutually exclusive expression patterns: TFF1 expression peaked at 1 hour, while TFF3 reached its peak at 3 hours, after TFF1s activation had diminished. Chromatin looping data indicated that the enhancer loops with TFF1 but not TFF3, suggesting that TFF3 upregulation is not due to direct enhancer-promoter interactions. CRISPR deletion of the TFF1 enhancer and 1,6-hexanediol (HD) exposure revealed that the TFF1 enhancer:promoter undergo Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS), which sequesters the transcriptional machinery and inhibits TFF3 expression. As estrogen signalling wanes or LLPS is disrupted, TFF1 expression declines while TFF3 expression increases. Our findings reveal that enhancer-driven activation can indirectly influence neighbouring genes, highlighting a dynamic shift in gene expression as signalling progresses.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

However, the identities of RNAs whose localization is regulated by a specific RBP as well as the impacts of that RNA localization on cell function have generally remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the RBP HNRNPA2B1 acts to keep specific RNAs out of neuronal projections. Using subcellular fractionation, high-throughput sequencing, and single molecule RNA FISH, we find that hundreds of RNAs demonstrate markedly increased abundance in neurites in HNRNPA2B1 knockout cells. These RNAs often encode motor proteins and are enriched for known HNRNPA2B1 binding sites and motifs in their 3' UTRs. The speed and processivity of microtubule-based transport is impaired in these cells, specifically in their neurites. HNRNPA2B1 point mutations that increase its cytoplasmic abundance relative to wildtype lead to stronger suppression of RNA mislocalization defects than seen with wildtype HNRNPA2B1. We further find that the subcellular localizations of HNRNPA2B1 target RNAs are sensitive to perturbations of RNA decay machinery, suggesting that it is HNRNPA2B1s known role in regulating RNA stability that may explain these observations. These findings establish HNRNPA2B1 as a negative regulator of neurite RNA abundance and link the subcellular activities of motor proteins with the subcellular abundance of the RNAs that encode them.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

We show that during the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) in the mouse embryo, dynamic changes in mitochondrial activity drive the production of mature HSCs with differing potencies. Lowering mitochondrial activity in the AGM by pharmacological or genetic means activates Wnt signaling to promote HSC expansion. Further, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) gives rise to functional heterogeneity in the definitive HSC pool. In-vitro and in-vivo functional assays, and single-cell transcriptomics on AGM HSCs showed that MMPlow HSCs are myeloid-biased, with enhanced differentiation potential, while MMPhigh HSCs are lymphoid-biased with diminished differentiation potential. Mechanistically, low mitochondrial activity upregulates Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling to promote HSC differentiation.

Here, we show that the POLgamma Y951N disease causing mutation induces replication stalling and severe mtDNA depletion. However, unlike other POLgamma disease causing mutations, Y951N does not directly impair exonuclease activity and only mildly affects polymerase activity. Instead, we found that Y951N compromises the enzymes ability to efficiently toggle between DNA synthesis and degradation, and is thus the first patient-derived mutation with impaired polymerase-exonuclease switching. These findings provide new insights into the intramolecular switch when POLgamma proofreads the newly-synthesized DNA strand, and reveal a new mechanism for causing mitochondrial DNA instability.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

Here, we performed a genomic analysis of 11,635 gliomas across ages and found that 4.5% of all gliomas harbor FGFR alterations including structural variants (SV) and single nucleotide variants (SNV), with an incidence of almost 10% in pediatric gliomas. FGFR family members are differentially enriched by age, tumor grade, and histological subtype, with FGFR1-alterations associated with glioneuronal histologies and pediatric low-grade gliomas. Across development, we find FGFR1 expression in both neuronal and glial precursors, while FGFR3 expression is largely restricted to astrocytic lineages. Leveraging novel isogenic model systems, we confirm FGFR1 alterations to be sufficient to activate MAPK and mTOR signaling, drive gliomagenesis, activate neuronal transcriptional programs and exhibit sensitivity to MAPK pathway inhibitors, including pan-FGFR inhibitors. Models driven by FGFR1 SVs exhibited different patterns of sensitivity compared to those driven by SNVs. Finally, we performed a retrospective analysis of clinical responses in children diagnosed with FGFR-driven gliomas and found that targeted MAPK or FGFR-inhibition with currently available inhibitors is largely associated with stability of disease. This study provides key insights into the biology of FGFR1-altered gliomas, therapeutic strategies to target them and associated challenges that still need to be overcome.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

Existing theoretical models have suggested the maintenance of a four-chromosome equilibrium (with driving and standard X and suppressing and susceptible Y) in a cyclic dynamic, studies of natural populations have failed to capture this pattern. Although there are several plausible explanations for this lack of cycling, interference from autosomal suppressors has not been studied using a theoretical population genetic framework even though autosomal suppressors and Y-linked suppressors coexist in natural populations of some species. In this study, we use a simulation-based approach to investigate the influence of autosomal suppressors on the cycling of sex chromosomes. Our findings demonstrate that the presence of an autosomal suppressor can hinder the invasion of a Y-linked suppressor under some parameter space, thereby impeding the cyclic dynamics, or even the invasion of Y-linked suppression. Even when a Y-linked suppressor invades, the presence of an autosomal suppressor can prevent cycling. Our study demonstrates the potential role of autosomal suppressors in preventing sex chromosome cycling and provides insights into the conditions and consequences of maintaining both Y-linked and autosomal suppressors.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

We engineered FoF1 to form multiple peripheral stalks, each bound to a proton-conducting a-subunit.

Here, we developed a synchronized ER-to-LD protein-trafficking assay and combined it with MINFLUX- and HILO-based single-molecule tracking and machine-learning analysis. Trafficking of a model protein LiveDrop between the ER and LDs occurs by diffusion through seipin-associated ER-LD membrane bridges that allow bidirectional protein movement. Unexpectedly, LiveDrop moves with the same apparent diffusion coefficient in the ER and LDs, but becomes molecularly confined at LD surfaces through a mechanism requiring its tryptophan residues. These data show how a specific LD-targeting membrane sequence leads to confined motion and LD protein accumulation, and directly demonstrate intra-organellar protein trafficking through membrane contact sites.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

Salt stress exacerbates high light stress in cyanobacteria and leads to severe yield losses in crop plants. Genetic traits that confer salt tolerance without compromising photosynthetic performance are essential for improving photosynthesis under these conditions. Here we applied accelerated evolution in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 by conditionally suppressing its methyl-directed mismatch repair system to obtain beneficial genetic traits for enhanced photosynthesis under salt stress. Screening over 10,000 mutants, we isolated eight strains with increased biomass or sucrose productivity under salt stress. Genome sequencing revealed an average of 8-20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or indels per genome. Notably, mutations in the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center D1 gene, resulting in the amino acid changes L353F, I358N, and H359N at the carboxyl terminus of the pre-D1 (pD1) protein, improve photosynthesis under salt and combined salt and light stress by potentially accelerating D1 maturation during PSII repair. Phylogenetic analysis of pD1 across cyanobacteria and red algae highlights the broad significance of these adaptive genetic traits, underscoring the importance of leveraging evolutionary insights to improve photosynthesis under stress or fluctuating environments.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

The current model proposes that MDA5 nucleoprotein filament assembly-disassembly dynamics regulates long dsRNA recognition and signaling. We show that MDA5 preferentially loads onto dsRNA via a 3' recessed end and uses ATP hydrolysis to translocate towards the 5'-end until obstructed, such as by another MDA5 on the opposite strand. Multiple MDA5 monomers accumulate at the blockade, forming a partial filament that extrudes the associated RNA in single-stranded loops and thereby compacting the MDA5-RNA complex. The compacted state is further stabilized by oligomerization of the MDA5's caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and can withstand significant forces, offering an alternative intermediate in the activation of MDA5-dependent innate immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

Gain-of-function research restrictions preclude assessing human adapting mutations of 2.3.4.4b H5N1. Here, we tracked the evolution of 2.3.4.4b H5N1 that infected non-human mammals and evaluated their ability to gain human adaptations. The non-human mammal 2.3.4.4b H5N1 partly acquired classical human adapting mutations, which are identical to the residues of H1N1pdm09 and seasonal human H3N2 infections while showing a few species-specific adaptations that might be potential barriers for successful human adaptations. Despite minimal changes in Hemagglutinin (HA), A160T and T199I mutations near the receptor binding site of HA in dairy cattle viruses indicate the rapid HA glycan surface evolution affecting virus entry and immune evasion. The quantitative assessment indicated that 2.3.4.4b H5N1 circulating in bears, cattle, dolphins, and foxes show higher human adaptive potential than other hosts. Also, H5N1 infections in mammals across time showed a unique set of adaptations in the 2.3.4.4b clade compared to previously circulating strains, especially the acquisition of Q591 adaptation in PB2 that enables human adaptation. Thus, 2.3.4.4b H5N1 acquires human adaptations due to natural selection pressure in non-human mammals. Overall, our study delineates human adaptation and infection risk of specific non-human mammalian circulating HPAI 2.3.4.4b H5N1 strains.

The tumor microtubes accelerate this process as the microtubes provide orientational guidance from the untreated tissue into the lesion.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

In capturing EMT states, we achieved an average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) of 90% across multiple cancer types.

Prior modeling approaches have accounted for the adaptive immune systems role in combating tumors, which has led to the development of stochastic models that explain cancer immunoediting and tumor-immune co-evolution. However, cancer immunemediated dormancy, wherein the adaptive immune system maintains a micrometastatic population by keeping its growth in check, remains poorly understood. Immune-mediated dormancy can significantly delay the emergence (and therefore detection) of metastasis. An improved quantitative understanding of this process will thereby improve our ability to identify and treat cancer during the micrometastatic period. Here, we introduce a generalized stochastic model that incorporates the dynamic effects of immunomodulation within the tumor microenvironment on T cell-mediated cancer killing. This broad class of nonlinear birth-death model can account for a variety of cytotoxic T cell immunosuppressive effects, including regulatory T cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. We develop analytic expressions for the likelihood and mean time of immune escape. We also develop a method for identifying a corresponding diffusion approximation applicable to estimating population dynamics across a wide range of nonlinear birth-death processes. Lastly, we apply our model to estimate the nature and extent of immunomodulation that best explains the timing of disease recurrence in bladder and breast cancer patients. Our findings quantify the effects that stochastic tumor-immune interaction dynamics can play in the timing and likelihood of disease progression. Our analytical approximations provide a method of studying population escape in other ecological contexts involving nonlinear transition rates.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

GNAL encodes Golf, a heterotrimeric G-protein  subunit with a defined molecular function to increase the production of the second messenger cAMP. Golf is abundant in the striatum, and is the only stimulatory G-protein in many cell types of the striatum. Due to the defined molecular signaling pathway and expression pattern of Golf, the clear genetic link to dystonia makes GNAL an exciting target to understand the pathological mechanisms of not only this genetic dystonia, but also the larger idiopathic disease. To better understand GNAL-linked dystonia, we generated a novel genetic mouse model that allows us to conditionally knock out Gnal in a site and time-specific manner. In the current study we used genetic or AAV based approaches to express Cre to knockout striatal Gnal in our novel Gnal fl/fl model. We then performed motor behavioral testing and ex vivo whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology of striatal spiny projection neurons to interrogate how loss of Gnal leads to dystonia. Mice with conditional striatal knockout of Gnal show hindlimb clasping, other dystonia-like postures, less motor coordination, slowness, and torticollis as compared to age-matched controls. Furthermore, striatal spiny projection neurons show increased excitability in Gnal knockout animals. These exciting data are the first to report uninduced, overt dystonia in a mouse model of GNAL-linked dystonia, and directly correlate these with changes in spiny projection neuron electrophysiological properties. Our results show that adult loss of Gnal in the striatum leads to the development of dystonia, through homeostatic, paradoxical increases in spiny projection neuron excitability, and suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at decreasing this hyperexcitable phenotype may provide symptomatic relief for patients with disease.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

Unfortunately, this technique has remained largely inaccessible at 7T, due to prohibitive cross-modal interference effects and physical constraints. Here, we developed a first-of-its-kind EEG-fMRI acquisition framework on a clinical 7T system combining key improvements from previous works: compact EEG transmission chain to reduce artifact incidence, reference sensors for artifact correction, and adapted leads for compatibility with a dense radiofrequency receive-array allowing state-of-the-art fMRI sensitivity and acceleration. Two implementations were tested: one using an EEG cap adapted in-house, and another using a recently-designed prototype from an industrial manufacturer, intended to be further developed into a commercial product accessible to the broader community. A comprehensive evaluation in humans showed that simultaneous acquisitions, including with sub-millimeter fMRI resolution, could be conducted without detectable safety issues or major practical constraints. The EEG exerted relatively mild perturbations on fMRI quality (6-11% loss in temporal SNR), without measurably affecting the detection of resting-state networks and visual responses. The artifacts induced on EEG could be corrected to a degree where the spatial, spectral and temporal characteristics were comparable to outside recordings, and hallmark features such as resting-state alpha and eyes-closing alpha modulation could be clearly detected.

Most of the Acrs characterized to date are stable stoichiometric inhibitors, and while enzymatic Acrs have been characterized biochemically, little is known about their potency, specificity, and reversibility. Here, we examine AcrIF11, a widespread phage and plasmid-encoded ADP-ribosyltransferase (ART) that inhibits the Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system. We present an NMR structure of an AcrIF11 homolog that reveals chemical shift perturbations consistent with NAD (cofactor) binding. In experiments that model both lytic phage replication and MGE/lysogen stability under high targeting pressure, AcrIF11 is a highly potent CRISPR-Cas inhibitor and more robust to Cas protein level fluctuations than stoichiometric inhibitors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AcrIF11 is remarkably specific, predominantly ADP-ribosylating Csy1 when expressed in P. aeruginosa. Given the reversible nature of ADP-ribosylation, we hypothesized that ADPr eraser enzymes (macrodomains) could remove ADPr from Csy1, a potential limitation of PTM-based CRISPR inhibition. We demonstrate that diverse macrodomains can indeed remove the modification from Csy1 in P. aeruginosa lysate. Together, these experiments connect the in vitro observations of AcrIF11s enzymatic activity to its potent and specific effects in vivo, clarifying the advantages and drawbacks of enzymatic Acrs in the evolutionary arms race between phages and bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

Post colonization, the Faroese people have been largely isolated from admixture with mainland and other island populations in the region. As such, the initial founder effect and subsequent genetic drift are likely major contributors to the modern genetic diversity found among the Faroese. In this study, we assess the utility of Y-chromosomal microsatellites to detect founder effect in the Faroe Islands through the construction of haplotype networks and a novel empirical method, mutational distance from modal haplotype histograms (MDM), for the visualization and evaluation of population bottlenecks. We compared samples from the Faroe Islands and Iceland to possible regional source populations and documented a loss of diversity associated with founder events. Additionally, within-haplogroup diversity statistics reveals lower haplotype diversity and richness within both the Faroe Islands and Iceland, consistent with a small founder population colonizing both regions. However, in the within-haplogroup networks, the Faroe Islands are found within the larger set of potential source populations while Iceland is consistently found on isolated branches. Moreover, comparisons of within-haplogroup MDM histograms document a clear founder signal in the Faroes and Iceland, but the strength of this signal is haplogroup-dependent which may be indicative of more recent admixture or other demographic processes. The results of the current study and lack of conformity between Icelandic and Faroese haplotypes implies that the two populations were founded by different paternal gene pools and there is no detectable post-founder admixture between the two groups.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

Multiple ribosome-hibernation factors have been identified in all domains of life, but due to their structural diversity and the lack of a common inactivation mechanism, it is currently unknown how many different hibernation factors exist. Here, we show that the YqjD/ElaB/YgaM paralogs, initially discovered as membrane-bound ribosome binding proteins in E. coli, constitute an abundant class of ribosome-hibernating proteins, which are conserved across all proteobacteria and some other bacterial phyla. Our data demonstrate that they inhibit in vitro protein synthesis by interacting with the 50S ribosomal subunit. In vivo cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry reveals their specific interactions with proteins surrounding the ribosomal tunnel exit and even their penetration into the ribosomal tunnel. Thus, YqjD/ElaB/YgaM inhibit translation by blocking the ribosomal tunnel and thus mimic the activity of antimicrobial peptides and macrolide antibiotics.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

Just as attention can shift externally towards relevant objects in the visual environment, attention can shift internally towards (i.e., prioritize) VWM content that is relevant for upcoming tasks. Internal and external attentional selection share a number of key neural and functional characteristics, which include their spatial organization: recent work has shown that spatial attention is directed towards the previous location of a prioritized memory item, similar to how a perceived stimulus is prioritized. Attending stimuli that are physically present is useful, as it enhances processing of the relevant visual input. When prioritizing items in memory, however, attending the prior stimulus location cannot serve this purpose, as there is no visual input to enhance. Here, we address this apparent contradiction which highlights the gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying external and internal visual attention. In two EEG experiments, we compare location-specific sensory enhancement during the attentional selection of external (perceived) as compared to internal (memorized) stimuli. During both internal and external selection we observed a lateralization of alpha oscillations and gaze position bias toward the previous locations of prioritized items, confirming earlier findings that suggested an inherent spatial organization within VWM. Critically, using Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT), we show that sensory enhancement at the attended location is only observed during external attentional selection of (perceived) stimuli. No such location-specific sensory enhancement was observed during attentional selection of items in VWM. Furthermore, we found no clear relationship across trials between alpha lateralization and sensory enhancement (measured through RIFT) during external attention, suggesting that these two metrics indeed reflect distinct cognitive mechanisms. In sum, using a novel combination of EEG and RIFT, we demonstrate a fundamental distinction between the neural mechanisms underlying the selection of perceived and memorized objects. Both types of selection operate within a spatial reference frame, but only external selection modulates early sensory processing. Our findings suggest that the visual system is not vestigially recruiting existing mechanisms of external attention for prioritization in VWM, but is instead using space as an organizational principle to store and select items in VWM.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

Plankton research is often approached using either optical methods, especially for taxonomic purposes, or genomics, which excels at describing the biochemistry of microbial communities. This technological dichotomy hampers efforts to link the morpho-optical properties of each species with its genetic and biomolecular makeup, leading to fragmented information and limited reproducibility. Methods to simultaneously acquire multimodal, i.e. optical and genetic, information on planktonic organisms would provide a connection between organismal appearance and function, improve taxonomic prediction, and strengthen ecological analysis. Here we present Ukiyo-e-Seq, an approach to generate paired optical and transcriptomic data from individual eukaryotic plankton. We performed Ukiyo-e-Seq on 66 microscopic organisms from Coogee, NSW, Australia and assembled transcriptomic contigs using a merge-split strategy. While overall phylogenetic heterogeneity spanned hundreds of taxa, diversity in individual wells was low, enabling accurate classification of both microbial plankton and marine larvae. We then combined Ukiyo-e-Seq with AlphaFold 3, a protein language model, and could confidently infer (i) the joint structure and interactions of 34 photosynthesis proteins from a single Chaetoceros diatom, and (ii) the cellular and developmental functions of novel proteins highly expressed in one trout larva. In summary, Ukiyo-e-Seq is a precise tool to connect morphological and genetic information of eukaryotic plankton.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

Despite decades of work, endogenous regulatory mechanisms that differentiate between de novo deposition and recycling activities of HIRA are still unknown. Here, we have investigated the pivotal role of HIRA de-/acetylation in regulating its function. Our results unequivocally establish function separation effects of acetyl and deacetyl mimic mutations of lysine-600, vis-a-vis de novo deposition or recycling of H3.3, respectively. Importantly, we demonstrate that HIRA deacetylation-dependent biased H3.3 recycling determines transcriptional output, possibly through preferential enrichment of H3.3-K36me3. Besides unraveling tunable regulatory mechanism that governs HIRA function, we illustrate a causal link between the chaperone activity, biased recruitment of pre-existing histones, and gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

Despite numerous methods proposed in recent years, a systematic understanding of the best solution is still lacking.

ResultsHere, we systematically evaluate 47 highly variable gene (HVG) selection methods, consisting of 21 baseline methods developed based on different data transformations and mean-variance adjustment techniques and 26 hybrid methods developed based on mixtures of baseline methods. Across 19 diverse benchmark datasets, 18 objective evaluation criteria per method, and 5,358 analysis settings, we observe that no single baseline method consistently outperforms the others across all datasets and criteria. However, hybrid methods as a group robustly outperform individual baseline methods. Based on these findings, a new HVG selection approach, mixture HVG selection (mixHVG), that incorporates top-ranked features from multiple baseline methods is proposed as a better solution to HVG selection. An open source R package mixhvg is developed to enable convenient use of mixHVG and its integration into users data analysis pipelines.

ConclusionOur benchmark study not only provides a systematic comparison of existing methods, leading to a better HVG selection solution, but also creates a pipeline and resource consisting of diverse benchmark data and criteria for evaluating new methods in the future.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

However, the interpretation of density maps is challenging, and cognitive bias can sometimes mislead investigators into modeling fictitious compounds. Ligand identification can be aided by automatic methods, but existing approaches are available only for X-ray diffraction and are based on iterative fitting or feature-engineered machine learning rather than end-to-end deep learning. Here, we propose to identify ligands using a deep learning approach that treats density maps as 3D point clouds. We show that the proposed model is on par with existing machine learning methods for X-ray crystallography while also being applicable to cryoEM density maps. Our study demonstrates that electron density map fragments can be used to train models that can be applied to cryoEM structures, but also highlights challenges associated with the standardization of electron microscopy maps and the quality assessment of cryoEM ligands.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

However, the properties and structure of DNA constructs are greatly altered in vivo due to spontaneous protein adsorption from biofluids. These adsorbed proteins, referred to as the protein corona, remain challenging to control or predict, and subsequently, their functionality and fate in vivo are difficult to engineer.

We identified protein characteristics important for their adsorption to DNA nanostructures and developed a machine-learning model that predicts which proteins will be enriched on a DNA nanostructure based on the DNA structures design features and protein properties.

Utilising the Multipad Agarose Plate (MAP), we monitor the growth rate and cell morphology of three clinically relevant species (E.coli, S.aureus and P.aeruginosa) after exposure to 11 different concentrations of 13 antibiotics (for a total of 24 microbe-antibiotic combinations). As the drug dose approaches the MIC and regardless of the mode of action, our results show a consistent increase in growth rate heterogeneity. Remarkably, drugs that affect protein synthesis consistently show the opposite trend, reducing heterogeneity. We hypothesize that growth rate heterogeneity under antibiotic treatment might therefore depend on the functional distance of the target from ribosomal activity, which is key in determining growth rate. Low heterogeneity is desirable from a clinical perspective, as the opposite is often associated to persistence and antibiotic survival. For all of the antibiotics and species tested, we also find a striking and non-trivial correlation between morphological alterations and growth inhibition. This observation allows us to introduce a new morphological parameter, MOR50, that enables the estimation of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) with a single snapshot after 2.5 hours of incubation.

Herein, we focused on Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a major postsynaptic protein that undergoes various forms of LLPS with other postsynaptic proteins, and present a minimalistic computational model that reproduces these forms of LLPS, including a form of two-phase condensates, phase-in-phase (PIP) organization. Analyses of this model revealed that the competitive binding of two types of client proteins is required for the PIP formation. The PIP only formed when CaMKII had high valency and a short linker length. Such CaMKII proteins exhibited a low surface tension, a modular structure, and slow diffusion. These properties are consistent with the functions required by CaMKII to store information at the synaptic level.

T cells, in particular, leverage their unique T cell receptors (TCRs) to detect specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-presented peptides. TCR activation is then relayed via linker for activation of T cells (LAT), a TCR-proximal disordered adapter protein, which organizes protein partners and mediates the propagation of signals down diverse pathways including NFAT and AP-1. Here, we studied how balanced downstream pathway activation is encoded in the amino acid sequence of LAT. To comprehensively profile the sequence-function relationship of LAT, we developed a pooled, single-cell, high-content screening approach in which a large series of mutants in the LAT protein were analyzed to characterize their effects on T cell activation. Measuring epigenetic, transcriptomic, and cell surface protein dynamics of single cells harboring distinct LAT mutants, we found functional regions spanning over 40% of the LAT amino acid sequence. Conserved sequence motifs for protein interactions along with charge distribution are critical sequence features, and contribute to interpretation of human genetic variation in LAT. While mutant defect severity spans from moderate to complete loss of function, nearly all defective mutants, irrespective of their position in LAT, confer balanced defects across all downstream pathways. To understand the molecular basis for this observation, we performed proximal protein labeling which demonstrated that disruption of LAT interaction with a single partner protein indirectly disrupts other partner interactions, likely through the dual roles of these proteins as effectors of downstream pathways and bridging factors between LAT molecules.

The regulatory logic of differentiation includes factors specific to one or multiple cell types, functioning in a combinatorial fashion. Classic approaches of GRN discovery used perturbational data to elucidate TF-TG links, but are laborious and not scalable across the tree of life. Single cell transcriptomics has emerged as a revolutionary approach to study gene expression with cell type resolution, but incorporating perturbational data is challenging. Planarians, with their pluripotent neoblast stem cells continuously giving rise to all cell types, offer an ideal model to attempt this integration. Despite extensive single cell transcriptomic studies, the transcriptional and chromatin regulation at the cell type level remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the regulatory logic of planarian stem cell differentiation by obtaining an organism-level integration of single cell transcriptomics and single cell accessibility data. We identify specific open chromatin profiles for major differentiated cell types and analyse their transcriptomic landscape, revealing distinct gene modules expressed in individual types and combinations of them. Integrated analysis unveils gene networks reflecting known TF interactions in each type and identifies TFs potentially driving differentiation across multiple cell types. To validate our predictions, we combined TF knockdown RNAi experiments with single cell transcriptomics. We focus on hnf4, a TF known to be expressed in gut phagocytes, and confirm its influence on other types, including parenchymal cells. Our results demonstrate high overlap between predicted targets and experimentally-validated differentially-regulated genes. Overall, our study integrates TFs, TGs and OCRs to reveal the regulatory logic of planarian stem cell differentiation, showcasing that the combination of single cell methods and perturbational studies will be key for characterising GRNs widely.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

Here, we investigate the cellular evolution of the hypothalamic medial preoptic area (MPOA), a brain region that plays a critical role in social behavior, across two sister species of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus and P. polionotus) with divergent social systems. These two species exhibit large differences in mating and parental care behavior across species and sex. Using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, we build a cellular atlas of the MPOA for males and females of both Peromyscus species. We identify four cell types that are differentially abundant across species, two of which may account for species differences in parental care behavior. Our data further implicate two sex-biased cell types to be important for the evolution of sex-specific behavior. Finally, we show a remarkable reduction of sex-biased gene expression in P. polionotus, a monogamous species that also exhibits reduced sexual dimorphism in parental care behavior. Our MPOA atlas is a powerful resource to investigate how molecular neuronal traits may be evolving to give rise to innate differences in social behavior across animal species.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

Four AFP types have convergently evolved in several fish lineages. AFPs inhibit ice crystal growth and lower cellular freezing point. In lineages with AFPs, species inhabiting colder environments may possess more AFP copies. Elucidating how differences in AFP copy number evolve is challenging due to the genes tandem array structure and consequently poor resolution of these repetitive regions. Here we explore the evolution of type III AFPs (AFP III) in the globally distributed suborder Zoarcoidei, leveraging six new long-read genome assemblies. Zoarcoidei has fewer genomic resources relative to other polar fish clades while it is one of the few groups of fishes adapted to both the Arctic and Southern Oceans. Combining these new assemblies with additional long-read genomes available for Zoarcoidei, we conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic test of AFP III evolution and modeled the effects of thermal habitat and depth on AFP III gene family evolution. We confirm a single origin of AFP III via neofunctionalization of the enzyme sialic acid synthase B and show that AFP gains and losses were not only correlated with temperature, but also with depth, which reduces freezing point via pressure. Associations between the environment and AFP III copy number were driven by duplications of paralogs that were translocated out of the ancestral locus at which Zoarcoidei AFP arose. Our results reveal novel environmental effects on AFP evolution and demonstrate the value of high-quality genomic resources for studying how structural genomic variation shapes convergent adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

However, a common confusion lies in equating the protein structure prediction problem with the protein folding problem. The former provides a static structure, while the latter explains the dynamic folding pathway to that structure. We challenge the current status quo and advocate that AF2 has indeed learned some protein folding prin- ciples, despite being designed for structure prediction. AF2s high-dimensional parameters encode an imperfect biophysical scoring function. Typically, AF2 uses multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to guide the search within a narrow re- gion of its learned surface. In our study, we operate AF2 without MSAs or initial templates, forcing it to sample its entire energy landscape -- more akin to an ab initio approach. Among over 7,000 proteins, a fraction fold using sequence alone, highlighting the smoothness of AF2s learned energy surface. Additionally, by combining recycling and iterative predictions, we discover multiple AF2 interme- diate structures in good agreement with known experimental data. AF2 appears to follow a ""local first, global later"" folding mechanism. For designed proteins with more optimized local interactions, AF2s energy landscape is too smooth to detect intermediates even when it should. Our current work sheds new light on what AF2 has learned and opens exciting possibilities to advance our understanding of protein folding and for experimental discovery of folding intermediates.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

Influenzaviruses have been studied mainly in birds but minor in bats. It is unknown whether Chiroptera are reservoirs of influenza viruses. However, circulation in bats showed molecular divergence from H17N10 (Guatemala) and H18N11 (Peru), and they were designated as new subtypes. The study aimed to characterize the influenza A virus detected in the fishing bat Noctilio albiventris. A surveillance study of pathogens of public health interest was carried out; rectal samples were taken from four fishing bats (N. albiventris) captured in Talaigua Nuevo, Bolivar, Colombia. The samples were sequenced by NGS using DNBseq (MGI-G50(R)) and analyzed with bioinformatics tools. Eight viral contigs associated with the Orthomyxoviridae family were obtained. The identified segments showed around 90% similarity with H18N11, except for the neuraminidase (N). The phylogenetic analysis of the N protein showed the appearance of a basal branch to the N11 subtype, and the molecular clock indicates that it does not share a recent common ancestor. 3D modeling indicates that the N protein of N. albiventris presents three mutations (K363R, T242K, and I139V) near the hypothetical active site of the protein. These mutations potentially increase the interaction with the HLA-DR of bats, which could have significant implications for the viruss behavior. The phylogenetic, evolutionary, and antigenic divergence of the N protein of N. albiventris suggests a new subtype called H18N12. Its role as a pathogen must be studied.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

A defining feature of GBM is the existence of spatially and functionally distinct cellular niches, i.e. a hypoxic niche, a leading-edge niche, and a perivascular niche, in which malignant cells engage in paracrine crosstalk with cell types comprising the tumor microenvironment. Here, by analysis of single cell transcriptomic data of human GBM and transgenic mouse models of GBM, we unexpectedly identified pericytes, mural cells intimately associated with the endothelium, as the most active paracrine signaling hub within the tumor parenchyma. Exclusive signaling axes emanating from pericytes were received by endothelial cells, malignant cells, astrocytes, and immune cells. Depletion of pericytes through genetic engineering in several different transgenic and orthotopic mouse models of GBM demonstrated accelerated tumor progression, a disrupted blood brain-barrier, and premature death of pericyte poor mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that pericyte deficiency altered the cellular composition of GBM, remodeled the endothelium, and impacted on the immune cell landscape, exacerbating tumor cell invasion and immune suppression. Specifically, endothelial cells deprived of pericyte association altered their signaling programs, which in turn attracted perivascular, tumor-associated macrophages polarized towards an immunesuppressive phenotype. The recruited macrophages expressed Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), which reinforced activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase MET on GBM cells harboring an extreme mesenchymal subtype driven by the key phenotypic regulator Fosl1 within hypoxic regions. Indeed, orthotopic implantation of isolated, MET-expressing GBM cells corroborated their superior tumor-initiating capability and invasive phenotype. In patients, low expression of a pericyte core gene signature was reduced in recurrent GBM, compared to primary tumors. Consistently, gene signatures for transcriptional programs of Fosl1+Met+ GBM cells were indicative of poor survival in human tumors, and spatial transcriptomics corroborated their superior invasive capacity. Taken together, we infer that the pericyte represents a critical modulator of GBM development by orchestrating a tumor-suppressive microenvironment; our findings thus highlight the importance of pericyte preservation in the face of current and future GBM therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

In the prevailing model, these properties are determined by the outer core, which acts as a mechanical filter limiting static and low-frequency stimuli from reaching the afferent terminal--the sole site of touch detection in corpuscles. Here, we determine the detailed 3D architecture of corpuscular components and reveal their contribution to touch detection. We show that the outer core is dispensable for rapid adaptation and frequency tuning. Instead, these properties arise from the inner core, composed of gap junction-coupled lamellar Schwann cells (LSCs) surrounding the afferent terminal. By acting as additional touch sensing structures, LSCs potentiate mechanosensitivity of the terminal, which detects touch via fast-inactivating ion channels. We propose a model in which Pacinian corpuscle function is mediated by an interplay between mechanosensitive LSCs and the afferent terminal in the inner core.

The permeability characteristics of the membrane determined several key functions of this network by determining which compounds could enter the compartment and which compounds could not. One key feature of known life is the utilisation of right-handed D- ribose and deoxyribose sugars and left-handed L- amino acid stereochemical isomers (enantiomers), however, it is not clear why life adopted this specific chirality. We previously demonstrated that an archaeal and an intermediate membrane mimic, bearing a mixture of bacterial and archaeal lipid characteristics (a  hybrid membrane), display increased permeability compared to bacterial-like membranes. Here, we investigate if these membranes can drive stereochemical selection on pentose sugars, hexose sugars and amino acids. Using permeability assays of homogenous unilamellar vesicles, we demonstrate that both membranes select for D- ribose and deoxyribose sugars while the hybrid membrane uniquely selects for a reduced alphabet of L- facing amino acids. This repertoire includes alanine, the plausible first L- amino acid utilised. We conclude such compartments could provide stereochemical compound selection thereby demonstrating a solution to the chirality problem during the evolution of life.","NA","biorxiv",1724969330862

All scans sought matches to the same set of 813,194 40-mer nucleotide queries randomly selected from the genome of Sus scrofa (domestic pig). For each of the two study organisms, mean segmental match rates (MSMRs) were then calculated for all segments in each of three categories: those segments occurring on autosomes, those on the X chromosome, and those on the Y chromosome.

ResultsIn scans of single-copy regions (euchromatin) in both their Y chromosomes and their autosomes, it was found that the number of matches to randomly selected porcine queries was higher in humans than in bonobos. When autosomes were compared, matches were 1.3% higher in humans than in bonobos. This figure is equal to the percentage of human autosomal nucleotide positions bearing nucleotides that match in pig but not in bonobo. Remarkably, it agrees with the percentage of autosomal nucleotides previously reported to differ in bonobos and humans. So, the results of this study indicate that essentially all the nucleotide positions that differ in humans and bonobos, are the same in humans and pigs. In addition, the number of matches to pig queries found on the human Y chromosome was 34.5% higher than on the bonobo Y, and 12.4% higher than on the chimpanzee Y (the chimpanzee figure may be the more reliable of the two, since the bonobo Y nucleotide sequence file scanned contained only unlocalized scaffolds).

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1724969330862

The Cox proportional-hazards model and inverse probability of treatment weighting were employed to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs). Among homologous primary-series NVX-CoV2373 versus BNT162b2 recipients, the aHR was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.82-0.91) for all laboratory-confirmed and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.48-1.33) for severe infections. Among homologous 1st-booster recipients, it was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.61-0.90) for all laboratory-confirmed and 0.48 (95% CI: 0.12-1.92) for severe infections. At 30-days post-immunization, we observed homologous, NVX-CoV2373 primary-series and 1st-booster offered added protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection versus BNT162b2; while there was numerically lower risk of severe disease among NVX-CoV2373-vaccinated, no statistically significant differences were observed.","NA","medrxiv",1724969330862

This study compared leading commercial blood tests for amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.

MethodsPlasma samples from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were assayed with AD blood tests from C2N Diagnostics, Fujirebio Diagnostics, ALZPath, Janssen, Roche Diagnostics, and Quanterix. Outcomes measures were amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, cortical thickness, and dementia severity. Logistic regression models assessed the classification accuracies of individual or combined plasma biomarkers for binarized outcomes, and Spearman correlations evaluated continuous relationships between individual plasma biomarkers and continuous outcomes.

ResultsMeasures of plasma p-tau217, either individually or in combination with other plasma biomarkers, had the strongest relationships with all AD outcomes.

DiscussionThis study identified the plasma biomarker analytes and assays that most accurately classified amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1724969330862

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1724969330862
