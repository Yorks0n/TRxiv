JAM generates antibodies de novo in both single-domain (VHH) and paired (scFv/mAb) antibody formats that achieve double-digit nanomolar affinities, strong early-stage developability profiles, and precise epitope targeting without experimental optimization. We demonstrate JAMs capabilities across multiple therapeutic contexts, including the first fully computationally designed antibodies to multipass membrane proteins - Claudin-4 and CXCR7. Against SARS-CoV-2, JAM-designed antibodies achieved sub-nanomolar pseudovirus neutralization potency, with early stage developability metrics achieving established clinical benchmarks. We show that increasing test-time computation by allowing JAM to iteratively introspect on its outputs substantially improves both binding success rates and affinities, representing the first evidence that test-time compute scaling may extend to physical protein design systems. The entire process from design to recombinant characterization requires <6 weeks, and multiple targets can be pursued in parallel with minimal additional experimental overhead. These results establish de novo antibody design as a practical approach for therapeutic discovery, offering paths to both improved efficiency in standard workflows and new opportunities for previously intractable targets.

Functionally and structurally distinct chromatin domains are defined by the so-called histone code, which consists of combinations of post-translational histone modifications deposited by ""code writers"" and recognized by ""code readers."" The primary mark of heterochromatin, trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3), is deposited by histone methyltransferases, such as SetDB1, and serves as a binding platform for readers, most notably HP1 family proteins. Using a reporter system to monitor the dynamics of heterochromatin establishment and maintenance, we demonstrated that transient tethering of HP1 triggers the SetDB1-dependent establishment of stable heterochromatin. This finding indicates the presence of a feedback mechanism wherein the reader of the H3K9me3 mark recruits the writer. We further discovered that the genetic interaction between SetDB1 and HP1 is mirrored by a direct physical interaction. This interaction requires the auto-methylation of two conserved histone mimic motifs located in unstructured regions of SetDB1. HP1 binds these SetDB1 motifs using the same molecular interface it employs to recognize the modified histone tail. Our findings show that SetDB1 auto-methylation is essential for the spreading and stable maintenance of heterochromatin. This includes its roles in processes such as X-chromosome inactivation and the negative feedback regulation of a large gene family encoding KRAB-ZNF transcriptional repressors. Thus, the primary heterochromatin mark is not limited to nucleosomes but is also deployed on the mark's writer itself. This fosters a direct physical interaction between the writer and the reader, ensuring key features of heterochromatin: its spreading to establish extended domains and its stable maintenance through cell divisions.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

Cell competition (CC) is a cell non-autonomous quality control in which ''winner'' cells eliminate viable but suboptimal ''loser'' cells based on their relative difference in fitness. Due to its central role in fitness perception, loss of p53 results in the emergence of ''supercompetitor'' cells, which stand at the apex of cell competition and induce apoptosis in neighboring wild-type (WT) cells. Here, we investigate CC dynamics using mosaic 3D mouse gastruloids, an embryonic stem cell (ESC)-based in vitro model of gastrulation, composed of defined numbers of WT and p53-KO cells. In mosaic gastruloids, even low numbers of p53-KO cells robustly outcompete WT cells, and introduction of as few as two p53-KO cells is sufficient to measurably impair neighboring WT cell growth. CC in gastruloids is independent of cell proliferation rates, nutrient availability, or reactive oxygen species (ROS), and not influenced by Nodal and ERK signaling. However, we observe that Wnt and BMP signaling protect from CC, which is exclusively driven by intrinsic apoptosis, as indicated by Bcl2-mediated complete rescue of WT cells. During gastruloid development, CC is temporally restricted to a window of 48-96 hours after aggregation, mirroring embryonic days E5.5-E7.5 in the mouse. Heterochronic mosaic gastruloid experiments demonstrate that relative differences in pluripotency levels are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause supercompetition, but that CC is contingent on both competitors residing within the developmental window permissive to CC. Neither pluripotent mosaic 3D aggregates, nor 3D EpiGastruloids, which model more advanced developmental processes, display any competition, supporting the hypothesis that developmental CC is specific to the onset of gastrulation. Our findings offer insights into the mechanisms of cell fitness evaluation in mammalian embryogenesis and establish gastruloids as a powerful 3D model for investigating developmental stage-specific cell competition.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

These ssDNA sequences, predominantly isolated from the ""no-hits"" zone with no significant matches in existing genomic databases, exhibit conserved motifs, distinct secondary structural features, and a unique AT-rich composition. These characteristics suggest potential roles in autoreplication, molecular stabilization, and resilience under extreme conditions, consistent with extremophilic adaptations. Notably, this discovery aligns with observations of a provisionally termed New Biological Structure (NBS) detected in diverse contexts, including meteorites and biogenic materials, though its characterization lies beyond the scope of this study.

The sequences were detected using a rigorous methodology that included stringent contamination controls, advanced metagenomic assembly techniques, and exhaustive taxonomic filtering to ensure robustness and minimize false positives. Their consistent detection across meteorites of varying types and geographic origins further underscores the reliability of the findings. Repeat analyses revealed specific motifs associated with potential regulatory or structural roles, while secondary structure predictions suggested configurations that could support autoreplication and stability under extreme conditions.

This groundbreaking discovery highlights the potential of meteorites to harbor previously uncharacterized genomic elements, offering profound insights into molecular diversity, prebiotic chemistry, and molecular evolution. By situating these findings within the broader context of extremophilic biology and astrobiological exploration, this study establishes a foundation for investigating the structural, functional, and evolutionary implications of these sequences. Future research will also explore their relevance as biosignatures in the search for life under extreme and extraterrestrial conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

A proper error analysis for time series data leads to significantly wider confidence intervals than the official evaluation. In addition to vaccination and seasonality, only few NPIs -- such as restrictions in public spaces -- can be confidently associated with variations in R(t), but even then effect sizes have large uncertainties. Furthermore, due to multicollinearity in NPI activation patterns, it is difficult to distinguish potential effects of NPIs in public spaces from other interventions that came into force early, such as physical distancing. %In future, a more careful design of NPIs is required to enable meaningful ex-post evaluation. In future, NPIs should be more carefully designed and accompanied by plans for data collections to allow for a timely evaluation of benefits and harms as a basis for an effective and proportionate response.","NA","medrxiv",1737929229340

However, it is challenging to determine the biological mechanisms underlying most associations, and we lack genome-scale approaches for inferring causal mechanistic pathways from genes to cellular functions to traits. Here we propose new approaches to bridge this gap by combining quantitative estimates of gene-trait relationships from loss-of-function burden tests with gene-regulatory connections inferred from Perturb-seq experiments in relevant cell types. By combining these two forms of data, we aim to build causal graphs in which the directional associations of genes with a trait can be explained by their regulatory effects on biological programs or direct effects on the trait. As a proof-of-concept, we constructed a causal graph of the gene regulatory hierarchy that jointly controls three partially co-regulated blood traits. We propose that perturbation studies in trait-relevant cell types, coupled with gene-level effect sizes for traits, can bridge the gap between genetics and biology.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

While the virus's overall resistance to human polyclonal antibody responses has steadily increased over time, the dynamics by which it escaped individual monoclonal antibodies within these responses have not been thoroughly explored. Recently, a series of studies by Cao et al. used deep mutational scanning (DMS) to identify which mutations allow the Wuhan-Hu-1 receptor-binding domain to escape binding by individual antibodies, doing so for thousands of antibodies. Here, we sought to use these data to retrospectively examine the evolutionary dynamics of escape from a set of 1,603 antibodies. For each antibody, we used the DMS data to predict an antibody-escape score for each of thousands of globally circulating viral sequences from the first 3.5 years of the pandemic, and then computed an escape trajectory that quantifies how the population's average escape score changed over time. We use pseudovirus neutralization data from Cao et al. and Wang et al. to validate common patterns in escape trajectories. While some trajectories increase monotonically over time, others show large fluctuations as a result of clade-displacement events that reduce the frequency of antibody-escape mutations in the viral population. Fitness effects of mutations estimated from natural sequences suggest that the mutations are displaced due to clonal interference. Further, these estimates suggest that the order in which escape mutations arose is shaped by changing selective pressures. Overall, this work helps describe how SARS-CoV-2 evaded the individual components of a polyclonal immune response in nature, and suggests that evasion occurred via complex evolutionary dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

Historical contingencies arise when elements from an organism's past leave lasting effects on the genome, altering the paths available for adaptation. We utilize strains isolated before and after widespread antibiotic use to study the impact of deep historical differences shaped by decades of evolution in varying antibiotic and host pressures. We evaluated these effects by comparing immediate and adaptive responses of two strains of Acinetobacter baumannii to the last-resort antibiotic, tigecycline (TGC). When grown in subinhibitory TGC, the two strains demonstrated divergent transcriptional responses suggesting that baseline transcript levels may dictate global responses to drug and their subsequent evolutionary trajectories. Experimental evolution in TGC revealed clear differences in population-genetic dynamics - with hard sweeps in populations founded by one strain and no mutations reaching fixation in the other strain. Transcriptomes of evolved populations no longer showed signatures of drug response, as was seen in the ancestors, suggesting that genetic adaptation may outweigh preexisting differences in transcriptional networks. Genetically, AMR was acquired through predictable mechanisms of increased efflux and drug target modification; however, the two strains adapted by mutations in different efflux regulators. Fitness tradeoffs of AMR were only observed in lineages evolved from the pre-antibiotic era strain, suggesting that decades of adaptation to antibiotics resulted in preexisting compensatory mechanisms in the more contemporary isolate, an important example of a beneficial effect of historical contingencies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Acinetobacter baumannii is a high priority pathogen often causing multidrug resistant nosocomial infections. Many healthcare systems experience clonal outbreaks of A. baumannii infections, yet treatment strategies are often strain-agnostic, ignoring the importance of strain differences. We show that historical differences between two strains, one isolated prior to widespread antibiotic use and the other following decades of selection to clinical conditions, dictate transcriptional patterns and response to a last-resort antibiotic and influence the genetic and phenotypic routes of resistance adaptation. While our study focuses on two reference strains of A. baumannii, these findings can be more broadly applicable to other pathogenic organisms in which a better understanding of the forces influencing resistance adaptation is essential for combating the antimicrobial resistance crisis.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

Despite recent breakthroughs in protein design and structure prediction, designing biocatalysts with activities rivaling those of natural enzymes remains challenging. Here, we present AI.zymes, a modular platform integrating cutting-edge protein engineering algorithms within an evolutionary framework. By combining programs such as Rosetta, ESMFold, ProteinMPNN, and FieldTools in iterative rounds of design and selection, AI.zymes optimizes a broad range of catalytically relevant properties, such as transition state affinity and protein stability. Notably, AI.zymes can also improve properties that are not targeted by the employed design algorithms. For instance, AI.zymes enhanced electrostatic catalysis by iteratively selecting variants with stronger catalytic electric fields. AI.zymes was benchmarked by improving the promiscuous Kemp eliminase activity of ketosteroid isomerase, yielding a 7.7-fold increase in activity after zero-shot experimental validation of only 7 variants. Due to its modularity, AI.zymes can readily incorporate emerging design algorithms, paving the way for a unifying framework for enzyme design.

NRC proteins are classified as CNL, which contain a coiled-coil (CC) domain in their N-terminal region. Previous studies highlighted the importance of the MADA motif in the first alpha helix of the CC domain for NRC-mediated defense responses. However, how other alpha helices in the CC domain contribute to NRC function remains unclear. In this study, we identified a novel hydrophobic feature localized in the CC domain barrel that contributes to NRC-mediated immunity. We screened the conserved hydrophobic residues among NRCs and identified seven required for NRC4-mediated cell death. Structural analysis revealed that four of these residues form a hydrophobic center in the CC domain. We further demonstrated that this hydrophobic core is important for NRC4 subcellular localization, oligomerization, and phospholipid association, but not for NRC4 focal accumulation on the extra-haustorial membrane during Phytophthora infestans infection. By comparing sequences of multiple NLRs in the NRC superclade, we found that the residues of the hydrophobic core in sensor NLRs exhibit greater diversity than those in helper NLRs.

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1737929229340

This pivotal enzyme has long been observed to be kinetically constrained. Yet, this impression is based on kinetic measurements heavily focused on eukaryotic rubiscos, a rather conserved group of low genetic diversity. Moreover, the fastest rubiscos that we know of so far were found among the sparsely sampled prokaryotes. Could there be yet faster rubiscos among the uncharted regions of rubiscos phylogenetic diversity? Here, we perform a characterization of more than 250 rubiscos from a wide range of bacteria and archaea, thereby doubling the coverage of the diversity of this key enzyme. We assess the distribution of the carboxylation rates at saturating levels of CO2, and establish that rubisco is a relatively slow enzyme across the tree of life, never exceeding {approx}20 reactions per second. We show that relatively faster subclades share similar evolutionary contexts, involving micro-oxygenic environments or a CO2 concentrating mechanism. Leveraging a simple machine learning model trained on this dataset, we predict the carboxylation rate for all {approx}68,000 sequenced rubisco variants found in nature to date. This study provides the largest and most diverse dataset of natural variants for an enzyme and their associated rates, establishing a solid benchmark for future efforts to predict catalytic rates from sequence data.

SignificanceDiscovering a fast carboxylating rubisco has been a long-standing challenge in the scientific community, given its potential impact on sustainable food and fuel production. Yet, only a small fraction of rubiscos natural diversity has been kinetically characterized. Here, we present a large-scale kinetic survey covering the entire spectrum of rubiscos diversity found in nature. Focusing on genetic clusters with above-average rates, we show that rubiscos catalytic rate does not exceed {approx}20 reactions per second. Supported by a machine-learning predictive model, we extend this finding to all sequenced natural variants. Our study provides the most comprehensive kinetic dataset for a single enzyme to date.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

However, cross-fed metabolites are often only available at low concentrations, limiting the growth rates of gene-loss mutants that are dependent on those metabolites. Here we define conditions that support a loss of function mutant in a three-member bacterial community of: (i) N2-utilizing Rhodopseudomonas palustris as an NH4+-excreting producer, (ii) N2-utilizing Vibrio natriegens as the ancestor, and (iii) a V. natriegens N2-utilizaton mutant that is dependent on the producer for NH4+. Using experimental and simulated cocultures, we found that the ancestor outcompeted the mutant due to low NH4+ availability under uniform conditions where both V. natriegens strains have equal access to nutrients. However, spatial structuring that separated the mutant from the ancestor, while maintaining access to NH4+ from the producer, allowed the mutant to avoid extinction. Counter to predictions, mutant enrichment under spatially structured conditions did not require a growth rate advantage from gene loss and the mutant coexisted with its ancestor. Thus, cross-feeding can originate from loss-of-function mutations that are otherwise detrimental, provided that the mutant can segregate from a competitive ancestor.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

However, their high cost and regulatory challenges hinder rapid and broad clinical translation. Here, we demonstrate that our lentivirally (LV) manufactured R110-CAR T cells, targeting a leukemia neoepitope, can also be engineered using non-viral Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposition with minimal-sized DNA vectors. Flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing was used to compare the two production modes using healthy donor and CLL patient-derived T cells and a CD19-CAR T cell control. SB products were shifted towards CD8+ subsets with expression of activation/co-inhibition markers (CD69, LAG-3, TIM-3) despite their naive-like phenotype and lack of antigenic challenge. The CAR binding moiety modulated these patterns with R110-CAR T cells showing more aberrant phenotypes. Moreover, SB engineering resulted in inflammatory signatures along with RIG-I-like and TOLL-like nucleotide sensing potentially resulting from the transfection procedure. Patient-derived products showed significantly fewer CAR-expressing cells, reduced proliferation clusters, and lower T cell diversity, particularly with SB manufacturing, pointing at potential challenges with this method when engineering CLL T cells. Together, our data suggest that the engineering mode may substantially influence T cell properties and that these are further modulated by the CAR binding moiety and the type of T cell donor.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

We developed a simple regression-based point score in 2020 based on an objective of forecasting critical care occupancy in the Canadian province of Ontario based on mean age of cases, case numbers, and testing volume. Evolution of the pandemic (variants of concern, vaccination) led us to re-assess and re-calibrate our earlier work, with inclusion of information vaccination which became widespread in 2021.

MethodsWe obtained complete provincial SARS-CoV-2 case, testing, and vaccination data for the period from March 2020 to September 2022, with data subdivided into 6 major ""waves"", following the approach applied by other Canadian investigators. Our initial model was fit only using the first two ""wild type"" SARS-CoV-2 waves; an updated model included wave 3 (N501Y+ variants). Our model was validated by comparing model projections to waves not used for model fitting; validation model fits were evaluated with Spearmans rho; counterfactuals without vaccination were modeled to impute fraction of critical care admissions prevented with vaccination. Costing was based on published economic estimates.

ResultsOur initial model (fit to waves 1 and 2) was well calibrated (rho 0.85) but predictive validity was modest (rho 0.46). Predictive validity improved in models fit to the first 3 pandemic waves without vaccination (rho 0.60) or with vaccination (rho 0.68) (P for inclusion of vaccination 0.013 by Likelihood Ratio Test). Prevented fraction of ICU admissions attributable to vaccination was 144% (22017 admissions expected vs. 9020 observed); based on published estimates of ICU admission cost for SARS-CoV-2 the 12977 admissions averted $2.9 (CDN) billion in economic costs, in contrast to the $3 billion total cost of the vaccination program.

ConclusionsSimple time series regression incorporating case and testing characteristics continues to be useful as a tool for forecasting critical care occupancy due to SARS-CoV-2 but early pandemic models need to be updated to capture the preventive effects of widespread vaccination. The economic benefit of vaccination for prevention of critical care resource consumption during the pandemic is substantial, achieving near cost neutrality with the provinces entire vaccination program.","NA","medrxiv",1737929229340

SOMs occur seasonally and are hypothesized to result from elevated microbial net primary productivity (NPP). Here, we set out to identify mechanistic drivers of the SOM near the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) site in the Sargasso Sea in October 2019. Coupled time-series analysis of metatranscriptomics, flow cytometry, and family-specific cyanophage quantification revealed elevated Prochlorococcus abundances, cyanophage abundances, and cyanophage-specific transcriptional activity in the SOM. These findings spurred us to analyze historical oxygen saturation profiles at BATS - identifying a repeated, seasonal cycle in SOM emergence associated with elevated virus-like particles and Prochlorococcus numbers. Returning to the 2019 study site, we found that transcriptional markers for increased dissolved organic matter uptake by copiotrophic bacteria were enriched in the SOM, consistent with enhanced catabolic activity due to the viral shunt. In addition, Prochlorococcus exhibited enrichment in ammonium transport transcripts at the SOM, consistent with increased responsiveness to remineralization activity by heterotrophs. Altogether, these findings suggest that enhanced viral lysis leads to locally elevated nutrient recycling and oxygen production, further reinforcing hypotheses that viruses may play a critical role in the emergence of SOMs in the oligotrophic ocean.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

While carboxysome number, size and spatial organization are observed to vary in different environmental conditions (CO2, light, temperature, light quality), molecular mechanisms underlying this potentially adaptive process remain elusive. Herein, we observed that mutants of the circadian rhythm/metabolism factor, Regulator of Phycobilisome Associated A (RpaA), exhibit a striking breakdown of carboxysomes under certain environmental conditions. We find that growth conditions leading to overreduction of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool (mixotrophic growth, high irradiance, or chemical inhibition of electron transfer from PQ to the cytochrome b6f complex) are accompanied by elevated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and correlate with carboxysome breakdown. Carboxysome breakdown is reversed by environmental conditions or chemical inhibitors that prevent PQ overreduction and accompanying ROS generation. Taken together, our data supports a novel link between the redox status of the PQ pool and carboxysome status and/or integrity. Our results have implications for fundamental understanding of cyanobacterial energy balancing pathways and may indicate new research directions for understanding how the carboxysome is remodeled in response to changing environments.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

Despite their importance, the structural basis for assembly and substrate transport in T7SSb, a widely distributed T7SS variant, remains poorly understood. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the T7SSb core complex from Bacillus subtilis, revealing how a ubiquitin-like protein, YukD, coordinates assembly of the secretion machinery. YukD forms extensive interactions with the central channel component YukB and promotes its association with the pseudokinase YukC, creating a stable building block for channel assembly. Using microscopy and competition assays, we demonstrate that YukD is essential for proper T7SSb complex formation and contact-dependent bacterial killing. Structural modeling suggests this YukD-dependent assembly mechanism is conserved across diverse Gram-positive bacteria. Our findings reveal how bacteria have adapted a ubiquitin-like protein as a structural regulator for assembling a large secretion complex.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

Fungi encode genes with features similar to non-self recognition systems in plants, animals, and bacteria. However, limited functional or mechanistic evidence exists for the surveillance-system recognition of heterologous microbes in fungi. We found that Neurospora species coexist with Pseudomonas in their natural environment. We leveraged two model organisms, Neurospora crassa and Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 (PSTDC3000) to observe immediate fungal responses to bacteria. PSTDC3000 preferentially surrounds N. crassa cells on a solid surface, causing environmental dependent growth responses, bacterial proliferation and varying fungal fitness. Specifically, the Type III secretion system (T3SS) {Delta}hrcC mutant of PSTDC3000 colonized N. crassa hyphae less well. To dissect initial cellular signaling events within the population of germinated asexual spores (germlings), we performed transcriptomics on N. crassa after PSTDC3000 inoculation. Upon contact with live bacteria, a subpopulation of fungal germlings initiate a response as early as ten minutes post-contact revealing transcriptional differentiation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) mechanisms, trace metal warfare, cell wall remodeling dynamics, multidrug-efflux transporters, secondary metabolite synthesis, and excretion. We dissected mutants of plausible receptors, signaling pathways, and responses that N. crassa uses to detect and mount a defense against PSTDC3000 and found seven genes that influence resistant and susceptibility phenotypes of N. crassa to bacterial colonization. Mutants in genes encoding a ctr copper transporter (tcu-1), ferric reductase (fer-1), superoxide reductase (sod-2), multidrug resistance transporter (mdr-6), a secreted lysozyme-Glycoside hydrolase (lyz) and the Woronin body tether leashin (NCU02793, lah-1 and lah-2) showed a significant reduction of growth in the presence of bacteria, allowing the bacteria to fully take over the fungal mycelium faster than wildtype. In this study we provide a bacterial-fungal model system within Dikarya that allows us to begin to dissect signaling pathways of the putative fungal immune system.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

The majority of Andropogoneae species, including maize, show a history of polyploidy -- a condition that, while offering the evolutionary advantage of multiple gene copies, poses challenges to basic cellular processes, gene expression, and epigenetic regulation. Genomic studies of polyploidy have been limited by sparse sampling of taxa in groups with multiple polyploidy events. Here, we present 33 genome assemblies from 27 species, including chromosome-scale assemblies of maize relatives Zea and Tripsacum. In maize, the after-effects of polyploidy have been widely studied, showing reduced chromosome number, biased fractionation of duplicate genes, and transposable element (TE) expansions. While we observe these patterns within the genus Zea, 12 other polyploidy events deviate significantly. Those tetraploids and hexaploids retain elevated chromosome number, maintain nearly complete complements of duplicate genes, and have only stochastic TE amplifications. These genomes reveal variable outcomes of polyploidy, challenging simple predictions and providing a foundation for understanding its evolutionary implications in an ecologically and economically important clade.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

ObjectiveThe primary objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the global prevalence of long COVID and its subtypes and symptoms in individuals with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, while the secondary objective is to assess risk factors for long COVID in the same population.

Data SourcesStudies on long COVID published from July 5, 2021, to May 29, 2024, searched from PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were used for this systematic review. Supplemental updates to the original search period were made.

Study SelectionThere were four inclusion criteria: (1) human study population with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis; (2) appropriate index diagnosis date; (3) outcome must include either prevalence, risk factors, duration, or symptoms of long COVID; and (4) follow-up time of at least two months after the index date. The exclusion criteria were: (1) non-human study population; (1) case studies or reviews; (2) studies with imaging, molecular, and/or cellular testing as primary results; (3) studies with specific populations such as healthcare workers, residents of nursing homes, and/or those living in long-term care facilities; and (4) studies that did not meet the sample size threshold needed to estimate overall prevalence with margin of error of 0.05.

Data Extraction and SynthesisTwo screeners independently performed screenings and data extraction, and decision conflicts were collectively resolved. The data were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis framework with a DerSimonian-Laird inverse variance weighted estimator.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary estimand (target population parameter of interest) was the prevalence of long COVID and its subtypes among individuals with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, and the secondary estimand was effect sizes corresponding to ten common risk factors of long COVID in the same population.

ResultsA total of 442 studies were included in this mega-systematic review, and 429 were meta-analyzed for various endpoints, avoiding duplicate estimates from the same study. Of the 442 studies, 17.9% of the studies have a high risk of bias. Heterogeneity is evident among meta-analyzed studies, where the I2 statistic is nearly 100% in studies that estimate overall prevalence. Global estimated pooled prevalence of long COVID was 36% among COVID-19 positive individuals (95% confidence interval [CI] 33%-40%) estimated from 144 studies. Geographical variation was observed in the estimated pooled prevalence of long COVID: Asia at 35% (95% CI 25%-46%), Europe at 39% (95% CI 31%-48%), North America at 30% (95% CI 24%-38%), and South America at 51% (95% CI 35%-66%). Stratifying by follow-up duration, the estimated pooled prevalence for individuals with longer follow-up periods of 1 to 2 years (47% [95% CI 37%-57%]) compared to those with follow-up times of less than 1 year (35% [95% CI 31%-39%]) had overlapping CI and were therefore not statistically distinguishable. Top five most prevalent long COVID subtypes among COVID-19 positive cases were respiratory at 20% (95% CI 14%-28%) estimated from 31 studies, general fatigue at 20% (95% CI 18%-23%) estimated from 121 studies, psychological at 18% (95% CI 11%-28%) estimated from 10 studies, neurological at 16% (95% CI 8%-30%) estimated from 23 studies, and dermatological at 12% (95% CI 8%-17%) estimated from 10 studies. The most common symptom based on estimated prevalence was memory problems estimated at 11% (95% CI 7%-19%) meta-analyzed from 12 studies. The three strongest risk factors for long COVID were being unvaccinated for COVID-19, pre-existing comorbidity, and female sex. Individuals with any of these risk factors had higher odds of having long COVID with pooled estimated odds ratios of 2.34 (95% CI 1.49-3.67) meta-analyzed from 6 studies, 1.59 (95% CI 1.28-1.97) from 13 studies, and 1.55 (95% CI 1.25-1.92) from 22 studies, respectively.

Conclusions and RelevanceThis study shows long COVID is globally prevalent in the COVID-19 positive population with highly varying estimates. The prevalence of long COVID persists over extended follow-up, with a high burden of symptoms 1 to 2 years post-infection. Our findings highlight long COVID and its subtypes as a continuing health challenge worldwide. The heterogeneity of the estimates across populations and geographical regions argues for the need for carefully designed follow-up with representative studies across the world.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the prevalence and patterns of long COVID and its subtypes, and what are the risk factors of long COVID?

ResultsMeta-analysis of 429 studies published from 2021-2024 estimated a pooled global long COVID prevalence of 36% in COVID-19 positive individuals. Variations in geographical regions showed that South America had the highest pooled prevalence of 51% (95% CI: 35%-66%), and the prevalence does not seem to diminish with extended follow-up (less than 1 year: 35%, 95% CI: 31%-39% vs. 1 to 2 years: 47%, 95% CI: 37%-57%). The estimated pooled prevalence of eight major long COVID subtypes in COVID-19 positive individuals were 20% (respiratory), 20% (general fatigue), 18% (psychological), 16% (neurological), 12% (dermatological), 10% (cardiovascular), 9% (musculoskeletal) and 5% (gastrointestinal).

Iteratively Defined Lengths of Inaccessibility (IDLI) classifies nucleosomes on the basis of shared patterns of intranucleosomal accessibility, into: i.) minimally-accessible chromatosomes; ii.) octasomes with stereotyped DNA accessibility from superhelical locations (SHLs) {+/-}1 through {+/-}7; iii.) highly-accessible unwrapped nucleosomes; and iv.) subnucleosomal species, such as hexasomes, tetrasomes, and other short DNA protections. Applying IDLI to mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) chromatin, we discover widespread nucleosomal distortion on individual mammalian chromatin fibers, with >85% of nucleosomes surveyed displaying degrees of intranucleosomally accessible DNA. We observe epigenomic-domain-specific patterns of distorted nucleosome co-occupancy and positioning, including at enhancers, promoters, and mouse satellite repeat sequences. Nucleosome distortion is programmed by the presence of bound transcription factors (TFs) at cognate motifs; occupied TF binding sites are differentially decorated by distorted nucleosomes compared to unbound sites, and degradation experiments establish direct roles for TFs in structuring binding-site proximal nucleosomes. Finally, we apply IDLI in the context of primary mouse hepatocytes, observing evidence for pervasive nucleosomal distortion in vivo. Further genetic experiments reveal a role for the hepatocyte master regulator FOXA2 in directly impacting nucleosome distortion at hepatocyte-specific regulatory elements in vivo. Our work suggests extreme--but regulated--plasticity in nucleosomal DNA accessibility at the single-molecule level. Further, our study offers an essential new framework to model transcription factor binding, nucleosome remodeling, and cell-type specific gene regulation across biological contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

In this article, we consider a population structured according to the island model, and use two and three-locus analytical models and multilocus simulations to explore the selective forces acting on a modifier locus affecting the rate of sexual reproduction of facultatively sexual organisms, in the presence of recurrent deleterious mutations. The results show that population structure and selection combine to generate a local excess of heterozygotes at selected loci (negative $F_{\mathrm{IS}}$), for both partially recessive and partially dominant deleterious alleles. The linkage disequilibrium between deleterious alleles may be either negative or positive depending on their dominance coefficient, the degree of population structure and the rate of sex. These genetic associations combine with many other ones to generate indirect selection at the sex modifier locus, generally favoring intermediate rates of sex even when sex entails direct fitness costs. Multilocus simulations show that the equilibrium rate of sex increases moderately as the degree of population structure increases. However, population structure may also prevent the irreversible spread of asexual mutants when the cost of sex is strong.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

Missense pathogenicity predictions from AlphaMissense based on structural context and protein language models improve the differentiation between benign and deleterious variants. Constraint metrics, on the other hand, allow researchers to pinpoint genomic regions under selective pressure that may not directly impact protein structure, but are more likely to contain functionally important mutations. Loss-of-function (LoF) variants, which result in the complete or partial loss of protein function, are particularly informative, as it is more straightforward to assess their downstream functional consequences. In this study, we present a unified meta regression model approach that incorporates the probability of pathogenicity, probability of constraint, and indicator whether a variant is a predicted loss-of-function or missense variant as features to model the observed effect size and uncertainty of effect size obtained from single-variant genetic analysis. We applied the unified meta regression model to 1,144 continuous phenotypes from UK Biobank using single variant summary statistics obtained from Genebass. We replicated our findings using the AllofUS cohort.

Spontaneous associations between different sensory modalities -crossmodal associations- are widely observed in humans. More recently, crossmodal associations have been reported in chimpanzees, monkeys, dogs, chickens, and tortoises, indicating a general cognitive strategy that reflects natural correlations in the environment or similarities in the architecture of the nervous system. Alternatively, or complementarily, crossmodal associations may arise from learning of species-specific occurrences. Recent research on primates has tentatively linked human pitch-luminance associations to the evolution of language. While humans and chimpanzees spontaneously match a high-pitched sound with a white shape and a low-pitched sound with a black shape, baboons and chickens do not exhibit any preferential association. Identifying spontaneous pitch-luminance associations in species that do not rely on vocal communication, such as the solitary Hermann's tortoises, would support the idea of a language-independent phenomenon. To test this idea, we studied tortoises for pitch-luminance associations in a spontaneous food-searching task. After hearing a high-pitched (700 Hz) vs low-pitched (450 Hz) sound, animals could choose to search for food behind either a light- or dark-coloured wall. When hearing the high-pitched sound, tortoises chose the white stimulus, whereas when hearing the low-pitched sound, they chose the black stimulus, similarly to what humans and chimpanzees do. These results demonstrate crossmodal pitch-luminance associations in tortoises. While showing this commonality in the perceptual organization of phylogenetically distant species, we shift the question on whether pitch-luminance associations reflect homology or convergent evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

The production of these pigments is governed in part by Agouti Signaling Protein (ASIP) and the Melanocortin 1 Receptor (MC1R) to which it binds. The most common background coat colors in mammals result from alternating bands of dark eumelanin and light pheomelanin within individual hairs. However, coats dominated by a single type of melanin have arisen several times. Here, we examine the genetic basis of two instances among the marsupials: a melanistic morph of the eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus) found at high frequency in the wild, and a rare case of fixed xanthism in the marsupial moles. In the eastern quoll, we show that a deletion encompassing part of the ASIP coding sequence likely explains melanism in this species. Notably, this mutation is convergent with that recently discovered in its dark-coated relative, the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii). Conversely, we show that a nonsense mutation which severely truncates MC1R in the southern marsupial mole (Notoryctes typhlops) is a strong candidate driver of its pheomelanin-predominant coat. Together with other recent findings, our results suggest that loss-of-function mutations have occurred repeatedly within the marsupials, representing an important mechanism underpinning coat color variation.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

Simulation demonstrates that this miscategorisation bias artificially boosts vaccine efficacy and infection rates even when a vaccine has zero or negative efficacy.

From a computational perspective, variant calling is a form of logical compression; neglecting large variation, a person's genome can be losslessly described as a set of differences (SNP and small InDel alleles) relative to the reference sequence. Another common genomic technique is haplotype phasing, wherein alleles are partitioned into their paternal and maternal components (as haplotypes). Some classes of alleles are more difficult to describe than others, e.g., short tandem repeats (STRs). STRs serve as a critical marker for many genetic assays.

The setup allows for the creation of multiple behavioral paradigms, two of which are highlighted here: a two-alternative forced-choice auditory-motor discrimination paradigm, and a two-armed bandit value-based decision-making task. In the auditory-motor paradigm, mice learn to report high or low frequency tones by pushing or pulling the joystick.

In addition to reporting categorical choices, this setup provides a rich dataset of motor parameters that reflect components of the underlying learning and decision processes in both of these tasks. These kinematic parameters (including joystick speed and displacement, Frechet similarity of trajectories, tortuosity, angular standard deviation, and movement vigor) provide key additional insights into the motor execution of choices that are not as readily assessed in other paradigms. The systems flexibility of task design, joystick readout, and ease of construction represent an advance compared to currently available manipulandum tasks in mice.

In this way, cells valuable for therapeutic purposes and disease modeling can be produced. However, the efficiency of this process is low, partly due to the properties of somatic donor nuclei which stabilize their differentiated fate but also act as barriers reprogramming-associated cell fate changes. The identity of these reprogramming barriers is not fully understood. Here, we developed an artificial intelligence-based approach to model nuclear reprogramming and used it to identify the chromatin modification H3K27ac as a novel epigenetic barrier to reprogramming-induced cell fate changes. Using reprogramming by nuclear transfer (NT) to eggs of Xenopus laevis as a model system, we profiled chromatin modifications in different cell types alongside gene expression patterns before and after reprogramming. Our model integrated the data to accurately predict reprogramming outcomes on a transcriptome level. By leveraging model predictions, we find that genes resisting inactivation during reprogramming display specific chromatin modification barcodes, including the known reprogramming barrier H3K4me3 alongside a novel candidate barrier, H3K27ac. Accordingly, reducing H3K27ac levels using p300/CBP inhibitors before reprogramming led to an improved downregulation of genes linked to H3K27ac-modified enhancers after reprogramming. Importantly, these effects were accompanied by improved embryonic development of the resulting nuclear transfer embryos. In summary, our study developed Digital Reprogramming, an artificial intelligence approach capable of predicting resistance to cell-fate reprogramming, which led to the identification of H3K27ac as a critical barrier to reprogramming-associated cell-fate changes.

C. elegans spe-11 is one of the few known paternal-effect embryonic lethal genes. We report that the sperm protein, SPE-11, forms a complex with an oocyte protein, OOPS-1 (Oocyte Partner of SPE-11), and that the protein complex is required for the completion of meiosis, the block to polyspermy, and eggshell formation. Consistent with the molecular interaction of their encoded proteins, oops-1 and spe-11 exhibit identical null phenotypes, displaying defects in meiotic progression and cytokinesis. We show that the complex binds F-actin in the absence of other proteins and inhibits the nucleation of actin filaments in vitro. Thus, the OOPS-1-SPE-11 complex may function to promote F-actin-mediated meiotic cytokinesis. Both OOPS-1 and SPE-11 are intrinsically disordered proteins that are highly phosphorylated. Biochemical and genetic experiments define interactions with the protein phosphatase 1 homologs GSP-3/4, which appear to promote OOPS-1-SPE-11 function. Genetic results support a model in which the OOPS-1-SPE-11 complex interacts with the cortical EGG complex to promote meiotic cytokinesis and to activate synthesis of the eggshell.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

Here we present a comprehensive map of T cell targets across 21 cancer types, revealing actionable tumor-specific targets in 86% of tumors. To define the repertoire of actionable T cell targets, we conducted a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis integrating data from 7,473 RNA-Seq datasets, 1,564 immunopeptidomes and 208 cancer single-cell datasets, comparing these against 17,384 normal samples covering 51 tissues. Our analysis uncovered 88 viable surface protein targets and 15,079 tumor-specific HLA-presented antigens, deriving from 11 distinct molecular events, across 21 tumor types, providing a comprehensive resource for T-cell-based immunotherapy development. We highlight 128 promising new tumor targets and validate 20 targets across five antigen classes. Among the antigens uncovered, we highlight 339 previously uncharacterized neoantigens, a new PMEL splicing peptide that we expect to be a superior antigen to the clinical target, novel self-antigens, peptides derived from ORFs previously unknown to encode proteins, and novel tumor-specific microbial targets. These findings significantly expand the therapeutic landscape of T cell therapies. To catalyze therapeutic development, we have made our pan-cancer target atlas and accompanying toolkit available to the scientific community and expect these resources will pave the way for immunotherapies across multiple cancers.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229340

We describe Tessera, an algorithm that approaches tissue segmentation through a novel approach, dividing the tissue into small multicellular tiles whose edges track with natural tissue boundaries. Tessera achieves this by incorporating successful tools from edge-preserving smoothing, topological data analysis, and morphology-aware agglomerative spatial clustering. We show that Tessera identifies a range of known anatomical structures, in healthy mouse brain and human lymph nodes, and novel disease-associated niches, in human brain and in lung cancer.

Efforts to scan mice in the awake state and avoid the use of anesthesia have demonstrated many benefits. However, the majority of current awake fMRI approaches involve head fixation through invasive surgical means. These approaches are limited for several reasons including increased subject morbidity and mortality, prolonged study timelines due to surgical recovery, a higher risk of susceptibility artifacts contaminating T2*-weighted images and obstructed access to the head for multi-modal recording techniques such as electrophysiology and fibre photometry. To address this need, we propose a non-invasive restraint to scan mice in the awake state. The restraint was designed to be compatible with brain stimulation and recording approaches. It was evaluated on the basis of motion, fMRI data quality, and animal stress levels, and subsequently compared to a conventional headpost restraint. We found the proposed approach was effective at restraining mice across a broad range of weights without the need for any anesthesia for setup. Conservatively, acquiring 25% more data with the non-invasive restraint compensates for censored frames in high motion runs and results in comparable network spatial specificity to less motion-vulnerable headpost approaches. This validation of network robustness paired with its non-invasive nature makes it a favourable approach for applications requiring high-throughput and/or multimodal imaging studies.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

Many of these functions are upregulated on demand, therefore cells control peroxisome abundance, and by extension peroxisome function, in response to environmental and developmental cues. The mechanisms upregulating peroxisomes in mammalian cells have remained unclear. Here we identify a signaling regulatory network and a mechanism that coordinate cellular demand for peroxisomes and peroxisome abundance by regulating peroxisome proliferation. We show that protein kinase C (PKC) promotes peroxisome PEX11b-dependent formation. PKC activation leads to an increase in peroxisome formation, promoting peroxisome-ER contact site formation through inactivation of GSK3?. We show that removal of VAPA and VAPB impairs peroxisome biogenesis and PKC regulation. Inhibition of PKC reduces peroxisome-ER interactions, leading to a decrease in peroxisome abundance. During neuronal differentiation, active PKC leads to a significant increase in peroxisome formation. We propose that peroxisomal regulation by transient active PKC signaling enables rapid and fine-tuned responses to the need for peroxisomal activity.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

Using consensus sequences of immunodominant antigens is a promising antigen design strategy for board cross-protection. Combining these two features, we designed and evaluated a TA mRNA vaccine encoding a consensus spike protein from SARS-CoV-2.

This is partly due to the type I interferon (IFN-I) antagonism of the non-structural RSV NS1 protein. It was recently suggested that NS1 could modulate host transcription via an interaction with the MED25 subunit of the Mediator complex. Previous work emphasized the role of the NS1 C-terminal helix 3 for recruitment of the MED25 ACID domain, a target of transcription factors (TFs). Here we show that the NS1 /{beta} core domain binds to MED25 ACID, and acts cooperatively with NS1 3 to achieve nanomolar affinity. This strong interaction is rationalized by the dual NS1 binding site on MED25 ACID predicted by AlphaFold3, which overlaps with the two canonical binding interfaces of TF transactivation domains (TADs), H1 and H2. By NMR, we confirmed that the NS1 /{beta} core domain targets the H2 interface. Several single amino acid NS1 /{beta} core domain mutations displayed reduced affinity for MED25 ACID, both in vitro and in cellula, at a comparable extent to the deletion of NS1 3. These mutations resulted in attenuated replication of recombinant RSV (rRSV) and increased expression of several antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) in interferon-competent cells. In MED25 knockdown cells, rRSV-mCherry replication was further attenuated, in line with the upregulation of IFT1 and ISG15 ISGs. The difference between WT and NS1 mutant rRSV-mCherry was partially lost, suggesting that RSV uses MED25 to control antiviral responses, by a mechanism involving the NS1-MED25 ACID complex. The strong interaction and the extended binding surface of NS1 on MED25 ACID provide evidence for a mechanism, where NS1 blocks access of transcription factors to MED25 ACID, and thereby MED25 mediated transcription activation.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

Upon mitochondrial perturbation, the ATFS-1-dependent transcriptional program promotes gene expression, leading to mitochondrial recovery. Conversely, atfs-1-deletion worms harbor dysfunctional mitochondria, are developmentally impaired, and short-lived. However, atfs-1-deletion worms develop to adults suggesting the presence of other signaling pathways that promote mitochondrial function and biogenesis in the absence of atfs-1. We hypothesized that additional transcription factors regulate, or promote, mitochondrial function in the absence of atfs-1. Here, we screened for transcription factors that could reduce the decline in mitochondrial function in the atfs-1 mutants when inhibited. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-180 re-establishes a functional mitochondrial network in atfs-1(null) worms, increases mtDNA content, and improves the developmental rate of wildtype worms. NHR-180 increases transcription of genes required for cytosolic protein synthesis in response to mitochondrial perturbation. Inhibition of the S6 kinase homolog, rsks-1, in atfs-1(null) worms leads to a recovery of the mitochondrial network and mtDNA content consistent with nhr-180 regulating expression of protein synthesis components. Consistent with the observations in C. elegans, S6 kinase inhibition also increased mitochondrial biogenesis in mammalian atf5-knockout cells that harbor severely impaired mitochondria. Intriguingly, nhr-180 or S6 kinase inhibition also rescues mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mutations in multiple genes required for oxidative phosphorylation. Combined, these studies suggest that increased protein synthesis contributes to the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by perturbations in OXPHOS gene expression and suggest a relatively straightforward approach to reducing the impact of mitochondrial dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

STHs reside in the gut, interacting both with the gut microbiota and host immunity. Clinical STH detection is laborious and often not performed within the context of gut microbiome studies. Here, we assessed whether fecal metagenome data could be used to assess STH infection, and to relate STH infection to microbiome diversity. We generated 310 gut metagenomes for mother-child pairs from two different locations in Gabon: one rural and one semi-urban. The presence and abundance of four STH parasites (Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides stercoralis, Trichuris trichiura, and Necator americanus) were assessed using both microscopy and qPCR. Sequence data were used to characterize the microbiomes and to detect the presence of these four STH parasites. We found that metagenome data could accurately detect the presence of all four STHs, as reflected by high sensitivity and specificity compared to microscopy or qPCR detection. Furthermore, the number of STH species present in stool was associated with microbiome diversity and with the abundances of specific taxa, most notably in young children. We applied this approach to microbiome data from five other populations in Africa and corroborated our findings. Our results demonstrate that human intestinal parasites can be accurately detected via metagenomic sequencing, and highlight how infection with multiple STH parasites is linked to consistent features in the gut microbiome in populations in Africa.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

However, an unsolved question is whether the well-established preference for protein-containing food manifested during states of protein restriction is innate or learned. Here, we tackled this problem by maintaining male rats on either a low-protein diet (5% protein, protein-restricted) or a control diet (22% protein, non-restricted) for 9-12 days, and then offered them two novel foods, a protein-containing solution (4% casein) and a carbohydrate-containing solution (4% maltodextrin) during a daily 60-minute free-choice test, repeated for 5 consecutive days. We assessed both the total and cumulative intake of each solution throughout each test, as well as the microstructure of licking behaviour as an index of the solutions' palatability. In a second experiment, we exposed a different cohort of rats, before any behavioural test, to the same protein source (i.e., casein) that they would encounter during the free-choice tests, to assess whether familiarity with casein would drive subsequent casein intake even in non-restricted rats. We found that dietary protein restriction leads to a rapid preference (within 16 minutes of first exposure) for a casein-rich solution, and this preference is persistent over subsequent exposures. Increased palatability of protein during initial exposure correlated with protein preference in the restricted rats. Moreover, familiarity with casein did not lead to protein preference in non-restricted rats. This study demonstrates that, when in need of protein, protein preference is a rapid adaptation that requires minimal experience of protein.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

We analyze high-yield population recordings from the macaque lateral intraparietal area (LIP) during a reaction-time random-dot-motion direction-discrimination task. We find that the trajectories of neural population activity patterns during single decisions lie within a two-dimensional decision manifold. Reaction time systematically varies along one dimension of the manifold, i.e. slow and fast decisions trace distinct activity patterns. Trajectories transition from a deliberation stage, in which they are noisy and remain similar between the choices, to a commitment stage, in which they are far less noisy and diverge sharply for the different choices. The deliberation phase is pronounced for slower decisions and gradually diminishes as reaction time decreases. A mechanistic circuit model provides an explanation for the observed properties, and suggests the transition between stages represents a transition from more sensory-driven to more circuit-driven dynamics. It yields two striking predictions we verify in the data. First, whether neurons are more choice selective for slow or fast trials varies systematically with the retinotopic location of their response fields. Second, the slower the trial, the more saccades undershoot the choice target. The results highlight the flexible and adaptive recruitment of neurons and the role of intrinsic circuit dynamics in the population implementation of a cognitive task.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

This problem underlines many applications, including metagenomic analyses. The exact genome generating the read is not in the reference set, but may be evolutionarily related to some references. Ideally, we need not just the identity of the closest references to the read but also their distance to the read. The distances can help us identify the read at the right taxonomic level and, more ambitiously, place it on a reference phylogeny. Aligning reads to reference genomes, the only available approach for computing such distances, becomes impractical for very large reference sets. It is also not effective at higher distances when used with efficient indexes (e.g., Bowtie2). While k-mers can create scalable indexes, existing k-mer-based methods are incapable of distance calculation. Thus, estimating distances between short reads and large, diverse reference sets remains challenging and seldom used. We introduce a method called krepp that combines four ideas to solve this challenge and to further enable placing reads on a reference phylogeny. We use i) locality-sensitive hashing to find inexact k-mer matches, ii) a phylogeny-guided colored k-mer index to map each k-mer to all references containing it, iii) a maximum likelihood framework to estimate read-genome distances using k-mer matches, and iv) an extension of distances to clades of the reference tree, which enables placement using a likelihood ratio test. We show that krepp matches true distances using a fraction of time compared to alignment, extends to higher distances, and accurately places short reads coming from any part of the genome (not just marker genes) on the reference phylogeny. We demonstrate easily extends to databases with tens of thousands of reference genomes and performs well in characterizing real microbial samples.

While the inflammasome in macrophages has been extensively studied and linked to pyroptosis and cytokine release, the neutrophil inflammasome remains poorly understood. Neutrophil inflammasome activation drives unique outcomes such as NETosis and robust IL-1{beta} production without inducing pyroptosis. In contrast, macrophage inflammasome activation promotes pyroptosis and the release of cytokines like IL-1 and IL-18. Here, using zebrafish models of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection and COVID-19-associated cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), we reveal opposing roles of neutrophil and macrophage inflammasomes: neutrophil inflammasomes are pro-inflammatory, whereas macrophage inflammasomes mediate anti-inflammatory responses. We show that Gasdermin E (Gsdme)- and Ninjurin-1-mediated cell death in neutrophils releases ASC specks, which are taken up by macrophages. This transfer negatively regulates caspase-1 activity via the Gsdme, promoting the resolution of inflammation. To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the anti-inflammatory role of the macrophage inflammasome, document the in vivo transfer of ASC specks between neutrophils and macrophages, and uncover the negative feedback regulation of the inflammasome by the Gsdme.

In most jurisdictions, AI-driven medical devices are already covered by existing medical device frameworks, although new AI-specific legislation may be required to address the challenges posed by recent advancements. This expert review focuses on frameworks and legislation explicitly tailored to AI, synthesizing research literature, government and intergovernmental framework programs, and online media coverage to provide an up-to-date assessment of global AI-specific regulation or strategies in healthcare as of December 2024. Our findings show that only 15.2% (n=30/197) of countries or territories have enacted legally binding AI-specific legislation, including the 27 member states of the European Union (EU) following the adoption of the EU AI Act. A further 9.1% (n=18/197) have drafted legislation, and 28.4% (n=56/197) have issued non-binding guidelines. Notably, 47.2% (n=93/197) of countries or territories do not have an AI-specific framework or legislation in place. Furthermore, our results highlight disparities between the Global North and South, with 60.3% (n=82/136) of Global South countries or territories lacking frameworks or legislation, compared to 18% (n=11/61) in the Global North. In conclusion, our work provides an overview of the status quo of AI regulation around the world, highlights disparities in the adoption of frameworks and legislation, and calls for the need for intergovernmental and regional cooperation.","NA","medrxiv",1737929229341

Without such a corpus, scholars must either search too widely across thousands of irrelevant journals, or too narrowly by relying on PubMeds Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). In our tests, MeSH missed 34% of medical education papers.

APPROACHWe developed the MEC (Medical Education Corpus), the first dedicated collection of medical education papers, through a three-step process. First, using the Core-Periphery model, we created the MEJ (Medical Education Journals), a collection of three groups of journals based on participation and influence in medical education discourse: the MEJ-Core (formerly the MEJ-24, 24 journals), MEJ-Adjacent (127 journals), and MEJ-Peripheral (a theoretical group). Second, we developed and evaluated a machine learning model, the MEC Classifier, trained on 4,032 manually labeled papers to identify medical education content. Finally, we applied the MEC Classifier to extract medical education papers from the MEJ-Core and MEJ-Adjacent journals.

OUTCOMESThe MEC currently contains 119,137 medical education papers from the MEJ-Core (54,927 papers) and MEJ-Adjacent journals (64,210 papers). In our evaluation using 1,358 test papers, the MEC Classifier demonstrated significantly improved sensitivity compared to MeSH (90% vs 66%, p = 0.001), even while maintaining a similar positive predictive value (82% vs 81%).

NEXT STEPSThe MEC provides a focused, searchable corpus that enables medical education scholars to more easily join conversations in the field. Scholars can now rely on the MEC when reviewing literature to frame their work, and the MEC also creates opportunities for field-wide analyses and meta-research. The MEC is freely available in the Supplement and is regularly updated on MedEdMentor (mededmentor.org), where we will also incorporate community feedback to further improve and expand the corpus.","NA","medrxiv",1737929229341

Previous studies have shown that some species are reliant on the lateral line for schooling, while some are not, and no clear mechanistic reason for these differences has been identified. To address the question of how the lateral line might impact schooling behavior, we identified three schooling species (giant danios Devario aequipinnatus, cherry barbs Puntius titteya, and neon tetras Paracheirodon innesi) that come from different environments and have differently structured lateral line systems. We expected to see larger changes in schooling behavior in species of fish with more neuromasts. To test this hypothesis we stained and imaged the lateral lines of these fishes, then quantified schooling behavior before and after lateral line ablation. Giant danios had the lowest density of neuromasts and, as expected, they showed no response to ablation. Cherry barbs and neon tetras both had higher densities of neuromasts and schooled differently after ablation, but in opposite ways. Cherry barbs became a less cohesive school while neon tetras formed a more cohesive school. Both of these species had a greater density of neuromasts than giant danios, but the cherry barbs had a greater number of canal neuromasts. This greater density of canal neuromasts in cherry barbs may explain the observed differences in schooling behavior after ablation if they were more dependent on them for schooling. This suggests that these three species might use their lateral lines in different ways. Overall, these results shed light on the importance of the lateral line, and the diversity of roles it plays in fish schooling.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

The mainstay for analyzing SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine efficacy has been assessment of serum IgG levels; however, validated assays for assessment of mucosal IgA in clinical samples are necessary as new and adapted measures are generated to combat immune-evasive viral variants. A mucosal IgA assay was developed and tested through assessment of IgA levels in salivary samples from participants of the 2019nCoV-314/ NCT05973006 study. These participants had previously received [&ge;]2 mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccinations prior to enrollment and received a single intramuscular study dose of NVX-CoV2601 (XBB.1.5) or bivalent vaccine (NVX-CoV2601 + NVX-CoV2373 [Wuhan]). Salivary samples were collected prior to vaccination on day 0 and on day 28 to assess response post vaccination. Both vaccine groups elicited a significant increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgA against XBB.1.5. Furthermore, cross-reactivity via identification of anti-JN.1 and anti-Wuhan IgA was also observed. The detection of IgA in clinical mucosal samples through this assay will be a valuable tool in supporting vaccine development.","NA","medrxiv",1737929229341

Whereas RNA-binding proteins and noncoding RNAs have been implicated in cell division, their interplay during this process remains unknown. Here, we discover that RSRC2, an arginine/serine-rich RNA-binding protein, plays an essential role in cell division by interacting with the long non-coding RNA C1QTNF1-AS1. The loss of either RSRC2 or C1QTNF1-AS1 results in defects in chromosome congression and mitotic progression. We show that RSRC2 interacts with distinct sets of proteins involved in splicing and centrosome biogenesis, contributing to the fidelity of cell division through two different mechanisms: one linked to the splicing of mitotic regulators and the other by localising to mitotic centrosomes for which the interaction with the C1QTNF1-AS1 RNA is required. Our study uncovers RSRC2 as a new regulator of cell division and illustrates how RNA-protein complexes promote error-free mitosis.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

Here, we introduce Ouro-Seq, a novel single-cell long-read sequencing framework with a versatile artifact removal mechanism for characterizing full-length mRNA species expressed by individual cells. We also developed a computational pipeline that identifies genuine full-length cDNAs and normalizes full-length mRNA size distributions for integration. Using Ouro-Seq, we constructed the Mouse Single-Cell Long-Read Splicing Atlas by collecting full-length transcriptomes of 103,304 nuclei or cells from 12 major organs and tissues of adult mice. Our atlas comprehensively characterizes alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, and alternative polyadenylation events across cell types, revealing previously unappreciated functional heterogeneity among individual cells. Different cell types exhibit largely distinct expression patterns of various isoforms, corresponding to their specific morphologies and biological functions. Our splicing atlas and generalized long-read frameworks will empower researchers to fully interpret biological variation across full-length transcriptomes of single cells.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

Here, we identify a new mechanism for regulation of p62 oligomerization and incorporation into p62 bodies by SHKBP1, a Cullin-3 E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor, that is independent of its potential functions in ubiquitination. We map a SHKBP1-p62 protein-protein interaction outside of p62 bodies that limits p62 assembly into p62 bodies and affects the antioxidant response by preventing sequestration and degradation of Keap1. These studies provide a non-ubiquitination-based mechanism for an E3 ligase adaptor in regulating p62 phase separation and cellular responses to oxidative stress.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

Here, we show that expression of the ETS family TF Erg is adult-biased, and that programmed upregulation of Erg expression during juvenile to adult aging is evolutionarily conserved and required for complete implementation of adult patterns of HSC self-renewal and myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid differentiation. Erg deficiency maintains fetal transcriptional and epigenetic programs, and persistent juvenile phenotypes in Erg haploinsufficient mice are dependent on deregulation of the fetal-biased TF Hmga2. Finally, Erg haploinsufficiency in the adult results in fetal-like resistance to leukemogenesis. Overall, we identify a mechanism whereby HSC TF networks are rewired to specify stage-specific hematopoiesis, a finding directly relevant to age-biased blood diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

Quantification of cytokine production with single-molecule RNA imaging demonstrates stimulus-specific patterns of response to restimulation at the single cell level. Differential licensing of inflammatory transcription factors is associated with encoding of specificities in chromatin. Trained cells show stronger responses to secondary stimuli that are more similar to the initial stimulus they experienced, suggesting a functional role for these stimulus-specific memories.

However, key regulators of these pleotropic traits have yet to be identified. Here, we discovered a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), FAM151B-DT, that is reduced in a stem cell model of frontotemporal dementia with tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and in brains from FTLD-tau, progressive supranuclear palsy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease patients. We show that silencing FAM151B-DT in vitro is sufficient to enhance tau aggregation. To begin to understand the mechanism by which FAM151B-DT mediates tau aggregation and contributes to several neurodegenerative diseases, we deeply characterized this novel lncRNA and found that FAM151B-DT resides in the cytoplasm where it interacts with tau, -synuclein, HSC70, and other proteins enriched in protein homeostasis. When silenced, FAM151B-DT blocks autophagy, leading to the accumulation of tau and -synuclein. Importantly, we discovered that increasing FAM151B-DT expression is sufficient to promote autophagic flux, reduce phospho-tau and -synuclein, and reduce tau aggregation.

Positive delta in adults is normally interpreted as implying that an individual is aging (or has aged) faster than the population norm, an indicator of unhealthy aging. Unfortunately, from cross-sectional (single timepoint) imaging data, it is impossible to know whether a single individuals positive delta reflects a state of faster ongoing aging, or an unvarying trait (in other words, a ""historical baseline effect"" in the context of the population being studied). However, for a cross-sectional dataset comprising many individuals, one could attempt to disambiguate the overall relative contributions of varying aging rates vs. fixed baseline effects. We present a method for doing this, and show that for the most common approaches, which estimate a single delta per subject, baseline effects are likely to dominate. If instead one estimates multiple biologically distinct modes of brain aging, we find that some modes do reflect aging rates varying strongly across subjects. We demonstrate this, and verify our modelling, using longitudinal (two timepoint) data from 4,400 participants in UK Biobank. In addition, whereas previous work found incompatibility between cross-sectional and longitudinal brain aging, we show that careful data processing does show consistency between cross-sectional and longitudinal results.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

Anopheles funestus is the dominant malaria vector in Tanzania and most parts of East and Southern Africa. To better understand its population genomic structure in Tanzania, we sequenced the genomes of 334 individual An. funestus mosquitoes from 11 administrative regions. We found two genetically differentiated populations; one inland and at high altitude (found in Katavi, Kagera, Kigoma, and Mwanza) and a second coastal, at low altitude (found in Pwani, Morogoro, Tanga, Ruvuma, Mtwara, Dodoma, and Lindi), with differences in genetic diversity and inbreeding. We found asynchronous selective sweeps, associated with insecticide resistance phenotypes, at the Cyp9k1 gene, and Cyp6p gene cluster, with distinct copy number-variant profiles between the coastal and inland populations. These results suggest that inland and coastal An. funestus populations have divergent histories, with the arid, central region of Tanzania, which also contains the Rift Valley being a possible barrier to gene flow. Such population disconnectedness should be considered for insecticide deployment, resistance management, and the rollout of novel genetic- based vector control approaches. These findings provide the most detailed study of Tanzanian An. funestus population structure and resistance genetics to date. Future research should examine the epidemiological relevance of this discontinuity in gene flow and whether these populations have different malaria transmission abilities.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

Despite existing research, it remains unclear how the gut microbiome is affected by different intensities of PA, and how other lifestyle factors influence this relationship. Here we study the relation between PA intensity and gut microbiome composition and function in a large Lifelines Dutch Microbiome Project dataset.

MethodsA cross-sectional design was performed on 5409 adults aged 40 to 60 from the community-based Lifelines Dutch Microbiome Project and from all these participants metagenomic shotgun data was available. Participants were categorized into sedentary (N=2501), moderate (N=1915), and vigorous (N=993) PA groups, based on self-reported activity levels. We investigated association between PA intensity and microbial diversity, bacterial species, and metabolic pathways by multiple regression models sequentially adjusted for the covariates age/sex, BMI, stool consistency and diet quality/alcohol intake.

ResultsVigorous PA, but not moderate PA, was significantly associated with higher gut microbiome alpha diversity (i.e., species richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity) as compared to sedentary PA. Compared to the sedentary group, the vigorous PA group showed a lower abundance of the bacterial species Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus ({beta} = -0.003, p = 0.042), even after extensive covariate adjustments and correction for multiple testing. Other species were initially also significantly associated with vigorous PA, but they disappeared after adjusting for covariates resulting in a loss of significance. Pathway analysis showed significant enrichment of two distinct metabolic pathways related to cellular energy recycling (Pyruvate fermentation to acetate and lactate II, {beta} = 8.11x10-05, p = 0.035) and purine metabolism (Purine ribonucleosides degradation, {beta} = 3.36x10-04, p = 0.039) in participants engaging in vigorous PA as compared to sedentary PA.

ConclusionsVigorous PA is associated with higher gut microbiome diversity and with specific alterations of microbial composition. The lower abundance of Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus within the vigorous PA group may be linked to increased gut permeability. The identified enrichment of microbial fermentation and purine metabolism in vigorous PA hints at a potential role of PA in affecting gut microbiome functionality and host health. The results of our modeling strategy highlight the importance of adjusting for dietary covariates to understand how PA may impact the gut microbiome independently from other influences.","NA","medrxiv",1737929229341

We characterized the epidemiological factors driving OROV spread in non-endemic Southeast Brazil, analyzing environmental and agricultural conditions contributing to viral transmission. Samples from 29,000 suspected arbovirus-infected patients were tested by RT-qPCR for Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika, Mayaro, and Oropouche virus. Between March and June 2024, OROV cases in the state reached 339, demonstrating successful local transmission.

Spatial analysis revealed that most cases clustered in municipalities with tropical climates and intensive cacao, robusta coffee, coconut, and pepper cultivation. Phylogenetic analysis identified the Espirito Santo OROV strains as part of the 2022-2024 Amazonian lineage. The rapid spread of OROV outside the Amazon highlights its adaptive potential and public health threat, emphasizing the need for enhanced surveillance and targeted control measures.","NA","medrxiv",1737929229341

In recent years, many small molecule inhibitors against these channels have been developed. The recent successful clinical trial of VX-548, a NaV1.8-selective inhibitor, has spurred much interest in expanding the arsenal of subtype-selective voltage-gated sodium channel therapeutics. Toward that end, we sought to determine whether NaVs are amenable to targeted protein degradation with small molecule degraders, namely proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and molecular glues. Here, we report that degron-tagged NaVs are potently and rapidly degraded by small molecule degraders harnessing the E3 ubiquitin ligases cereblon (CRBN) and Von Hippel Lindau (VHL). Using LC/MS analysis, we demonstrate that PROTAC-mediated proximity between NaV1.8 and CRBN results in ubiquitination on the 2nd intracellular loop, pointing toward a potential mechanism of action and demonstrating the ability of CRBN to recognize a VGSC as a neosubstrate. Our foundational findings are an important first step toward realizing the immense potential of NaV-targeting degrader analgesics to combat chronic pain.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

The selection of appropriate symbionts is paramount for the host to gain valuable nutrients and could be tailored to increase stress tolerance against anthropogenic induced changes in ocean environments, such as coral bleaching in response to ocean warming. Previous research suggests glycan-lectin interactions play a role in symbiont uptake; however, blockage of such interactions does not fully inhibit symbiosis establishment, suggesting other receptors are at play. Potential candidates include RGD peptide binding integrins, which are known to mediate phagocytosis of microbes in other systems. Here, we used a combination of cnidarian model systems and human cell lines to determine if integrins facilitate symbiont recognition and uptake. Integrins are highly expressed in the endodermal tissue of the host, where symbiosis takes place, and upon uptake into endodermal cells, symbionts altered the expression of integrins and downstream signaling molecules. Blockage of integrin binding sites with RGD competitor peptides reduced symbiont uptake, but had no effect on the general uptake of non-symbiotic algae, or uptake in a non-symbiotic cnidarian. In addition, inert beads coated with integrin RGD peptide ligands were phagocytosed more readily than beads coated with scrambled peptide. Finally, overexpression of RGD-binding integrins in human cells increased symbiont uptake and mutation of the active binding site abolished uptake. Our findings reveal RGD-binding integrins as key players in symbiosis establishment and shed light on the evolutionary functions of integrins as phagocytic receptors.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

Complete anaerobic SQ degradation via interspecies metabolite transfer to sulfonate-respiring bacteria produces hydrogen sulfide, which has dose- and context-dependent health effects. Here, we studied potential SQ degradation by the mammalian host and the impact of SQ supplementation on human and murine gut microbiota diversity and metabolism. 13CO2 breath tests with germ-free C57BL/6 mice gavaged with 13C-SQ were negative. Also, SQ was not degraded by human intestinal cells in vitro, indicating that SQ is not directly metabolized by mice and humans. Addition of increasing SQ concentrations to human fecal microcosms revealed dose-dependent responses of the microbiota and corroborated the relevance of Agathobacter rectalis and Bilophila wadsworthia in cooperative degradation of SQ to hydrogen sulfide via interspecies transfer of 2,3-dihydroxy-1-propanesulfonate (DHPS). Similar to the human gut microbiome, the genetic capacity for SQ or DHPS degradation is sparsely distributed among bacterial species in the mouse gut. Escherichia coli and Enterocloster clostridioformis were identified as primary SQ degraders in the mouse gut. SQ and DHPS supplementation experiments with conventional laboratory mice and their intestinal contents showed that SQ was incompletely catabolized to DHPS. Although some E. clostridioformis genomes encode an extended sulfoglycolytic pathway for both SQ and DHPS fermentation, SQ was only degraded to DHPS by a mouse-derived E. clostridioformis strain. Our findings suggest that SQ is solely a nutrient for the gut microbiota and not for mice and humans, emphasizing its potential as a prebiotic. SQ degradation by the mouse microbiota differs from the human gut microbiota by absence of DHPS degradation activity. Hence, the microbiota of conventional laboratory mice does not fully represent the SQ metabolism in humans, indicating the need for alternative model systems to assess the impact of SQ on human health. This study advances our understanding of how individual dietary compounds shape the microbial community structure and metabolism in the gut and thereby potentially influence host health.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

Inner membranes of mitochondria are known to be permeable to potassium ions (K+), which enter the matrix either through ATP-sensitive channels (MitoKATP) or leakage across the bilayer driven by inner membrane potentials. Mitochondrial K+ influx is associated with increased osmotic pressure, promoting water influx and increasing matrix volume. Since BAT mitochondria have lower inner membrane potentials due to uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) activity, we hypothesized this could involve compensatory changes in MitoKATP activity, and thus tested MitoKATP involvement in brown adipocyte activities under basal and stimulated conditions. We find that cold exposure and adrenergic stimulation in mice modulate BAT MitoK levels, the channel portion of MitoKATP. Genetic ablation of the gene that codes for the pore-forming subunit of MitoKATP in human pre-adipocytes decreased cellular respiration and proliferation, compromising differentiation into mature adipocytes. In mouse cell lines, the absence of the protein limited cellular oxygen consumption in the precursor stage, but not in mature adipocytes. Interestingly, inhibition of MitoKATP in mature adipocytes increased adrenergic-stimulated oxygen consumption, indicating that shutdown of this pathway is important for full BAT thermogenesis. Similarly, MitoKATP inhibition increased oxygen consumption in BAT mitochondria isolated from mice treated with beta 3 adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243. Overall, our results suggest that the activity of MitoKATP regulates differentiation and metabolism of brown adipocytes, impacting on thermogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

The acquisition of effector signatures in Treg cells is closely tied to the surrounding tissue-specific immune environment and typically occurs alongside Foxp3 expression. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic and functional consequences of Treg-mediated regulation in a Th2-driven disease setting. The application of both in vitro systems and in vivo disease models allowed us to mimic Th2-mediated environments.

We could demonstrate Th2-driven loss of Foxp3 expression in Treg cells in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a maintained Treg signature despite the loss of active Foxp3 expression. Functional characterization of Tregs both in vitro and in vivo uncovered a preserved suppressive capacity even in the absence of Foxp3.

Our findings unveil that, despite loss of Foxp3, a preserved Treg signature remains intact enabling the regulation of Th2-mediated diseases. The persistence of this regulatory transcriptome highlights the importance for developing Treg-cell therapy strategies in cancer and autoimmune diseases independent of Foxp3 expression.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

Surface proteins belonging to the SLAM family are known to be crucial for stabilizing the immunological synapse and regulating antiviral responses during lymphotropic viral infections. In the context of HIV-1, there have been reports of SLAMF6 down-regulation in HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells; however, the significance of this modulation for CTL function remains unclear. In this investigation, we used CTL lines from People living with HIV (PLWH) to examine the impact of SLAMF6 blockade on three pivotal processes: (1) the formation of CD8+-CD4+ T-cell conjugates, (2) the establishment of the immunological synapse, and (3) the killing and cytokine production capacity of HIV-1-specific CTLs during HIV-1 infection. Our findings reveal that the inability to form CD8+-CD4+ T-cell conjugates following incubation with an anti-SLAMF6 blocking antibody is primarily attributable to a defect in actin ring formation at the immunological synapse. Furthermore, SLAMF6 blockade leads to a reduction in the killing efficiency of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells by HIV-1-specific CTLs, underscoring the critical role of SLAMF6 in cytolytic function. This study highlights the importance of SLAMF6 receptors in modulating cytotoxic antiviral responses, shedding light on potential avenues for manipulation and enhancement of this pathway in the context of HIV and other lymphotropic viral infections.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

Does this generalization extend to non-ethological actions? Here, we examined fMRI responses for tool-use actions that participants performed with their hands or feet. We additionally tested individuals born without hands to control for hand motor imagery when performing foot actions. We show that the primary sensorimotor cortices have hand and foot selectivity, consistent with a somatotopic organization. In contrast, higher-level motor areas within the tool-use network, such as the premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, and superior parietal cortices, showed a shared preference for tool-use independent of the executing body part and sensorimotor experience. Multivariate decoding of action-type in these areas generalized between controls hand and foot and was successful in individuals born without hands. Finally, the temporal dynamics pattern in primary and association areas carried effector-specific and action-type information, respectively. Altogether, we show that the tool-use network in motor association areas represents higher-order action information beyond concrete motor parameters associated with specific effectors, and regardless of hand motor experience. This suggests that an action-type, effector-independent organization extends beyond ethological actions, supporting a hierarchical organization in the action domain. Further, it shows that functional organization in congenital handlessness is based on the hierarchical organization of the intact cortex.","NA","biorxiv",1737929229341

We found that internucleosomal DNA linker length controls nucleosome arrangement and histone tail interactions, shaping the structure of individual chromatin molecules both within and outside condensates.

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1737929229341
