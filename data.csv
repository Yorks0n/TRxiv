While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937521

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937521

Through our network of collaborators from across Canada, retail milk is being procured longitudinally and sent to a central laboratory for testing for the presence of influenza A virus RNA. To date (24 May 2024), we have tested 18 retail milk samples from five Canadian provinces (NL, NB, QC, MB, and AB) and all have tested negative for influenza A virus RNA. Testing is ongoing and these results will be updated on rolling basis as additional data becomes available. Despite no known HPAI infections of dairy cattle in Canada to date, H5N1 poses a significant threat to the health of both humans and other animals. Routine surveillance of retail milk on a national scale will allow for monitoring of infected dairy cattle on an ongoing basis in a cost-effective, standardized, scalable and easily accessible manner. Our network and testing will act as an early warning system which will enable rapid responses necessary to contain an outbreak should any samples test positive.","NA","medrxiv",1717106937521

These libraries are often kept in plasmids that are amplified in E. coli to generate sufficient material for an experiment. Library uniformity is critical for ensuring that every element in the library is tested similarly, and is thought to be influenced by the culture approach used during library amplification. We tested five commonly used culturing methods for their ability to uniformly amplify plasmid libraries: liquid, semisolid agar, cell spreader-spread plates with high or low colony density, and bead-spread plates. Each approach was evaluated with two library types: a random 80-mer library, representing high complexity low coverage of similar sequence lengths, and a human TF ORF library, representing low complexity high coverage of diverse sequence lengths. We found that no method was better than liquid culture, which produced relatively uniform libraries regardless of library type. However, when libraries were transformed with high coverage, culturing method had minimal impact on uniformity or amplification bias. Plating libraries was the worst approach by almost every measure for both library types, and, counter-intuitively, produced the strongest biases against long sequence representation. Semisolid agar amplified most elements of the library uniformly but also included outliers with orders of magnitude higher abundance. For amplifying DNA libraries, liquid culture, the simplest method, appears to be best.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937521

Fluorescence images have a black background due to the inherent nature of fluorescence imaging. The black background fits well with dark themes that are used on screens and presentations. On the other hand, inverting the color images to display the signals on a white background can aid the human visual system in capturing detailed information or subtle features. In addition, white backgrounds match better with printed media. However, current methods to invert or change the background of color images require multiple steps or do not offer flexibility in the adjustment which is important when dealing with complex images without raw data. To facilitate easy access to background inversion and flexible modifications, ezReverse was developed. Two methods are implemented, the first based on color space transformation followed by inverting the lightness, while the second method identifies grayscale values which are subsequently modified. The web app ezReverse is a versatile tool, that accommodates multiple color spaces, kernel filters, and gamma correction for optimal inversion of color images.

The recovery of mammalian predators of conservation concern in Europe is a success story, but their impact on some prey species of conservation concern may cause conservation dilemmas. This calls for effective intervention strategies that mitigate predator impacts without compromising their recovery.

2. We evaluated diversionary feeding as a management intervention tool to reduce depredation on nests of rapidly declining Western capercaillies in Scotland. We studied the influence of diversionary feeding provision on the fates of artificial nests deployed using a replicated and representative randomised landscape-scale experiment. This comprised 30 paired control (no diversionary feeding) and treatment (diversionary feeding applied) sites, 60 in total, each containing six artificial nests distributed across 600 km2. The experiment was replicated over two years, and in the second year, the control-treatment pairs were reversed, yielding 60 treatment and 60 control sites and 720 artificial nests.

3. Diversionary feeding substantially reduced depredation of artificial nests, translating into an 83% increase in predicted nest survival over 28 days of incubation. The increase in survival was mostly accounted for by a reduction in the probability that a pine marten, the main nest predator, consumed or cached eggs. Diversionary food also significantly reduced nest predation by badgers, although the magnitude of this effect varied by year.

4. Diversionary feeding is an easily employable method shown in this study to reduce predator impact (functional) without lethal (numerical) intervention. Managers should proceed with its application for conserving capercaillie in Scotland without delay.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937521

Our understanding of how animals evolved this exquisite regulatory control remains elusive, but evidence suggests that changes in chromatin-based mechanisms may have contributed. To investigate this possibility, here we examine chromatin-based gene regulatory features in the closest relatives of animals, choanoflagellates. Using Salpingoeca rosetta as a model system, we examined chromatin accessibility and histone modifications at the genome scale and compared these features to gene expression. We first observed that accessible regions of chromatin are primarily associated with gene promoters and found no evidence of distal gene regulatory elements resembling the enhancers that animals deploy to regulate developmental gene expression. Remarkably, a histone modification deposited by polycomb repressive complex 2, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), appeared to function similarly in S. rosetta to its role in animals, because this modification decorated genes with cell type-specific expression. Additionally, H3K27me3 marked transposons, retaining what appears to be an ancestral role in regulating these elements. We further uncovered a putative new bivalent chromatin state at cell type-specific genes that consists of H3K27me3 and histone H3 lysine 4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1). Together, our discoveries support the scenario that gene-associated histone modification states that underpin development emerged before the evolution of animal multicellularity.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937521

A recent notion that most psychotropics are detrimental to the gut microbiota has arisen from consistent findings of metabolic adverse effects. However, unlike olanzapine, the metabolic effects of lurasidone are conflicting, with most reports observing weight loss rather than gain. Thus, this study investigates the contrasting effects of olanzapine and lurasidone on the gut microbiota to explore the hypothesis of ""gut neutrality"" for lurasidone exposure.

Experimental ApproachUsing a Sprague-Dawley rat model, the impact of olanzapine and lurasidone administration on the gut microbiota was explored. Faecal and blood samples were collected weekly over a 21-day period to analyse changes to the gut microbiota and related metabolic markers.

Key ResultsLurasidone triggered no significant weight gain or metabolic alterations, instead positively modulating gut microbiota through increases in mean OTUs (+50 OTUs) and alpha diversity (+0.5 increase in Shannons index). This novel finding suggests an underlying mechanism for lurasidones metabolic inertia. In contrast, olanzapine triggered a statistically significant decrease in mean OTUs (-75 OTUs) and substantial compositional variation, suggesting a decrease in microbial richness. Microbiota alterations correlated with metabolic dysfunction, evidenced through a statistically significant 30% increase in weight gain, increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and increase in blood triglycerides and glycaemic levels.

Conclusion and ImplicationsThe study challenges the notion that all antipsychotics disrupt the gut microbiota similarly and highlights the potential benefits of gut positive or neutral antipsychotics like lurasidone in managing metabolic side effects. Further research is warranted to validate these findings in humans to guide personalised pharmacological treatment regimens for schizophrenia.

However, most models have been applied in unperturbed contexts, precluding a predictive understanding of how chromatin state responds to TF perturbation. Here, we used transfer learning to train and interpret deep learning models that use DNA sequence to predict, with accuracy approaching experimental reproducibility, how the concentration of two dosage-sensitive TFs (TWIST1, SOX9) affects regulatory element (RE) chromatin accessibility in facial progenitor cells. High-affinity motifs that allow for heterotypic TF co-binding and are concentrated at the center of REs buffer against quantitative changes in TF dosage and strongly predict unperturbed accessibility. In contrast, motifs with low-affinity or homotypic binding distributed throughout REs lead to sensitive responses with minimal contributions to unperturbed accessibility. Both buffering and sensitizing features show signatures of purifying selection. We validated these predictive sequence features using reporter assays and showed that a biophysical model of TF-nucleosome competition can explain the sensitizing effect of low-affinity motifs. Our approach of combining transfer learning and quantitative measurements of the chromatin response to TF dosage therefore represents a powerful method to reveal additional layers of the cis-regulatory code.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937521

However, the molecular landscape of these abundant proteins has remained underexplored due to a lack of structural data. By employing AlphaFold2multimer together with planar symmetry constraints in a workflow validated by electron cryomicroscopy structure determination, we have elucidated the lattice structures of over 150 S-layers from diverse archaea and bacteria. Our findings unveil a multifaceted evolutionary landscape for S-layer proteins, highlighting key differences in the evolution of bacterial and archaeal S-layers. Our study allows us to discover underlying patterns in S-layer structure, organisa-tion, and cell anchoring mechanisms across the prokaryotic tree of life, deepening our understanding of the intricately complex microbial cell surfaces, which appear to have evolved proteinaceous S-layers independently on multiple occasions. This work will open avenues for rational manipulation of prokaryotic cellular interactions in multicellular microbiomes, as well as for innovative 2D biomaterial design.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937521

Our study explores the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, a classic model system in biology and a species adept at microscale interaction, as a biological platform for micro-robotics. Initially, we focus on remotely directing the walking paths of fruit flies in an experimental arena. We accomplish this through two distinct approaches: harnessing the fruit flies opto-motor response and optogenetic modulation of its olfactory system. These techniques facilitate reliable and repeated guidance of flies between arbitrary spatial locations. We guide flies along predetermined trajectories, enabling them to scribe patterns resembling textual characters through their locomotion. We enhance olfactory-guided navigation through additional optogenetic activation of positive valence mushroom body output neurons. We extend this control to collective behaviors in shared spaces and navigation through constrained maze-like environments. We further use our guidance technique to enable flies to carry a load across designated points in space, establishing the upper bound on their weight carrying capabilities. Additionally, we demonstrate that visual guidance can facilitate novel interactions between flies and objects, showing that flies can consistently relocate a small spherical object over significant distances. Beyond expanding tools available for micro-robotics, these novel behavioral contexts can provide insights into the neurological basis of behavior in fruit flies.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937521

The sequence features enabling such extreme-distance enhancer-promoter interactions remain elusive. Here, we used in vivo enhancer replacement experiments in mice to show that short- and medium-range enhancers cannot initiate gene expression at extreme-distance range. We uncover a novel conserved cis-acting element, Range EXtender (REX), that confers extreme-distance regulatory activity and is located next to a long-range enhancer of Sall1. The REX element itself has no endogenous enhancer activity. However, addition of the REX to other short- and mid-range enhancers substantially increases their genomic interaction range. In the most extreme example observed, addition of the REX increased the range of an enhancer by an order of magnitude, from its native 71kb to 840kb. The REX element contains highly conserved [C/T]AATTA homeodomain motifs. These motifs are enriched around long-range limb enhancers genome-wide, including the ZRS, a benchmark long-range limb enhancer of Shh. Mutating the [C/T]AATTA motifs within the ZRS does not affect its limb-specific enhancer activity at short range, but selectively abolishes its long-range activity, resulting in severe limb reduction in knock-in mice. In summary, we identify a sequence signature globally associated with long-range enhancer-promoter interactions and describe a prototypical REX element that is necessary and sufficient to confer extreme-distance gene activation by remote enhancers.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937521

The ability to design crosses with high means that will maintain genetic variation in the population is the goal for long-term applications. Herein, we describe a new computational package for mate allocation in a breeding program. SimpleMating is a flexible and open-source R package originally designed to predict and optimize breeding crosses in crops with different reproductive systems and breeding designs. Divided into modules, SimpleMating first estimates the cross performance (criterion), such as mean parental average, cross total genetic value, and/or usefulness of a set of crosses. The second module implements an optimization algorithm to maximize a target criterion while minimizing next-generation inbreeding. The software is flexible, allowing users to specify the desired number of crosses, maximum/minimum number of crosses per parent, and the maximum value of the parent relationship for creating crosses. As an outcome, SimpleMating generates a mating plan from the target parental population using single or multi-trait criteria. As example, we implemented and tested SimpleMating in a simulated maize breeding program obtained through stochastic simulations. The crosses designed via SimpleMating showed large genetic mean over time (up to 22% more genetic gain than conventional genomic selection programs, with lower genetic diversity decrease over time), supporting the use of this tool, as well as the use of data-driven decisions in applied breeding programs.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937521

The identification of high-confidence large-effect autism risk genes offers the opportunity to identify convergent, underlying biology by studying these genes in the context of the gastrointestinal system. Here we show that the expression of these genes is enriched in human prenatal gut neurons as well as their migratory progenitors, suggesting that the development and/or function of these neurons may be disrupted by autism-associated pathogenic variants, leading to gastrointestinal dysfunction. Here we document the prevalence of gastrointestinal issues in patients with large-effect variants in sixteen of these genes, highlighting dysmotility, consistent with potential enteric neuron dysfunction. Using the high- throughput diploid frog Xenopus tropicalis, we individually target five of these genes (SYNGAP1, CHD8, SCN2A, CHD2, and DYRK1A) and observe disrupted enteric neuronal progenitor migration for each. More extensive analysis of DYRK1A reveals that perturbation causes gut dysmotility in vivo, which can be ameliorated by treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (escitalopram) or a serotonin receptor 6 agonist, identified by in vivo drug screening. This work suggests that atypical development of enteric neurons contributes to the gastrointestinal distress commonly seen in individuals with autism and that increasing serotonin signaling may be a productive therapeutic avenue.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937521

Piezos undergo large conformational changes, induce far-reaching deformation onto the membrane, and modulate the function of two-pore potassium (K2P) channels. Taken together, this led us to hypothesize that Piezos may be able to signal their conformational state to other nearby proteins. Here, we use chemical control to acutely restrict Piezo1 conformational flexibility and show that Piezo1 conformational changes, but not ion permeation through it, are required for modulating the K2P channel TREK1. Super-resolution imaging and stochastic simulations further reveal that both channels do not co-localize, which implies that modulation is not mediated through direct binding interactions; however, at high Piezo1 densities, most TREK1 channels are within the predicted Piezo1 membrane footprint, suggesting the footprint may underlie conformational signaling. We speculate that physiological roles originally attributed to Piezo1 ionotropic function could, alternatively, involve conformational signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937521

In plants, due to the absence of cell migration, correct placement of newly produced cell walls during cell division is of eminent importance for generating functional tissues and organs. In particular, during radial growth of plant shoots and roots, concerted cell divisions in the cambium are essential to produce adjacent xylem and phloem tissues in a strictly bidirectional manner. While several intercellular signaling cascades have been identified to instruct tissue organization during radial growth, a role of mechanical forces in guiding cambium stem cell activity has been frequently proposed but, so far, not been functionally investigated on the cellular level. Here, we coupled anatomical analyses with a cell-based vertex model to analyze the role of mechanical stress in radial plant growth at the cell and tissue scale. Simulations based on segmented cellular outlines of radially growing Arabidopsis hypocotyls revealed a distinct stress pattern with circumferential stresses in cambium stem cells which coincided with the orientation of cortical microtubules. Integrating stress patterns as a cue instructing cell division orientation was sufficient for the emergence of typical cambium-derived cell files and agreed with experimental results for stress-related tissue organization in confining mechanical environments. Our work thus underlines the significance of mechanical forces in tissue organization through self-emerging stress patterns during the growth of plant organs.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937521

FtsZ recruits other proteins, collectively known as the divisome, that together remodel and constrict the envelope. Constriction is driven by peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall synthesis by the glycosyltransferase FtsW and the transpeptidase FtsI (FtsWI), but these enzymes require activation to function. How recruitment of FtsZ to the division site leads to FtsWI activation and constriction remains largely unknown. Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that an FtsZ-binding protein, FzlA, is essential for activation of FtsWI in the alphaproteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Additionally, we found that FzlA also binds to a DNA translocase called FtsK, suggesting that it may link constriction activation to chromosome segregation. FzlA is conserved throughout alphaproteobacteria but has only been examined in detail in C. crescentus. Here, we explored whether FzlA function is conserved in diverse alphaproteobacteria. We assessed FzlA homologs from Rickettsia parkeri and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and found that, similar to C. crescentus FzlA, they bind directly to FtsZ and localize to midcell. The FtsZ-FzlA interaction interface is conserved, as we demonstrated that FzlA from each of the three species examined can bind to FtsZ from any of the three in vitro. Additionally, we determined that A. tumefaciens FzlA can fulfill the essential function of FzlA when produced in C. crescentus, indicating conservation of function. These results suggest that FzlA serves as an important regulator that coordinates chromosome segregation with envelope constriction across diverse alphaproteobacteria.

ImportanceCell division is essential for bacterial replication and must be highly regulated to ensure robust remodeling of the cell wall in coordination with segregation of the genome to daughter cells. In Caulobacter crescentus, FzlA plays a major role in regulating this process by activating cell wall synthesis in a manner that couples constriction to chromosome segregation. FzlA is broadly conserved in alphaproteobacteria suggesting it plays a similar function across this class of bacteria. Here we have shown that, indeed, FzlA biochemical interactions and function are conserved in diverse alphaproteobacteria. Because FzlA is conserved in alphaproteobacterial human pathogens, understanding this protein and its interactome could present therapeutic benefits by identifying potential antibiotic targets to treat infections.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937521

However, how vaccines, emergent variants, and their intersection shift host responses in the human nasal mucosa remains uncharacterized. We and others have shown during the first SARS-CoV-2 wave that a muted nasal epithelial interferon response at the site of infection underlies severe COVID-19. We sought to further understand how upper airway cell subsets and states associate with COVID-19 phenotypes across viral variants and vaccination. Here, we integrated new single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from nasopharyngeal swabs collected from 67 adult participants during the Delta and Omicron waves with data from 45 participants collected during the original (Ancestral) wave in our prior study. By characterizing detailed cellular states during infection, we identified changes in epithelial and immune cells that are both unique and shared across variants and vaccination status. By defining SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells for each variant, we found that Delta samples had a marked increase in the abundance of viral RNA+ cells. Despite this dramatic increase in viral RNA+ cells in Delta cases, the nasal cellular compositions of Delta and Omicron exhibit greater similarity, driven partly by myeloid subsets, than the Ancestral landscapes associated with specialized epithelial subsets. We found that vaccination prior to infection was surprisingly associated with nasal macrophage recruitment and activation rather than adaptive immune cell signatures. While patients with severe disease caused by Ancestral or Delta variants had muted interferon responses, Omicron-infected patients had equivalent interferon responses regardless of disease severity. Our study defines the evolution of cellular targets and signatures of disease severity in the upper respiratory tract across SARS-CoV-2 variants, and suggests that intramuscular vaccines shape myeloid responses in the nasal mucosa upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937521

Here we show that the catenulid Stenostomum brevipharyngium, a member of the earliest-branching flatworm lineage, lacks conventional neoblasts despite being capable of whole-body regeneration and asexual reproduction. Using a combination of single-nuclei transcriptomics, in situ gene expression analysis, and functional experiments, we find that cell divisions are not restricted to a single cell type and are associated with multiple fully differentiated somatic tissues. Furthermore, the cohort of germline multipotency genes, which are considered canonical neoblast markers, are not expressed in dividing cells, but in the germline instead, and we experimentally show that they are neither necessary for proliferation nor regeneration.

Brain imaging studies have reported disrupted large-scale functional connectivity in people with 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). However, the significance and biological determinants of these functional alterations remain unclear. Here, we use a cross-species design to investigate the developmental trajectory and neural underpinnings of brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS. We find that LgDel mice, an established mouse model of 22q11DS, exhibit age-specific patterns of functional MRI (fMRI) dysconnectivity, with widespread fMRI hyper-connectivity in juvenile mice reverting to focal hippocampal hypoconnectivity over puberty. These fMRI connectivity alterations are mirrored by co-occurring developmental alterations in dendritic spine density, and are both transiently normalized by developmental GSK3{beta} inhibition, suggesting a synaptic origin for this phenomenon. Notably, analogous hyper-to hypoconnectivity reconfiguration occurs also in human 22q11DS, where it affects hippocampal and cortical regions spatially enriched for synaptic genes that interact with GSK3{beta}, and autism-relevant transcripts. Functional dysconnectivity in somatomotor components of this network is predictive of age-dependent social alterations in 22q11.2 deletion carriers. Taken together, these findings suggest that synaptic-related mechanisms underlie developmentally mediated functional dysconnectivity in 22q11DS.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937522

A reliable indexing of taxa based on their association with host health and microbiome resilience could accelerate development of microbiome-based therapeutics including selection of live biotherapeutics and facilitate microbiome comparisons in diverse study populations.

Here we first investigated 196 taxa for their association with three hallmark properties of health and microbiome-resilience, namely prevalence/community-influence in non-diseased subjects, longitudinal stability and host health, using a discovery cohort of 39,926 publicly available adult (> 18 years) gut microbiomes from 127 studies spanning 42 countries and 28 disease conditions (including 9,434 longitudinal samples). We identified 18 species-level-taxa, referred to as  Health-Associated Core Keystones (HACKs), with association-strengths in the top 30 percentile for all three properties. We integrated these association-strengths into a single value, the HACK-index, that ranks taxa based on their estimated contribution to both microbiome stability and host health. We then demonstrate the reproducibility of these indices for the taxon associations with the three properties, using a validation cohort of 4,500 gut microbiomes (from 11 studies with various demographics and diseases). Specific consortia of high HACK-index taxa are also associated with positive response to Mediterranean Diet interventions and Immuno-Checkpoint-Inhibitor therapies. We finally identify the distinguishing microbial genomic functions associated with high HACK-indices/HACK-taxa that can be investigated using targeted mechanistic studies to identify microbiome effectors of improved health.

The availability of HACK-indices provides a rational basis for microbiome comparisons and will facilitate the selection and design of microbiome-based therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937522

However, the relationships and feedbacks between virus dynamics, microbial host dynamics, and environmental disturbance is not understood. Centralia, PA, USA, is the site of an underground coal seam fire that has been burning for over 60 years. As the fire moves along the coal seam, previously heated soils cool to ambient temperature, creating a gradient of heat disturbance intensity and recovery. We examined annual soil viral population dynamics over seven consecutive years in Centralia using untargeted metagenome sequencing. Viral communities changed over time and were distinct between fire-affected and reference sites. Dissimilarity in viral communities was greater across sites (space) than within a site across years (time), and cumulative viral diversity more rapidly stabilized within a site across years than within a year across sites. There also were changes in CRISPR investment as soils cooled, corresponding to shifts in viral diversity. Finally, there were also differences in viral-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes between fire-affected and reference sites. These results indicate that despite high site-to-site soil viral diversity, there was surprising viral community consistency within a site over the years and shifting host-viral interactions in soils recovering from disturbance. Together, these results provide insights into how viral and host communities collectively respond to unpredicted environmental disturbance.

The location of pairs of identical sequences is highly consistent with expectations from mobility and social contact data. Outliers in the relationship between genetic and mobility data can be explained by SARS-CoV-2 transmission between postal codes with male prisons, consistent with transmission between prison facilities.

Previous work assembled YAG transcripts based on their targeted sequencing but not using reference genome assemblies, potentially resulting in an incomplete transcript repertoire. Here we used the recently produced gapless telomere-to-telomere (T2T) Y chromosome assemblies of great ape species (bonobo, chimpanzee, human, gorilla, Bornean orangutan, and Sumatran orangutan) and analyzed RNA data from whole-testis samples for the same species. We generated hybrid transcriptome assemblies by combining targeted long reads (Pacific Biosciences), untargeted long reads (Pacific Biosciences) and untargeted short reads (Illumina)and mapping them to the T2T reference genomes. Compared to the results from the reference-free approach, average transcript length was more than two times higher, and the total number of transcripts decreased three times, improving the quality of the assembled transcriptome. The reference-based transcriptome assemblies allowed us to differentiate transcripts originating from different Y chromosome gene copies and from their non-Y chromosome homologs. We identified two sources of transcriptome diversity--alternative splicing and gene duplication with subsequent diversification of gene copies. For each gene family, we detected transcribed pseudogenes along with protein-coding gene copies. We revealed previously unannotated gene copies of YAGs as compared to currently available NCBI annotations, as well as novel isoforms for annotated gene copies. This analysis paves the way for better understanding Y chromosome gene functions, which is important given their role in spermatogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937522

Here, we have applied 5PSeq, single-particle cryo-EM and readthrough reporter assays to provide insight into the biological function of New1. We show that the lack of New1 results in ribosomal stalling at stop codons preceded by a lysine or arginine codon and that the stalling is not defined by the nature of the C-terminal amino acid but rather by the identity of the tRNA isoacceptor in the P-site.

We find the reduced response to low-dose LPS correlates with minimal TLR4 and CD14 surface expression, despite sufficient internal expression of TLR4. Additionally, we find that AMs do not produce IL-10 in response to a variety of PAMPs due to low expression of transcription factor c- Maf and that lack of IL-10 production contributes to an enhancement of pro-inflammatory responses by Type I IFN.

Normally, we are interested in visualizing and measuring if the differences in the proportion of number of cells across various covariates is significant or biologically relevant.

Use of a polyspecific orthogonal translation system enables introduction of chemical groups with various properties, including photo-reactive, proximity-reactive, and click chemistry-enabled functional groups for library screening. We established conjugation conditions that facilitate modification of the full library, demonstrating the feasibility of sorting the full billion-member library in protein-small molecule hybrid format in future work. Here, we conducted initial library screens after introducing O-(2-bromoethyl)tyrosine (OBeY), a weakly electrophilic ncAA capable of undergoing proximity-induced crosslinking to a target. Enrichments against donkey IgG and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) each led to the identification of several OBeY-substituted clones that bind to the targets of interest. Flow cytometry analysis on the yeast surface confirmed higher retention of binding for OBeY-substituted clones compared to clones substituted with ncAAs lacking electrophilic side chains after denaturation. However, subsequent crosslinking experiments in solution with ncAA-substituted clones yielded inconclusive results, suggesting that weakly reactive OBeY side chain is not sufficient to drive robust crosslinking in the clones isolated here. Nonetheless, this work establishes a multi-modal, chemically expanded antibody library and demonstrates the feasibility of conducting discovery campaigns in chemically expanded format. This versatile platform offers new opportunities for identifying and characterizing antibodies with properties beyond what is accessible with the canonical amino acids, potentially enabling discovery of new classes of reagents, diagnostics, and even therapeutic leads.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937522

We performed a deep-sequencing experiment using PacBio HiFi reads to obtain metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from a pooled human gut microbiome. We performed long-read metagenome assembly using two methods (hifiasm-meta, metMDBG), used improved bioinformatic and proximity ligation binning strategies to cluster contigs and identify MAGs, and developed a novel framework to compare and consolidate MAGs (pb-MAG-mirror). We found proximity ligation binning yielded more MAGs than bioinformatic binning, but our novel comparison framework resulted in higher MAG yields than either binning strategy individually. In total, from 255 Gbp of total HiFi data we produced 595 total MAGs (including 175 high-quality MAGs) using hifiasm-meta, and 547 total MAGs (including 277 high-quality MAGs) with metaMDBG. Hifiasm-meta assembled almost twice as many strain-level MAGs as metaMDBG (246 vs. 156), but both assembly methods produced up to five strains for a species. Approximately 85% of the MAGs were assigned to known species, but we recovered >35 high-quality MAGs that represent uncultured diversity. Based on strict similarity scores, we found 125 MAGs were unequivocally shared across the assembly methods at the strain level, representing [~]22% of the total MAGs recovered per method. Finally, we detected more total viral sequences in the metaMDBG assembly versus the hifiasm-meta assembly ([~]6,700 vs. [~]4,500). Overall, we find the use of HiFi sequencing, improved metagenome assembly methods, and complementary binning strategies is highly effective for rapidly cataloging microbial genomes in complex microbiomes.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937522

As such, there is growing interest in determining the microbial traits that drive SOM formation and stabilization; however, whether certain microbial traits consistently predict SOM accumulation across different functional pools (e.g., total vs. stable SOM) is unresolved. To address these uncertainties, we incubated individual species of fungi in SOM-free model soils, allowing us to directly relate the physiological, morphological, and biochemical traits of fungi to their SOM formation potentials. We find that the formation of different SOM functional pools is associated with distinct fungal traits, and that  multifunctional species with intermediate investment across this key grouping of traits (namely, carbon use efficiency, growth rate, turnover rate, and biomass protein and phenol contents) promote SOM formation, functional complexity, and stability. Our results highlight the limitations of categorical trait-based frameworks that describe binary (high/low) trade-offs between microbial traits, instead emphasizing the importance of synergies among microbial traits for the formation of functionally complex SOM.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937522

However, accurate and precise de novo assemblies of large and complex genomes remains a challenging task. Long-read sequencing data alone or in hybrid mode combined with more accurate short-read sequences facilitate the de novo assembly of genomes. A number of software exists for de novo genome assembly from long-read data although specific performance comparisons to assembly human genomes are lacking. Here we benchmarked 11 different pipelines including four long-read only assemblers and three hybrid assemblers, combined with four polishing schemes for de novo genome assembly of a human reference material sequenced with Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Illumina. In addition, the best performing choice was validated in a non-reference routine laboratory sample. Software performance was evaluated by assessing the quality of the assemblies with QUAST, BUSCO, and Merqury metrics, and the computational costs associated with each of the pipelines were also assessed. We found that Flye was superior to all other assemblers, especially when relying on Ratatosk error-corrected long-reads. Polishing improved the accuracy and continuity of the assemblies and the combination of two rounds of Racon and Pilon achieved the best results. The assembly of the non-reference sample showed comparable assembly metrics as those of the reference material. Based on the results, a complete optimal analysis pipeline for the assembly, polishing, and contig curation developed on Nextflow is provided to enable efficient parallelization and built-in dependency management to further advance in the generation of high-quality and chromosome-level human assemblies.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937522

For instance, cellular differentiation is one life history strategy that enables a single celled microeukaryotic species to produce morphologically and physiologically distinct types of cells with different ecological functions. Here we report that cell differentiation in the marine choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta endows one of its cell types with the ability to utilize insoluble ferric colloids for improved growth through the expression of a cytochrome b561 iron reductase (cytb561a). This gene is an ortholog of the mammalian duodenal cytochrome b561 (DCYTB) that reduces ferric cations prior to their uptake in gut epithelia and is part of an iron utilization toolkit that choanoflagellates and their closest living relatives, the animals, inherited from a last common eukaryotic ancestor. In a database of oceanic metagenomes, the abundance of cytb561a transcripts from choanoflagellates positively correlates with upwellings, which are a major source of ferric colloids in marine environments. As this predominant form of iron is largely inaccessible to cell-walled microbes, choanoflagellates and other phagotrophic eukaryotes may serve critical ecological roles by first acquiring ferric colloids through phagocytosis and then cycling this essential nutrient through iron utilization pathways. These findings provide insight into the ecological roles choanoflagellates perform and may inform reconstructions of early animal evolution where functionally distinct cell types became an integrated whole at the origin of animal multicellularity.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937522

MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial, several potential treatments for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were assessed in separate comparisons in RECOVERY, both of which are reported here. Eligible and consenting adults could join the molnupiravir comparison, the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, or both. For each comparison, participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the relevant antiviral (five days of molnupiravir 800mg twice daily or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir 300mg/100mg twice daily) or to usual care without the relevant antiviral drug, using web-based unstratified randomisation with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were time to discharge alive from hospital, and among those not on invasive ventilation at baseline, progression to invasive ventilation or death. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Both comparisons were stopped by the investigators because of low recruitment. ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsFrom 24 January 2022 to 24 May 2023, 923 patients were recruited to the molnupiravir comparison (445 allocated molnupiravir and 478 allocated usual care), and from 31 March 2022 to 24 May 2023, 137 patients were recruited to the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison (68 allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 69 allocated usual care). More than three-quarters of the patients in both comparisons were vaccinated and had anti-spike antibodies at randomisation, and more than two-thirds were receiving other SARS-CoV-2 antivirals (including remdesivir or sotrovimab). In the molnupiravir comparison, 74 (17%) patients allocated to molnupiravir and 79 (17%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.28; p=0.66). In the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, 13 (19%) patients allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 13 (19%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.47-2.23; p=0.96). In neither comparison was there evidence of a significant difference in the duration of hospitalisation or the proportion of patients progressing to invasive ventilation or death.

InterpretationIn adults hospitalised with COVID-19, neither molnupiravir nor nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were associated with reductions in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death although these comparisons had limited statistical power due to low recruitment.

High-resolution cryo-EM typically requires higher voltage cryo-TEMs with coherent FEG sources, stable columns, autoloader systems and direct electron detectors. These setups are specialised for Cryo-EM work and are expensive to establish and maintain. More recently the concept of using 100-keV cryo-TEMs has been introduced as a way to make cryo-EM more affordable and hence accessible to a larger group of researchers. So far, the implementation of these 100-keV cryo-TEMs have relied on specialised microscopes with FEG sources as well as more stable optics than usually present on the common 120-keV TEMs. We here explored whether a standard 120-keV TEM, commonly available at many laboratories worldwide, can be upgraded with a direct electron detector and its suitability for high-resolution cryo-EM using a standard side entry cryo-holder. Using this imaging configuration, we were successful in achieving a 2.65[A] reconstruction for standard apoferritin. We were also able to resolve a more challenging small 64kDa protein haemoglobin to 4.33[A]. Furthermore, we were able to solve an asymmetric 153 kDa membrane protein GPCR (M4 muscarinic acid receptor) to a resolution of 4.4[A]. Importantly, all these results were achieved using a standard automated data collection routine implemented through SerialEM, making it feasible to collect large cryo-EM data sets with a side entry cryo-holder. These results showcase a potentially widely accessible solution to obtaining interpretable cryo-EM structures. Furthermore, we envisage that this imaging configuration gives an option for many EM facilities and laboratories to set up a high-quality cryo-EM SPA sample screening capability without the need to procure costly specialised Cryo-TEMs. This could help to considerably lower the economic entry barrier for cryo-EM SPA and contribute to the ""democratisation"" of cryo-EM.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937522

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

However, laboratory studies typically simplify reality and focus on the effects of an individual stressor. Here, we use a microfluidic approach to simultaneously provide a physical stressor (shear flow) and a chemical stressor (H2O2) to the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. By treating cells with levels of flow and H2O2 that commonly co-occur in nature, we discover that previous reports significantly overestimate the H2O2 levels required to block bacterial growth. Specifically, we establish that flow increases H2O2 effectiveness 50-fold, explaining why previous studies lacking flow required much higher concentrations. Using natural H2O2 levels, we identify the core H2O2 regulon, characterize OxyR-mediated dynamic regulation, and dissect the redundant roles of multiple H2O2 scavenging systems. By examining single-cell behavior, we serendipitously discover that the combined effects of H2O2 and flow block pilus-driven surface migration. Thus, our results counter previous studies and reveal that natural levels of H2O2 and flow synergize to restrict bacterial colonization and survival. By studying two stressors at once, our research highlights the limitations of oversimplifying nature and demonstrates that physical and chemical stress can combine to yield unpredictable effects.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937522

We sought to exploit this and identify novel rare, protein-coding variants associated with metabolic health in newly released WGS data (N=708,956) from the UK Biobank and All of Us studies. Identified genes highlight novel biological mechanisms, including protein truncating variants (PTVs) in the DNA double-strand break repair gene RIF1 that have a substantial effect on body mass index (BMI, 2.66 kg/m2, s.e. 0.43, P = 3.7x10-10). UBR3 is an intriguing example where PTVs independently increase BMI and type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. Furthermore, PTVs in IRS2 have a substantial effect on T2D (OR 6.4 [3.7-11.3], P = 9.9x10-14, 34% case prevalence among carriers) and were unexpectedly also associated with chronic kidney disease independent of diabetes status, suggesting an important role for IRS-2 in maintaining renal health. We identified genetic evidence of functional heterogeneity in IRS1 and IRS2, suggesting a greater role for IRS-1 in mediating the growth promoting effects of insulin and IGF-I, while IRS-2 has a greater impact on glucose homeostasis likely through its actions in the pancreatic islet and insulin target tissues. Our study demonstrates that large-scale WGS provides novel mechanistic insights into human metabolic phenotypes through improved capture of coding sequences.","NA","medrxiv",1717106937522

However, the complexity, binding dependencies and temporal effects of their action remain unclear. Here, we dissect how the pioneer TF GATA6 triggers Primitive Endoderm (PrE) differentiation from pluripotent cells. We show that transient GATA6 binding exploits accessible regions to decommission active enhancers and promote pluripotency gene silencing. Simultaneously, GATA6 targets closed chromatin and initiates an extensive remodeling culminating in the establishment of fragile nucleosomes flanked by ordered nucleosome arrays and increased accessibility. This is directly enhanced by rapidly expressed PrE TFs (SOX17) and by pluripotency TFs repurposed for differentiation (OCT4/SOX2). Furthermore, GATA6 mediates the replacement of essential nuclear receptors for PrE differentiation, from ESRRB to ESRRA. Therefore, pioneer TFs orchestrate a complex gene regulatory network involving many if not all available pioneer TFs, including those required to support the original identity of differentiating cells.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937522

To understand how biochemical constraints shaped protein structural evolution, we coupled the extensive genetic and metabolic data from the Saccharomycotina subphylum with the capability of AlphaFold2 to systematically predict protein structures from sequence. Determining how 11,269 enzyme structures catalysing 361 different metabolic reactions evolved over 400 million years alongside their molecular functions, we report that metabolism has shaped the structural evolution of enzymes at different levels: the organisms overall metabolism; the topological organisation of the metabolic network; and each enzymes molecular properties. For example, structural evolution depends on each enzymes reaction mechanism, on the variability rather than the amount of metabolic flux, and on biosynthetic cost. Evolutionary cost-optimization is stronger on highly abundant enzymes and acts differently on different structural domains, with the exception of small-molecule binding sites, which are prioritised over other structural domains and lack cost-optimisation. Finally, while enzyme surfaces are less constrained, surface residues can also be exposed to positive selection for the co-evolution of protein-protein interaction sites. Accessing AlphaFolds power to predict protein structures systematically and across species barriers, facilitating the integration of protein structures with functional genomics, we were thus able to map biological constraints which shape protein structural evolution at scale and over long timelines.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937522

Mature wild silversides were treated with a control [dissolved oxygen (DO):100% air saturation (a.s.) / pCO2: 650 {micro}atm] or HypOA conditions [DO: 40% a.s. / pCO2: 2300 {micro}atm] for 10 days prior to spawning. Their offspring were reared under both treatments in factorial experimental design. Parental acclimation to HypOA altered several offspring traits, including increased embryo survival under HypOA and an overall reduction in post-hatch growth rate. Offspring from HypOA-treated parents that were reared under control conditions had larger eyes across the developmental period. When compared against the overall control group, larvae directly exposed to HypOA exhibited 2,416 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs). Although most of these DETs were specific to individual parental treatments, the most enriched Gene Ontology terms were conserved across parental treatments, including terms related to neurotransmitter secretion, nervous system development, axon pathfinding, calcium channel activity, proteolysis, and extracellular matrix organization. Larvae from HypOA-treated parents that were reared under control conditions exhibited a shift in constitutive gene expression similar to that seen in larvae directly exposed to HypOA. This highly consistent finding indicates that parental acclimation before fertilization promotes the transcriptional frontloading of genes in offspring. This effect may have primed regulatory functions in offspring that sense and respond to low DO and elevated pCO2 conditions. Though, our results suggest that this altered developmental phenotype may have some negative fitness consequences for offspring.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937522

We utilized high-throughput sample multiplexed proteomics and integrated intelligent data acquisition methods to map proteomes of cancer cell lines in response to HDACi. We determined cell type-specific and ubiquitous cellular responses based on the quantification of 10,621 total proteins. We then established how coordinated remodeling of the proteome, transcriptome and chromatin state of HDACi treated cancer cells revealed convergent (JUN, MAP2K3, CDKN1A) and divergent (CCND3, ASF1B, BRD7) molecular phenotypes. HDACi- regulated proteins differ greatly across cell lines owing to heterogeneous molecular states of these cell lines.

The mechanisms of cognitive impairment after COVID-19 (COGVID) remain unclear, but neuroimaging studies provide evidence of brain changes, many that are associated with aging. Therefore, we calculated Brain Age Gap (BAG), which is the difference between brain age and chronological age, in a cohort of 25 mild to moderate COVID-19 survivors (did not experience breathlessness, pneumonia, or respiratory/organ failure) and 24 non-infected controls (mean age = 30 +/- 8) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). BAG was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (F = 4.22, p = 0.046) by 2.65 years. Additionally, 80% of the COVID-19 group demonstrated an accelerated BAG compared to 13% in the control group (X2 = 20.0, p < 0.001). Accelerated BAG was significantly correlated with lower cognitive function (p < 0.041). Females in the COVID-19 group demonstrated a 99% decreased risk of accelerated BAG compared to males (OR = 0.015, 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.300).

Proposed drivers of remarkable longevity include high vegetable intake, strong social connections, and genetic markers. Here, we reveal new predictors of remarkable longevity and  supercentenarian status. In the United States, supercentenarian status is predicted by the absence of vital registration. The state-specific introduction of birth certificates is associated with a 69-82% fall in the number of supercentenarian records. In Italy, England, and France, which have more uniform vital registration, remarkable longevity is instead predicted by poverty, low per capita incomes, shorter life expectancy, higher crime rates, worse health, higher deprivation, fewer 90+ year olds, and residence in remote, overseas, and colonial territories. In England and France, higher old-age poverty rates alone predict more than half of the regional variation in attaining a remarkable age. Only 18% of  exhaustively validated supercentenarians have a birth certificate, falling to zero percent in the USA, and supercentenarian birthdates are concentrated on days divisible by five: a pattern indicative of widespread fraud and error. Finally, the designated  blue zones of Sardinia, Okinawa, and Ikaria corresponded to regions with low incomes, low literacy, high crime rate and short life expectancy relative to their national average. As such, relative poverty and short lifespan constitute unexpected predictors of centenarian and supercentenarian status and support a primary role of fraud and error in generating remarkable human age records.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937522

GP38 is considered an important target for vaccine and therapeutic design as GP38-specific antibodies can protect against severe disease in animal models, albeit through a currently unknown mechanism of action. Here, we show that GP38 induces endothelial barrier dysfunction in vitro, and that CCHFV infection, and GP38 alone, can trigger vascular leak in a mouse model. Protective antibodies that recognize specific antigenic sites on GP38, but not a protective neutralizing antibody binding the structural protein Gc, potently inhibit endothelial hyperpermeability in vitro and vascular leak in vivo during CCHFV infection.

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1717106937522

While RdRp is the target of several viral inhibitors, the active site has several pitfalls when translating in vitro inhibitors to the clinic. The highly polar residues within the active site often necessitate the use of highly polar or charged compounds, especially when designing nucleoside analog inhibitors, posing significant challenges in optimizing drug-likeness and membrane permeability for clinical efficacy. Here, we investigated the broad-spectrum potential of the allosteric Thumb-1 cryptic site of the RdRp, which to date has only been adequately studied in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). To explore this potential antiviral target, we used a suite of bioinformatics techniques, including homology modeling and multiple sequence alignments, to reveal the conserved landscape of the Thumb-1 site across +ssRNA viruses. We then used ChemPrint, our Mol-GDL (Molecular-Geometric Deep Learning) machine learning model to predict drug inhibition of the Thumb-1 site in RdRp across +ssRNA viruses. Here, we identify MDL-001 as a promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidate with favorable properties that enable oral and once-a-day dosing. We also show how the cryptic nature of the Thumb-1 site masks itself to conventional virtual screening techniques, like docking, where activity prediction is heavily based on solving or predicting an accurate structure of the open pocket. This study demonstrates the utility of this approach in drug discovery for broad-spectrum antivirals that target the Thumb-1 site.

The highly conserved RdRp Thumb-1 site across these viruses is identified as a potential target for broad spectrum antiviral drugs, which would be vital tools in prophylactic and therapeutic responses to future viral threats.

MethodologyUtilizing bioinformatics and deep learning (through our proprietary AI platform called GALILEO), the study maps the conserved landscape of the RdRp Thumb-1 site across a range of human pathogenic +ssRNA viruses and screens for potential inhibitory compounds.

Key DiscoveriesMDL-001 emerges as a potential broad-spectrum non-nucleoside antiviral drug candidate and the RdRp Thumb-1 site exists as a family of targets, many of which may be targetable by a single drug.

Impact and ImplicationsThe discovery that the Thumb-1 site of RdRp can be targeted by small molecules for antiviral activity against a range of +ssRNA viruses.

Future DirectionsThis work paves the way for further development of MDL-001 and research for other broad-spectrum antiviral compounds that target the RdRp Thumb-1 domain.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937522

DesignThis case series study analyzed adverse event (AE) reports submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database following RSVPreF immunization from September 1, 2023, to February 23, 2024.

SettingVAERS, as a national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system, provides insights into the safety profile of the RSVPreF vaccine in a real-world setting.

ParticipantsSurveillance data included all AE reports submitted to VAERS for pregnant individuals following vaccination.

ExposureReceipt of RSVPreF vaccine among pregnant individuals in the U.S.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresDescriptive statistics assessed all AE reports with RSVPreF, including frequency, gestational age at vaccination, time to AE onset, and serious report proportions. The Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) was utilized, estimating the information component (IC) to identify disproportionate reporting of RSVPreF-event pairs.

ResultsVAERS received 77 reports pertained to RSVPreF vaccination in pregnant individuals, with 42 (54.55%) classified as serious. The most reported non-pregnancy-specific AEs were headache, injection site erythema, and injection site pain. Preterm birth was the most frequently reported pregnancy-specific AE, followed by preterm premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, cervical dilatation, and hemorrhage during pregnancy. The median time from immunization to reported preterm birth was 3 days, with two-thirds of cases within a week. Disproportionality analysis indicated a significant signal for various AEs, particularly highlighting preterm birth with an IC of 2.18 (95%CI, 1.54-2.63), suggesting that reports of preterm birth associated with RSVPreF vaccination occurred more frequently than statistically expected.

ConclusionsWhile reported AEs were generally consistent with the safety profile observed in prelicensure studies, this study highlights ongoing concern about preterm birth among pregnant individuals following RSVPreF vaccination. Comprehensive longitudinal follow-up, including prospective pregnancy registries and infant follow-up studies is urgently required.","NA","medrxiv",1717106937522

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

FundingNational Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2701800 and 2022YFC2304700), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82202567 and 32270003), Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2022278), Shanghai Rising-Star Program (23QA1410500), and Shanghai municipal three-year action plan for strengthening the construction of the public health system (2023-2025) GWVI-2.1.2.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1717106937522

Recently, the emergence and dominance of the JN.1 lineage over XBB variants have prompted a reevaluation of current vaccine strategies. Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of XBB-based vaccines against JN.1, concerns persist regarding the durability of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses against evolving JN.1 subvariants. In this study, we compared the humoral immunogenicity of XBB and JN.1 lineage infections in human subjects with diverse immune histories to understand the antigenic and immunogenic distinctions between these variants. Similar to observations in naive mice, priming with XBB and JN.1 in humans without prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure results in distinct NAb responses, exhibiting minimal cross-reactivity. Importantly, breakthrough infections (BTI) with the JN.1 lineage induce 5.9-fold higher neutralization titers against JN.1 compared to those induced by XBB BTI. We also observed notable immune evasion of recently emerged JN.1 sublineages, including JN.1+R346T+F456L, with KP.3 showing the most pronounced decrease in neutralization titers by both XBB and JN.1 BTI sera. These results underscore the challenge posed by the continuously evolving SARS-CoV-2 JN.1 and support the consideration of switching the focus of future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine updates to the JN.1 lineage.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937523

Here, we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), a genome editing system that combines the programmability and precision of CRISPR/Cas9 with the RNA-mediated gene insertion capabilities of the human LINE1 (L1) element. CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937523

DesignNationwide cohort studies, using target trial emulation.

SettingDenmark, Finland, and Sweden, from 1 October 2023 to 29 February 2024.

ParticipantsIndividuals aged [&ge;]65 years who had previously received at least four covid-19 vaccine doses. Main outcome measures: Cumulative incidences of covid-19 hospital admission and death for 12 weeks after immunisation (defined as 1 week after vaccination) among recipients of an XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk differences.

ResultsDuring autumn and winter 2023-2024, a total of 1,867,448 1:1 matched pairs of XBB-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and non-recipients were included (mean age 75.4 years, standard deviation 7.4 years). The comparative vaccine effectiveness was 60.6% (95% confidence interval, 46.1% to 75.1%) against covid-19 hospital admission (930 v 2,551 events) and 77.9% (69.2% to 86.7%) against covid-19 related death (301 v 1,326 events) at 12 weeks of follow-up. This corresponded to 191.1 (95% confidence interval, 50.2 to 332.1) covid-19 hospital admissions and 109.2 (100.2 to 118.1) deaths prevented per 100,000 individuals vaccinated with an XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1717106937523

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937523

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937523

Stress-induced exposure of ribosome-free mRNA following translational shutoff is thought to cause condensation by allowing new multivalent RNA-dependent interactions, with RNA length and associated interaction capacity driving increased condensation. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all mRNA species condense in response to multiple unrelated stresses in budding yeast, length plays a minor role, and instead, stress-induced transcripts are preferentially excluded from condensates, enabling their selective translation. Using both endogenous genes and reporter constructs, we show that translation initiation blockade, rather than resulting ribosome-free RNA, causes condensation. These translation initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are biochemically detectable even when stress granules, defined as microscopically visible foci, are absent or blocked. TIICs occur in unstressed yeast cells, and, during stress, grow before the appearance of visible stress granules. Stress-induced transcripts are excluded from TIICs primarily due to the timing of their expression, rather than their sequence features. Together, our results reveal a simple system by which cells redirect translational activity to newly synthesized transcripts during stress, with broad implications for cellular regulation in changing conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937523

It forms a right-handed helical barrel consisting of 22 pairs of Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 subunits, with a diameter of 32 nm its wider end and 19 nm at its narrower end. Oligomerization is stabilized by the C-terminus, which forms two helical layers linked by a {beta}-strand, and coiled-coil domains that enable strong charge-charge inter-subunit interactions. Flotillin interacts with membranes at both ends; through its SPFH1 domains at the wide end and the C-terminus at the narrow end, facilitated by hydrophobic interactions and lipidation. The inward tilting of the SPFH domain, likely triggered by phosphorylation, suggests its role in membrane curvature induction, which could be connected to its proposed role in clathrin-independent endocytosis. The structure suggests a shared architecture across the family of SPFH proteins and will promote further research into Flotillins roles in cell biology.

Significance statementIt is well known that many biochemical processes in cells must occur in localized regions. There are many different ideas about how cells keep processes localized. In this study we demonstrate that Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 co-assemble to form a large, truncated cone shaped cage whose wide end is always attached to a membrane surface and whose narrow end is sometimes attached to a separate membrane. The entire wall of the cage is without holes and is likely impervious even to small molecules, forming a diffusion barrier that can connect membrane systems. The Flotillin cage is thus well suited to isolate biochemical processes. Through membrane attachment, it also alters local membrane curvature, which could influence endocytic and mechanosensory processes.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937523

However, this approach can produce variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice appeared to habituate more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in withdrawal behavior. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdalar neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map pain sensation and affect.","NA","biorxiv",1717106937523
