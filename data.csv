Persistently elevated autoantibodies have been found in some individuals with long COVID (LC). Using a >21,000 human protein array, we identified diverse AAB targets in LC patients that correlated with their symptoms. Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness. Our findings suggest that targeting AABs could benefit some LC patients.","NA","medrxiv",1723586877204

Previous studies support that pasteurization effectively inactivates avian influenza in milk and an earlier retail milk survey showed viral RNA, but no live virus could be detected in the dairy products tested. Because of the variety of products and processing methods in which milk is used, additional product testing was conducted to determine if HPAI viral RNA could be detected in retail dairy samples, and for positive quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) samples to be tested for presence of live virus. Revised protocols were developed to extract RNA from solid dairy products including cheese and butter. The solid dairy product was mechanically liquified with garnet and zirconium beads in a bead beater diluted 1 to 4 with BHI media. This pre-processing step was suitable in allowing efficient RNA extraction with standard methods. Trial studies were conducted with different cheese types with spiked in avian influenza virus to show that inoculation of the liquified cheese into embryonating chicken eggs was not toxic to the embryos and allowed virus replication. A total of 167 retail dairy samples, including a variety of cheeses, butter, ice cream, and fluid milk were collected as part of nationwide survey. A total of 17.4% (29/167) of the samples had detectable viral RNA by qRT-PCR targeting the matrix gene, but all samples were negative for live virus after testing with embryonating egg inoculation. The viral RNA was also evaluated by sequencing part of the hemagglutinin gene using a revised protocol optimized to deal with the fragmented viral RNA. The sequence analysis showed all viral RNA positive samples were highly similar to previously reported HPAI dairy cow isolates. Using the revised protocols, it was determined that HPAI viral RNA could be detected in a variety of dairy products, but existing pasteurizations methods effectively inactivate virus assuring consumer safety.","NA","medrxiv",1723586877204

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

We employed a single-nucleus RNA-sequencing approach to assess the transcriptional heterogeneity and cell differentiation processes within the SAM. By collecting dissected inflorescence meristems, we constructed an inflorescence single-nucleus SAM atlas from Arabidopsis thaliana. Our analysis unveiled regulatory elements for most previously known cell types such as the boundary domain, vasculature, early primordia, epidermis and internal stem cells. We also identified previously unobserved transcriptional profiles, revealing that the stem cortex is defined early within forming primordia. Moreover, trajectory inference analysis allowed us to capture spatial control of S-phase machinery by floral homeotic genes and differentiation gene expression dynamics from internal shoot stem cells toward internal layers such as cortex, cambium, xylem and phloem. The results advance our understanding of the cellular and transcriptional heterogeneity underlying the cell-fate transcriptional dynamics shaping shoot organs and architecture.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877204

During cap-snatching, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (FluPol) binds to host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and the emerging transcript2,3. The FluPol endonuclease then cleaves a capped RNA fragment that sub-sequently acts as a primer for the transcription of viral genes4,5. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of FluPol bound to a transcribing Pol II in complex with the elongation factor DSIF in the pre-cleavage state. The structure shows that FluPol directly interacts with both Pol II and DSIF, which position the FluPol endonuclease domain near the RNA exit channel of Pol II. These interactions are important for the endonuclease activity of FluPol and FluPol activity in cells. A second structure trapped after cap-snatching shows that cleavage rearranges the capped RNA primer within the FluPol, directing the capped RNA 3'-end towards the FluPol polymer-ase active site for viral transcription initiation. Altogether, our results provide the molecular mechanisms of co-transcriptional cap-snatching by FluPol.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877204

DESS comprises 20% dimethyl sulfoxide, 250 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and saturated sodium chloride, and its efficacy has been confirmed in various taxa and tissues. DESS enables the stable, long-term preservation of both sample morphology and DNA. However, to access the DNA, excising a portion of the sample was necessary. Although DNA is a valuable source of information for species identification, DNA extraction can result in the loss of an entire sample or segment, especially in small-sized organisms, thereby compromising specimen value. Therefore, establishing non-destructive DNA extraction techniques is imperative. Thus, this paper presents a protocol for conducting non-destructive DNA extraction and DNA barcoding using a portion of the DESS supernatant obtained from a nematode specimen. This method was successfully employed for DNA barcoding of nematodes that were stored in DESS at room temperature (-10[~]35{degrees}C) for ten years. Moreover, the method can be potentially applied in the preservation and non-destructive extraction of DNA from specimens of various species. Following sample collection, a bulk environmental sample from sediment and seagrass is immediately immersed in DESS in the field. Subsequently, DNA is extracted from the supernatant solution, allowing non-destructive DNA barcoding. Overall, this paper presents comprehensive protocols for DNA extraction from DESS supernatants and demonstrates their practical application using meiofauna (small animals) and diatoms as examples.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877204

However, the extent to which these viral prospecting efforts have enhanced preparedness for disease outbreaks remains poorly characterized, especially in terms of whether they are necessary, sufficient, or feasible ways to spur medical countermeasure development. We find that several viruses which pose known threats to human health lack approved vaccines and that known viruses discovered in human patients prior to 2000 have caused most major 21st-century outbreaks. With Filoviridae as a case study, we show there is little evidence to suggest that viral prospecting has accelerated countermeasure development or that systematically discovering novel zoonotic viruses in animal hosts before they cause human outbreaks has been feasible. These results suggest that prospecting for novel viral targets does not accelerate a rate-limiting step in countermeasure development and underscore questions about the importance of zoonotic viral discovery for outbreak preparedness. We consider limitations to these conclusions and alternative but related approaches to preparedness and response.","NA","medrxiv",1723586877204

Establishing methods to induce membrane rupture of organelles of interest is essential to analyze the downstream effects of membrane rupture; however, the spatiotemporal induction of rupture of specific membranes remains challenging. Here, we develop a series of optogenetic tools to induce organelle membrane rupture by using engineered Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), whose primary function is to form membrane pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) during apoptosis. When BAX is forced to target mitochondria, lysosomes, or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by replacing its C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) with organelle-targeting sequences, the BAX mutants rupture their target membranes. To regulate the activity of organelle-targeted BAX, the photosensitive light-oxygen-voltage-sensing 2 (LOV2) domain is fused to the N-terminus of BAX. The resulting LOV2-BAX fusion protein exhibits blue light-dependent membrane-rupture activity on various organelles, including mitochondria, the ER, and lysosomes. Thus, LOV2-BAX enables spatiotemporal induction of membrane rupture across a broad range of organelles, expanding research opportunities on the consequences of organelle membrane disruption.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877204

Using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behaviour (COM-B) model for behaviour change, the aim of this research was to explore the barriers and facilitators of community pharmacy PrEP delivery, for pharmacists and community members.

MethodsCommunity members at elevated risk of acquiring HIV and community pharmacists were recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analysed within the framework of the COM-B model.

Results17 interviews with pharmacists (pharmacy owners n=7; employed pharmacists n=6; locums n=4) and 24 with community members (Black African women n=6; other women n=2; young adults aged 18-25 years n=6; transgender people n=6; female sex workers n=4) were carried out. Capability barriers included sub-optimal awareness and knowledge of PrEP, pharmacy facilities, and pharmacist roles in delivering public health services. Opportunity barriers included lack of staff capacity, privacy and pharmacy screening and monitoring facilities. Motivational barriers included a concern that increased access could increase sexually transmitted infections and involve a financial cost. Capability facilitators included awareness raising, HIV and PrEP training and education. Opportunity facilitators included PrEP appointments and the accessibility of pharmacies. Motivational facilitators included a preference for pharmacy delivery over other models (e.g., sexual health, GP), and a belief that it would be discrete and less stigmatising.

ConclusionPharmacy PrEP delivery is acceptable but for it to be feasible, results point to the need for the development of a behaviour change intervention focusing on education, training and awareness raising, targeting pharmacists and community members to stimulate patient activation and de-stigmatise HIV. This intervention would need to be facilitated by system and environmental changes (e.g., commissioning service).

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSLocation, sigma of sexual health clinics and lack of PrEP awareness limits PrEP access for key groups among whom new HIV acquisitions remain high. Previous research and the UK government suggests PrEP provision via community pharmacies as a potential way of improving PrEP access and health equity.

What this study addsThis is the first research study to explore the barriers to and facilitators of pharmacy PrEP delivery for pharmacists and community members in the UK. To increase capabilities and motivation, training and awareness raising is needed. To increase opportunities and motivation, environmental and system level changes are needed.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyResults point to the acceptability of pharmacy PrEP delivery, but for it to be feasible behaviour change interventions supported by system and environmental changes are needed.","NA","medrxiv",1723586877204

As a notable example, growth plate hypertrophic chondrocytes use cellular biogenesis and disproportionate fluid uptake to expand 10 to 20 times in size to drive lengthening of endochondral bone. Similarly, notochordal cells expand to one of the largest cell types in the developing embryo to drive axial extension. In zebrafish, the notochord vacuolated cells undergo vacuole fusion to form a single large, fluid-filled vacuole that fills the cytoplasmic space and contributes to vacuolated cell expansion. When this process goes awry the notochord lacks sufficient hydrostatic pressure to support vertebral bone deposition resulting in adult spines with misshapen vertebral bones and scoliosis. However, it remains unclear whether endochondral bone and the notochord share common genetic and cellular mechanisms for regulating cell and tissue expansion. Here, we demonstrate that the 5'inositol phosphatase gene, inppl1a, regulates notochord expansion, spine morphogenesis, and endochondral bone lengthening in zebrafish. Furthermore, we show that inppl1a regulates notochord expansion independent of vacuole fusion, thereby genetically decoupling these processes. We demonstrate that inppl1a dependent notochord expansion is essential to establish normal mechanical properties of the notochord to facilitate the development of a straight spine. Finally, we find that inppl1a is also important for endochondral bone lengthening in fish, as has been shown in the human INPPL1 related endochondral bone disorder Opsismodysplasia. Overall, this work reveals a conserved mechanism of cell size regulation that influences disparate tissues critical for skeletal development and short stature disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877204

Using a novel assay for high-resolution live imaging of regenerating adult vertebrate neurons, we identify acute fragmentation and rapid recompaction of the somatic Golgi as a key driver of peripheral neuron regeneration, implicating this organelle as a therapeutic target in an area of clinical unmet need. Compaction of the fragmented Golgi facilitates stepwise recruitment of the microtubule nucleation factors AKAP9 and gamma-tubulin within a discrete period that corresponds with acentrosomal Golgi-mediated microtubule nucleation. Furthermore, disruption of AKAP9 or gamma-tubulin recruitment compromises microtubule nucleation leading to impaired regeneration. Crucially, these mechanisms are conserved in the contexts of in vivo rat sciatic nerve transection and in primary human peripheral neurons. This work transforms our understanding of the cell intrinsic mechanisms that render injured peripheral neurons competent to initiate axon regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877204

Ten extant subfamilies are currently described and Macropathinae, which comprises the entirety of the fauna in South America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, is thought to be the most ancient of these. The New Zealand rhaphidophorid fauna supports high phylogenetic diversity throughout its mesic zone, with most species occurring above-ground. In contrast, the Australian fauna is poorly known, with an apparently greater relative proportion of species utilising caves as refugia. A robust phylogenetic framework is needed to underpin future taxonomic work on the group and potentially contrasting patterns of taxonomic diversity within Macropathinae. Here, we performed fossil-calibrated phylogenetic analysis using whole mitochondrial genomes and nuclear markers to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Macropathinae, with a focus on the Australian fauna. By dramatically increasing taxon sampling relative to past studies, we recover the Australian fauna as rampantly polyphyletic, with the remaining Macropathinae nested amongst six distinct Australian lineages. Deep divergences between major clades imply additional Australian lineages remain undetected, either due to extinction or sampling bias, and have likely confounded past biogeographic signal. We infer the radiation of Macropathinae began during the Lower Jurassic prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana with a potential Pangaean origin for Rhaphidophoridae. Finally, we find evidence for several undescribed taxa of Australian Rhaphidophoridae, all of which qualify as short-range endemics, and discuss the conservation implications of these restricted distributions.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877204

This capability results in high temporal resolution, reduced data redundancy, and a wide dynamic range. This makes EBS ideal for Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) as SMLM relies on the sequential imaging of sparse, blinking fluorescent emitters to achieve super-resolution. Recent studies have shown that EBS can effectively capture these emitters, achieving spatial resolution comparable to traditional cameras. However, existing analyses of event-based SMLM (eveSMLM) data have relied on converting event lists into image frames for conventional analysis, limiting the full potential of the technology.

To overcome this limitation, we developed EVE, a specialized software for analyzing eveSMLM data. EVE offers an integrated platform for detection, localization, and post-processing, with various algorithmic options tailored for the unique structure of eveSMLM data. EVE is user-friendly and features an open, modular infrastructure that supports ongoing development and optimization. EVE is the first dedicated tool for event-based SMLM, transforming the analysis process to fully utilize the spatiotemporal data generated by EBS. This allows researchers to explore the full potential of eveSMLM and encourages the development of new analytical methods and experimental improvements.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877204

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1723586877204

ObjectiveThis cross-sectional study examined the relationships between macronutrients, dietary components, and sleep parameters, considering their interdependencies.

MethodsData from 4,825 users of sleep and nutrition apps for at least 7 days were analyzed. Multivariable regression analysis investigated associations between quartiles of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate, and total fat, including saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats), dietary components (sodium, potassium, dietary fiber, and sodium-to-potassium ratio), and sleep variables (total sleep time [TST], sleep latency [SL], and % wakefulness after sleep onset [%WASO]). Nutrients were divided into quartiles, with the lowest intake group as the reference. Compositional data analysis accounted for interdependencies among macronutrients. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI).

ResultsHigher protein intake was associated with longer TST in the 3rd (B = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.26) and 4th quartiles (B = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.27). Higher total fat intake was linked to shorter TST in the 3rd (B = -0.11, 95% CI = -0.20, -0.27) and 4th quartiles (B = -0.16, 95% CI = -0.25, -0.07). Higher carbohydrate intake was associated with shorter %WASO in the 3rd (B = -0.82, 95% CI = -1.37, -0.26) and 4th quartiles (B = -0.57, 95% CI = -1.13, -0.01), while higher total fat intake was linked to longer %WASO in the 4th quartile (B = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.06, 1.18).

A higher sodium-to-potassium ratio was linked to shorter TST in the 3rd (B = -0.11, 95% CI = -0.20, -0.02) and 4th quartiles (B = -0.19, 95% CI = -0.28, -0.10), longer SL in the 2nd (B = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.08, 1.98) and 4th quartiles (B = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.53, 2.47), and longer %WASO in the 4th quartile (B = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.15, 1.28). Compositional data analysis, involving 6% changes in macronutrient proportions, showed higher protein intake correlated with longer TST (B = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.18, 0.35), while more monounsaturated fats were linked to longer SL (B = 4.64, 95% CI = 1.93, 7.34) and %WASO (B = 2.21, 95% CI = 0.63, 3.78). Higher polyunsaturated fat intake correlated with shorter TST (B = -0.22, 95% CI = -0.39, -0.05), shorter SL (B = -4.72, 95% CI = -6.58, -2.86), and shorter %WASO (B = -2.00, 95% CI = -3.08, -0.92).

We additionally re-examine the spatial positioning of skeletal material and associated sediments within the Puzzle Box area, from which abundant H. naledi remains representing a minimum of six individuals were recovered in 2013 and 2014. Multiple lines of evidence exclude the hypothesis that skeletal remains from these three areas come from bodies that decomposed on the floor of the chamber or within a shallow depression prior to burial by sediments.

Standard Visium capture areas (6.5mm by 6.5mm) limit the survey of larger tissue structures, but combining overlapping images and associated gene expression data allow for more complex study designs. Current software can handle nested or partial image overlaps, but is designed for merging up to two capture areas, and cannot account for some technical scenarios related to capture area alignment.

ResultsWe generated Visium data from a postmortem human tissue sample such that two capture areas were partially overlapping and a third one was adjacent. We developed the R/Bioconductor package visiumStitched, which facilitates stitching the images together with Fiji (ImageJ), and constructing SpatialExperiment R objects with the stitched images and gene expression data. visiumStitched constructs an artificial hexagonal array grid which allows seamless downstream analyses such as spatially-aware clustering without discarding data from overlapping spots.

In Eurasia, prehistoric migration and population replacement have affected present-day humans. The available high-quality genetic evidence for prehistoric migration in eastern Eurasia, particularly in the Far East, is still limited. We succeeded in obtaining low-contaminant, high-coverage genomes from middle-Yayoi (>46-fold coverage) and Initial Jomon (>67-fold coverage) individuals from mainland Japan. This study demonstrated that the Yayoi individual exhibited a genetic profile distinct from that of the indigenous Jomon population of the Japanese archipelago, suggesting that Yayoi ancestry was connected to the peopling of the Eurasian continent. Our high-coverage genome provides interesting insights into the evolution of copy number polymorphisms related to the dietary styles of ancient Japanese people. The copy number estimates of the amylase gene for Yayoi individuals were comparable to those of present-day East Asians who have diets high in starch. This suggests that the population in the middle Yayoi period may have already adapted to high-starch diets, which may have been related to paddy rice agriculture introduced from the continent. Furthermore, individuals from the initial Jomon period showed high amylase copy numbers comparable to those from modern East Eurasia, including modern Japanese. This suggests that some Jomon people may have consumed a high-starch diet then. The high-coverage whole-genome sequence also revealed differences in the demographic backgrounds of the two ancestral populations during the Yayoi and Jomon periods. Our results shed light on the prehistorical events and origins of related migrations from Eurasia at that time and their genetic background, cultural transformations, and links to modern Japanese people.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877204

Despite the far-reaching epidemiological implications of this trend, the extent to which antimicrobial resistance load varies within human populations and the drivers that contribute most to this variation remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate in a representative cohort of 7,095 Finnish adults1 that socio-demographic factors, lifestyle, and gut microbial community composition shape resistance selection and transmission processes. Antimicrobial resistance gene load was linked not only to prior use of antibiotics, as anticipated, but also to frequent consumption of fresh vegetables and poultry, two food groups previously reported to contain antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Interestingly, ARG load was not associated with high-fat and -sugar foods. Furthermore, antimicrobial resistance gene load was systematically higher in females and the generally healthier high-income demographics in urban and densely populated areas. Data from this prospective cohort with a 17-year follow-up suggests that the prognostic potential of antimicrobial resistome is comparable to blood pressure for mortality and sepsis. These findings highlight population-level risks and socio-demographic dimensions of antimicrobial resistance that are particularly relevant in the current context of global urbanization and middle-class growth.","NA","medrxiv",1723586877204

We identify error-correcting turns during navigation and use whole-brain calcium imaging and cell-specific perturbations to determine their neural underpinnings. These turns occur as motor sequences accompanied by neural sequences, in which defined neurons activate in a stereotyped order during each turn. Distinct neurons in this sequence respond to sensory cues, anticipate upcoming turn directions, and drive movement, linking key features of this sensorimotor behavior across time.

Upon treatment with inflammatory soup, we observed no changes in neuronal transcription or functional responses upon calcium imaging, and only a very minor increase in resting membrane potential via whole cell patch clamping. Similarly small changes were observed when treating mouse primary sensory neurons with inflammatory soup. A semi-systematic re-examination of past literature further indicated that observed effects of inflammatory mediators on dissociated sensory neuron cultures are generally very small.

Most mammals are susceptible to progressive age-related hearing loss; however, the evolution of biosonar, which requires the ability to hear low-intensity echoes from outgoing sonar signals, may have selected against the development of hearing deficits in echolocating bats. Although many echolocating bats exhibit exceptional longevity and rely on acoustic behaviors for survival to old age, relatively little is known about the aging bat auditory system. In this study, we used DNA methylation to estimate the ages of wild-caught big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and measured hearing sensitivity in young and aging bats using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). We found no evidence for hearing deficits in aging bats, demonstrated by comparable thresholds and similar ABR wave and DPOAE amplitudes across age groups. We additionally found no significant histological evidence for cochlear aging, with similar hair cell counts, afferent, and efferent innervation patterns in young and aging bats. Here we demonstrate that big brown bats show minimal evidence for age-related loss of peripheral hearing sensitivity and therefore represent informative models for investigating mechanisms that may preserve hearing function over a long lifetime.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877204

Using a chemical-genetic approach, we identified genes in Escherichia coli that are important for growth in G4-stabilizing conditions. Reducing levels of elongation factor Tu or slowing translation elongation with chloramphenicol suppress the effects of G4 stabilization. In contrast, reducing expression of certain translation termination or ribosome recycling proteins is detrimental to growth in G4-stabilizing conditions. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses demonstrate that ribosome assembly factors and other proteins involved in translation are less abundant in G4-stabilizing conditions. Our integrated systems approach allowed us to propose a model for how RNA G4s can present barriers to E. coli growth and that reducing the rate of translation can compensate for G4-related stress.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877204

Integrative analysis revealed baseline biomarkers associated with successful responses, indicating that TPE-IVIG treatment benefits those with a poorer baseline health status.

Plasmid-associated TraT sequences largely cluster into two separate lineages that have more recently evolved, incorporating TraT from Enterobacterales IncF and Legionellaceae F-like plasmids.

For all isolates, we generate hybrid assemblies and co-amoxiclav MICs, and for a subset (n=67/377), blaTEM-1 qPCR expression data. First, we test whether certain E. coli lineages are intrinsically better or worse at expressing blaTEM-1, for example, due to lineage differences in regulatory systems, which are challenging to directly quantify. Using genotypic features of the isolates (blaTEM-1 promoter variants and copy number), we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model for blaTEM-1 expression that controls for phylogeny. We establish that blaTEM-1 expression intrinsically varies across the phylogeny, with some lineages (e.g. phylogroups B1 and C, ST12) better at expression than others (e.g. phylogroups E and F, ST372). Next, we test whether phylogenetic variation in expression influences the resistance of the isolates. With a second model, we use genotypic features (blaTEM-1 promoter variants, copy number, duplications; ampC promoter variants; efflux pump AcrF presence) to predict isolate MIC, again controlling for phylogeny. Lastly, we use a third model to demonstrate that the phylogenetic influence on blaTEM-1 expression causally drives the variation in co-amoxiclav MIC.

Both proteins have been implicated in sterol homeostasis of yeast and humans. Here, we investigate sterol and lipid binding of the NCR1/NPC2 transport system and determine crystal structures of the sterol-binding NTD. The NTD binds both ergosterol and cholesterol, with nearly identical conformations of the binding pocket. Apart from sterols, the NTD can also bind fluorescent analogs of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine as well as sphingosine and ceramide. We confirm the multi-lipid scope of the NCR1/NPC2 system using photo-crosslinkable and clickable lipid analogs, namely pac-cholesterol, pac-sphingosine and pac-ceramide.

This bias can be mitigated by aligning to pangenome graphs to incorporate documented organismic variation, but this approach still suffers from substitution patterns due to chemical damage. We introduce a novel methodology introducing the RYmer index, a variant of the commonly-used minimizer index which represents purines (A,G) and pyrimidines (C,T) as R and Y respectively. This creates an indexing scheme robust to the aforementioned chemical damage. We implemented SAFARI, an ancient DNA damage-aware version of the pangenome aligner vg giraffe which uses RYmers to rescue alignments containing deaminated seeds. We show that our approach produces more correct alignments from ancient DNA sequences than current approaches while maintaining a tolerable rate of spurious alignments. In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithm improves the estimate of the rate of ancient DNA damage, especially for highly damaged samples.

However, in most cases we have an incomplete understanding of the patterns of motoneuron activity that generate distinct actions and how upstream premotor circuits select and assemble such motor programmes. In this study, we used two closely related but kinematically distinct types of saccadic eye movement in larval zebrafish as a model to examine circuit control of movement diversity. In contrast to the prevailing view of a final common pathway, we found that in oculomotor nucleus, distinct subsets of motoneurons were engaged for each saccade type. This type-specific recruitment was topographically organised and aligned with ultrastructural differences in motoneuron morphology and afferent synaptic innervation. Medially located motoneurons were active for both saccade types and circuit tracing revealed a type-agnostic premotor pathway that appears to control their recruitment. By contrast, a laterally located subset of motoneurons was specifically active for hunting-associated saccades and received premotor input from pretectal hunting command neurons. Our data support a model in which generalist and action-specific premotor pathways engage distinct subsets of motoneurons to elicit varied movements of the same body part that subserve distinct behavioural functions.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877204

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1723586877204

However, the mechanism by which PRMT5 couples splicing to transcriptional output is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that a major function of PRMT5 activity is to promote chromatin escape of a novel, large class of mRNAs that we term Genomically Retained Incompletely Processed Polyadenylated Transcripts (GRIPPs). Using nascent and total transcriptomics, spike-in controlled fractionated cell transcriptomics, and total and fractionated cell proteomics, we show that PRMT5 inhibition and knockdown of the PRMT5 SNRP (Sm protein) adapter protein pICln (CLNS1A), but not type I PRMT inhibition, leads to gross detention of mRNA, SNRPB, and SNRPD3 proteins on chromatin. Compared to most transcripts, these chromatin-trapped polyadenylated RNA transcripts have more introns, are spliced slower, and are enriched in detained introns. Using a combination of PRMT5 inhibition and inducible isogenic wildtype and arginine-mutant SNRPB, we show that arginine methylation of these snRNPs is critical for mediating their homeostatic chromatin and RNA interactions. Overall, we conclude that a major role for PRMT5 is in controlling transcript processing and splicing completion to promote chromatin escape and subsequent nuclear export.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877204

Biomolecular condensates have emerged as an attractive signaling substrate in this process, but the underlying mechanisms are not well-understood. Here, we probed the molecular basis of YAP signal integration through transcriptional condensates. Leveraging light-sheet single-molecule imaging and synthetic condensates, we demonstrate charge-mediated co-condensation of the transcriptional regulators YAP and Mediator into transcriptionally active condensates in stem cells. IDR sequence analysis and YAP protein engineering demonstrate that instead of the net charge, YAP signaling specificity is established through its negative charge patterning that interacts with Mediators positive charge blocks. The mutual enhancement of YAP/Mediator co-condensation is counteracted by negative feedback from transcription, driving an adaptive transcriptional response that is well-suited for decoding dynamic inputs. Our work reveals a molecular framework for YAP condensate formation and sheds new light on the function of YAP condensates for emergent gene regulatory behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877204

Changes in the extracellular matrix such as aberrant deposition, densification and increased crosslinking are hallmarks of late-stage fibrotic diseases that often lead to organ dysfunction. Biomaterials have been widely used to mimic the mechanical properties of the fibrotic matrix and study cell function. However, the initiation of fibrosis has largely been overlooked, due to the challenges in recapitulating early fibrotic lesions within the native extracellular microenvironment. Using visible light mediated photochemistry, we induced local crosslinking and stiffening of extracellular matrix proteins within ex vivo murine and human tissue. In ex vivo lung tissue of epithelial cell lineage-traced mice, local matrix crosslinking mimicked early fibrotic lesions that increased alveolar epithelial cell spreading, differentiation and extracellular matrix remodeling. However, inhibition of cytoskeletal tension or integrin engagement reduced epithelial cell spreading and differentiation, resulting in alveolar epithelial cell dedifferentiation and reduced extracellular matrix deposition. Our findings emphasize the role of local extracellular matrix crosslinking and remodeling in early-stage tissue fibrosis and have implications for ex vivo disease modeling and applications to other tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877204

These structures, all obtained at nominally zero membrane potential in detergent micelles, reveal distinct ion-occupancy patterns in the selectivity filter. The first two structures are very similar to those reported in the related Shaker channel and the much-studied Kv1.2-2.1 chimeric channel. On the other hand, two new structures show unexpected patterns of ion occupancy. First, the toxin -Dendrotoxin, like Charybdotoxin, is seen to attach to the negatively-charged channel outer mouth, and a lysine residue penetrates into the selectivity filter, with the terminal amine coordinated by carbonyls, partially disrupting the outermost ion-binding site. In the remainder of the filter two densities of bound ions are observed, rather than three as observed with other toxin-blocked Kv channels. Second, a structure of Kv1.2 in Na+ solution does not show collapse or destabilization of the selectivity filter, but instead shows an intact selectivity filter with ion density in each binding site. We also attempted to image the C-type inactivated Kv1.2 W366F channel in Na+ solution, but the protein conformation was seen to be highly variable and only a low-resolution structure could be obtained. These findings present new insights into the stability of the selectivity filter and the mechanism of toxin block of this intensively studied, voltage-gated potassium channel.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877204

GroEL also binds translating ribosomes in vivo, suggesting an additional role in cotranslational folding. Here, we used biochemical reconstitution, structural proteomics and electron microscopy to study the mechanism by which GroEL/ES engages nascent polypeptides. We show that GroEL binds nascent chains on the inside of its cavity via the apical domains and disordered C-terminal tails, resulting in local structural destabilization of the substrate. Ribosome-tethered nascent proteins are partially encapsulated upon GroES binding to GroEL, and refold in the chaperonin cavity. Reconstitution of chaperone competition at the ribosome shows that both Trigger factor and GroEL can be accommodated on long nascent chains, but GroEL and DnaK are mutually antagonistic. Our findings extend the role of GroEL/ES in de novo protein folding, and reveal an unexpected plasticity of the chaperonin mechanism that allows cotranslational substrate encapsulation.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877204

Understanding the underlying mechanisms holds potential to mitigate health risks and reduces the steadily increasing number of heat-related casualties associated with global warming. Here we report the identification of a discrete group of hypothalamic preoptic neurons that transform to rheostatically increase their activity over the course of heat acclimation, a property required for mice to become heat tolerant. Peripheral thermo-afferent pathways via the parabrachial nucleus activate preoptic neurons and mediate acute heat-defense mechanisms in non-acclimated animals. However, long-term heat exposure promotes the preoptic neurons to gain intrinsically warm-sensitive activity, independent of thermo-afferent parabrachial input. Our data shows that their newly gained cell-autonomous warm-sensitivity is required to recruit peripheral heat tolerance mechanisms in acclimated animals. Mechanistically, we find a combination of increased sodium leak current and enhanced utilization of the Nav1.3 ion channel to drive their pacemaker-like, warm-sensitive activity. We propose a salient neuronal plasticity mechanism, adaptively driving acclimation to promote heat tolerance.

In dairy cows, infection resulted in no nasal shedding, but severe acute mammary gland infection with necrotizing mastitis and high fever was observed for both H5N1 genotypes/strains. Milk production was rapidly and drastically reduced and the physical condition of the cows was severely compromised. Virus titers in milk rapidly peaked at 108 TCID50/mL, but systemic infection did not ensue. Notably, adaptive mutation PB2 E627K emerged after intramammary replication of H5N1 euDG.

To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Warm White Light-Emitting Diode (LED), Cool White LED, Blue LED, and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic Puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation, and husbandry programs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic Puffin strandings remains to be the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine if aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877205

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1723586877205

The mechanisms of lineage restriction remain enigmatic. We previously defined occlusion as a mode of gene silencing wherein affected genes lack the transcriptional potency to be activated by their cognate transcription factors (TFs). Here, we present a comprehensive mechanistic basis of lineage restriction as driven by gene occlusion. Specifically, we show that genes can become occluded simply by the default action of chromatinization in the absence of TF binding, that naive pluripotent stem cells establish full developmental potency via their capacity to erase occlusion, that primed pluripotent cells shut down this deocclusion ability in preparation for differentiation, that differentiating cells become increasingly restricted in their fate potency by the irreversible occlusion of lineage-inappropriate genes, and that stem cells employ placeholder factors (PFs) to protect silent genes needed for later activation from premature occlusion. Collectively, these mechanisms drive lineage restriction whereby the transcriptionally potent portion of the genome shrinks progressively during differentiation, rendering the fate potency of developing cells to also dwindle progressively.

A handful of ncRNAs have characterised functions, including important epigenetic roles in development and disease. Neither ncRNA nor multinucleated muscle is ideally suited to sequencing technologies. We therefore used customised RNA profiling methods and quantitative network modelling to study cell-type specific ncRNA transcriptome responses during load-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy. We completed five independent supervised exercise-training studies (n=144) and 61% of individuals accrued muscle mass beyond normal technical variation (lean mass responders, LMR). The remainder were defined as having no measurable lean mass response (NMLMR). Fifty ncRNA genes (FDR <1%) were differentially regulated in LMR, and in total we identified 110 ncRNAs for further study. A network model of the human muscle transcriptome was built (n=437 samples), assigning ncRNAs to protein coding modules representing functional pathways or single-cell types. We identified that the known hypertrophy-related ncRNA, CYTOR, was leukocyte-associated in vivo in humans (FDR = 4.9 x10-7; Fold Enrichment [FE] = 6.6). Other ncRNA modules included PPP1CB-DT, which was segregated with myofibril assembly genes (FDR = 8.15 x 10-8; FE = 47.5), while EEF1A1P24 and TMSB4XP8 were associated with vascular remodelling and angiogenesis genes (FDR = 2.77 x 10-5; FE = 3.6). MYREM was positively associated with hypertrophy, and we established its myonuclear expression pattern in vivo in humans using spatial transcriptomics probes. We show that single-cell type associations of ncRNA are identifiable from bulk transcriptomic data and that hypertrophy-linked ncRNA genes appear to mediate their association with muscle growth via multiple cell types.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877205

We demonstrate that human cortical thickness development and aging trajectories unfold along patterns of molecular and cellular brain organization, traceable from population-level to individual developmental trajectories. During childhood and adolescence, cortex-wide spatial distributions of dopaminergic receptors, inhibitory neurons, glial cell populations, and brain-metabolic features explain up to 50% of variance associated with a lifespan model of regional cortical thickness trajectories. In contrast, modeled cortical thickness change patterns during adulthood are best explained by cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptor and transporter distributions. These relationships are supported by developmental gene expression trajectories and translate to individual longitudinal data from over 8,000 adolescents, explaining up to 59% of developmental change at cohort- and 18% at single-subject level.

In particular, clustering remains one of the most common tools to dissect the chemical space. Unfortunately, most current approaches present unfavorable time and memory scaling, which makes them unsuitable to handle million- and billion-sized sets. Here, we propose to bypass these problems with a time- and memory-efficient clustering algorithm, BitBIRCH. This method uses a tree structure similar to the one found in the Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies (BIRCH) algorithm to ensure O(N) time scaling. BitBIRCH leverages the instant similarity (iSIM) formalism to process binary fingerprints, allowing the use of Tanimoto similarity, and reducing memory requirements. Our tests show that BitBIRCH is already > 1,000 times faster than standard implementations of the Taylor-Butina clustering for libraries with 1,500,000 molecules. BitBIRCH increases efficiency without compromising the quality of the resulting clusters. We explore strategies to handle large sets, which we applied in the clustering of one billion molecules under 5 hours using a parallel/iterative BitBIRCH approximation.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877205

In this study, we inspect the metabolic profile of metagenome-assembled genomes along the pronounced redox gradient of the water column in an anchialine cave. Bridging neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography and niche theory, our analysis uses focal metabolic capabilities while also incorporating individuality by looking into background metabolic capabilities of each individual and further includes spatial distribution of microbes to delineate their niche space.

MethodsThis study uses the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to investigate the potential relationship between vaccinations and the incidence of NMOSD, AE, and MOGAD. Potential risk factors, such as age, sex, type of vaccine, and previous history of autoimmune diseases, were examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

ResultsOur analysis included 161 cases: 72 NMOSD, 82 AE, and 7 MOGAD. The COVID-19 vaccine was implicated in 19/72 (26.3%) NMOSD, 43/82 (52.4%) of AE and 6/7 (85.7%) of MOGAD. The subacute temporal profile (OR 24.4, p = 0.004) and the presence of any comorbidity (OR 12.49, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with hospitalization for those with NMOSD. The subacute onset of symptoms and encephalopathy was statistically significant for hospitalization (OR 6.15, p = 0.048) and (OR 10.3, p = 0.005) respectively for patients with AE.

Identifying and controlling dose-dependent transgenes require tools for precisely titrating expression. To this end, we developed a highly modular, extensible framework called DIAL for building editable promoters that allow for fine-scale, heritable changes in transgene expression. Using DIAL, we increase expression by recombinase-mediated excision of spacers between the binding sites of a synthetic zinc finger transcription factor and the core promoter. By nesting varying numbers and lengths of spacers, DIAL generates a tunable range of unimodal setpoints from a single promoter. Through small-molecule control of transcription factors and recombinases, DIAL supports temporally defined, user-guided control of transgene expression that is extensible to additional transcription factors. Lentiviral delivery of DIAL generates multiple setpoints in primary cells and iPSCs. As promoter editing generates stable states, DIAL setpoints are heritable, facilitating mapping of transgene levels to phenotypes. The DIAL framework opens new opportunities for tailoring transgene expression and improving the predictability and performance of gene circuits across diverse applications.

HighlightsPromoter editing generates unimodal setpoints from a single synthetic promoter

DIAL setpoints are tuned by the length of an excisable spacer within the promoter

Here, we sequenced and analyzed 382 full-length OROV genomes from human samples collected between 2022 and 2024 from all four states, aiming to trace the origin and genetic evolution of OROV leading to the current outbreak. Genomic analyses revealed that the recent upsurge of OROV cases in the Brazilian Amazon region coincides with the emergence of a novel reassortant viral lineage containing the M segment of viruses detected in the eastern Amazon region from 2009 to 2018 and the L and S segments of viruses detected in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador from 2008 to 2021. The novel reassortant OROV lineage likely emerged in the Central region of the AM state between 2010 and 2014 and displayed a long-range silent dispersion during the second half of the 2010s. The 2022-2024 OROV epidemic was spatially segregated into three major subpopulations located in RR, AMACRO (a bordering region between AC, RO, and AM-Southern region), and AM-Central (which includes the Amazonas capital, Manaus) regions. The peak of OROV transmissions in all regions occurred during the rainy season in the Amazon basin. Furthermore, our phylodynamics reconstructions showed that OROV spread was driven mainly by short-range (< 2 km) movements, with an average dispersal rate [&le;] 1.2 km/day, consistent with the pattern of an active flight of infected vectors. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion (22%) of long-range (> 10 km) OROV migrations were also detected, consistent with viral dispersion via human activities. Our data provides an unprecedented view of the real-time spread and evolution of a neglected emergent human pathogen. Moreover, our results emphasize the need for widespread, long-term genomic surveillance to better understand the real burden of OROV within and beyond the Amazon region.","NA","medrxiv",1723586877205

This study investigates virological factors contributing to the reemergence of Oropouche fever in Brazil between 2023 and 2024.

MethodsIn this study, we combined OROV genomic, molecular, and serological data from Brazil from 1 January 2015 to 29 June 2024, along with in vitro and in vivo characterization. Molecular screening data included 93 patients with febrile illness between January 2023 and February 2024 from the Amazonas State. Genomic data comprised two genomic OROV sequences from patients. Serological data were obtained from neutralizing antibody tests comparing the prototype OROV strain BeAn 19991 and the 2024 epidemic strain. Epidemiological data included aggregated cases reported to the Brazilian Ministry of Health from 1 January 2014 to 29 June 2024.

FindingsIn 2024, autochthonous OROV infections were detected in previously non-endemic areas across all five Brazilian regions. Cases were reported in 19 of 27 federal units, with 83.2% (6,895 of 8,284) of infections in Northern Brazil and a nearly 200-fold increase in incidence compared to reported cases over the last decade. We detected OROV RNA in 10.8% (10 of 93) of patients with febrile illness between December 2023 and May 2024 in Amazonas. We demonstrate that the 2023-2024 epidemic was caused by a novel OROV reassortant that replicated approximately 100-fold higher titers in mammalian cells compared to the prototype strain. The 2023-2024 OROV reassortant displayed plaques earlier than the prototype, produced 1.7 times more plaques, and plaque sizes were 2.5 larger compared to the prototype. Furthermore, serum collected in 2016 from previously OROV-infected individuals showed at least a 32-fold reduction in neutralizing capacity against the reassortment strain compared to the prototype.

InterpretationThese findings provide a comprehensive assessment of Oropouche fever in Brazil and contribute to a better understanding of the 2023-2024 OROV reemergence. The recent increased incidence may be related to a higher replication efficiency of a new reassortant virus that also evades previous immunity.","NA","medrxiv",1723586877205

Cell walls are highly dynamic structures that act both as a structural material and as a hub for a wide range of signaling processes. Despite its crucial role in all aspects of the plant life cycle, live dynamical imaging of the cell wall and its functional properties has remained challenging. Here, we introduce CarboTag, a modular toolbox for live functional imaging of plant walls. CarboTag relies on a small molecular motif, a pyridine boronic acid, that targets its cargo to the cell wall, is non-toxic and ensures rapid tissue permeation. We designed a suite of cell wall imaging probes based on CarboTag in any desired color for multiplexing. Moreover, we created new functional reporters for live quantitative imaging of key cell wall features: network porosity, cell wall pH and the presence of reactive oxygen species. CarboTag opens the way to dynamical and quantitative mapping of cell wall responses at subcellular resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877205

Specifically, we enter n variations of k pattern classes (n*k patterns) onto a cortex-like balanced inhibitory-excitatory network with heterogeneous neurons, and let the pattern spread within the recurrent network. We show that we can identify high mutual-information (MI) neurons as major information-bearing elements within each pattern representation. We employ a simple one-shot adaptive (learning) process focusing on high MI neurons and inhibition. Such  localist plasticity has high efficiency, because it requires only few adaptations for each pattern. Specifically, we store k=10 patterns of size s=400 in a 1000/1200 neuron network. We stimulate high MI neurons and in this way recall patterns, such that the whole network represents this pattern. We assess the quality of the representation (a) before learning, when entering the pattern into a naive network and (b) after learning, on the adapted network, during recall. The recalled patterns could be easily recognized by a trained classifier. The pattern  unfolds over the recurrent network with high similarity, albeit compressed, with respect to the original input pattern. We discuss the distribution of neuron properties in the network, and find that an initial Gaussian or uniform distribution changes into a more heavy-tailed, lognormal distribution during the adaptation process. The remarkable result is that we are able to achieve reliable pattern recall by stimulating only high information neurons. This work has interesting technical applications, and provides a biologically-inspired model of cortical memory.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877205

Herein, we developed a highly modular saponin-based nanoparticle platform incorporating toll-like receptor agonists (TLRas) including TLR1/2a, TLR4a, TLR7/8a adjuvants and their mixtures. These various TLRa-SNP adjuvant constructs induce unique acute cytokine and immune-signaling profiles, leading to specific Th-responses that could be of interest depending on the target disease for prevention. In a murine vaccine study, the adjuvants greatly improved the potency, durability, breadth, and neutralization of both COVID-19 and HIV vaccine candidates, suggesting the potential broad application of these adjuvant constructs to a range of different antigens. Overall, this work demonstrates a modular TLRa-SNP adjuvant platform which could improve the design of vaccines for and dramatically impact modern vaccine development.

The aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity of earwax on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli isolated from skin and stool respectively. Bacteriological investigations were carried out using culture and morphological characteristics, conventional biochemical tests and antibiotic susceptibility testing of both earwax and conventional antibiotics against the presumptive isolates. Occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus (58.3%) and Escherichia coli (45.8%) in skin and stool samples were respectively determined based on cultural and morphological characteristics. Conventional biochemical tests were carried out on the 14 and 10 presumptive Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli isolates and then 10 and 8 presumptive isolates were detected respectively. The antibacterial activity of the test agent was determined using the agar well diffusion technique; five different concentrations (20% v/v, 40% v/v, 60% v/v, 80% v/v, and 100% v/v) of the test agents were evaluated against the bacterial isolates. The earwax showed antibacterial activity against both isolates (except the 20% v/v for Staphylococcus aureus) at all concentrations used with antibacterial activity directly proportional to earwax concentration and a better antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (zone of inhibition 20mm) aureus than Escherichia coli. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out on the 10(41.7%) and 8(33.3%) presumptive isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli respectively based on Kirby Bauer method. Highest rate of susceptibilities of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates to antibiotics were observed in Erythromycin (100%), while for Escherichia coli were observed in Erythromycin and Levofloxacin (100%). Meanwhile, highest rate of resistant to Staphylococcus aureus isolates were observed in Gentamicin (100%) while for Escherichia coli was observed in Amoxicillin (100%). This study shows that earwax plays a critical role in the fight against infectious microorganisms as some of the antibiotics.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877205

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877205

The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g. upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% and 14% of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56.

However, this notion has recently been challenged. Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877205

However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role. Our data show that the clonal dynamics of blood are consistent with a set of remarkably simple evolutionary rules which strike a balance between chance and determinism.","NA","biorxiv",1723586877205
