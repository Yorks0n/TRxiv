These artifacts can affect demultiplexing accuracy and downstream analyses. Results We performed a rapid barcoding experiment on 66 diagnostic samples and found that 83% of reads carried the expected single-barcode pattern, while 17% contained multiple barcodes or other artifacts. Current demultiplexers, including the widely used Dorado, fail to correctly handle these complex cases, leaving approximately 7% of reads partially trimmed and contaminated with adapter fragments. Additional issues include the presence of two barcodes at the same read end - either identical, originating from the same sample, or different, introduced after pooling. The latter can lead to barcode bleeding when the outer barcode is incorrectly selected. To address these challenges, we developed Barbell, a pattern-aware demultiplexer that detects all barcode configurations. Barbell reduces trimming errors by three orders of magnitude, minimizes barcode bleeding, and supports custom experimental setups such as shorter barcodes, dual-end barcodes, and custom flank sequences. Conclusions Our results highlight the impact of complex barcode attachments in Nanopore sequencing and demonstrate that Barbell drastically reduces their effects on downstream analyses.

All previously characterized retrons produce high levels of multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) in the cell by reverse transcription, which acts as an antitoxin in the absence of phage infection. However, we describe here a non-canonical mechanism for Type VI retrons, which do not produce detectable msDNA in the absence of phage, yet still provide phage defense. Focusing primarily on Retron-Vpa2, a Type VI retron from Vibrio parahaemolyticus, we show broad defense against phages and identify triggers of the system within phage recombination systems. Within the Retron-Vpa2 operon, we find a highly enriched, structured transcript that we term a hybrid RNA (hyRNA), which contains both the retrons reverse transcription template and a translationally repressed toxic effector coding sequence. We find that phage infection induces the accumulation of high levels of msDNA and that this msDNA is necessary for derepressing translation of the antiviral toxin. These findings present key biological and mechanistic insights into a distinct group of retrons while highlighting the diversity of systems that participate in bacterial immunity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 33 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time- dependent covariate) was evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, including adjusting for influenza activity as an effect modifier.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43920 (82.2%) were vaccinated by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1130 (2.12%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over time the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the risk of influenza was not significantly different during periods when influenza activity was low (HR, .70; 95% C.I., .42 - 1.15; P = .15) or medium (HR, 1.20; 95% C.I., .86 - 1.67; P = .28), but was significantly higher for the vaccinated state than the unvaccinated state when influenza activity was high (HR, 1.33; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.64; P = .009).

ConclusionsThis study was unable to find a protective influence of influenza vaccination among working-aged adults during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season and found that influenza vaccination was associated with a higher risk of influenza when influenza activity was high.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find a protective influence of influenza vaccination during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season and found a significantly higher risk of influenza with vaccination when influenza activity was high.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1761343764865

Here, we introduce TF-MAPs, a scalable and general platform to chart complete functional maps of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. We apply TF-MAPS to three human disease TFs: HNF1A, FOXG1 and FOXP1. Allostery in all three proteins is distance-dependent, anisotropic, and couples the DNA-binding interface to the protein surface. The allosteric surfaces of FOXG1 and FOXP1 are quite diverged, revealing a potential for protein-specific regulation in protein families. All three TFs have potentially druggable pockets where mutations have strong functional effects on binding, either within the binding interface or distant from it. Using TF-MAPS it should be possible to chart functional and allosteric maps for hundreds of human TFs and other DNA-binding proteins to understand DNA recognition and TF regulation, to mechanistically interpret clinical variants, and to guide the development of TF-modulating therapeutics.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Sanger Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cy4wa09"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Grant reference: 220540/Z/20/A, ‘Wellcome Sanger Institute Quinquennial Review 2021-2026’;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

Profiling 500,000 alleles across 74 cell types, scOUT-seq revealed that outcomes in most cell subtypes differ markedly from the bulk average. Various cell types shifted major repair classes, preferred different molecular sequences, and even enriched large structural variants, with distinctive patterns of allelic co-occurrence.

Understanding how gut microbes interact and contribute to plastic degradation is essential for developing potential microbiome-based bioremediation strategies. We isolated 183 microbes from wild Alaskan threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) guts across six lakes and screened for plastic degrading potential using lipase/esterase assays and biofilm formation on PET and PP. During the screen for microbes with plastic degrading potential, we discovered that stickleback gut microbiota members enhance and suppressed the lipase, esterase, and biofilm activity of other microbes. Isolates with the highest plastic degrading potential were incubated in minimal media with PET or PP as the sole carbon source to determine whether plastic degradation potential is enhanced. Surface analysis identified a Pseudomonas trivialis strain that exhibited degradation of PP in monoculture; however, this activity was suppressed in the presence of another gut isolate, Pseudomonas germanica. These results demonstrate that microbes associated with the wild threespine stickleback gut microbiome possess plastic degradation potential and provide insights into how microbial interactions can either promote or inhibit bioremediation of plastic pollution in cold-water environments.","[{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-253562-5022;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R15GM122038;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1126100;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

To discover regulators of microglial activation states, we conducted CRISPR interference screens in iPSC-derived microglia for inhibitors and activators of six microglial states. We identified transcriptional regulators for each of these states and characterized 31 regulators at the single-cell transcriptomic and cell-surface proteome level in two distinct iPSC-derived microglia models. Finally, we functionally characterized several regulators. STAT2 knockdown inhibits interferon response and lysosomal function. PRDM1 knockdown drives disease-associated and lipid-rich signatures and enhanced phagocytosis. DNMT1 knockdown results in widespread loss of methylation, activating negative regulators of interferon signaling. These findings provide a framework to direct microglial activation to selectively enrich microglial activation states, define their functional outputs, and inform future therapies.

HLA-B*07:02+ individuals living with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS (PMS) were characterized by a relative reduction in EBNA6-specific and MAG-specific CD8 T cells compared to healthy donors. Furthermore, both RRMS and PMS patients exhibited a delayed expansion of CMV- and laEBV-specific CD8 T cells compared to healthy donors indicating an age-specific interaction with disease. Female RRMS patients were moreover characterized by a specific reduction of laEBV-specific CD8 T cells compared to male RRMS patients. NAg-specific CD8 T cells recognized heterogeneous peptides, were of low cellular frequency in peripheral blood, and exhibited a circulating, naive-like, anergic phenotype. In contrast, virus-specific CD8 T cells were characterized by high-frequency cellular responses with an effector-like, tissue-homing phenotype. These immunophenotypes were largely shared between MS and healthy donors. Collectively, our data provide novel insights into CD8 T-cell recognition of both NAg and laEBV antigens in MS and constitute a key reference map of epitopes for further immunomonitoring of EBV- and self-specific CD8 T cells in health and disease.","[{""name"":""The Lundbeck Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R190-2014-4178;""},{""name"":""European Research Council ERC Consolidator"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MIMIC 101045517;""},{""name"":""Scleroseforeningen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/037s01565"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""A44005;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

CL have been described in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes but have not previously been reported in phages. We demonstrate that CL in coliphage T2 and T4 generates genomic and phenotypic diversity in resulting progeny to evade host defense, a process known as bet-hedging. Whole genome sequencing of T2 and T4 show similar levels of CL-driven sequence variation in dozens of other putative CL. Additional sequencing of T6, T7, Sec{varphi}27, ICP1 and ICP2, alongside bioinformatics of the BASEL phage collection reveals that putative CL are widespread in phages and are encoded in every functional class of genes. Collectively, our study describes a new paradigm for understanding phage replication in which CL drive genetic diversification and population heterogeneity to rapidly evolve.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GM139537;AI158433;GM088344;F31AI186463;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DEB-1813069;DEB-1951307;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

These chemically-identical ""mass tags"" conjugate to peptides to encode samples with different mass offsets for parallel analysis. The current state-of-the-art for multiplexing with non-isobaric mass tags was recently improved from 3-plex to 9-plex, but what is the largest plex size that can be reasonably achieved with current technology? A full answer to this question requires evaluating current mass spectrometry hardware, facets of which have been well-investigated by others. However, it may be under-appreciated that multiplexing 1000s of samples with mass tags does not actually require 1000s of isotopes, or 1000s of synthesis steps to create. Non-intuitively, high plex mass tags can require relatively few different isotopes. The focus of this exposition is to characterize the potential of the differential mass defect to create tens to over a thousand isotopologues of small molecules and how careful combinations of these small molecules can combinatorially scale the plex size to minimize synthetic steps. Importantly, we show that plex sizes in the hundreds, an order of magnitude greater than state-of-the-art, are achievable using molecules comparable in size to existing commercial tags, and that going beyond hundreds may require larger molecules. Approaches to achieve high-plex proteomics will almost certainly require using the differential mass defect, so we hope this exposition serves to accelerate progress in reagent development to achieve high plex proteomics.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

It facilitates molecular evolution and has been characterized in a variety of biological systems, but studies of prokaryotic promoters are limited. Prokaryotic promoters are non-coding DNA sequences that regulate transcription. The main housekeeping promoters ({sigma}70) share two sequence motifs called the -35 and the -10 box that are spaced 17{+/-}1 base pairs (bps) apart. The sequence of these boxes, their distance, and the existence of multiple nearby boxes can determine promoter strength, the ability of a promoter to drive high levels of transcription. Here we used computational modelling to show that the mutational robustness of {sigma}70 promoters - the persistence of promoter strength upon mutation - correlates with promoter strength itself. Mutational robustness is also influenced by potential overlaps between -10 and -35 boxes, and by specific positions within the boxes. It is higher when the boxes are exactly 17 bps apart. These findings can be partially explained by the flexibility of -35 boxes, which enables adjacent bases to create overlapping and new -35 boxes.

However, the causal relationship between HR and effective immunity remains unresolved. We show that the Arabidopsis cbp60g sard1 double mutant exhibits exaggerated ETI-associated HR but only partial resistance to bacterial and oomycete pathogens, thereby genetically uncoupling cell death from disease resistance without pleiotropic defects. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling reveals that the absence of CBP60g and SARD1 disrupts the balance between immune activators and suppressors, including reduced induction of the Nudix hydrolase NUDT7. Overexpression of NUDT7 diminishes but does not abolish the heightened HR phenotype in cbp60g sard1 mutant, indicating that multiple negative regulators act redundantly to restrain immune-associated cell death. These findings demonstrate that HR is not an obligatory determinant of effective resistance and provide mechanistic insight into how plants coordinate transcriptional networks to balance pathogen defence with the containment of host cell death. By refining the relationship between HR and immunity, this work challenges a long-standing paradigm in plant biology and advances our understanding of immune regulation.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101039824;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

We previously identified a 55-bp cis-repressive element in the PKD1 3'UTR. Here, we define a six-nucleotide miR-17 seed match within this element that is sufficient to reproduce PKD1 repression. In vivo base substitution of this motif stabilizes Pkd1 mRNA and increases polycystin-1 (PC1) protein levels, producing a robust reduction in cyst growth and preservation of kidney function in mouse models. To therapeutically recapitulate this effect, we developed a steric-blocking oligonucleotide that occludes the motif, stabilizes PKD1 transcript levels, increases PC1 expression, and mitigates cyst-pathogenic events in both murine and patient-derived ADPKD cells. Together, these findings establish a minimal, targetable cis-regulatory motif and provide proof-of-concept for oligonucleotide-mediated PKD1 derepression, while offering a potentially generalizable strategy to restore other haploinsufficient genes.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5R01DK102572;5R01DK133186;1R01DK139033;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

This process is driven by UBC13 and the B-family TLS polymerase REV3L, suggesting that in the absence of MRNIP, dysregulated MRE11 activity at chain termination sites licenses gap filling via template switching. In the absence of PRIMPOL-dependent repriming, MRNIP loss leads to paradoxical SMARCAL1, MRE11 and primosome-dependent ssDNA gaps, suggesting that nucleolytic digestion of reversed forks generates DNA intermediates that platform primase redundancy in the context of chain termination. We also highlight novel site-specific roles for the anti-resection factor 53BP1 in enabling primase redundancy via suppression of the nuclease EXO1, and in limiting the EXO1-dependent processing of post-replicative ssDNA gaps.

Yet, we lack a theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying oscillations in E-PV-SOM circuits and of the differences with respect to the classical mechanisms for oscillations in simpler E-I networks. Here, we derive a biologically realistic mean-field model of a canonical three-population E-PV-SOM circuit. This model robustly generates oscillations whose features are consistent with experimental observations, including the relative timing of PV and SOM activity and the effects of optogenetic perturbations. By reducing the model to a linear analytical form, we demonstrate that gamma oscillations emerge directly from the cell-specific connectivity of the three-population circuit. This connectivity motif alone accounts for experimentally observed phase relationships, with PV activity consistently leading that of SOM neurons. Together, this mean field model identifies a distinct structural mechanism giving rise to oscillations in canonical E-PV-SOM circuits and provides theoretical primitives for constructing large-scale, cell-type-specific models of cortical dynamics.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

In this field, the challenge lies in designing probes that are both sufficiently sensitive to environment, and specific in their subcellular localization. Here, we design Prodan-based polarity probes targeting the following organelles: mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes and lipid droplets. The new probes provide robust organelle targeting, except for the mitochondrial probe, whose targeting ability is cell type dependent. Due to operating range of Prodan fluorophore in the UV-Blue region, our probes can be easily combined with other fluorescent tags in the visible range. Therefore, polarity of sub-cellular compartments can be studied together with additional fluorescent reporters. We used these probes to show the polarity of organelle membranes in healthy cells and under starvation condition where we observed organelle-specific polarity remodeling. These probes are important addition to the repertoire of smart cellular probes and will find critical use in understanding spatiotemporal regulation of cellular physiology.","[{""name"":""Interdisciplinary Thematic Institute SysChem"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-10-IDEX-0002;""},{""name"":""CSC Graduate School"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-17-EURE-0016;""},{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AmpliSens ANR-21-CE42-0019-01;""},{""name"":""Swedish Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03zttf063"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2020-02682;2024-02993;2024-00289;""},{""name"":""Karolinska Institutet"",""id"":""https://ror.org/056d84691"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2024-03250;2024-03341;2022-00803;2020-00997;""},{""name"":""Cancer Research KI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2024-03488;""},{""name"":""Human Frontier Science Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGP0025/2022;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

In contrast, we demonstrate that stem cell maintenance in Arabidopsis bud precursor cells requires active cell-cycle progression. Inhibiting division silences the shoot meristem marker gene SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) and promotes differentiation. Whereas proliferation dilutes H3K27me3 levels to counteract silencing. Meanwhile, we identified two classes of transcription factors recruiting polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to epigenetically silence STM. The balance between these forces establishes a cell cycle-coupled epigenetic ""Sisyphus"" mechanism that maintains pluripotency. This cell fate switch is bistable; modeling and experimental data confirm that prolonged quiescence triggers irreversible differentiation. We propose that sequence-dependent PRC2 recruitment in plants enables precise silencing of fate-determining genes, while cell proliferation sustains pluripotency by resetting epigenetic marks.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

However, high dimensionality and spurious associations remain major obstacles to extracting meaningful biological insight from multi-omic host-associated microbiome data; a challenge further exacerbated when ""holo-omic"" analyses across the host-microbiome boundary is considered. Here, we show that a computational method designed for multi-omic analysis in eukaryotes can be leveraged to integrate and analyse five layers of holo-omic data from porcine hosts and their gut microbiomes. We collected caecal tissue and digesta samples during a feeding trial that tested the impact of microbiota-directed fibres (acetylated galactoglucomannan) at critical developmental stages. From 800,000 features including microbial and host genes, metagenome-assembled genomes, and metabolites from caecal tissue and digesta, we used multiset correlation and factor analysis to select the most relevant features for capturing coordinated patterns across omic layers. From these features, we predicted over 2,000 putative host-microbiome interactions based on co-occurrence. Some of them reflected previously known relationships between animal and microbiome features, such as microbial genes for carbohydrate metabolism being linked to glycoside abundances in host tissue. Other predicted co-occurrences included features that were not detected in single-omic analysis and offer new hypotheses of host-microbiome interactions that warrant future investigation. Hence, we showcase an application of holo-omic analysis that avoids common pitfalls in high-dimensional data analysis; identifies known interactions as a form of validation; and most importantly, predicts new leads for understanding host-microbiome symbiosis.","[{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101000309;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

Experiments, with their ability to control variables and isolate mechanisms, are a powerful tool for uncovering the causal processes that drive community dynamics. They therefore allow us to move beyond correlations and to directly test theoretical predictions. Yet, because experiments are often logistically demanding and resource-intensive, they are less frequently employed than observational approaches in community ecology. Here, we trace the past three decades of experimental research in community ecology through a systematic literature review. We focus on the motivation behind experiments, their links to ecological theory, the types of questions they address, their scale, and the methods used to do this. Our results corroborate the historically tight relationship between experiments and ecological theory and document a gradual increase in experimental complexity -particularly related to the use of molecular methods. However, persistent gaps remain in the taxa and ecosystems studied, with aquatic ecosystems, fungi, and microbes still underrepresented compared to terrestrial plants and animals. Moreover, experiments are still limited in their spatial and temporal scale; they are typically short-term, local, and reliant on manual methods. The integration of high-throughput technologies with experimental workflows is still in its infancy, even though they are increasingly common in biomonitoring. To illustrate the potential of such tools in experimental research, we present a proof-of-concept study. It shows how automated technologies can be incorporated at different stages of the experimental workflow to expand the scale of experiments while reducing the reliance on human labor and potentially lowering financial costs. We conclude that many of the long-lasting biases and challenges in experimental community ecology could be addressed by combining technological innovations with broader collaboration among research groups. Coordinated networks, standardized protocols, and the integration of long-term and large-scale experimental designs can substantially improve in situ replication as well as cross-site comparability. Such efforts are essential for developing a more comprehensive mechanistic understanding of community dynamics across diverse ecosystems.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Research Council of Finland"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05k73zm37"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""336212;345110;342374;""},{""name"":""Swedish Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03zttf063"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2023-05118;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

It is an exemplar condition for evaluating penetrance in adult cohorts due to its relatively low mortality, variable expressivity and link to several large genes. Using genome sequencing data from ~500,000 adults in UK Biobank, we curated a set of rare pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in COL1A1, COL1A2 and IFITM5 using annotations from gnomAD, ClinVar and SpliceAI. Analysis of summed read-count data from genome and exome sequencing led to exclusion of 16 mosaic variants with consistently low allelic balance of 3.4-35.9%. We identified 61 likely constitutive heterozygous pathogenic variants in COL1A1 and COL1A2 (29 loss-of-function or splice variants and 32 missense) in 115 participants, with a mean age at recruitment of 55.1 years; no pathogenic variants were identified in IFITM5. Phenotypes were assessed using ICD-10 codes, self-reports and heel bone mineral density. Overall disease penetrance was lower than anticipated: 40.7% for COL1A1 and 21.3% for COL1A2, potentially due to depletion of severe early-onset disease. When considering only truncating variants in COL1A1, disease penetrance increased to 73.1%, and 90% of individuals had reduced levels of circulating COL1A1 protein. For COL1A2, bone mineral density data supported the low penetrance, whereas for COL1A1, data suggested the possibility of a subclinical phenotype. Overall, for pathogenic missense variants (including those altering Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats), the low penetrance observed suggests reliance on current ClinVar assertions to support pathogenicity may overstate OI risk in population screening.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1761343764865

Using tomato as a model, we tested over 800 SynCom-temperature combinations consisting of root endophytic bacteria and rhizosphere metabolites. An Elastic Net regression model trained on plant biomass data accurately predicted the performance of unseen SynComs, with prediction accuracy plateauing at [~]5% (301/6144) of all possible SynCom-temperature combinations. Incorporating genomic features significantly improved model performance, whereas microbiome compositional data alone were not informative. We applied the model to design novel SynComs, which were tested in both laboratory and field conditions using a commercial tomato cultivar. The model-informed SynCom enhanced plant growth in field trials and improved heat stress tolerance under controlled laboratory conditions. Multi-omics analyses and feature importance metrics identified specific microbial taxa, including Sphingobium sp., whose enrichment was linked to host plant metabolite (e.g., tomatine) and stress-responsive gene expression.

Management of the severe diffuse form of KATPHI currently lacks treatment options, as the first-line therapy octreotide is often insufficiently effective, necessitating radical pancreatectomy in many patients. In this study, we applied stem cell derived islets carrying KATPHI-causing mutation KCNJ11-/- to develop new pharmaceutical therapies for KATPHI. We tested seven candidate molecules in vitro, identifying three that reduced insulin secretion in KCNJ11-/- stem cell derived islets. Of these, we tested acyl-ghrelin and its long-acting analogue relamorelin in mice that became hypoglycaemic due to carrying human KCNJ11-/- stem cell derived grafts. Acyl-ghrelin and relamorelin alone increased fasting glycaemia. Combining relamorelin with octreotide increased blood glucose more than the sum of each drug alone, reversing hypoglycaemia to normoglycaemia. In conclusion, we show that ghrelin receptor agonists have acute anti-hypoglycaemic effects in a humanised mouse model of KATPHI, especially when combined with octreotide.

For such synthetic cells to accurately replicate cellular reactions, it is critical that the concentrations of encapsulated molecules mirror those in living systems, as reaction kinetics and cellular network states are highly sensitive to these concentrations. However, methods for precisely determining encapsulation efficiency in synthetic cells at single cell resolution have been limited. To address this challenge, we developed QuantGUV, a software-driven, image-based analysis method that determines the concentrations of fluorescent molecules encapsulated within giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). We used QuantGUV to measure the encapsulation efficiencies of fluorescent molecules, ranging in size from 0.5 nm to 20 nm. These measurements were conducted on GUVs formed via the water-in-oil emulsion transfer method under various experimental conditions. Using QuantGUV, we have measured the encapsulation efficiencies of three fluorescence molecules, sulforhodamine B, mEGFP and polystyrene bead, in GUVs formed via the water-in-oil emulsion transfer method. The encapsulation efficiencies for polystyrene bead was close to 100 % in most of the conditions while sulforhodamine B and mEGFP's encapsulation efficiencies depended on the parameters during the GUV formation such as concentrations of lipids and oil-water ratio during the GUV formation. By providing crucial insights into encapsulation efficiencies, QuantGUV offers a valuable tool to monitor the building quantitative synthetic cell systems with accurately controlled internal environments which is a critical step towards the creation of synthetic cells.","[{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0439y7842"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X023303/1;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X01262X/1;""},{""name"":""Royal Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wnrjx87"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGSR2242552;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

Tau filaments in AD adopt the Alzheimer's fold, which is distinct from other tauopathies and highly conserved across sporadic and familial AD.

In particular, up to half of AD patients harbor limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC).

Additional sampling revealed CTE neuropathology in one patient, suggestive features without definitive CTE in the second, and no evidence of CTE in the third.

Our understanding of PDE mechanisms, including the involvement of small RNAs and transposases, is mainly based on studies in the single-cell ciliates, whereas in metazoans, the PDE mechanisms remain largely unknown. In the parasitic nematode Ascaris, PDE removes and remodels all germline chromosome ends, splits fused chromosomes into somatic chromosomes, leading to dramatic karyotype changes. To probe the possible involvement of small RNAs in Ascaris PDE, we identified two Argonautes, AsWAGO-2 and AsWAGO-3, associated with PDE. Using cellular fractionation followed by nuclease-treated immunoprecipitation, we characterized WAGO-associated small RNAs (siRNAs) and their targets in chromatin, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm. We found that AsWAGO-3 is enriched on eliminated chromatin, with its associated siRNAs mostly targeting genes. However, a subset of AsWAGO-3 siRNAs targets repeats in the eliminated regions specifically located in the middle of chromosomes that originated from the ends of ancestral chromosomes. In contrast, AsWAGO-2 transiently stains the retained chromosomes during elimination mitoses, and the associated siRNAs are enriched in the retained regions only in the chromatin fraction. Overall, our data established a link between WAGOs and Ascaris PDE, demonstrating the flexibility of small RNA pathways that selectively distinguish retained and eliminated DNA. We suggest that some of the targeting may be a response to the karyotype changes associated with chromosome fusion and PDE.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AI155588;GM151551;AI114054;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

Here, we present a second high-quality Denisovan genome, reconstructed from a molar found at Denisova Cave. It belonged to a man who lived [~]200,000 years ago in a small Denisovan group. This group mixed with early Neandertals and was then replaced by Denisovans who had mixed with later Neandertals. We show that in addition Denisovans received gene flow from hominins that diverged before the split of the ancestors of Denisovans and modern humans. The two Denisovan genomes allow us to disentangle Denisovan ancestry in present-day humans revealing contributions from at least three distinct Denisovan groups. In particular, Oceanians and South Asians independently inherited DNA from a deeply diverged Denisovan population which was likely isolated in South Asia. This supports an early migration of the ancestors of Oceanians through South Asia followed by the later arrival of the ancestors of present-day South Asians. East Asians do not share this Denisovan component in their genomes, suggesting that their ancestors arrived independently, perhaps by a northerly route. Finally, the two high-quality Denisovan genomes allow us to refine the catalogue of genetic changes that arose on the Denisovan lineage, some of which were contributed to present-day humans.","[{""name"":""Max Planck Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01hhn8329"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""694707;""},{""name"":""Russian Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03y2gwe85"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""24-18-00069;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

More than half of human proteins, however, contain mixtures of disordered regions and one or more folded domains, and the biological function of these multi-domain proteins depends on the interplay between the folded and disordered regions. Here, we developed AF-CALVADOS, a coarse-grained simulation model that is informed by AlphaFold to model the dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins and multi-domain proteins containing mixtures of folded and disordered regions. AF-CALVADOS leverages information from AlphaFold 2 to model folded regions that we then integrate with the coarse-grained CALVADOS model. Our automated framework makes it possible to perform simulations of any soluble folded or disordered protein without manually defined folded regions, enabling scaling to the proteome level. We validate AF-CALVADOS using experimental data and consistency between our simulations and the AlphaFold 2 predicted aligned error matrix. We demonstrate the scalability of AF-CALVADOS by performing simulations of 12,483 cytosolic human proteins and make the data freely available; we envisage that large-scale simulation data generated by AF-CALVADOS can be used to benchmark or train machine learning models for flexible, multi-domain proteins. The conformational ensembles can be used to study sequence-dynamics-function relationships at scale, and can shed light on the interplay between folded and disordered regions.

Parasite-stimulated immune cells from malaria-naive donors increased adhesion to microvessels, at least partly through LFA-1. This caused barrier disruption and inflammatory activation of BBB cells. Secretion of TNF-, IFN-{gamma}, and granzyme B by monocytes, NK and {gamma}{delta} T cells correlated with vascular injury, and accumulation of immune cells was required for local barrier damage. Our computational analysis disentangled pathogenic mechanisms driven specifically by either P. falciparum parasite or immune cells, as well as shared pathways. These findings demonstrate how vascular-immune interactions may contribute to vascular injury in cerebral malaria and point towards the potential of immunomodulatory therapeutics.","[{""name"":""European Reseach Council"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""948088;847543;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Laboratory"",""id"":""https://ror.org/010jaxs89"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NA;""},{""name"":""Agencia Estatal de Investigación"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RYC 2020-029886-I/AEI/10.13039/501100011033;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

Oct4, a master regulator of pluripotency, exemplifies this capacity as it can bind nucleosome-occupied DNA. Yet, how Oct4 reshapes chromatin fibres beyond the scale of a single nucleosome has remained unclear. Here, we harness our near-atomistic coarse-grained chromatin model to dissect how full-length Oct4 interacts with chromatin fibres of varying nucleosomal repeat lengths. We find that Oct4 increases DNA accessibility not by decondensing chromatin, but by driving fibres into compact liquid-like states in which nucleosomes breathe, reorient, exchange neighbours, and transiently expose DNA. Oct4 binds preferentially to linker DNA through its structured POU domains, while its disordered activation domains mediate cluster formation: a three-stage process consisting of nucleation of small clusters, attachment to chromatin via the DNA binding domains, and growth that is amplified when long DNA linkers enable fibre bending and looping. Oct4 clusters deform chromatin and bridge distal DNA segments in a stoichiometry- and linker length-dependent manner, revealing a tunable mechanism for controlling higher-order structure. Together, our results establish how Oct4 exploits multivalency, nucleosome breathing, and chromatin flexibility to reorganise fibres into liquid-like states that reconcile condensation with enhanced accessibility, providing a physical route to overcome the transcription-factor  search problem and activate silenced genes during reprogramming.","[{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0439y7842"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X02332X/1;EP/Z002028/1;EP/X035603/1;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""803326;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

We attenuated ACD across distinct striatal regions, finding that ACD attenuation specifically in ventral striatum (VS) increased decision noisiness and impaired reward-guided choice. This effect was largely due to a reduction in ""win-stay"" behavior. Using in-vivo calcium imaging, we found that VS ACD correlated with reward prediction errors (RPEs). Furthermore, these trial-by-trial ACD fluctuations predicted trial-by-trial choice variability. Finally, ex-vivo slice electrophysiology and computational modeling revealed two mechanisms through which astrocytes could regulate behavioral variability: by regulating presynaptic excitatory-inhibitory balance, and by sharing RPE signals across populations of striatal neurons. Together, these results suggest that VS astrocytes contribute to cortico-striatal functions to mediate decision noisiness.","[{""name"":""Army Research Office"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""78259-NS-MUR;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH135646;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

Comparative approaches can help distinguish conserved from species-specific mechanisms, but their application has been limited by the lack of molecular tools beyond traditional model organisms, complicating direct comparisons of conserved and divergent mechanisms of neural function. This gap is particularly evident for the dopaminergic system, a key regulator of motivated behaviors across species and the principal pharmacological target for current psychotherapies. Building on our recent development of comparative gene editing, we here present an adeno-associated virus-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to reduce in vivo dopamine receptors D1 and D2 levels across the rodent phylogeny. Using this approach, we achieved specific reduction of receptor levels in three rodent species (house mouse, prairie vole, and Syrian hamster), which we demonstrate with radioactive ligand binding assays. This toolkit expands the reach of comparative gene editing approaches, enabling functional investigation of the dopaminergic system across rodent species.

However, emerging viral variants have escaped all Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved NAb treatments, underscoring the urgent need for effective therapeutic alternatives. Using a nanoluciferase (Nluc)-expressing attenuated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 lacking the open reading frames (ORF) 3a and 7b ({Delta}3a7b-Nluc), we characterized resistance profiles of two broadly protective NAbs targeting the S receptor binding domain (RBD) in S1 (1301B7) and the stem helix domain (SH) in S2 (1249A8). Serial passaging of {Delta}3a7b-Nluc under selective pressure identified a 1301B7 antibody-resistant mutants (ARM-B7) harboring an RBD mutation (S371F) that conferred resistance to 1301B7 and other RBD-directed NAbs (Casirivimab, SC27 and Sotrovimab). In contrast, no ARM emerged under treatment with 1249A8, or an antibody cocktail of 1301B7 (RBD) + 1249A8 (SH). These findings demonstrate that S2 SH-targeting NAbs shows higher genetic barrier to resistance than S1 RBD-targeting NAbs, and that a NAbs cocktail therapy targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD and S2 SH offers the most effective strategy to prevent the emergence of escape mutations. Together, our findings provide critical insights into developing next-generation resistance-evading NAb therapies against SARS-CoV-2, and potentially other coronaviruses, and demonstrate the value of using our attenuated viral platforms for the safe identification of ARM without the potential biosafety concerns of doing these experiments using wild-type (WT) forms of SARS-CoV-2.

SIGNIFICANCEThe clinical efficacy of early SARS-CoV-2 NAbs has been challenged by the emergence of escape viral variants, highlighting an urgent need to anticipate resistance. Using a luminescent attenuated SARS-CoV-2 platform, we profiled resistant mutations against two broadly protective SARS-CoV-2 NAbs. Passage of {Delta}3a7b-Nluc in the presence of a NAb targeting the RBD S1 domain (1301B7) readily selected for an ARM, whereas passage in the presence of an SH S2 domain NAb (1249A8) did not. Notably, a cocktail of 1301B7 and 1249A8 created a high barrier of selecting SARS-CoV-2 ARM, preventing the emergence of resistant variants. We identified an S371F mutation in the S1 RBD of ARM-B7 that confers resistance to 1301B7 and other S1 RBD-targeting NAbs. These results highlight the importance of combination therapies targeting both variable RBD S1 and conserved SH S2 domain for the efficient treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and to prevent the emerge of NAb-induced escape mutations.","[{""name"":""NIAID"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 AI161363;75N93021C00014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

Humans exhibit significant phenotypic differences from other great apes, yet pinpointing the underlying genetic changes has been limited by incomplete reference genomes and a reliance on single assemblies to represent a species. We aligned 20 telomere-to-telomere (T2T) assemblies spanning great ape divergence and variation to define 1,596 Consensus HAQERs (consensus human ancestor quickly evolved regions), regions that diverged rapidly between the human-chimpanzee ancestor and an ancestral node of modern humans. Unlike prior HAQER sets, Consensus HAQERs incorporate population variation, reducing the likelihood of intraspecies variation appearing as interspecies divergence. Consensus HAQERs exhibit signatures of elevated mutation rates, ancient positive selection, bivalent regulatory function, are enriched in disease-linked loci, and often emerged in previously inaccessible repetitive DNA. Through multiplex, single-cell enhancer assays, we identify HAQERs as active enhancers in the developing brain and cardiomyocytes, highlighting their potential contributions to human-specific gene regulation across multiple tissues.

Using single-cell multiomics data for the cerebellum from human, macaque, marmoset, and mouse, we revealed that TE contributions to different cell types are shaped by differences in evolutionary constraint across cell types, as well as the preferential co-option of certain TEs in specific cell states. Using a sequence-based deep-learning model predicting cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility, we systematically assessed the co-option potential of TEs into cerebellar gene regulatory networks, identifying seventeen TE fragments with complex regulatory sequences in their ancestral states that facilitate their co-option as cell-type-specific cis-regulatory elements. Primate-specific HERVL (human endogenous retrovirus L) is predominantly accessible in differentiating granule cells and other rhombic-lip-derived neuroblasts during hindbrain development, and contributes to species-specific gene expression patterns. Our study uncovers a pivotal role for TEs in the evolution of the cerebellum. More generally, it demonstrates how TEs can be directly co-opted into the gene regulatory networks of specific cell types and introduces a generalizable analytical framework for dissecting their contribution to mammalian regulatory evolution.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

When a protein is correlated with, but not causally linked to, disease, its genetic determinants can add unwanted variability to protein-disease associations. In such cases, removing the genetic component may improve their predictive performances.

Here, we tested this hypothesis by genetically adjusting 94 highly heritable proteins spanning diverse biological pathways and evaluating their associations with the onset of 37 diseases in 39,871 UK Biobank participants. Genetically adjusted proteins showed stronger associations in 88% of 1,312 significant protein-disease pairs, equivalent to a 30% median reduction in required sample size for comparable power. Of 96 protein-disease pairs with significant differences, all but one showed larger effects for adjusted proteins. Most proteins also showed consistently stronger associations with environmental and lifestyle factors once genetic effects were removed.

Finally, we constructed multi-protein scores from genetically adjusted proteins and demonstrated that they significantly improve prediction for 7 diseases compared to unadjusted proteins. These findings demonstrate that removing genetic effects from plasma proteins is an effective strategy to increase power for biomarker discovery and clinical trial design, consistent with the largely non-causal role of most plasma proteins in disease risk.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1761343764865

While recent outbreaks have revealed much about the epidemiological dynamics that sustain human-to-human transmission, the mechanisms by which the virus persists between outbreaks are unknown. Previously, phylogenetic approaches have been used to characterise the EBOV reservoir from the evolutionary relationships among observed human outbreaks. We here employ a novel phylogenetic latency model - inspired by recent observations of extreme EBOV evolutionary rate heterogeneity in humans - to characterise the natural history of EBOV and by extension its reservoir. We find the prevailing model of EBOV reservoir dynamics is deficient, and the long-term EBOV evolutionary rate is slower than previously believed. The hypothesis that EBOV diversity dates back to a bottleneck event just prior to the first human outbreak is not supported by the data. Further, our results suggest that EBOV undergoes extended periods of quiescence in the reservoir, similar to that observed in a small fraction of human infections. These findings have significant implications for understanding the source of EBOV outbreaks, characterising the EBOV reservoir, and uncovering the factors that contribute to EBOV outbreaks in humans.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""206298/Z/17/Z;313694/Z/24/Z;218471/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Research Foundation - Flanders"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03qtxy027"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""G0E1420N;G098321N;""},{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""01102733;""},{""name"":""Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""260003/005679/2023;260003/013252/2024;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IG-5305-2023;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AI153044;AI162611;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""725422;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

BCI implants have targeted broad cortical regions known to have relevant motor representations, but emerging technologies will allow flexible targeting to specific neural populations. The structure of motor representations at this scale, however, has not been well characterized across frontal motor cortices. Here, we investigate how motor representations and population dynamics (temporal coordination) vary across a large expanse of frontal motor cortices. We used high-density, laminar, microelectrode arrays to simultaneously record many neurons and then sampled neural populations across frontal motor cortex in two monkeys while they performed a reaching task. Our experiments allowed us to map neuronal activity across three spatial dimensions and relate them to movement. Target decoding analysis revealed that task information was heterogeneously distributed across the cortical surface and in depth. Similarly, we found that the temporal dynamics of different neural populations were heterogeneous, but that the amount of task information predicted which neural populations had similar dynamics. The neural populations with the most similar dynamics were composed of neurons with high task information regardless of spatial location. Our results highlight the spatiotemporal complexity of motor representations across frontal motor cortex at the level of neurons and neural populations, where well-learned movements consistently recruit a spatially distributed subset of neurons. Further insights into the spatiotemporal structure of neural activity patterns across frontal motor cortex will be critical to guide future implants for improved BCI performance.

Significance StatementMotor brain-computer interfaces (BCI) translate neural activity into movement, but how to target implants within motor cortices to maximize performance remains unclear. We used high-density recordings of neural activity spanning a large cortical area and related them to movement to map the spatial distribution of task information and the evolution of neural population activity over time. Our measurements revealed that neurons with the most task information were heterogeneously distributed across cortex yet also evolved coherently in time, suggesting that spatially distributed neurons coordinate to control movements. Our results provide new links between neuron- and population-level maps of motor representations, and highlight the complex spatiotemporal structure of activity that may need to be considered when designing next-generation BCIs.","[{""name"":""National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TL1 TR002318;""},{""name"":""Heiwa Nakajima Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/000k40t10"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Graduate Fellowship;""},{""name"":""Weill Neurohub"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""postdoctoral fellowship;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Simons Collaboration for the Global Brain Pilot award, 898220;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2117997;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIH R01 NS134634;UF1NS126485;""},{""name"":""Office of Research Infrastructure Programs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01jdyfj45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P51 OD010425;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

The DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), classically defined as the maintenance methyltransferase that preserves DNA methylation patterns during replication, exemplifies this versatility. Beyond its canonical role, DNMT1 is highly expressed in the developing and adult brain, where it contributes to transcriptional regulation in postmitotic neurons. Notably, cytoplasmic DNMT1 localization has been observed in neural cells, and emerging evidence links DNMT1 to mitochondrial function with implications for neurodegenerative disease, whereby the underlying functional mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.

Here, we identify a previously unrecognized cytosolic function of DNMT1 in developing cortical excitatory neurons. Through genetic perturbation, proteomics, and high-resolution imaging, we show that DNMT1 regulates dendritic and axonal branching independently of its catalytic activity and nuclear localization. Instead, DNMT1 operates as a cytosolic scaffold interacting with the polarity regulator DOCK7 to modulate Rac1-STMN1 signaling, microtubule dynamics, and organelle trafficking. These findings expand the conceptual framework of DNMT1 from a genome guardian to a dual-compartment regulator that coordinates cytoskeletal remodeling and mitochondrial positioning. Beyond advancing our understanding of neuronal morphogenesis, this work provides mechanistic insight into how DNMT1 mutations may lead to neurodegenerative diseases.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ZI-1224/13-1;ZI-1224/13-1;368482240/GRK2416;""},{""name"":""Excellence Strategy of the Federal Government and the Länder"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OPSF678;OPSF812;SFASIA002;""},{""name"":""European Union&#8722;NextGenerationEU-HEAL ITALIA"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PE00000019;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

Conventional transformation methods rely on purified DNA and physical force to drive uptake into the chloroplast, often resulting in DNA shearing and thus low transfer efficiency for large constructs. Bacterial conjugation offers an attractive alternative as this is an entirely in vivo process, enabling DNA transfer without any physical manipulation. To assess the feasibility of this approach, we attempted to generate an Escherichia coli donor strain carrying both the broad-host-range conjugative plasmid pTA-Mob (52.7 kb) and the cloned Phaeodactylum tricornutum chloroplast genome (pPt_Cp, 132.9 kb). Unexpectedly, pTA-Mob and pPt_Cp proved incompatible: co-maintenance could not be achieved via electroporation, and conjugation with a self-transmissible pTA-Mob variant resulted in a [~]10{square}-fold decrease in transfer efficiency. Systematic testing of pTA-Mob and pPt_Cp plasmid variants as well as sequence analysis of evolved transconjugants revealed that the incompatibility arose from the pBBR1 replicon present in pTA-Mob. Guided by these insights, we identified an alternative conjugative plasmid, pRL443, that was compatible with pPt_Cp. Together, these findings provide a framework for dissecting plasmid incompatibility when working with large constructs and establish a functional conjugative system capable of mobilizing the P. tricornutum chloroplast genome.","[{""name"":""Advanced Research + Invention Agency (ARIA)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PROP-PR01-P003;""},{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGPIN-2025-05428;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

However, whether skeletal muscle retains a ""memory"" of disuse remains unknown. We investigated repeated lower-limb immobilization in young adults and a refined aged rat model of repeated disuse, integrating multi-omics, histology, biochemistry, and primary human cell analyses. In young human muscle, a second period of disuse elicited an attenuated transcriptional response in oxidative and mitochondrial pathways, suggesting a protective molecular memory, although this did not translate into attenuated atrophy. In contrast, aged muscle exhibited a detrimental molecular memory, with greater atrophy, exaggerated suppression of aerobic metabolism genes/pathways despite recovery of these genes after initial disuse, depletion of NAD and mitochondrial DNA, and activation of proteasomal, extracellular matrix and DNA-damage pathways. Repeated disuse induced DNA hypermethylation and downregulation of aerobic metabolism and mitochondrial genes across species. NR4A1 remained suppressed in young human muscle, whereas acetylcholine receptor subunit genes were epigenetically primed in humans and further upregulated with repeated atrophy in both young and aged muscle. NMRK2 was among the most downregulated genes after both periods of atrophy in humans, and nicotinamide riboside improved myotube size in primary human muscle cells derived post-atrophy.

If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

Here, we developed a new computational framework to minimize negative transfer for domain-adaptive brain decoding by reframing source selection as a mixture model parameter estimation problem, allowing each source subject to contribute through a continuous mixture weight rather than being outright included or excluded. To compute these weights, we developed a novel convex optimization algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Moments. By using model performance metrics as the generalized moment functions in our GMM optimization, our algorithm also provides theoretical guarantees that the mixture weights are an optimal approximation of the importance weights that underlie domain adaptation theory. When tested on a large-scale brain decoding dataset (n=105 subjects), our new mixture model weighting framework achieved state-of-the-art performance--increasing accuracy up to 2.5% over baseline fine-tuning, double the performance gain compared to previous research in supervised source selection. Notably, these improvements were achieved using significantly less training data (i.e., 62% smaller effective sample sizes), suggesting that our performance gains stem from reduced negative transfer. Collectively, this research advances toward a more principled and generalizable brain decoding framework, laying the mathematical foundation for scalable brain-computer interfaces and other applications in computational neuroscience.","[{""name"":""Schroeder Institute for Brain Innovation and Recovery"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

While clonal expansions in the hematopoietic system have been extensively characterized and reported to be nearly ubiquitous, clonal mosaicism (CM) has more recently also been described across multiple solid tissues. However, outstanding questions remain about the parameters and processes of human somatic evolution in non-cancerous solid human tissues, including when clones arise, how they evolve over time, and what mechanisms lead to their expansion. Questions of timing and clonal dynamics can be addressed through phylogenetic reconstruction, which serves as a  temporal microscope, while uncovering the mechanisms of expansion necessitates simultaneous phenotypic profiling. To address this gap, here we develop Single-cell Miniaturized Automated Reverse Transcription and Primary Template-directed Amplification (SMART-PTA) for joint single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing for large scale and cost efficient interrogation of solid tissue CM. We established a workflow that generates hundreds of matched single-cell whole genome and transcriptome libraries within a week. We profiled phenotypically normal esophagus tissue from four aged donors and used somatic variants to build high-resolution single-cell lineages from >2,700 cells with accompanying transcriptomic information, reconstructing >70 years of somatic evolution. T cell expansions identified from T cell receptor (TCR) sequences validated the clonal structure of the single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based phylogenies and phylogenetic cross-correlation analysis showed that epithelial cells had higher degrees of shared ancestry by spatial location compared to immune cells. Mapping mutation signatures to the phylogenetic tree revealed the emergence of tobacco/alcohol exposure-related signatures later in life, consistent with the donors exposure histories. We identified variants in driver genes that were previously reported in the phenotypically normal esophagus, detecting clonal expansions harboring mutations in genes including TP53 and FAT1. We mapped the evolution of clones with both monoallelic as well as biallelic TP53 loss, including a clone associated with high expression of cell cycling genes and higher chromosome instability. Leveraging the matched transcriptome data, we uncovered cell type biases in mutant clones, with a higher proportion of TP53 or FAT1-mutant cells in an earlier basal epithelial cell state compared to wild-type cells. We further observed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) events on chromosome 9q that spanned the NOTCH1 locus in up to [~]35% of epithelial cells. Mapping CNLOH events to the phylogenetic tree revealed a striking pattern in which CNLOH was separately acquired many times, reflecting convergent evolution. Cells with CNLOH events were biased towards the earlier basal epithelial state, suggestive of a selective advantage that leads to prevalent recurrence of chr9q CNLOH. Together, we demonstrate that SMART-PTA is an efficient, scalable approach for single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome profiling to build phenotypically annotated single-cell phylogenies with enough throughput and power for application to normal tissue somatic evolution. Moreover, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of the esophageal epithelium at high scale and resolution, providing a window into the dynamics and processes that shape clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues throughout a lifespan.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3NS132139;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R33 CA267219;""},{""name"":""NIDDK"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30 DK132710;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RM1HG011014;""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01d35cw23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Career Award for Medical Scientists;""},{""name"":""Vallee Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05nmp3276"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Scholar Award;""},{""name"":""Blood Cancer United"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""The Mark Foundation for Cancer Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00v7th354"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""MacMillan Family Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

A promising strategy for ""proteome editing"" is to use bifunctional molecules (e.g. PROteolysis-Targeting Chimeras or PROTACs1) that bring a target protein into proximity with a degradation or stabilization effector, but their broader application is constrained by a limited repertoire of well-characterized target or effector ""handles"". We asked whether coupling de novo protein design to a multiplex screening framework could address this gap by accelerating the discovery of effector handles for intracellular protein degradation, stabilization, or relocalization. Using LABEL-seq2, a sequencing-based assay that enables multiplex, quantitative measurement of protein abundance, we screened 9,715 de novo designed candidate effector handles for their ability to recruit a target protein to components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system3 (UPS) (FBXL12, TRAF2, UCHL1, USP38) or the autophagy pathway4 (GABARAP, GABARAPL2, MAP1LC3A). In a single experiment, we discovered hundreds of de novo designed effector handles that reproducibly drove either intracellular degradation (n = 277) or stabilization (n = 204) of a reporter protein. Validation of a subset of these hits in an orthogonal assay confirmed that sequencing-based measurements from the primary screen reliably reflected changes in intracellular abundance of the target protein. Successful effector handles were discovered for both the UPS (n = 194) and autophagy (n = 287) pathways, which provide complementary routes for programmable proteome editing. Autophagy-recruiting effector handles generalized to endogenous targets, as substituting the reporter-specific target handle with a high-affinity MCL1 binder5 reduced endogenous levels of this intracellular oncoprotein6. Moreover, directing autophagy-recruiting effector handles to the outer mitochondrial membrane dramatically perturbed mitochondrial networks in a manner consistent with synthetic tethering and sequestration7,8. Beyond generating a diverse repertoire of protein abundance or localization effector handles, our results establish a scalable, low-cost platform that links deep learning-guided protein design to functional cellular readouts, and chart a course toward a general framework for programmable proteome editing.","[{""name"":""National Heart Lung and Blood Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012pb6c26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31HL168982;""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T32GM136534;""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV-043758;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG010632;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility.

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

These events occur when cohesin loads near the midpoint between two loci and extrudes them through a defined spatial radius, producing encounter durations that exceed those of random collisions. We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors. Our findings support a time-gated model of distal enhancer-promoter communication in which only rare, long-lived and mostly extrusion-driven encounters are productive, offering a unifying framework for how chromosome dynamics control transcription in single cells.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_192642;TMCG-3_213782;320030-236070;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 1305-2024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

Here, we present a spatially resolved, multi-omics framework that integrates whole-organ 3D imaging at cellular resolution with targeted proteomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic profiling to detect and characterize microscopic tubal lesions. Using this platform, we identified a total of 99 STICs and their presumed precursors that harbor TP53 mutations in morphologically unremarkable tubal epithelium in all five specimens obtained from cancer-free organ donors with average-risk of developing ovarian cancer. Although these lesions comprised only 0.2% of the epithelial compartment, they displayed geographic diversity, immune exclusion, metabolic rewiring, and DNA copy number changes among lesions and normal fallopian tube epithelium discovered alterations in STIC-associated genes and the pathways they control. In sum, this platform provides a comprehensive 3D atlas of early neoplastic transformation, yielding mechanistic insights into tumor initiation and informing clinical screening strategies for detecting cancer precursors in whole organs at cellular resolution.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U54CA268083;RO1CA300052;UG3CA275681;P50CA228991;R01GM149976;U01AI167892;5R01NS111039;R21NS125395;U54 HL165443;U54 DK 134301;R01 HL170107;U2CCA271891;""},{""name"":""Sloan research fellow award, a CZI Scialog award, and UCSD Startup funds"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Johns Hopkins University and Instituto Superior Técnico student exchange program (HOPTEC and FLAD)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Richard W.

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification1 to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) as well as from local ER- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

While infection is known to impair mitochondrial function and enhance glycolysis, the role of viral accessory proteins in these alterations remains unclear. Here, we investigate the metabolic impact of the accessory protein ORF7a. Lentiviral expression of ORF7a in human lung epithelial (A549) and monocytic (THP1) cells, coupled with integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, revealed profound dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. ORF7a impaired oxidative phosphorylation, reducing basal and maximal respiration, inducing mitochondrial depolarization, and increasing reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, ORF7a upregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), promoting pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex phosphorylation and suppressing pyruvate oxidation. However, pharmacological PDK4 inhibition did not restore respiration. High-resolution respirometry in frozen samples revealed impaired complex I function, while Blue Native-PAGE demonstrated defective respiratory supercomplex assembly. By linking enzymatic inhibition with structural destabilization, our study uncovers a functional vulnerability of the mitochondrial respiratory chain to viral manipulation. These findings establish ORF7a as a key modulator of host metabolic reprogramming and highlight mitochondrial pathways as potential therapeutic targets in COVID-19.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

In this work, we present mBER, an open-source protein binder design system capable of designing antibody-format binders with state-of-the-art experimental success rates. mBER builds on the ColabDesign framework, achieving successful antibody design primarily through the inclusion of informative sequence and structure conditioning information. Using mBER, we designed two libraries comprising over 1 million VHH binders against 436 diverse targets. We experimentally screened the two libraries against 145 of these targets, resulting in a dataset of over 100 million binding interactions. We achieved specific and significant design success against 45% of targets. In a filtered set of designs, we detect binding rates to specific epitopes as high as 38%. Through mBER, we demonstrate that format-specific binder design is possible with no additional training of underlying folding and language models. This work represents the largest reported de novo protein design and validation campaign, and one of the first open-source methods to demonstrate double-digit percentage experimental success rates for antibody binder design.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

This is especially a problem in children, where cancer survivors experience a subsequent high risk of bone mineral deficits and fractures, normally seen in the older population. Here, we model this to show that early-life treatment with a single dose of the commonly used chemotherapy cisplatin profoundly impairs late-life bone health, and that these bone deficits are completely resolved through treatment with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). While we had previously shown that this same strategy protects against chemotherapy induced female infertility, this maintenance of aged bone health appears to be unrelated to endocrine changes due to protection of the ovarian reserve. Rather, this is driven by altered phosphorus homeostasis and protection against renal damage, which otherwise increases parathyroid hormone secretion to mobilise calcium stores from bone.

Here, we question this view by demonstrating cross-communication between distinct arbitrium systems. Using prototypical arbitrium phages, we demonstrate that AimP peptides bind and repress unrelated AimR receptors, promoting lysogeny and reducing prophage induction.

This revealed that selenoprotein production is limited by ribosome collisions that occur at inefficiently decoded selenocysteine codons. Accordingly, slowed translation elongation reduced collisions and enhanced selenocysteine decoding. Oxidative stress also slowed translation elongation and augmented selenoprotein production. We identified translation elongation factor EEF1G as a sensor of oxidized glutathione that couples the cellular redox state to translation elongation rate.

We addressed this eco-evolutionary question in an open marine animal associated system, through two longitudinal samplings years apart in an oyster farm, obtaining >1,000 virulent phages and >600 Vibrio crassostreae strains. Surprisingly, lineages of phage and bacteria were very persistent, with some phages remaining strictly identical after four years. The phage-vibrio infection network remained modular with multiple lineages co-habitating within individual oysters for long periods of time. Seasonal restriction of V. crassostreae, overwintering in wild oysters, and limited viral decay may explain phage stability. Oysters also act as hotspots of activity of diverse mobile genetic element (MGE), hosting plasmids, prophages, phage-plasmids and entirely new classes of satellite-plasmids. Our findings demonstrate how nested ecological constraints can stabilize viral lineages: oysters house vibrio populations that escape host immunity, vibrios restrict phages via receptors and defenses, and satellites parasitize their cognate helper phages. We suggest that ecological context can favor the long-term maintenance of viral lineages and stabilize MGE persistence in the ocean, even amid ongoing mutation and antagonistic co-evolution.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""884988;""},{""name"":""Canada Excellence Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02tvrwm90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-00051;""},{""name"":""FRQ-NT, Fonds des leaders John-R.-Evans"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""44584;""},{""name"":""ANR"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""20-CE35-0014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has allowed proteome-scale quantification of hundreds of thousands of ubiquitination sites (ubi-sites), however the functional importance and regulatory roles of most ubi-sites remain undefined. Here, we assembled a human reference ubiquitinome of 108,341 ubi-sites by harmonizing public proteomics data. We identified a core subset of ubi-sites under evolutionary constraint through alignment of ubiquitin proteomics data from six non-human species, and determined ultra-conserved ubi-sites recurring at regulatory hotspots within protein domains. Perturbation proteomics revealed that these highly conserved ubi-sites are more likely to regulate signaling functions rather than proteasomal degradation. To further prioritize functional ubi-sites with roles in cellular signaling, we constructed a functional score for more than 100,000 ubi-sites by integrating evolutionary, proteomic, and structural features using machine learning. Our score identifies ubi-sites regulating diverse protein functions and rationalizes mechanisms of genetic disease. Finally, we employed chemical genomics to validate the functional relevance of high-scoring ubi-sites and leveraged genetic code expansion to demonstrate that ubiquitination of K320 in the RNA-regulator ELAVL1 disrupts RNA binding.

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865

This rare cyanobacterium-to-plastid transition has only been reported once more in Paulinella chromatophora [~]100 Mya. Unfortunately, the order and relative importance of organellogenesis events have been blurred by time in primary plastids and obscured by P. chromatophora becoming phototrophic. Here, we characterize the tripartite symbiosis in a benthic dinoflagellate (Sinophysis sp.) using diverse single-cell methods. Sinophysis houses a photosynthetic cyanobacterium closely interacting with an alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont. The cyanobacterium is in the intermediate stage of symbiont-to-organelle transition, with the host likely supporting it with metabolites and proteins, and controlling its cell division. Surprisingly, it seems to have replaced the hosts remnant non-photosynthetic plastid. Our results support mixotrophy, horizontal gene transfer, co-symbioses, and cell division control as early drivers of primary plastid origin and highlight the importance of protists for deciphering organellogenesis events.","[{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""23K14256;23K05942;20K15856;""},{""name"":""Human Frontier Science Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGEC29/2024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761343764865
