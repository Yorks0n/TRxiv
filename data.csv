However, there are other reorganizations of the network that do not involve fission and fusion. One such exception is the elusive, beads-on-a-string morphological transition of mitochondria. During such transitions, the cylindrical tubes of the mitochondrial membrane transiently undergo shape changes to a string of pearls connected along thin tubes. These dynamics have been anecdotally observed in many contexts and given disparate explanations. Here we unify these observations by proposing a common underlying mechanism based on the biophysical properties of tubular fluid membranes for which it is known that, under particular regimes of tension and pressure, membranes reach an instability and undergo a shape transition to a string of connected pearls. First, we use high-speed light-sheet microscopy to show that transient, short-lived pearling events occur spontaneously in the mitochondrial network in every cell type we have examined, including primary fibroblasts, T-cells, neurons, and budding yeast. We present evidence that transient mitochondrial pearling occurs during important biological events, particularly during T cell activation and neuronal firing. Using our high-temporal resolution data, we identify two distinct categories of spontaneous pearling, i) internal pressure-driven pearling regulated by ionic flux, and ii) external tension-driven pearling regulated by molecular motors. By applying live-cell STED microscopy we document the structural reorganization of inner cristae membranes during mitochondrial pearling. We then compare numerous methods for inducing pearling, including the ability to induce these dynamics with single mitochondrion precision. These methods include ionophores, channel activators, osmotic shock, detergents, laser stimulation, membrane intercalating molecules, chemical fixation, and micro-needle force. These disparate inducers establish three main physical causes of pearling, i) ionic flux amplifying internal osmotic pressure, ii) membrane packing lowering bending elasticity, and iii) external mechanical force increasing membrane tension. Pearling dynamics thereby reveal a fundamental biophysical facet of mitochondrial biology. We suggest that pearling should take its place beside fission and fusion as a key process of mitochondrial dynamics, with implications for physiology, disease, and aging.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Our data reveal that mitochondria frequently undergo spontaneous and reversible pearling - a biophysical instability in which tubules undulate into regularly spaced beads. We discovered that pearling imposes a characteristic length scale, simultaneously mediating nucleoid disaggregation and establishing inter-nucleoid distancing with near-maximally achievable precision. Cristae invaginations play a dual role: lamellar cristae density determines pearling frequency and duration, and preserves the resulting nucleoid spacing after recovery. The distribution of mitochondrial genomes is thus fundamentally governed by the interplay between spontaneous pearling and cristae ultrastructure.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1734991745661

Currently known phage counter-defense systems are specific to (the activity of) the targeted bacterial defense system. Here, we uncover a mechanism by which the T7 bacteriophage broadly counteracts bacterial defenses using protein phosphorylation. We show that the T7 protein kinase (T7K), which was believed to specifically redirect the function of a few host proteins, is in fact a hyper-promiscuous, dual-specificity kinase enacting a massive wave of phosphorylation on virtually all host and phage proteins during infection. The scale of phosphorylation vastly exceeds the number of previously known phosphorylation events in E. coli, has no sequence motif specificity, and results in a higher proteome-wide phosphorylation density than that of mammalian cells which encode [~] 500 kinases. Stoichiometry analysis of phosphorylation sites revealed a strong bias of T7K activity towards nucleic acid-binding substrates, which we show is mediated by its C-terminal DNA-binding domain. This specificity for highly stoichiometric phosphorylation of nucleic acid-binding proteins enables the deactivation of DNA-targeting or - containing bacterial defense systems. We provide mechanistic insight into how T7K weakens two such defense systems, Retron-Eco9 and DarTG1, through specific phosphorylation events, with single phosphomimetic mutations in key sites of the toxins abolishing defense. Finally, by screening a large collection of E. coli strains, we provide evidence of broad counter-defense capacities for T7K in nature, as strains counteracted contain diverse bacterial defense systems.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

The emergence of single-cell multi-omics technologies has driven the development of several methods that integrate transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility data to infer GRNs. While these methods provide examples of their utility in discovering new regulatory interactions, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating their mechanistic and predictive properties as well as their ability to recover known interactions is lacking. To address this, we built a comprehensive framework, Gene Regulatory nETwork Analysis (GRETA), available as a Snakemake pipeline, that includes state of the art methods decomposing their different steps in a modular manner. With it, we found that the GRNs were highly sensitive to methods choices, such as changes in random seeds, or replacing steps in the inference pipelines, as well as whether they use paired or unpaired multimodal data. Although the obtained networks performed moderately in predictive evaluation tasks and partially recovered known interactions, they struggled to capture causal relationships from perturbation assays. Our work brings attention to the challenges of inferring GRNs from single-cell omics, offers guidelines, and presents a flexible framework for developing and testing new approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

We optimize bulk and single-cell ACCESS-ATAC protocols and develop computational methods to show that the increased resolution compared with ATAC-seq improves the accuracy of TF binding site prediction. We use ACCESS-ATAC to perform genome-wide allelic occupancy and co-occupancy imputation for 64 TFs each in HepG2 and K562, revealing that the propensity of a majority of TFs to co-occupy nearby motifs oscillates with a period approximating the helical turn of DNA.

Core genes are traditionally identified by the analysis of amino acid similarities among proteomes, but can also be defined using structures, which bear potential in deep clades beyond the twilight zone of amino acids. Despite breakthroughs in accurate AI-driven protein structure prediction, obtaining full 3D structural models on a proteomic scale is still prohibitively slow. Here, we present Unicore, a novel method for identifying structural core genes at a scale suitable for downstream phylogenetic analysis. By applying the ProstT5 protein language model to the input proteomes to obtain their 3Di structural strings, Unicore saves over three orders of magnitude in runtime compared to a full 3D prediction. Using Foldseek clustering, Unicore identifies single-copy structures universally present in the species and aligns them using Foldmason. These structural core gene alignments are projected back to amino acid information for downstream phylogenetic analysis. We demonstrate that this approach defines core genes with linear run-time scaling over the number of species, up to 56 times faster than OrthoFinder, while reconstructing phylogenetic relationships congruent with conventional approaches. Unicore is universally applicable to any given set of taxa, even spanning superkingdoms and overcoming limitations of previous methods requiring orthologs of fixed taxonomic scope, and is available as a free and open source software at https://github.com/steineggerlab/unicore.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

However, the mechanism(s) by which changes in LD composition and dynamics contribute to pathophysiology of these disorders remains unclear. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a droplet associated protein with a common risk variant (E4) that confers the largest increase in genetic risk for late-onset AD. E4 is associated with both increased neuroinflammation and excess LD accumulation. In the current study, we sought to quantitatively profile the lipid and protein composition of LDs between the neutral E3 and risk variant E4, to gain insight into potential LD-driven contributions to AD pathogenesis. Targeted replacement mice expressing human E3 or E4 were injected with saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and after 24 hours, hepatic lipid droplets were isolated for proteomic and lipidomic analyses. Lipidomics revealed a shift in the distribution of glycerophospholipids in E4 LDs with a concomitant increase in phosphatidylcholine species, and overall, the baseline profile of E4 LDs resembled that of the LPS-treated groups. Quantitative proteomics showed that LDs from E4 mice are enriched for proteins involved in protein/vesicle transport but have decreased levels of proteins involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation. Interestingly, proteins associated with LDs showed substantial overlap with previously published lists of AD postmortem tissue and microglia -omics studies, suggesting a potential role for LDs in modulating AD risk or progression. Given this, we exposed primary microglia from the same E3 or E4 mice to exogenous lipid, inflammatory stimulation, necroptotic N2A cells (nN2A), or a combination of treatments to evaluate LD formation and its impact on the cells immune state. Microglia from E4 mice accumulated more LDs in every condition tested, at baseline, and following addition of fatty acids, LPS stimulation, or nN2As. E4 microglia also secreted significantly more cytokines (TNF, IL-1b, IL-10) than E3 microglia in the control, oleic acid, and nN2A treatment conditions, yet showed a blunted response to LPS. In sum, these results suggest that E4 microglia accumulate more LDs compared to E3 microglia and that E4 is associated with a basal LD composition that resembles a pro-inflammatory cell. Together with the high overlap of the LD proteome with established AD-associated datasets, these data further support the idea that alterations in LD dynamics, particularly within microglia, may contribute to the increased risk for AD associated with APOE4.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Despite the critical importance of antibodies in a wide range of areas of biomedical significance, the traditional process of antibody discovery is limited by inefficiency, high costs and failure rates, fundamental logistical hurdles, limited scalability potential, and long turnaround times. Recent computational biology efforts, including machine learning/artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, have proven to have critical capabilities and advantages over purely experimental techniques, disrupting a number of areas that have traditionally met with limited success, such as protein structure modeling, enzyme engineering, drug design, and others. In the context of antibodies, AI-based approaches have been developed to optimize existing antibodies and generate novel antibody sequences in a target-agnostic manner. However, the ability of AI approaches to generate novel paired antibody sequences against a specific target (antigen) of interest has not been validated. In this work, we present MAGE (Monoclonal Antibody GEnerator), a sequence-based protein Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned for the task of generating paired variable heavy and light chain antibody sequences against antigens of interest. Here we show that MAGE is capable of efficiently generating diverse antibody sequences that are distinct from the antibody sequences found in the training datasets, with experimentally validated binding specificity against SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), an emerging avian influenza H5N1 viral hemagglutinin (H5), and respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV-A) prefusion F. MAGE is trained on protein sequence alone and requires only an antigen sequence as input for antibody design, with no need for a preexisting antibody template. MAGE represents a first-in-class model capable of designing human antibodies with demonstrated functionality against multiple targets. AI models for generation of human antibodies will provide unique and disruptive capabilities in the far-reaching field of antibody science.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Tolerance to genetic change, high-mutation rates, adaptations to hosts and immune escape has driven high divergence of viral genes, hampering their functional annotation and phylogenetic inference. The protein structure is more conserved than sequence and can be used for searches of distant homologs and evolutionary analysis of divergent proteins. Structures of viral proteins are traditionally underrepresented in public databases, but recent advances in protein structure prediction allows us to address this issue. Combining two state-of-the-art approaches, AlphaFold2-ColabFold and ESMFold, we predicted models for 85,000 proteins from 4,400 human and animal viruses, expanding the structural coverage for viral proteins by 30 times compared to experimental structures. We also performed structural and network analyses of the models to demonstrate their utility for functional annotation and inference of distant phylogenetic relationships. Taking this approach, we examined the deep evolutionary history of viral class-I fusion glycoproteins, gaining insights on the origins of coronavirus spike protein. To enable further discoveries, we have created Viro3D (https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/), a virus species-centred protein structure database. It allows users to search, browse and download protein models from a virus of interest and explore similar structures present in other virus species.

An example of an important social association is that between breeding partners - a key social connection in monogamously breeding species. The selection of a breeding partner begins well before reproduction for many species, and this process can have consequences for subsequent reproductive success. Thus, the non-breeding season can shape behaviour during the breeding season. However, it is currently unknown how outcomes in the breeding season can impact associate choice during the non-breeding season, as studying this has been limited due to requiring high volumes of individual social data across both contexts. This study used three years of wild great tit social data from Wytham Woods, Oxford, UK, to examine social associations between pairs classified with respect to prior and future relationship status. We found a distinct behavioural pattern in divorced pairs, which was present from early in the winter, suggesting that the act of divorce occurs soon after the completion of the breeding season. Pairs forming for the first time behaved similarly to divorced pairs earlier in the season, but became similar to faithful pairs throughout the winter. On a finer spatiotemporal scale the behaviour of faithful and divorced birds diverged over the winter. These results provide the first evidence of when divorce occurs in paired great tits, while suggesting that different behaviours may drive behavioural divorce at different times.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Here, we identify substantia nigra DANs with Annexin A1 (Anxa1) expression as selectively vulnerable across multiple prodromal PD models and significantly reduced in patient-derived DANs. We found that Anxa1+ DANs have a unique functional profile, as they do not signal reward or reinforce actions, and they are not necessary for motivated behavior. Instead, activity of Anxa1+ DAN axons correlates with vigorous movements during self-paced exploration, yet their silencing only disrupts a subset of action sequences that mirror a PD bradykinesia profile. Importantly, Anxa1+ DANs are essential for procedural learning in a maze task and for motor learning of dexterous actions. These findings establish the early vulnerability of Anxa1+ DANs in PD, whose function can explain prodromal bradykinesia and impairments in procedural motor learning.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Despite its clinical success, the mechanism through which daptomycin exerts its antibacterial properties has remained controversial. Much of the debate is focused around daptomycin's ability to depolarise the cytoplasmic membrane, potential formation of large membrane pores, and its more recently discovered capability to inhibit cell wall synthesis and disturb membrane lipid domain organisation through interactions with cell wall precursor lipids. Here we show that, rather than representing different facets of a single underlying activity, daptomycin exhibits two independent antibacterial mechanisms of action: (i) targeting of cell wall precursor lipids that leads to cell wall synthesis inhibition and (ii) membrane depolarisation that does not rely on interactions with cell wall precursor lipids. This dual mechanism of action provides an explanation for the frequently disagreeing findings obtained through in vivo and in vitro studies and explains why resistance development towards daptomycin is slow and multifactorial. In a broader context, this demonstrates that dual mechanism antibiotics can be clinically successful and exhibit favourable characteristics in terms of real-world, clinically relevant resistance development.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

We found that the translation initiation factor EIF4A1, which unwinds complex mRNA structures in the 5' UTR of oncogenic transcripts, is highly expressed in AML stem- and progenitor-like cells. Inhibiting eIF4A with the small molecule Zotatifin reduces translation of transcripts related to the cell cycle and survival. This results in downregulation of AKT, STAT-5, and MCL-1 and underlies synergy of Zotatifin with Venetoclax.

Kun-peng matched Sylph, achieving the highest precision and lowest false-positive rates while demonstrating superior time and memory efficiency among all tested tools. Furthermore, Kun-peng's efficient database architecture enables the practical utilization of large-scale reference databases that were previously computationally prohibitive. In comprehensive testing across 586 air, water, soil, and human metagenomic samples using an expansive pan-domain database (204,477 genomes, 4.3TB), Kun-peng classified 69.78-94.29% of reads, achieving 38-43% higher classification rates than Kraken2 with the standard database. Unexpectedly, Sylph failed to classify any reads in air samples and left > 99.85% of reads unclassified in water and soil samples. In terms of computational efficiency, Kun-peng processed each sample in 0.2~11.2 minutes using only 4.0~35.4GB peak memory. Remarkably, these processing times were comparable to Kraken2 using the standard database (81GB, 5% of the pan-domain database). Memory-wise, Kun-peng required only 35.4GB peak memory with the pan-domain database, representing a 473-fold reduction compared to Kraken2. When compared to Sylph, Kun-peng processes samples up to 46.3 times faster while using up to 20.6 times less memory. Overall, Kun-peng offers an ultra-memory-efficient, fast, and accurate solution for pan-domain metagenomic classifications.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

We present data obtained with nominal isotropic resolutions ranging from 0.65 to 0.35 mm for partial brain coverage for stimulus evoked responses, and 0.75 mm for whole brain coverage to capture the spontaneous fluctuations that are the source of functional connectivity measures. The increasingly higher nominal resolutions (i.e. smaller voxel volumes and dimensions) employed in image acquisition were shown to correspond to real gains in resolution using image reconstruction methods developed to minimize blurring. Existence of supralinear gains in stimulus-evoked percent signal change and major improvements in statistical significance were evident relative to 7 Tesla, the most advanced commercially available ultrahigh magnetic field platform currently employed in human brain studies. These results were feasible due to gains in intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio, BOLD contrast, and image acceleration provided by the uniquely high magnetic field of 10.5 Tesla, and the use of novel high channel count arrays to capture these gains. The results provide a preview of the potential that will be available in the new era of greater than 10 Tesla human functional imaging, particularly for mesoscale functional organizations and connectivity.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

In this study, we elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of triculamin through heterologous expression and show that the biosynthesis proceeds in the presence of a precursor (triA), macrocyclase (triC), and acetyltransferase (triT). Through in vitro triT acetylation and bioactivity assays, we show that acetylation functions as a resistance mechanism. Genomic searches of triculamin BGC genes across bacteria show that triculamin is more widely distributed than previously anticipated, as triculamin-like core peptides are found in at least three phyla in contrast to previously described lasso peptides that are typically restricted to one phylum. Triculamin BGCs with both canonical and non-canonical RiPP biosynthetic genes were identified. Two strains containing canonical triculamin-like BGCs were chemically characterized and shown to produce the novel triculamin-like lasso peptides palmamin and gelatinamin, the latter of which appears to have an unprecedented additional ring formation. Detailed phylogenetic investigation of the macrocyclases from triculamin-like BGCs suggests that these molecules are products of convergent evolution. These findings broaden the evolutionary and functional landscape of lasso peptides, revealing their unexpected diversification and cross-phylum distribution.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

In this study, we evaluated the impact of the morphogenic regulator GRF-GIF on plant regeneration and genome editing outcomes in tomato. We demonstrate that expressing a tomato GRF-GIF chimera reliably accelerates the onset of shoot regeneration from callus tissue culture by approximately one month and nearly doubles the number of recovered transgenic plants. Consequently, the GRF-GIF chimera enables the recovery of a broader range of edited haplotypes and simplifies the isolation of mutants harboring heritable edits, but without markedly interfering with plant growth and development. Based on these findings, we outline strategies that employ basic or advanced diagnostic pipelines for efficient isolation of single and higher-order mutants in tomato. Our work represents a technical advantage for tomato transformation and genome editing, with potential applications across other Solanaceae species.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Here, we reveal a bacterial anti-phage system that mediates immune signaling through nucleobase modification. Immunity is triggered by phage nucleotide kinases, which, combined with the system-encoded adenosine deaminase, produce deoxyinosine 5'-triphosphate (dITP) as immune messengers. The dITP signal activates downstream effector to mediate cellular NAD+ depletion, resulting in population-level defense through the death of infected cells. To counteract immune signaling, phages deploy specialized enzymes that deplete cellular dAMP, the precursor of dITP messengers. Our findings uncover a nucleobase modification-based anti-phage signaling pathway, establishing noncanonical nucleotides as a new type of immune messengers in bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

However, movements are regularly triggered and constantly corrected based on sensory inputs caused by disturbances to the body or environment. Since such disturbances are often predictable and since preparing for disturbances would make movements better, we hypothesized that expectations about sensory inputs also influence preparatory activity in motor circuits. Here we show that when humans and monkeys are probabilistically cued about the direction of a future mechanical perturbation, they incorporate sensory expectations into their movement preparation and improve their corrective responses. Using high-density neural recordings, we establish that sensory expectations are widespread across the brain, including the motor cortical areas involved in preparing self-initiated actions. The geometry of these preparatory signals in the neural population state is simple, scaling directly with the probability of each perturbation direction. After perturbation onset, a condition-independent perturbation signal shifts the neural state leading to rapid responses that initially reflect sensory expectations. Based on neural networks coupled to a biomechanical model of the arm, we show that this neural geometry emerges through training, but only when the incoming sensory information indicating perturbation direction coincides with - or is preceded by - a condition-independent signal indicating that a perturbation has occurred. Thus, motor circuit dynamics are shaped by future sensory inputs, providing clear empirical support for the idea that movement is governed by the sophisticated manipulation of sensory feedback.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

These latter mechanisms are mediated by defence systems, including DNA-degrading systems such as Restriction-Modification (RM) and CRISPR-Cas, as well as abortive infection systems that induce cell death or dormancy. Computational studies suggest that bacterial genomes encode several defence systems, which may act synergistically to enhance phage resistance. However, the regulation, interactions, and ecological roles of these systems in native hosts remain poorly understood. This study explored the role of eight predicted defence systems in the clinical isolate NILS69 of E. coli by testing its susceptibility to 93 phages. Infectivity and adsorption assays using mutants defective in these systems revealed that only PD-T4-3 and RM systems restricted phages able to adsorb. The RM system acted via a predicted Type IV endonuclease and was also able to limit plasmid conjugation if the plasmid was transferred from a donor strain lacking a methylase, which is the hallmark of Type I, II or III RM systems. Other defence systems showed no detectable activity, likely due to phage specificity, environmental regulation, or cofactor requirements. These findings underscore the need for further studies to investigate the regulation and ecological roles of bacterial defence systems in their native host contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

With comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate that EpiAgent excels in typical downstream tasks, including unsupervised feature extraction, supervised cell annotation, and data imputation. By incorporating external embeddings, EpiAgent facilitates the prediction of cellular responses to both out-of-sample stimulated and unseen genetic perturbations, as well as reference data integration and query data mapping. By simulating the knockout of key cis-regulatory elements, EpiAgent enables in-silico treatment for cancer analysis. We further extended zero-shot capabilities of EpiAgent, allowing direct cell type annotation on newly sequenced datasets without additional training.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Condensation can be driven by phase separation of proteins, and involves highly dynamic, multivalent, and weak interactions of their intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Understanding these interactions has been limited by the lack of large-scale experimental methods capable of generating thermodynamic data. Here, we develop and use Condensate Partitioning by mRNA-Display (CPmD) to directly measure the energetics of the partitioning of almost 100,000 peptides of 14 to 40 amino acid length into condensates formed by an IDR, that of the germ granule protein Dead-box helicase 4 (DDX4). This large set of peptides contained many that were derived from DDX4 itself, as well as a tiling library of a significant fraction of all experimentally characterised IDRs. We show that the results of such large scale partitioning studies yield a uniquely quantitative picture of the driving forces that govern IDR condensate formation of DDX4, as well as partitioning of other sequences into its condensates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the derived set of interactions is also able to quantitatively explain condensate formation of unrelated sequences.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Mixotrophy in ciliates is commonplace, but has been investigated at a cellular and molecular level almost entirely in one organism, Paramecium bursaria. Reliance on just one model system makes it difficult to know which cell biological aspects of this system represent general features of ciliate mixotrophy versus accidental features of the specific organism. Here we describe the cell biology and genome of the giant heterotrichous ciliate Stentor pyriformis. We show that this giant unicellular organism contains Chlorella variabilis as its endosymbiont, that the Chlorella can live freely outside the host, that within the host the Chlorella cells are docked near the cell surface, surrounded by microtubule ""baskets"", and that the photosynthetic efficiency of the Chlorella is reduced inside the Stentor cell compared to when it is free-living outside the host, with photon energy instead being shunted to non-photochemical quenching. Compared to the non-mixotrophic Stentor coeruleus, S. pyriformis has several distinct cellular features that may be related to endosymbiosis: the presence of microtubule baskets, which are absent in S. coeruleus; positive rather than negative phototaxis, which is likely an adaptation to allow the photosynthetic symbionts access to sufficient light; and a lack of pigment in the host cell, which may be an adaptation to tolerate high light levels. Compared to P. bursaria, S. pyriformis has several similar cellular features: in both organisms, the symbiont is a strain of Chlorella variabilis; the Chlorella endosymbiont retains the ability to live freely when separated from the host; and the algal symbionts contained in perialgal vesicles are docked at the cell surface. One potentially informative difference between P. bursaria and S. pyriformis is that S. pyriformis employs a standard genetic code, similar to other Stentor species but different from most other ciliates, including P. bursaria, which use a non-standard code in which one or more stop-codons are respecified to encode amino acids. This difference in genetic code could serve as a barrier to impede gene transfer from symbiont to host in other ciliates, but this would not be a factor in S. pyriformis. A second cell biological difference is that whereas P. bursaria performs phototaxis by a kinetic accumulation mechanism, in which swimming is non-directional but cells slow down in regions of higher light intensity, S. pyriformis performs directed swimming towards the direction of high light intensity. However, as in P. bursaria, phototaxis in S. pyriformis requires the presence of the Chlorella, implying a potential flow of information from the symbiont to direct the orientation and swimming of the host cell. We propose that S. pyriformis will serve as a useful model system for studying the evolution of mixotrophy and endosymbiosis, with unique advantages in terms of size and regenerative ability as well as distinct cellular and genomic features compared with other mixotrophic ciliate models.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Loss of quorum sensing (QS) via mutation of the master regulator, lasR, is a common adaptation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa during chronic infections. Here, we use experimental evolution in host-mimicking media to show that loss of QS is constrained by environmental factors associated with host inflammation. Specifically, environments combining oxidative stress and abundant free amino acids limited loss of QS, whereas QS loss was rapid in the absence of oxidative stress regardless of amino acids. Under oxidative stress, lasR mutations were contingent upon first decoupling regulation of oxidative stress responses from QS via mutations in the promoter region of the primary catalase, katA, or in the oxidative stress regulator, oxyR, enabling maintenance of oxidative stress tolerance. Together, our findings suggest that host inflammatory responses likely delay the loss of QS whilst colonizers undergo stepwise evolution, first adapting to survive lethal stressors before responding to other nutritional selective drivers that favour loss of QS.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Here we design, synthesize, and characterize a reversibly photoswitchable morphinan agonist termed azo-morphine-3 (AM-3) which interconverts from low to high efficacy in response to different wavelengths of light to enable optical control of MOR signaling. Cryo-EM structures of the low efficacy trans and high efficacy cis states of AM-3 bound to the MOR reveal distinct binding modes of the photoswitchable azobenzene moiety, each inducing unique structural dynamics, providing insight into the molecular basis of agonist efficacy. In mice, AM-3 drives reversible and repeatable optical control of anti-nociception with a reduced side effect profile owing to its restriction to the periphery and its ability to be locally activated at the site of pain.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Coral bleaching, the disruption of the symbiosis between stony corals and zooxanthellate algae, is driven by climate change-induced seawater warming and further exacerbated by pathogenic microbes. However, how pathogens, especially viruses, contribute to accelerated bleaching remains poorly understood. The present study utilizes the model sea anemone Nematostella vectensis to explore these dynamics by creating a transgenic line with a reporter gene regulated by sequences from two RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) genes involved in antiviral responses. Under heat stress, the reporter gene showed significant upregulation, indicating that these regulatory sequences are indeed responsive to thermal stress. Analyses of transcriptome data of N. vectensis, Exaiptasia diaphana (another sea anemone), and the stony coral Stylophora pistillata revealed stress-induced activation of a set of bona fide immune-related genes conserved between the three species. Population-specific differences in stress-induced transcriptional responses of immune-related genes were evident in both Nematostella and Stylophora, depending on geographic origin. In Exaiptasia, the presence or absence of zooxanthellae also influenced stress-induced immune gene expression. To test whether the viruses themselves may contribute to this immune response under stress, we subjected Nematostella polyps to variable periods of heat stress and measured the transcript levels of resident viruses as well as selected antiviral genes. While the antiviral genes responded within 1-3 hours of heat stress, viral gene expression was already upregulated within 30 minutes, suggesting that their increase might be contributing to the elevated immune response under stress, and consequentially, the further demise of organismal homeostasis. These findings highlight the complex interplay between environmental stress, viruses, immune responses, and symbiotic states in Hexacorallia. Better understanding of these mechanisms could provide insights into the role of immune pathways in coral resilience and bleaching in a changing climate.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Quantum chemical calculations attribute these shifts primarily to aromatic ring currents, with additional contributions from charge transfer effects linked to weak interactions. The agreement between experimental and computed chemical shifts validated the X-ray structure as a reliable basis for detailed computational analyses.

A WGD occurred in an ancestor of arachnopulmonates (spiders, scorpions, and their relatives), which provides an important independent comparison to WGDs in other animal lineages like those in vertebrates and horseshoe crabs. After WGD, arachnopulmonates retained many duplicated copies (ohnologues) of developmental genes including clusters of homeobox genes, many of which have been inferred to have undergone subfunctionalisation. However, there has been little systematic analysis of gene regulatory sequences and comparison of the expression of ohnologues versus their single-copy orthologues between arachnids. Here we compare the regions of accessible chromatin and gene expression of ohnologues and single-copy genes during three embryonic stages between an arachnopulmonate arachnid, the spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum, and a non-arachnopulmonate arachnid, the harvestman Phalangium opilio. We found that the expression of each spider ohnologue was lower than their single-copy orthologues in the harvestman providing evidence for subfunctionalisation. However, this was not reflected in a reduction in peaks of accessible chromatin because both spider ohnologues and single-copy genes had more peaks than the harvestman genes. We also found peaks of open chromatin that increased in the late stage associated with activation of genes expressed later during embryogenesis in both species. Taken together, our study provides the first genome-wide comparison of gene regulatory sequences and gene expression in arachnids and thus provides new insights into the impact of the arachnopulmonate WGD.

Significance statementThe comparison of independent WGD events is essential to understanding their evolutionary outcomes. Here we examine gene expression and chromatin accessibility during the development of two arachnids, one of which underwent an ancient WGD. Our data provide the first direct comparison of the regulation of ohnologues and single-copy genes in arachnids.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

However, the original version faced limitations in managing redundancies across multiple gene sets. Additionally, programmatic tools like GeneSetCluster can be challenging for users with limited coding expertise. Results We introduce GeneSetCluster 2.0 which substantially improves upon its predecessor. This update presents a new methodology for addressing duplicated gene-sets and incorporates a seriation-based clustering algorithm that reorders data, enabling the identification of patterns. The updated version is optimized for faster computational performance through parallelization, reducing execution times. Furthermore, the 2.0 version also enhances cluster annotation by identifying relevant tissues and biological processes associated with each cluster.

In contrast to prior models, the HCE model is trained end-to-end on neurophysiology data, without relying on pre-trained network features. We recorded 313 V4 neurons during full-color nature video stimulation and fit the HCE model to each neuron. The model's predicted optimal patterns (POPs) revealed complex spatiotemporal pattern selectivity in V4, supporting its role in representing space, time, and color. These findings indicate that area V4 is crucial for image segmentation and grouping operations that are essential for complex vision. Thus, responses of V4 neurons under naturalistic conditions can be explained by a hierarchical three-stage model where each stage consists entirely of units like those found in area V1.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

In this study, we present a systematic analysis of jointly optimizing P(structure|sequence) and P(sequence|structure), which enables us to find optimal solutions for modeling the conformational landscape. We support this approach with experimental evidence that joint optimization is superior for (1) designing stable proteins using a joint model (TrROS (TrRosetta) and TrMRF) (2) achieving high accuracy in stability prediction when jointly modeling (half-masked ESMFold pLDDT+ ESM2 Pseudo-likelihood).

AR is activated by androgens, translocating to the nucleus to bind DNA regulatory elements (AREs) and initiate transcription. This process involves coregulatory proteins, pioneer factors like FOXA1, epigenetic modifications, and 3D chromatin interactions. However, the temporal coordination of AR and co-regulatory binding factors, epigenomic modifications, and 3D chromatin dynamics during AR-mediated transcription remains unclear. Results Using a time-course model of androgen stimulation in LNCaP prostate cancer cells, we integrated temporal multi-omics datasets into the MOFA+ framework to investigate AR-mediated transcriptional dynamics. Our analyses uncovered a critical role for rapid AR binding at gene promoters in driving nascent transcription of AR target genes. We demonstrated that AR binding is preceded by nucleosome H3K27 acetylation flanking androgen response elements, which are constitutively marked by FOXA1 binding. Notably, we identified a temporal early switch in nascent transcription post-androgen stimulation, from MYC to AR target genes, likely mediated by transient androgen-induced 3D chromatin interactions. Significance These findings reveal that androgen stimulation rapidly reorganizes 3D chromatin structure and differential MYC and AR transcription factor binding to trigger three distinct patterns of temporal epigenome states associated with the establishment of AR-mediated transcription in prostate cancer. These insights advance understanding of AR regulation in prostate cancer and contribute to a deeper understanding of the temporal relationship between MYC and AR transcriptional regulation in hormone-driven cancers.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Yet, the co-linearity of codons and amino acids is so commonplace an idea that few even ask how it arose. Readout is done by two distinct sets of proteins, called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARS). AARS must enforce the rules first used to assemble themselves. The roots of translation lie in experimentally testing the structural codes that the earliest AARS*tRNA cognate pairs used to recognize both amino acid and RNA substrates. We review here new results on five different facets of that problem. (i) The surfaces of structures coded by opposite strands of the same gene have opposite polarities. The corresponding proteins then fold up ""inside out"" relative to one another. The inversion symmetry of base pairing thus projects into the proteome. That leads in turn to contrasting amino acid and RNA substrate binding modes. (ii) E. coli reproduces in vivo the nested hierarchy of active excerpts we had designed as models--protozymes and urzymes--for ancestral AARS. (iii) A third novel deletion produced in vivo and a new Class II urzyme suggest how to design bidirectional urzyme genes. (iv) Codon middle-base pairing provides a basis to constrain Class I and II AARS family trees. (v) AARS urzymes acylate Class-specific subsets of an RNA library, showing RNA substrate specificity for the first time. Four new phylogenetic routines augment these results to compose a viable platform for experimental study of the origins of genetic coding.

Significance StatementThe origin of genetic coding poses questions distinct from those faced studying the evolution of enzymes since the first cells. Modern enzymes that translate the code range in size from [~]330 to [~]970 amino acids. Ancestral forms cannot have been nearly as complex. Moreover, such primitive enzymes likely could enforce only a much-reduced coding alphabet. Structural and molecular biology data point to a broad sketch of events leading to the code. That research platform will enable us to see how Nature came to store information about the physical chemistry of amino acids in the coding table. That, in turn, allowed searching of a very broad amino acid sequence space. Selection could then learn how to assemble amino acids into functional, reflexive catalysts. Those catalysts had rates and fidelities consistent with bootstrapping the modern coding alphabet. New phylogenetic algorithms need to be developed to fully test that putative sketch experimentally.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

The recent introduction of KRAS inhibitors has been a source of tremendous enthusiasm; however, therapeutic resistance has emerged, and combination approaches are needed. In particular, it is important to understand how downstream signaling of KRAS supports PDAC growth. For example, DUSP6, a dual-specificity phosphatase that modulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation and RAS pathway activity, has emerged as an important regulator of KRAS-MAPK signaling. Analysis across diverse bulk RNA-seq datasets revealed that DUSP6 is markedly overexpressed in primary tumor samples compared to non-tumoral pancreatic tissue. Interestingly, both human bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data indicated that DUSP6 was upregulated in epithelial cells within the tumor. Further examination showed that DUSP6 was also overexpressed in metastatic samples relative to primary tumor samples, and this upregulation correlated with the quasi-mesenchymal/squamous molecular subtype. Pertaining to its clinical significance, patients with high DUSP6 expression exhibited a poorer prognosis for overall survival than those with low expression. Subsequent gene set enrichment analysis of publicly available datasets revealed the enrichment of pathways associated with cell migration and metabolism in metastatic samples. To elucidate the role of DUSP6 in these pathways, we developed PDAC cell lines stably knocked down DUSP6 and observed a concurrent increase in ERK/MAPK activation. Additionally, suppression of DUSP6 demonstrated PDAC cell-specific alterations in migratory capacity . Next, we assessed the metabolism of PDAC cell lines following DUSP6 knockdown and observed a notable increase in basal glycolysis. Interestingly, despite the observed alterations in migratory capacity and glycolytic metabolism upon DUSP6 modulation, the combined approach of DUSP6 downregulation and glycolysis inhibition failed to affect the observed migratory phenotype, suggesting that glycolytic demands did not drive the migratory phenotype . In summary, these findings suggest that DUSP6 elicits two independent functions in PDAC: migratory capacity and glycolysis metabolism, providing new insights into the function of DUSP6 in PDAC.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

In North America, infections in novel avian and mammalian species suggest the potential for changing ecology and establishment of new animal reservoirs. Outbreaks among domestic birds have persisted despite aggressive culling, necessitating a re-examination of how these outbreaks were sparked and maintained. To recover how these viruses were introduced and disseminated in North America, we analyzed 1,818 Hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences sampled from North American wild birds, domestic birds and mammals from November 2021-September 2023 using Bayesian phylodynamic approaches. Using HA, we infer that the North American panzootic was driven by [~]8 independent introductions into North America via the Atlantic and Pacific Flyways, followed by rapid dissemination westward via wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, shorebirds, and Galliformes, while species such as songbirds, raptors, and owls mostly acted as dead-end hosts. Unlike the epizootic of 2015, outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by [~]46-113 independent introductions from wild birds, with some onward transmission. Backyard birds were infected [~]10 days earlier on average than birds in commercial poultry production settings, suggesting that they could act as ""early warning signals"" for transmission upticks in a given area. Our findings support wild birds as an emerging reservoir for HPAI transmission in North America and suggest continuous surveillance of wild Anseriformes and shorebirds as crucial for outbreak inference. Future prevention of agricultural outbreaks may require investment in strategies that reduce transmission at the wild bird/agriculture interface, and investigation of backyard birds as putative early warning signs.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Research into natural variation and the evolution of plasticity frequently studies cis-regulatory elements with theory suggesting they are more important evolutionarily than trans-regulatory elements. Genome-wide association studies have supported this idea, observing a predominance of cis-loci affecting plasticity. However, studies in structured populations provide a contrasting image, raising questions about the genetic architecture of natural variation in plasticity. To circumvent potential statistical difficulties present in genome-wide association studies, we mapped loci underlying transcriptomic plasticity in response to salicylic acid using recombinant inbred lines generated from two random Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. We detected extensive transgressive segregation in the salicylic acid response, suggesting that plasticity to salicylate in Arabidopsis is polygenic. Most loci (>75%) underlying this variation act in trans, especially for loci influencing plasticity. Trans-acting loci were enriched in genome hotspots, with predominantly small effect sizes distributed across many genes. This could potentially explain their under-discovery in genome-wide association studies. This work reveals a potentially important role for trans-acting loci in plastic expression responses, with implications for understanding plant adaptation to different environments.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Tsuboyama et al. measured folding stability for 57,698 single amino acid insertion or deletion mutants in 405 small domains, and this analysis identified 103 stabilizing mutants ({triangleup}{triangleup}Gunfolding > 1 kcal/mol).

We also find that stabilizing indels are typically correctly classified as stabilizing by the Rosetta energy function (which explicitly models backbone energetics), but not by an inverse folding (ESM-IF)-based analysis (Cagiada et al. 2024) which predicts absolute stability ({triangleup}Gunfolding).","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Recent studies highlight the significance of interactions between ACh and various neuromodulators in regulating complex behaviors. The ability to simultaneously image ACh and other neuromodulators can provide valuable information regarding the mechanisms underlying these behaviors. Here, we developed a series of red fluorescent G protein-coupled receptor activation-based (GRAB) ACh sensors, with a wide detection range and expanded spectral profile. The high-affinity sensor, rACh1h, reliably detects ACh release in various brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and cortex. Moreover, rACh1h can be co-expressed with green fluorescent sensors in order to record ACh release together with other neurochemicals in various behavioral contexts using fiber photometry and two-photon imaging, with high spatiotemporal resolution. These new ACh sensors can therefore provide valuable new insights regarding the functional role of the cholinergic system under both physiological and pathological conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Some protein language models have the capacity to encode dependencies between sites in conserved structural and functional domains across the protein universe. We employ the MSA Transformer, which takes a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) as an input, and is trained with masked language modeling objectives, to investigate if and how effects of epistasis can be captured to enhance the analysis of phylogenetic relationships. We test whether the MSA Transformer internally encodes evolutionary distances between the sequences in the MSA despite this information not being explicitly available during training. We investigate the model's reliance on information available in columns as opposed to rows in the MSA, by systematically shuffling sequence content. We then use MSA Transformer on both natural and simulated MSAs to reconstruct entire phylogenetic trees with implied ancestral branchpoints, and assess their consistency with trees from maximum likelihood inference. We demonstrate how both previously known and novel evolutionary relationships are available from a ""non-classical"" approach with very different computational requirements, by reconstructing phylogenetic trees for the RNA virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA virus domain. We anticipate that MSA Transformer will not replace but rather complement classical phylogenetic inference, to accurately recover the evolutionary history of protein families.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

This phenomenon is similar to T cell exhaustion but less well characterized, which limits therapeutic interventions.

Nevertheless, the nature of ICP expressionin NK cellsis still poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to identify the conditions that lead to and the phenotype of immune checkpoint LAG3 (Lymphocyte-activation gene 3) expressing NK cells. Using various experimental models, we found that LAG3 is expressed by murine NK cells upon activation in different contexts, including in response to cancer and acute viral infections. LAG3 marks a subset of immature, proliferating and activated cells, which, despite activation, have a reduced capacitytorespond to a broad range of stimuli. Further characterization also revealed that LAG3+ NK cells exhibit a transcriptional signature similar to that of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our results support the use of LAG3 as a marker of dysfunctional NK cells across diverse chronic and acute inflammatory conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

However, most existing genetic studies have been based on short-read sequencing methods, which capture fewer than half of the SVs present in any one individual. Long-read sequencing (LRS) enhances our ability to detect disease-associated and functionally relevant structural variants (SVs); however, its application in large-scale genomic studies has been limited by challenges in sample preparation and high costs. Here, we leverage a new scalable wet-lab protocol and computational pipeline for whole-genome Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing and apply it to neurologically normal control samples from the North American Brain Expression Consortium (NABEC) (European ancestry) and Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC) (African or African admixed ancestry) cohorts. Through this work, we present a publicly available long-read resource from 351 human brain samples (median N50: 27 Kbp and at an average depth of [~]40x genome coverage). We discover approximately 234,905 SVs and produce locally phased assemblies that cover 95% of all protein-coding genes in GRCh38. Utilizing matched expression datasets for these samples, we apply quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses and identify SVs that impact gene expression in post-mortem frontal cortex brain tissue. Further, we determine haplotype- specific methylation signatures at millions of CpGs and, with this data, identify cis-acting SVs. In summary, these results highlight that large-scale LRS can identify complex regulatory mechanisms in the brain that were inaccessible using previous approaches. We believe this new resource provides a critical step toward understanding the biological effects of genetic variation in the human brain.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

We therefore present the current study, a repeated-measures dose-dependent study of the subjective and neural dynamics induced through DMT under naturalistic conditions. Nineteen participants received either a 20mg or 40mg dose of freebase DMT across two dosing sessions in a blinded, counterbalanced order, with blinding rates consistent across doses. Electroencephalography (EEG) data was collected, as well as time-resolved retrospective measures of subjective experience (Temporal Experience Tracing). Both doses of DMT induced rapid changes in experience dimensions. However, the 40mg dose induced significantly more extreme visual hallucinations and emotionally intense experiences. Further, we computed a variety of neural markers on the EEG data, and found that oscillatory alpha power and permutation entropy were most strongly associated with continuous subjective experience dimensions. Strikingly, lempel-ziv complexity, a previously hailed as a robust correlate of subjective experiences within the psychedelic-state, was the least strongly associated neural marker. These findings provide an important insight into how distinct neural dynamics may contribute to this radical and intense altered state of consciousness.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Senescence is defined as an irreversible growth arrest observed when cells are exposed to a variety of stressors including DNA damage, oxidative stress, or nutrient deprivation. While senescence is a well-established driver of aging and age-related diseases, it is a highly heterogeneous process with significant variations across organisms, tissues, and cell types. The relatively low abundance of senescence in healthy aged tissues represents a major challenge to studying senescence in a given organ, including the human lung. To overcome this limitation, we developed a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning framework to generate a comprehensive senescence marker gene list in human lungs (termed SenSet) using the largest publicly available single-cell lung dataset, the Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA). We validated SenSet in a highly complex ex vivo human 3D lung tissue culture model subjected to the senescence inducers bleomycin, doxorubicin, or irradiation, and established its sensitivity and accuracy in characterizing senescence. Using SenSet, we identified and validated cell-type specific senescence signatures in distinct lung cell populations upon aging and environmental exposures. Our study presents the first comprehensive analysis of senescent cells in the healthy aging lung and uncovers cell-specific gene signatures of senescence, presenting fundamental implications for our understanding of major lung diseases, including cancer, fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or asthma.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Despite its significance in lysozyme amyloidosis, the intermediate state has been recalcitrant to detailed structural investigation as it is only transiently and sparsely populated. Here, we investigated the intermediate state of a mutational variant of human lysozyme (I59T) using CEST and CPMG RD NMR at low pH. 15N CEST profiles probed the thermal unfolding of the native state into the denatured ensemble and revealed an additional state distinct from the two major states. Global fitting of 15N CEST and CPMG data provided kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the exchange between all three states, characterising the intermediate state populated at 0.6%. 1H CEST data also confirmed the presence of the intermediate state displaying unusually high or low 1HN chemical shifts. To further investigate the structural details of the intermediate state we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which recapitulated the experimentally observed folding pathway and free energy landscape. A high-energy intermediate state with a locally disordered {beta}-domain and C-helix was observed, revealing non-native hydrogen bonding and amide-{pi} interactions. These interactions account for the anomalous 1H chemical shifts and likely stabilise the transient intermediate state structure. Together, our NMR and MD data provide the first direct structural information on the intermediate state, offering insights into targeting lysozyme amyloidosis.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Various epithelial cancers express high levels of WNT7B and WNT10A that are not commonly expressed during tissue homeostasis, but rather associate with tissue development and regeneration. Although increased WNT7B/10A expression correlates with aggressive disease and lower patient survival rates, the mechanism by which these WNTs influence cancer progression remains unknown. Here, we use patient-derived organoids to show that tumor-intrinsic expression of WNT7B/10A drives survival and growth of advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Bulk and single-cell profiling reveal that WNT7B drives proliferation and promotes expression of a poor prognosis basal-like state by preventing expression of a more differentiated, classical PDAC signature. By generating WNT7B reporter organoids, we show that heterogeneously distributed WNT-high PDAC cells are shifted towards a more basal-like phenotype and stably co-exist with WNT-low/negative lineages. Furthermore, hybrid co-cultures of WNT7B-proficient and -knockout PDAC organoids demonstrate that WNT-sending cells drive survival and proliferation of neighboring WNT-negative cells within the cancer epithelium via short range, cell contact-dependent signaling. In summary, our work uncovers a prominent role of WNT7B/10A in driving PDAC subtype heterogeneity and argues that WNT inhibition may be applied to force a class switch to a more differentiated, less aggressive cancer subtype that correlates with improved therapeutical response.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Direct force measurements reveal increased mechanical activity at the interface of the two competing cell types in the form of large stress fluctuations which can lead to upward forces and cell elimination.

Consequently, melanoma cells must rapidly evolve to evade immune detection by simultaneously modulating cell-autonomous epigenetic mechanisms and tumor-microenvironment interactions. Angiogenesis has been implicated in this process; although an increase of vasculature initiates the immune response in normal tissue, solid tumors manage to somehow enhance blood flow while preventing immune cell infiltration. By comparing the expression of transcription factors (TFs) across early-stage melanoma, naevi, and other cancer types, we found the homeodomain-containing TF HOXD13 drives a melanoblast-like developmental program, which is upregulated in melanoma and strongly correlated with angiogenesis and immune cell exclusion. Using transcriptomics, 3D chromatin profiling, and in vivo models, we demonstrate that HOXD13 upregulation promotes tumor growth in vivo by concomitantly enhancing angiogenesis and suppressing T-cell infiltration. HOXD13 orchestrates 3D chromatin contacts between distal enhancers and promoters, simultaneously activating VEGFA, SEMA3A, and CD73. VEGFA and SEMA3A remodel the tumor vasculature and CD73 elevates extracellular levels of adenosine, a vasodilator and immune suppressor that binds adenosine receptors (AdR) on endothelial and T cells. In line with these findings, HOXD13-induced growth advantage in vivo was significantly reversed by the concomitant administration of VEGFR and AdR inhibitors. By revealing a dual pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive HOXD13-CD73/VEGF gene regulatory axis, we identify a subset of patients who might benefit from combinations of AdR and VEGFR inhibitors which are both currently being tested in clinical trials.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

The xrRNA forms a 9 base pair pseudoknot that creates a knot-like topology similar to that of flavivirus xrRNAs, despite lacking sequence similarity. Biophysical assays confirm a compact pseudoknot structure in solution, and functional studies validate its relevance both in vitro and during infection. Our study reveals how viral RNAs achieve a common functional outcome through highly divergent sequences and identifies the knot-like topology as a defining feature of xrRNAs.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Existing tools for uncovering co-evolutionary signals primarily rely on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), often neglecting considerations of phylogenetic relatedness and shared evolutionary history. Here, we present a novel approach based on the substitution mapping of amino acid changes onto the phylogenetic tree. We categorize amino acids into two groups: 'tolerable' and 'intolerable,' and assign them to each position based on the position dynamics concerning the observed amino acids. Amino acids deemed 'tolerable' are those observed phylogenetically independently and multiple times at a specific position, signifying the position's tolerance to that alteration. Gaps are regarded as a third character type, and we only consider phylogenetically independent altered gap characters. Our algorithm is based on a tree traversal process through the nodes and computes the total amount of substitution per branch based on the probability differences of two groups of amino acids and gaps between neighboring nodes. We employ an MSA-masking approach to mitigate misleading artifacts from poorly aligned regions. When compared to tools utilizing phylogeny (CAPS and CoMap) and state-of-the-art MSA-based approaches (DCA, GaussDCA, PSICOV, and MIp), our method exhibits significantly superior accuracy in identifying co-evolving position pairs, as measured by statistical metrics including MCC, AUC, and F1 score. PHACE's success arises from its ability to consider the frequently neglected phylogenetic dependency.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

For instance, it is well-established that a common North American deermouse, Peromyscus leucopus, has unique interactions with microbes, which likely shape its ability to serve as a critical reservoir for numerous zoonotic pathogens, including a Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi.

In mammalian oocytes, defects in the structure or composition of chromosomes are a leading cause of aberrant or failed meiosis, and by extension, can cause miscarriage and infertility. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, but are critical for development of novel diagnostics and treatments. The chromosome periphery, the least understood chromosome compartment, has recently emerged as an essential component of mitotic chromosomes and somatic cell division. However, in female meiosis it remains completely unexplored. This study provides the first comprehensive survey of a meiotic chromosome periphery compartment in both human and mouse oocytes. Using a combination of time-lapse microscopy, super-resolution imaging and 3DCLEM we show that removing the chromosome periphery, via Ki67 depletion, has substantial negative impact on chromosome structure, spatial organization and positional awareness, with many oocytes stalling and arresting in meiosis I. Importantly, we also reveal key differences between the mitotic and oocyte meiotic chromosome periphery compartments, most remarkably in the retention of Ki67 in the oocyte through anaphase I, where unwanted chromosomes are stripped of Ki67 before being ejected from the oocyte. This work presents the discovery of an exciting new pathway operating during female meiosis and a provides a platform for future work exploring the meiotic chromosome periphery for therapeutic vulnerabilities.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

These eco-evolutionary dynamics are largely unexplored, particularly at the molecular level. Here, we hypothesize that such dynamics in the wake of the GOE explain the otherwise paradoxical evolutionary history of metal use in nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase. This ancient metalloenzyme exists in three isozymes, with distinct metal cofactors. Recent research demonstrates that the most ancient isozyme, emerging a billion years or more before the GOE, required a molybdenum (Mo)-based cofactor. ""Alternative"" nitrogenases using iron (Fe) or vanadium (V) cofactors evolved after the GOE. This history is puzzling because Mo availability in the environment increased after the GOE, while Fe availability decreased, due to the contrasting environmental redox behaviors of these elements. Why, then, did the alternatives emerge only after the GOE? Using a simple model constrained by known microbial Mo quotas, we demonstrate that a strong selection pressure for use of metals in nitrogenase other than Mo is a likely consequence of competition between nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes and nitrate-reducing microbes, which require Mo for nitrate reduction and assimilation. This competition would have intensified after the GOE due to increasing environmental availability of nitrate, explaining the evolutionary timing of the nitrogenase isozymes. Ecological resource competition therefore emerges as a third driver of metallome evolution in deep-time, alongside the relative environmental availabilities and adaptive advantages of particular metals.

Significance statementThe selection of metals in biochemical evolution is widely attributed to either the relative environmental availability of specific metals or their functional benefits in biological systems. We propose a third pressure, ecological resource competition, which is typically overlooked as a driver of molecular novelty in deep time. Specifically, we hypothesize that competition between Mo-dependent nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes and Mo-dependent nitrate reducers led to the emergence of Mo-free ""alternative"" nitrogenase enzymes during the early Proterozoic. This novel hypothesis explains the paradoxical emergence of alternative nitrogenases after the Great Oxidation Event despite increasing ocean Mo abundances at that time. Competition among microbial species for the same metals likely drove molecular innovations, especially in response to dynamically changing geochemical landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

A range of methods have been developed to detect unusual clusters of infections in these settings; however use of explicitly 3-D (x,y,z) spatial data has received little attention. In this study, we use data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic to assess the fine-scale spatial epidemiology and the clustering of confirmed cases to better understand impacts of spatial resolution and aggregation on spatio-temporal cluster detection. Methods Data for this analysis combined the results from mandatory weekly viral testing during the 2020-2021 academic year with high-resolution spatial data from university students residing in high-rise residence halls at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst campus. These data were analyzed for statistically-significant clustering of SARS-CoV-2 cases in three- dimensional space as well as time, within and between the high-density buildings on campus. Two sets of analyses were conducted. The first used a Space-Time Permutation Model, which scans for areas with a greater than expected number of cases (SaTScan). To assess the impact of data aggregation, analysis was done at several levels of spatial resolution. Additionally, we performed sensitivity analyses using a purely temporal surveillance algorithm, CDC's Early Aberration Reporting System- (EARS). Results and conclusions Analysis with SaTScan at the room- and floor-level identified multiple statistically significant clusters within one residence hall. Analyses with these same cases aggregated at the floor-level were found to be as sensitive, but far less computationally intensive, than room-level analysis. Analysis at both of these spatial scales was more sensitive than analysis aggregated at the street address-level. Two events exceeding alert thresholds were detected in the purely temporal analysis; one of which was also detected in spatio-temporal analyses. These results expand our understanding of spatio-temporal scan metrics to include 3-D analysis, and optimizing choice of spatial scales. These results have broad applicability in epidemiology in assessing the ability of spatio-temporal methods for public health surveillance, with potential expansion to ecological studies incorporating vertical movement.","NA","medrxiv",1734991745661

Accordingly, using language involves an interplay between unimodal brain areas that process sensory information and transmodal areas that respond to linguistic input regardless of the input modality (e.g., reading sentences vs. listening to speech). Previous work has shown that intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC), when performed within individuals, can delineate a distributed language network that overlaps in detail with regions activated by a reading task. The network was widely distributed across multiple brain regions, recapitulating an organization that is characteristic of association cortex, and which suggests that the distributed language network serves transmodal, not unimodal, functions. Here, we tested whether the distributed language network encapsulates transmodal functions by assessing its degree of overlap with two language tasks, one auditory (i.e., listening to speech) and one visual (i.e., reading sentences). The results show that the distributed language network aligns well with regions activated by both tasks, supporting a transmodal function. Further, the boundaries of the distributed language network along the lateral temporal cortex serve as a good proxy for the division between transmodal language and auditory functions: presentation of sounds (i.e., filtered, incomprehensible speech) evoked activity that was largely outside of the distributed language network but closely followed the network boundaries. These findings support that individualized iFC estimates can delineate the division between sensory-linked and abstract linguistic functions. We conclude that within-individual iFC may be viable for language mapping in individuals with aphasia who cannot perform language tasks in the scanner.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

V1R-type olfactory receptors are highly conserved at the amino acid sequence level among teleost fish and believed to play a fundamental role in reproduction. Our previous studies have reported the unexpected sequence diversity of V1Rs among some cichlid species, implying the possible involvement of V1Rs in their speciation. In this study, we extensively investigated the process of the evolutionary diversification of all six V1Rs (V1R1 to V1R6) by utilizing the genome data from 528 cichlid species, covering almost all lineages. In V1R2, two highly divergent alleles (1.17%: variant sites/CDS length) without recombination were shared and maintained among the cichlids of all East African Great Lakes. In V1R6, large number of highly variable alleles that could be derived from the multiple recombination of two highly divergent alleles (1.39%: variant sites/CDS length) were shared among the cichlids of Lake Victoria. Additionally, we also identified highly divergent alleles in V1R1 within the tribe Tropheini, and in both V1R3 and V1R6 within Trematocarini and Ectodini. Given that one of the two divergent alleles of these V1Rs emerged so rapidly during cichlid evolution, they are likely to be derived from introgression. However, the source lineages for those introgressions were not identified despite the extensive exploration implying that they have already been extinct. This work provides compelling support for the contribution of introgression to explain striking diversity of V1Rs in East African cichlids.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Whether the emergence of resistance is accelerated by environmental exposure to low levels of therapeutics remains controversial. Here, we report a non-genetic mechanism of stress adaptation that promotes heritable resistance to the widely used antifungal drug fluconazole. In the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, transient exposure to subtherapeutic fluconazole doses induces a protective response that we term para-resistance. Like conventional resistance mechanisms, para-resistance is heritable. However, it does not arise from genetic mutations and can revert spontaneously. Systematic analyses of para-resistant isolates suggest that its key regulators include the stress-activated MAP kinase Hog1, the histone deacetylase subunit Snt1, the chromatin regulator Rap1, and the Sko1 transcriptional factor. Notably, molecules that disrupt biomolecular condensation and prion propagation - crucial for the inheritance of protein assemblies - block the induction of para-resistance, whereas inhibiting histone deacetylases facilitates its induction. We find that para-resistance is common in clinical isolates and, remarkably, passage through the mammalian gut triggers its acquisition, compromising fluconazole's therapeutic efficacy. Our work defines a pervasive, prion-like epigenetic mechanism of stress adaptation and highlights potential strategies to mitigate the rapid emergence of drug resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Theory suggests the evolution of differentiation between life stages is facilitated by the expression of different genes at different points throughout ontogeny, which alleviates pleiotropic evolutionary constraints. Therefore, ascertaining what contributes to specialized patterns of gene expression across ontogeny is fundamental to understanding the evolution of ontogenetic complexity. Expression divergence between duplicate genes and gene organization on chromosomes have been identified as important features of relatively complex ontogenies. Therefore, one could predict that their link to transcriptional specialization across ontogeny may be weaker in relatively simpler life cycles. Here, we investigated the links between gene duplication, gene organization, and stage-specific patterns of expression across the relatively simple Caenorhabditis elegans life cycle. We found that signatures of stage-biased chromosomal regions were weaker in C. elegans than what has been previously described in organisms with more complex ontogenies. Furthermore, we found the extent that duplicate genes varied in ontogenetic expression pattern was more constrained in C. elegans. Overall, our findings add to a body of evidence that suggests a link between gene duplication and gene organization and the evolution of complex ontogenies.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years.

By contrast, Marchantia-specific immune mechanisms have not been explored. In this study, we investigated the genetic basis of quantitative resistance in M. polymorpha against the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum nymphaeae, a naturally occurring compatible parasite. Through a combination of phenotypic, cytological and transcriptomic approaches, combined with genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identified key defense-related genes and pathways. Transcriptomic analyses performed on two lines with contrasting suceptibilities to the pathogen revealed a strong overlap in immune responses between M. polymorpha and angiosperms, including the upregulation of PR proteins, transcription factors typically associated with biotic stresses, and enzymes involved in specialized metabolism. Leveraging the biological and genetic variability present in a collection of natural M. polymorpha accessions, highlight the role of horizontally transferred microbial-like terpene synthase (MTPSL) genes, which may contribute to the exceptional terpene diversity in liverworts and play a role in pathogen resistance. GWAS uncovered candidate loci associated with resistance traits, implicating both core immune components and specialized metabolic pathways. These results provide new insights into the specific molecular underpinnings of bryophyte immunity and underscore the evolutionary significance of horizontal gene transfer and specialized metabolites in shaping plant-pathogen interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Structural data illustrate how UBR4 binds substrate and extends K48-specific ubiquitin chains.

Numerous inferential methods have been developed to account for the effect of spatial autocorrelation when evaluating map-to-map similarity. A popular method to generate surrogate maps with preserved spatial autocorrelation is the spin test. Here we show that a key component of the procedure -- projecting brain maps to a spherical surface -- distorts distance relationships between vertices. These distortions result in surrogate maps that imperfectly preserve spatial autocorrelation, yielding inflated false positive rates. We then confirm that targeted removal of individual spins with high distortion reduces false positive rates.

Viral sequencing during the pandemic allowed us to track disease spread, quickly identify new variants, and guide the development of vaccines. Tiled amplicon sequencing, in which a panel of primers is used for multiplex amplification of fragments across an entire genome, was the cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. The speed, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of this method led to its implementation in academic and public health laboratories across the world and adaptation to a broad range of viral pathogens. However, similar methods are not available for larger bacterial genomes, for which whole-genome sequencing typically requires in vitro culture. This increases costs, error rates and turnaround times. The need to culture poses particular problems for medically important bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which are slow to grow and challenging to culture. As a proof of concept, we developed two novel whole-genome amplicon panels for M. tuberculosis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Applying our amplicon panels to clinical samples, we show the ability to classify pathogen subgroups and to reliably identify markers of drug resistance without culturing. Development of this work in clinical settings has the potential to dramatically reduce the time of diagnosis of drug resistance for multiple drugs in parallel, enabling earlier intervention for high priority pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

However, effectively controlling these models to generate novel sequences with desired functions remains a major challenge. Here, we show that Evo, a 7-billion parameter genomic language model, can perform function-guided design that generalizes beyond natural sequences. By learning semantic relationships across multiple genes, Evo enables a genomic ""autocomplete"" in which a DNA prompt encoding a desired function instructs the model to generate novel DNA sequences that can be mined for similar functions. We term this process ""semantic mining,"" which, unlike traditional genome mining, can access a sequence landscape unconstrained by discovered evolutionary innovation. We validate this approach by experimentally testing the activity of generated anti-CRISPR proteins and toxin-antitoxin systems, including de novo genes with no significant homology to any natural protein. Strikingly, in-context protein design with Evo achieves potent activity and high experimental success rates even in the absence of structural hypotheses, known evolutionary conservation, or task-specific fine-tuning. We then use Evo to autocomplete millions of prompts to produce SynGenome, a first-of-its-kind database containing over 120 billion base pairs of AI-generated genomic sequences that enables semantic mining across many possible functions. The semantic mining paradigm enables functional exploration that ventures beyond the observed evolutionary universe.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

To date, almost all megaphages have evaded cultivation, with only phage G being in active culture for over 50 years. We examined with multiomics this five decades long cultivated history from nine different laboratories with five different lab variants to the modern era. In this work, we resolved the five complete phage G genomes, the particle proteome, de novo methylome, and used artificial intelligence (AI) to annotate the genome of phage G. Phage G is one of the largest phages with a size of >0.6 {micro}m, about half the width of the host cell, and a 499 kbp, non-permuted, linear genome that has, uniquely among known phages, two pairs of ends. Its closest known relative is Moose phage W30-1 which was metagenomically assembled without cultivation from a moose rumen sample. Phage G has >650 protein-coding open reading frames (ORFs), with >65% being hypothetical proteins with no known function, with the rest of the genome geared towards nucleic acid replication (e.g., helicases, polymerases, endonucleases) and are structural in nature (e.g., capsid, tail, portal, terminase). The genome encodes a 35 kbp stretch with 66 ORFs without any known functional homology, a cryptic genomic region that is roughly the size of phage lambda. Phage G has an expansive repertoire of auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) acquired from its bacterial host, including a phoH,ftsZ,UvsX/RecA-like, gyrA, gyrB,and DHFR. Furthermore, AMGs discovered in phage G could manipulate host sporulation (sspD, RsfA, spoK) and antiviral escape genes (e.g., anti-CBass nuclease and Anti-Pycsar protein). Phage proteomics found >15% of the protein ORFs were present in either the wild-type or mutant variants of phage G, including genes involved in replication (e.g.,UvsX/RecA-like), host sporulation, as well as structural genes (e.g., capsid, tail, portal). The methylome of phage G was localized to the cryptic region with limited functional homology, with supervised machine learning (i.e., HMMs) was unable to resolve this region, but was resolved with protein structural AI. This cryptic region was a hot spot for methylation at 32%, where many of the functions of the ORF are still unknown.

Infected hamsters presented a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, with overexpression of innate immunity genes, impacted dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, altered energy metabolism.

Specifically, we focused on hyperconnected 3D regulatory hubs and demonstrated that hub-interacting genes exhibit high and coordinated expression at the single-cell level and strong association with oncogenic programs that distinguish IDH-wt glioblastoma patients from low-grade glioma. Epigenetic silencing of a recurrent 3D enhancer hub--with an uncharacterized role in glioblastoma--was sufficient to cause concordant downregulation of multiple hub-connected genes along with significant shifts in transcriptional states and reduced clonogenicity. By integrating published datasets from other cancer types, we also identified both ''universal '' and cancer type-specific 3D regulatory hubs which enrich for varying oncogenic programs and nominate specific factors associated with worse outcomes. Genetic alterations, such as focal duplications, could explain only a small fraction of the detected hyperconnected hubs and their increased activity.

Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) isolate genes and their regulatory elements within the same topological neighborhood, avoiding crosstalk between regulatory elements. Perturbation of domain boundaries causes aberrant genomic contacts and gene expression misregulation. Architectural proteins such as CTCF and the cohesin complex are critical to form boundaries. However, we still lack a complete understanding of what makes a boundary more effective at insulating genomic contacts than others. To understand how domains are structured, we experimentally classified boundaries according to their chromatin accessibility as a proxy of protein occupancy in K562 human cells. We found that highly accessible boundaries are occupied by more proteins, are more robust contact insulators, have a more conserved CTCF DNA-binding motif and are more conserved across cell types in contrast to less accessible ones. By exploring the proteins enriched at boundaries with different accessibility, we found that CTCF and cohesin, together with REST, form a module, and ZFN316, together with EMSY, form another module, and both modules occupy boundaries very frequently. Finally, by using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genetic edition of ZNF316 DNA-binding motif at a robust domain boundary, we demonstrate that ZNF316 can block chromatin contacts in the absence of CTCF. Our results emphasize the importance of protein combination and abundance to support boundary strength and propose ZNF316 as a novel architectural protein.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Bacteria encode >100 distinct viral (phage) defense systems and each has evolved to sense crucial components or activities associated with the viral lifecycle. Here we used a high-throughput AlphaFold-multimer screen to discover that a bacterial NLR-related protein directly senses multiple phage proteins, thereby limiting immune evasion. Phages encoded as many as 5 unrelated activators that were predicted to bind the same interface of a C-terminal sensor domain. Genetic and biochemical assays confirmed activators bound to the bacterial NLR-related protein at high affinity, induced oligomerization, and initiated signaling.

By screening 10 million eukaryotic proteins, we identified several domains that define multi-copy gene families and frequently co-occur with TE/viral domains. Among these, a Tc1/Mariner transposase helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain was captured by F-box genes in the Caenorhabditis genus, creating a new class of F-box genes. For specific members of this class, like fbxa-215, we found that the HTH domain is required for diverse processes including germ granule localisation, fertility, and thermotolerance. Furthermore, we provide evidence that HSF-1 mediates the transcriptional integration of fbxa-215 into the heat-shock response by binding to Helitron TEs directly upstream of the fbxa-215 locus. The interactome of HTH-bearing F-box factors suggests roles in post-translational regulation and proteostasis, consistent with established functions of F-box proteins. Based on AlphaFold2 multimer proteome-wide screens, we propose that the HTH domain may diversify the repertoire of protein substrates that F-box factors regulate post-translationally. We further demonstrate that F-box genes repeatedly and independently captured TE domains throughout eukaryotic evolution, and describe an additional instance in zebrafish. In conclusion, we identify recurrent TE domain captures by F-box genes in eukaryotes and provide insights into how these novel proteins are integrated within host gene regulatory networks.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Most cases of eukaryote HGT reported to date are inter-domain transfers and only few studies have investigated eukaryote-to-eukaryote HGTs. Furthermore, the extent to which HGT has contributed to the gene repertoire of some lineages such as vertebrates remains unclear. Here, we performed a large-scale survey of HGT among 242 species of ray-finned fishes. We found strong evidence supporting 18 teleost-to-teleost HGT events that involve 17 different genes in 11 teleost fish orders. The genes involved in these transfers show lower synonymous divergence than expected under vertical transmission, their phylogeny is inconsistent with that of teleost fishes, and high nucleotide similarity on these genes between donor and recipient lineages extends to non-coding regions. The distribution of HGT events in the teleost tree is heterogenous, with eight of the 18 transfers occurring between the same two orders (Osmeriformes and Clupeiformes). Besides the previously reported transfer of an antifreeze protein, most transferred genes play roles in immunity, suggesting that such genes are more likely than others to confer strong selective advantage to the recipient species. Overall, our work shows that teleost-to-teleost HGT has occurred on multiple occasions and it will be worth further quantifying these transfers and evaluating their impact on teleost evolution as more genomes are being sequenced.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

As such early identification of emerging bacterial strains capable of rapidly evolving AMR is key. Although antimicrobial tolerance and persistence are precursor phenotypes for AMR, little evidence exists to support their importance in real-world settings. Here we used bacterial genome wide association on national genomic surveillance data of the diarrhoeal pathogen Shigella sonnei (n=3745) to agnostically identify common genetic signatures among lineages convergently evolving toward AMR (n=15). This revealed an association of an AMR trajectory with a multi- and highly variable second copy of metG, borne by a phage-plasmid we called pWPMR2. Further analyses revealed that pWPMR2 was present across clinically relevant enteric pathogens globally, including past and contemporary outbreaks, and that the additional-metG mechanism was present across multiple bacterial phyla. Functional microbiology, experimental evolution, and single-cell physiology studies confirmed that the expression of auxiliary metG, particularly the mutated version on pWPMR2, created a sub population of persister cells predisposed to survival in, and evolving resistance against, third generation cephalosporins. Thus, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of auxiliary metG carriage that predisposes bacteria to AMR with real world impacts. Furthermore, our approach is a timely example of using genomic epidemiology to rapidly guide functional microbiology studies in the era of routine genomic surveillance, and also highlights several deficiencies in current AMR surveillance practices.","NA","medrxiv",1734991745661

Microbiomes have the capacity to influence their hosts' fitnesses, but the conditions under which such influences contribute to evolution are not clear. This is due in part to a lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework for describing the combined effects of host and associated microbes on phenotypic variation. Here we begin to address this gap by extending the foundations of quantitative genetic theory to include host-associated microbes, as well as alleles of hosts, as factors that explain quantitative host trait variation. We introduce a way to partition host-associated microbiomes into componenents relevant for predicting a microbiome-mediated response to selection. We then apply our general framework to a simulation model of microbiome inheritance to illustrate principles for predicting host trait dynamics, and to generalize classical narrow and broad sense heritabilities to account for microbial effects. We demonstrate that microbiome-mediated responses to host selection can arise from various transmission modes, not solely vertical, with the contribution of non-vertical modes depending on host life history. Our work lays a foundation for integrating microbiome-mediated host variation and adaptation into our understanding of natural variation.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

The anatomy, as well as alterations in neurological diseases such as epilepsy, suggest that chandelier cells exert an important inhibitory control on action potential initiation. However, their functional role remains unclear, including whether their effect is indeed inhibitory or excitatory. One reason is that there is a relative gap in electrophysiological theory about the electrical effect of axo-axonic synapses. This contribution uses resistive coupling theory, a simplification of cable theory based on the observation that the small initial segment is resistively coupled to the large cell body acting as a current sink, to fill this gap. The main theoretical finding is that a synaptic input at the proximal axon shifts the action potential threshold by an amount equal to the product of synaptic conductance, driving force at threshold, and axial axonal resistance between the soma and either the synapse or of the middle of the initial segment, whichever is closer. The theory produces quantitative estimates useful to interpret experimental observations, and supports the idea that axo-axonic cells can potentially exert powerful inhibitory control on action potential initiation.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

In Stage 1 of the project, a list of potential trustworthiness checks was created. The checks on this list must be evaluated to determine which should be included in the INSPECT-SR tool.

MethodsWe attempted to apply 72 trustworthiness checks to RCTs in 50 Cochrane Reviews. For each, we recorded whether the check was passed, failed or possibly failed, or whether it was not feasible to complete the check. Following application of the checks, we recorded whether we had concerns about the authenticity of each RCT. We repeated each meta-analysis after removing RCTs flagged by each check, and again after removing RCTs where we had concerns about authenticity, to estimate the impact of trustworthiness assessment. Trustworthiness assessments were compared to Risk of Bias and GRADE assessments in the reviews.

Results95 RCTs were assessed. Following application of the checks, assessors had some or serious concerns about the authenticity of 25% and 6% of the RCTs, respectively. Removing RCTs with either some or serious concerns resulted in 22% of meta-analyses having no remaining RCTs. However, many checks proved difficult to understand or implement, which may have led to unwarranted scepticism in some instances. Furthermore, we restricted assessment to meta-analyses with no more than 5 RCTs, which will distort the impact on results. No relationship was identified between trustworthiness assessment and Risk of Bias or GRADE.

ConclusionsThis study supports the case for routine trustworthiness assessment in systematic reviews, as problematic studies do not appear to be flagged by Risk of Bias assessment. The study produced evidence on the feasibility and impact of trustworthiness checks. These results will be used, in conjunction with those from a subsequent Delphi process, to determine which checks should be included in the INSPECT-SR tool.

Plain language summarySystematic reviews collate evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to find out whether health interventions are safe and effective. However, it is now recognised that the findings of some RCTs are not genuine, and some of these studies appear to have been fabricated. Various checks for these ""problematic"" RCTs have been proposed, but it is necessary to evaluate these checks to find out which are useful and which are feasible. We applied a comprehensive list of ""trustworthiness checks"" to 95 RCTs in 50 systematic reviews to learn more about them, and to see how often performing the checks would lead us to classify RCTs as being potentially inauthentic. We found that applying the checks led to concerns about the authenticity of around 1 in 3 RCTs. However, we found that many of the checks were difficult to perform and could have been misinterpreted. This might have led us to be overly sceptical in some cases. The findings from this study will be used, alongside other evidence, to decide which of these checks should be performed routinely to try to identify problematic RCTs, to stop them from being mistaken for genuine studies and potentially being used to inform healthcare decisions.

One major obstacle is that distinct pathologies may currently be diagnosed as the same disease and prescribed the same treatments. The key to developing antidepressants with ubiquitous efficacy is to first identify a strategy to differentiate between heterogeneous conditions. Major depression is characterized by hallmark features such as anhedonia and a loss of motivation1,2, and it has been recognized that even among inbred mice raised under identical housing conditions, we observe heterogeneity in their susceptibility and resilience to stress3. Anhedonia, a condition identified in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, is described as the inability to experience pleasure and is linked to anomalous medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity4. The mPFC is responsible for higher order functions5-8, such as valence encoding; however, it remains unknown how mPFC valence-specific neuronal population activity is affected during anhedonic conditions. To test this, we implemented the unpredictable chronic mild stress (CMS) protocol9-11 in mice and examined hedonic behaviors following stress and ketamine treatment. We used unsupervised clustering to delineate individual variability in hedonic behavior in response to stress. We then performed in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging to longitudinally track mPFC valence-specific neuronal population dynamics during a Pavlovian discrimination task. Chronic mild stress mice exhibited a blunted effect in the ratio of mPFC neural population responses to rewards relative to punishments after stress that rebounds following ketamine treatment. Also, a linear classifier revealed that we can decode susceptibility to chronic mild stress based on mPFC valence-encoding properties prior to stress-exposure and behavioral expression of susceptibility. Lastly, we utilized markerless pose tracking computer vision tools to predict whether a mouse would become resilient or susceptible based on facial expressions during a Pavlovian discrimination task. These results indicate that mPFC valence encoding properties and behavior are predictive of anhedonic states. Altogether, these experiments point to the need for increased granularity in the measurement of both behavior and neural activity, as these factors can predict the predisposition to stress-induced anhedonia.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Although these methods are conceptually similar, we show by analyzing association studies of 209 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank that they systematically prioritize different genes. This raises the question of how genes should ideally be prioritized. We propose two prioritization criteria: 1) trait importance -- how much a gene quantitatively affects a trait; and 2) trait specificity -- a genes importance for the trait under study relative to its importance across all traits. We find that GWAS prioritize genes near trait-specific variants, while burden tests prioritize trait-specific genes. Because non-coding variants can be context specific, GWAS can prioritize highly pleiotropic genes, while burden tests generally cannot. Both study designs are also affected by distinct trait-irrelevant factors, complicating their interpretation. Our results illustrate that burden tests and GWAS reveal different aspects of trait biology and suggest ways to improve their interpretation and usage.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

From the first COVID-19 case detected through March 25, 2022, 66,684 of 196,652 residents of Californias state prison system were infected, most of them in two large winter waves of outbreaks that reached all 35 of the state prisons. We used individual-level data on disease timing and nightly room assignments in these prisons to reconstruct locations and pathways of transmission statistically, and from that estimated reproduction numbers, locations of unobserved infection events, and the subsequent magnitude and distribution of long COVID prevalence. Where earlier work has recommended smaller cells over large dormitory housing to reduce transmission, recommended use of cells with solid doors over those with bars only, and cautioned against reliance on solid doors (e.g., in cold months when HVAC systems can circulate aerosols), we found evidence of substantial transmission in both dorms and cells regardless of the door and season. Effective reproduction numbers were found to range largely between 0 and 5, in both cells and dorms of all door types. Our estimates of excess case rates suggest that as a result of disparities in incarceration, prison outbreaks contributed to disproportionate disease burden on Black and Indigenous people in California.

More critically, several red-fluorescent GECIs exhibit photoswitching when exposed to blue light, thereby limiting their applicability in all- optical experimental approaches. Here, we present the development of PinkyCaMP, the first mScarlet-based Ca2+ sensor that outperforms current red fluorescent sensors in brightness, photostability, signal-to-noise ratio, and compatibility with optogenetics and neurotransmitter imaging. PinkyCaMP is well-tolerated by neurons, showing no toxicity or aggregation, both in vitro and in vivo. All imaging approaches, including single-photon excitation methods such as fiber photometry, widefield imaging, miniscope imaging, as well as two-photon imaging in awake mice, are fully compatible with PinkyCaMP.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Mormon Fritillary butterflies (Speyeria mormonia) exhibit a striking wing color polymorphism throughout their range: typical morphs bear silver spots on their ventral surfaces, and can co-occur with unsilvered morphs displaying a dull coloration1. Through genome-wide association studies in two polymorphic populations, we fine-map this difference in silvering to the 3 region of the transcription factor gene optix. The expression of optix is confined to the unsilvered regions that surround the spots, and these patterns are transformed to a silver identity upon optix RNAi knockdown, implicating optix as a repressor of silver scales in this butterfly. We show that the unsilvered optix haplotype shows signatures of recent selective sweeps, and that this allele is shared with the monomorphic, unsilvered species Speyeria hydaspe, suggesting that introgressions facilitate the exchange of variants of adaptive potential across species. Remarkably, these findings parallel the role of introgressions and cis-regulatory modulation of optix in shaping the aposematic red patterns of Heliconius butterflies2-7, a lineage that separated from Speyeria 45 million years ago8. The genetic basis of adaptive variation can thus be more predictable than often presumed, even for traits that appear divergent across large evolutionary distances.

However, whether and to what degree L1 activity directly impacts genome integrity is unclear. Here, we apply whole-genome sequencing to experimental models of L1 expression to comprehensively define the spectrum of genomic changes caused by L1. We provide definitive evidence that L1 expression frequently and directly causes both local and long-range chromosomal rearrangements, small and large segmental copy-number alterations, and subclonal copy-number heterogeneity due to ongoing chromosomal instability. Mechanistically, all these alterations arise from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by L1-encoded ORF2p. The processing of ORF2p-generated DSB ends prior to their ligation can produce diverse rearrangements of the target sequences. Ligation between DSB ends generated at distal loci can generate either stable chromosomes or unstable dicentric, acentric, or ring chromosomes that undergo subsequent evolution through breakage-fusion bridge cycles or DNA fragmentation. Together, these findings suggest L1 is a potent mutagenic force capable of driving genome evolution beyond simple insertions.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

Unfortunately, clinical responses remain limited due to rapid resistance onset. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional inhibition. However, there is limited mechanistic understanding of KRAS degradation in vivo. Here, we developed a preclinical LUAD mouse model and demonstrated that targeted oncogenic KRAS degradation induces rapid tumor regression. Transcriptional, histological, and immunophenotypic analyses revealed a substantial remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Notably, disease relapse observed during long-term degrader treatment stems from proteolysis machinery dysregulation, indicating resistance mechanisms distinct from those reported upon KRAS inhibition. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of KRAS degradation in LUAD, offering insights into cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms driving durable antitumor responses and supporting further clinical exploration.

The whooping crane (Grus americana) experienced severe population declines in the 18th century, culminating into a collapse to 16 individuals in 1941. Legal protections and conservation actions have since increased the population to approximately 840 individuals, yet the impact on genomic diversity remains unclear. We analysed the temporal dynamics of genomic erosion by sequencing a high-quality genome reference, and re-sequencing 16 historical and 37 modern genomes, including wild individuals and four generations of captive-bred individuals. Genomic demographic reconstructions reveal a steady decline, accelerating over the past 300 years with the European settlement of North America. Temporal genomic analyses show that despite demographic recovery, the species has lost 70% of its genetic diversity and has increased their inbreeding. Although the modern population bottleneck reduced the ancestral genetic load, modern populations possess more realized load than masked load, possibly resulting in a chronic loss of fitness. Integrating pedigree and genomic data, we underscore the role of breeding management in reducing recent inbreeding. Yet ongoing heterozygosity loss, load accumulation, and background inbreeding argues against the species downlisting from their current Endangered status on the IUCN Red List and the Endangered Species Act. The presence of private genetic variation in wild and captive populations suggests that wild-captive crosses could enhance genetic diversity and reduce the realized load. Our findings emphasize the role of genomics in informing conservation management and policy.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745661

For instance, at ~$1.5-3.3k USD, current NA fluorometers present a greater capital cost than ONT's $1k USD portable MinION third-generation Nanopore sequencing platform. The collapse of international scientific device and consumable supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic also highlighted the need for distributed manufacturing of molecular research tools to mitigate the impact of increased pricing to RLSs.

The DIYNAFLUOR was primarily designed to be compatible with the popular DNA-centric Qubit High Sensitivity (HS) and Broad Range (BR) assay kits. Notably, the DIYNAFLUOR demonstrated an 'in-assay' Limit of Detection with the Qubit HS kit of 0.0028 ng/uL, and an average absolute bias of 0.018 ng/muL across a 0-10 ng/uL working range using a 2-point linear calibration methodology.

Analyses of empirical and simulated datasets show substantial time savings by using these heuristics without compromising the accuracy of results. MEGA12 also implements an evolutionary sparse learning approach to identify fragile clades and associated sequences in evolutionary trees inferred through phylogenomic analyses. In addition, this version includes fine-grained parallelization for ML analyses, support for high-resolution monitors, and an enhanced Tree Explorer.

To address this problem, we have developed GENEVA, a platform that measures the molecular and phenotypic consequences of drug perturbations within diverse populations of cancer cells at single-cell resolution, both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we apply GENEVA to study the KRAS G12C inhibitors, recapitulating known properties of these drugs and uncovering a previously unknown role for mitochondrial activation in cell death induced by KRAS inhibition. We demonstrate that this finding can be leveraged for the development of combination therapies with greater efficacy. Finally, we show that the application of GENEVA with in vivo mouse models revealed epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) as a key mechanism for resistance to KRAS G12C inhibition.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745662

Here, we take advantage of gastruloids, a stem cell embryoid system not subject to most size controls, to study the role of size in emergent properties of mammalian embryogenesis. We report that gastruloids exhibit robust morphology and transcriptional profiles within a size range. However, size affects the dynamics, and, outside a range of robust morphogenesis, the precision of anterior-posterior (AP) axial elongation. Gastruloid axial elongation exhibits active cellular contractility, requires planar cell polarity (PCP), adhesion and cell-cell contact remodelling. Smaller gastruloids initiate elongation earlier, correlated with an earlier Brachyury polarisation. Brachyury expression increases tissue fluidity. Axis formation is regulated by the balance of Brachyury multifoci coalescence and the timing of initiation of the elongation programme. Sizes beyond the robust range can modify relative tissue composition. Very small aggregates have increased neural fate bias, accompanied by a loss of paraxial mesoderm mediated by differences in Nodal signalling activity.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745662

However, unraveling the intertwined relationships between enzymes and their catalytic reactions remains a significant challenge. Here, we present EnzymeCAGE, a catalytic-specific geometric foundation model trained on approximately 1 million structure-informed enzyme-reaction pairs, spanning over 2,000 species and encompassing an extensive diversity of genomic and metabolic information. EnzymeCAGE features a geometry-aware multi-modal architecture coupled with an evolutionary information integration module, enabling it to effectively model the nuanced relationships between enzyme structure, catalytic function, and reaction specificity. EnzymeCAGE supports both experimental and predicted enzyme structures and is applicable across diverse enzyme families, accommodating a broad range of metabolites and reaction types. Extensive evaluations demonstrate EnzymeCAGE's state-of-the-art performance in enzyme function prediction, reaction de-orphaning, catalytic site identification, and biosynthetic pathway reconstruction. These results highlight its potential as a transformative foundation model for understanding enzyme catalysis and accelerating the discovery of novel biocatalysts.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745662

In addition, the ability to capture spatial information of kinase activity is crucial to deconvolute complex signaling networks, interrogate multifaceted kinase actions, and assess drug effects or genetic perturbations. Here we developed a proteomic kinase activity sensor platform (ProKAS) for the analysis of kinase signaling using mass spectrometry. ProKAS is based on a tandem array of peptide sensors with amino acid barcodes that allow multiplexed analysis for spatial, kinetic, and screening applications. We engineered a ProKAS module to simultaneously monitor the activities of the DNA damage response kinases ATR, ATM, and CHK1 in response to genotoxic drugs, while also uncovering differences between these signaling responses in the nucleus, cytosol, and replication factories. Furthermore, we developed an in silico approach for the rational design of specific substrate peptides expandable to other kinases. Overall, ProKAS is a novel versatile system for systematically and spatially probing kinase action in cells.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745662

However, repetitive sequences and complex structural variation pose significant challenges for large-scale characterization. Here, we introduce a method using Oxford Nanopore ultra-long sequencing and adaptive sampling, coupled with a bioinformatic pipeline, to generate haplotype-resolved single-contig IGH assemblies. We compared our method to a well-established IGH characterization framework using Pacific Biosciences HiFi sequencing in four donors and observed almost complete sequence congruence between our haplotype-resolved assemblies and the HiFi reads. Applying our approach to the HG002 reference material revealed no base differences to the Telomere-to-Telomere genome benchmark over the IGH locus. Importantly, among the four donors, our approach uncovered 30 novel alleles and previously uncharacterized large structural variants, including a 120 kb segmental duplication spanning IGHE to IGHA1 and an expanded seven-copy IGHV3-23 gene haplotype.","NA","biorxiv",1734991745662

In recent years, there has a been a shift towards using graph-based reference genomes to address some of these biases, which has required new algorithms and file formats to be developed. This has created the need to develop new tools capable of utilizing these formats and performing operations similar to those carried out by traditional methods.In this paper we present ""gaftools"", a multi-purpose tool that introduces several utilities for processing graph alignments in GAF format. Gaftools enables users to index and sort alignments, with graph ordering serving as a necessary step for the sorting process. Additionally it allows users to view subsets of alignments and perform realignment using the wavefront alignment algorithm, among other useful features. Many of these functionalities are inspired by SAMtools, which provide similar operations for linear genomes, while gaftools adapts and extends them for pangenomes.
