The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of long COVID on working memory using a single rapid online anonymous survey and working memory quiz. We analyzed working memory scores in relation to long COVID status (clinically diagnosed, self-reported, and non-long COVID), age, number of COVID-19 infections and long COVID duration, and subjective ratings of brain fog severity and overall life impact of symptoms. The study recruited 1064 participants aged 16 to over 85 years (83% from the United Kingdom) with 39% reporting long COVID. The results demonstrate that long COVID significantly impairs working memory, with the greatest deficits observed in clinically diagnosed cases. In addition, we found that working memory declined with age and multiple COVID-19 infections particularly in the diagnosed long COVID group. Moreover, individuals in the diagnosed long COVID group reported experiencing the most severe brain fog and the greatest impact of long COVID symptoms on their lives, and both of these factors were strongly correlated with lower memory scores. Participants who had been living with long COVID for a longer duration had lower memory scores. However, this relationship was likely influenced by the SARS-CoV-2 variant, as individuals with prolonged long COVID symptoms were more likely to have been infected with earlier variants (alpha and wild-type) which are linked to more severe disease outcomes. Our results suggest that long COVID is associated with significant working memory impairments, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions and support strategies for those with long COVID to address memory problems.","NA","medrxiv",1738620528844

Increasingly that goal is understood as requiring huge numbers of people to be sequenced from every broadly-defined genetic ancestry group, so as not to miss ""ancestry-specific variants."" Here, we argue that this focus is unwarranted. We start with first principles considerations, based on models of mutation-drift-selection balance, which suggest highly pathogenic mutations should be at similarly low frequencies across ancestry groups. Severe disease mutations tend to be strongly deleterious, and thus evolutionarily young, and are kept at relatively constant frequency through recurrent mutation. Therefore, highly pathogenic alleles are shared identical by descent within extended families, not broad ancestry groups, and sequencing more people should yield similar numbers regardless of ancestry. We illustrate these points using gnomAD genetic ancestry groupings, and show that the classes of variants most likely to be highly pathogenic, notably sets of loss of function alleles at strongly constrained genes, conform well to these predictions. While there are many important reasons to diversify genomic research, strongly deleterious alleles will be found at comparable rates in people of all ancestries, and the information they provide about human biology is shared across ancestries.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528844

Substantial work over the past century has pursued the generation of ever-more accurate maps of regional boundaries, using either expert judgement or data-driven clustering of functional, connectional, and/or architectonic properties. However, these approaches are often purely descriptive, have limited generalizability, and do not elucidate the underlying generative mechanisms that shape the regional organization of the brain. Here, we develop a novel approach that leverages a simple, hierarchical principle for generating a multiscale parcellation of any brain structure in any mammalian species using only its geometry. We show that this approach yields regions at any resolution scale that are more homogeneous than those defined in nearly all existing benchmark brain parcellations in use today across hundreds of anatomical, functional, cellular, and molecular brain properties measured in humans, macaques, marmosets, and mice. We additionally show how our method can be generalized to previously unstudied mammalian species for which no parcellations exist. Finally, we demonstrate how our approach captures the essence of a simple, hierarchical reaction-diffusion mechanism, in which the geometry of a brain structure shapes the spatial expression of putative patterning molecules linked to the formation of distinct regions through development. Our findings point to a highly conserved and universal influence of geometry on the regional organization of the mammalian brain.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528844

We sought to investigate whether symptom severity is influenced by changes in sex hormones over the menstrual cycle, or by hormonal contraception.

MethodsWe carried out a retrospective analysis of menstrual and symptom data, prospectively collected via the Visible app from individuals with long COVID, ME/CFS, or both, who had regular menstrual cycles, between 7th September 2022 and 6th March 2024. Mixed-effects models were used to examine associations between symptom severity, menstrual cycle phase and contraception type.

Findings948 users were included; 100% of users were female and 92.6% identified as women. The most tracked symptoms were fatigue (99{middle dot}5% of users), brain fog (88{middle dot}3%), headaches (85{middle dot}1%) and muscle aches (78{middle dot}6%). All menstrual cycle phases showed a modest, but significant, improvement compared to the menstrual phase, most markedly the early luteal (IRR = 0{middle dot}963, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}958-0{middle dot}968), but also the follicular (IRR = 0{middle dot}985, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}981-0{middle dot}990) and late luteal phases (IRR = 0{middle dot}980, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}974- 0{middle dot}985). Crashes (sudden and severe worsening of symptoms following exertion) were significantly more frequent during menstruation than in other phases. Users of combined hormonal contraception (n=70) had a statistically significant reduction in overall symptom score (OR = 0{middle dot}827, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}690-0{middle dot}992) and crash incidence (OR = 0{middle dot}548, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}350-0{middle dot}856) compared to those not using contraception (n=786).

InterpretationMenstruation is associated with worsened symptoms in long COVID and ME/CFS. Users of combined hormonal contraception report a lower symptom burden than non-users, suggesting a modulatory role of ovarian hormones. These findings could empower menstruating people living with long COVID and ME/CFS to anticipate cyclical changes in symptoms and plan their activities accordingly, and could also inform their use of contraception.

Here, we show that bona fide archaellum gene clusters are widespread in several members of the Chloroflexota, which in turn lack any bacterial flagellar components. Analysis of archaellum encoding loci and predicted structures show remarkable similarity to the archaellum machinery. Moreover, using cryoEM single particle analysis, we solved the structure of the bacterial archaellum from Litorilinea aerophila, demonstrating the successful expression and assembly of this machinery in Bacteria and its function in swimming motility. Finally, a phylogenomic analysis revealed two horizontal gene transfer events from euryarchaeal members to Chloroflexota. In summary, our study demonstrates that a functional and assembled archaellum machinery can be successfully exchanged between the two prokaryotic domains.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528844

To enable a more reliable and rigorous evaluation of NPIs based on time series data, we reanalyse the data for the original official evaluation of NPIs in Germany using an ensemble of 9 competitive statistical methods for estimating the effects of NPIs and other determinants of disease spread on the effective reproduction number [R](t) and the associated error bars. A proper error analysis for time series data leads to significantly wider confidence intervals than the official evaluation. In addition to vaccination and seasonality, only few NPIs - such as restrictions in public spaces - can be confidently associated with variations in [R](t), but even then effect sizes have large uncertainties. Furthermore, due to multicollinearity in NPI activation patterns, it is difficult to distinguish potential effects of NPIs in public spaces from other interventions that came into force early, such as physical distancing. In future, NPIs should be more carefully designed and accompanied by plans for data collections to allow for a timely evaluation of benefits and harms as a basis for an effective and proportionate response.","NA","medrxiv",1738620528844

Unregulated rapid transcription elongation can lead to detrimental consequences such as transcription-replication collisions, altered alternative splicing patterns, and genome instability. Therefore, elongating Pol II requires mechanisms to slow its progression, yet the molecular basis of transcription braking remains unclear. RECQL5 is a DNA helicase that functions as a general elongation factor by slowing down Pol II. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human RECQL5 bound to multiple transcription elongation complexes. Combined with biochemical analysis, we identify an -helix of RECQL5 responsible for Pol II binding and slowdown of transcription elongation. We further reveal that the transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) complex allows Pol II to overcome RECQL5-induced transcription braking through concerted actions of its translocase activity and competition with RECQL5 for engaging Pol II. Additionally, RECQL5 inhibits TCR-mediated Pol II ubiquitination to prevent activation of the DNA repair pathway. Our results suggest a model in which RECQL5 and the TCR complex coordinately regulate the transcription elongation rate to ensure transcription efficiency while maintaining genome stability. This work provides a framework for future studies on the regulatory role of elongation speed in gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528844

To investigate how plants recognize PPNs, we aimed to identify microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) from nematodes and the corresponding plant immune components. Due to the limited availability of material from obligate PPNs, we used Caenorhabditis elegans, a free-living nematode, as a MAMP source. C. elegans extracts activated MAMP-triggered immune responses in Arabidopsis Col-0. Through chromatography-based purification, we identified a secreted trehalase and pinpointed a conserved peptide region essential for its MAMP activity. A corresponding peptide from root-knot nematode trehalase enabled the identification of lectin receptor kinases LecRK-V.5 and LecRK-V.6 as key components in immune induction. Notably, this peptide region is conserved across insect and fungal pathogens, with LecRK-Vs required for immune responses to these peptides, highlighting the role of LecRK-V-mediated mechanism for broad-spectrum pathogen detection via trehalase-derived peptides.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528844

Here we show, using structural biology, quantitative proteomics and functional assays, that the BAM complex is radically different within the Bacteroidetes, a large and important phylum widely distributed within the environment and animal microbiomes. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of BAM complexes from the human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and the human oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis show similar, seven-component complexes of ~325 kDa in size with most of the mass in the extracellular space. In addition to canonical BamA and BamD, the complexes contain an integral OM protein named BamF that is essential and intimately associated with BamA, as well as four surface-exposed lipoproteins (SLPs) named BamG-J. Together, BamF-J form a large, extracellular dome that likely serves as an assembly cage for the {beta}-barrel-SLP complexes that are a hallmark of the Bacteroidetes.

Overexpression of a catalytically inactive AtMC1 in an atmc1 background triggers severe autoimmunity partially dependent on the same immune signalling components. Overexpression of the E3 ligase SNIPER1, a master regulator of NLR homeostasis, fully reverts the AtMC1-dependent autoimmunity phenotype, inferring that a broad defect in NLR turnover may underlie the severe phenotype observed. Catalytically inactive AtMC1 localizes to punctate structures that are degraded through autophagy. Altogether and considering previous evidence on the proteostatic functions of AtMC1, we speculate that Wt AtMC1 may either directly or indirectly control NLR protein levels, thereby preventing autoimmunity.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528844

Here, we compare traditional binary DEG classification with a rank-based method, grounded in Bayesian statistics, using a published yeast dataset comprising over 40 replicates. This analysis reveals how the choice of thresholds and number of replicates results in discrepancies between studies and potentially interesting genes being overlooked. Furthermore, by comparing wild-type with wild-type samples, we show how variability in gene expression can be mistaken for differential expression. Evaluating current practices for navigating the accuracy-error trade-off in the search for differentially expressed genes leads us to advocate rank-based methods and Bayesian statistics to mitigate the limitations of binary classifications and communicate uncertainty.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

In proof-of-concept experiments, we observed robust editing with our optimized NanoCas in mouse models targeting Pcsk9, a gene involved in cholesterol regulation, and targeting exon splice sites in dystrophin to address Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mutations. We further tested the efficacy of our NanoCas system in vivo in non-human primates (NHPs) resulting in editing levels above 30% in muscle tissues. The compact size of NanoCas, in combination with robust nuclease editing, opens the door for single-AAV editing of non-liver tissues in vivo, including the use of newer editing modalities such as reverse transcriptase (RT) editing, base editing, and epigenetic editing.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

Transmission is enabled through the movement of cattle between herds, as indicated from Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI) data. We estimate the rates of under-reporting by state and present the anticipated rates of positivity for cattle tested at the point of exportation over time. We investigate the likely impact of intervention methods to date on the underlying epidemiological dynamics, demonstrating that current interventions have had insufficient impact, preventing only a mean 175.2 reported outbreaks. Our model predicts that the majority of the disease burden is, as of January 2025, concentrated within West Coast states, due to the network of cattle movements and distribution of the respective dairy populations. We quantify the extent of uncertainty in the scale of the epidemic, highlighting the most pressing data streams to capture, and which states are most expected to see outbreaks emerge next, with Arizona and Wisconsin at greatest risk. Our model suggests that dairy herd outbreaks will continue to be a significant public health challenge in 2025, and that more urgent, farm-focused, biosecurity interventions and targeted surveillance schemes are sorely needed.","NA","medrxiv",1738620528845

Unlike RV-specific IgG+ LLPCs, IgA+ LLPCs were generated independently of MHCII expression by dendritic cells - rather MHCII expression by B cells was both necessary and sufficient. B cell MHCII was also sufficient to induce a unique population of T-bet+ follicular helper T (TFH1) cells which were crucial for RV-specific IgA+ LLPC accumulation in the gut via IFN{gamma}- and CXCR3-dependent mechanisms. Similar to RV infection, TFH1 cells were required for influenza-specific IgA response. However, unlike RV infection, B cell MHCII was not sufficient to induce influenza-specific IgA+ LLPCs, suggesting the operation of mucosal site-specific priming mechanisms. Collectively, our data reveal that unconventionally primed TFH1 cells support IgA responses to mucosal viral infections.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

Here, we identify vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons as key regulators of this plasticity. Using all-optical methods in mice navigating virtual reality, we show that novel environments trigger a transient increase in VIP interneuron activity, which facilitates rapid place field formation and stable spatial map construction. Bidirectional optogenetic manipulation -suppressing or upregulating VIP interneuron activity- modulates the speed of spatial map formation and alters signatures of behavioral timescale plasticity (BTSP), a mechanism critical for place field induction. Both insufficient and excessive VIP interneuron activity impair reward-seeking behavior specifically in novel environments, revealing that a precise balance of VIP activity is essential for spatial learning. Our findings demonstrate that VIP interneurons gate a temporal window for place cell plasticity, mediating the impact of environmental novelty on hippocampal remapping and spatial memory.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

FER is required for the perception of endogenous RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides to control various aspects of plant growth, development and immunity. RALFs are perceived by FER- LORELEI-LIKE GPI-ANCHORED PROTEIN (LLG) heterocomplexes to induce cellular responses and bind to LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT EXTENSIN (LRX) proteins as structural components of the cell wall. We show that FER s RALF ligands are necessary for full success of powdery mildew colonization. Our data reveals that LLGs and LRXs are also powdery mildew susceptibility factors, and that the susceptibility function of RALFs is best explained by a combination of peptide signalling and cell wall-related effects. We further reveal that cell wall and apoplastic pH homeostasis, hallmark features of RALF function, support powdery mildew reproductive success. The function of host RALF peptides is underlined by the fact that, in contrast to previously described pathogens that hijack FER for colonization, powdery mildew fungi do not produce functional RALF mimics. Surprisingly, RALF-dependent powdery mildew pathogenesis is partially independent of FER. The resistance phenotype of ralf and fer mutants is not associated with de-regulated salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signalling, important defense-related phytohormones. Collectively, powdery mildew fungi require RALF signalling for apoplastic pH regulation and cell wall structural organization for successful colonization, highlighting a novel mechanism for host susceptibility by obligate biotrophic fungi.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

In this study, we explored topological inversion and soma-targeting strategies, which are complementary to conventional mutagenesis, to re-engineer a red genetically encoded calcium indicator, FRCaMP, for enhanced in vivo performance. The resulting sensors, FRCaMPi and soma-targeted FRCaMPi (SomaFRCaMPi), exhibit up to 2-fold higher dynamic range and peak {Delta}F/F0 per single AP compared to widely used jRGECO1a in neurons in culture and in vivo. Compared to jRGECO1a and FRCaMPi, SomaFRCaMPi reduces erroneous correlation of neuronal activity in the brains of mice and zebrafish by two- to four-fold due to diminished neuropil contamination without compromising the signal-to-noise ratio.

ChatGPT O1 employs ""chain-of-thought reasoning"" (CoT) to enhance structured problem-solving, while DeepSeek-R1 introduces self-reflection capabilities through reinforcement learning. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of these models in pediatric scenarios using the MedQA dataset.

Materials and MethodsA total of 500 multiple-choice pediatric questions from the MedQA dataset were presented to ChatGPT O1 and DeepSeek-R1. Each question included four or more options, with one correct answer. The models were evaluated under uniform conditions, with performance metrics including accuracy, Cohens Kappa, and chi-square tests applied to assess agreement and statistical significance. Responses were analyzed to determine the models effectiveness in addressing clinical questions.

ResultsChatGPT O1 achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 92.8%, significantly outperforming DeepSeek-R1, which scored 87.0% (p < 0.00001). The CoT reasoning technique used by ChatGPT O1 allowed for more structured and reliable responses, reducing the risk of errors. Conversely, DeepSeek-R1, while slightly less accurate, demonstrated superior accessibility and adaptability due to its open-source nature and emerging self-reflection capabilities. Cohens Kappa (K=0.20) indicated low agreement between the models, reflecting their distinct reasoning strategies.

ConclusionsThis study highlights the strengths of ChatGPT O1 in providing accurate and coherent clinical reasoning, making it highly suitable for critical pediatric scenarios.

DeepSeek-R1, with its flexibility and accessibility, remains a valuable tool in resource-limited settings. Combining these models in an ensemble system could leverage their complementary strengths, optimizing decision support in diverse clinical contexts.

In previous work, we predicted a fourth RBD epitope based on allosteric conformational perturbations measured by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) upon complexation with the canonical spike protein target, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). We subsequently identified a pan-neutralizing antibody (ICO-hu104) with the predicted epitope, however, as the epitope was somewhat distant from the hACE2 binding interface, and our previous work limited to the spike RBD, the neutralization mechanism was unclear. Using HDX-MS, we investigated the binding of ICO-hu104 to the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from Wuhan, Delta and Omicron variants. We demonstrate that binding of ICO-hu104 at its epitope results in an increase in deuterium uptake in the distant HR1 domain for variants of concern, which in a biological context could be indicative of destabilisation of the helices within this region, promoting S1 shedding or failure of helical extension during S2-mediated fusion. This is supported by our computational modelling, highlighting propagation of allosteric effects to the S2 coiled-coil region. Collectively, this work demonstrates an alternative neutralization mechanism for ICO-hu104 which is distinct from its first-generation predecessors and thus opens alternative avenues targeting non-RBD epitopes through assessment of allosteric perturbations.

The availability of tools that can reliably and efficiently generate and store sequencing read summary statistics has become critical. Results: As part of the effort by the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) to generate high-quality reference genomes at scale, we sought to address the community need for efficient sequencing data evaluation by developing rdeval, a standalone tool to quickly compute and dynamically display sequencing read metrics. Rdeval can either run on the fly or store key sequence data metrics in read 'sketches', with dramatic compression gains. Statistics can then be efficiently recalled from sketches for additional processing. Rdeval can convert fa*[.gz] files to and from other popular formats including BAM and CRAM for better compression. Overall, while CRAM achieves the best compression, the gain is marginal, and BAM achieves the best compromise between data compression and accessing speed. Rdeval also generates a detailed visual report with multiple data analytics that can be exported in various formats. We showcase rdeval's functionalities using human and VGP read data from different sequencing platforms and species. For PacBio long-read sequencing, our analysis shows dramatic improvements both in read length and quality over time, and a benefit of additional coverage for genome assembly.

We report a novel method called simultaneous protein and RNA -omics (SPARO) to capture the cell type-specific transcriptome and proteome simultaneously from both in vitro and in vivo experimental model systems. This method leverages the ability of biotin ligase, TurboID, to biotinylate cytosolic proteins including ribosomal and RNA-binding proteins, which allows enrichment of biotinylated proteins for proteomics as well as protein-associated RNA for transcriptomics. We validated this approach first using well-controlled in vitro systems to verify that the proteomes and transcriptomes obtained reflect the ground truth, bulk proteomes and transcriptomes. We also show that the effect of a biological stimulus (e.g., neuroinflammatory activation by lipopolysaccharide) can be faithfully captured. We also applied this approach to obtain native-state proteomes and transcriptomes from two key neural cell types, astrocytes and neurons, thereby validating the in vivo application of SPARO.

Single-cell transcriptomics identified differential kynurenine metabolism in Tregs, which was validated ex vivo as a mechanism of Treg glycolytic adaptation and suppressive rewiring. These findings underscore immunometabolic dysfunction as a driver of CD4 T cell remodeling in sepsis and suggest therapeutic avenues to restore an effective immune response.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

The uniformity of the feature space provides a straightforward way for AI models to learn all three billion tokens for reading the human genome as a first language. We propose a diffusion transformer, dnaSORA, for learning these features. dnaSORA has generative capacity similar to Stable Diffusion but for DNA point clouds. The models architecture is novel because it is unified; thus, it also functions as a discriminator that uses a frozen latent representation for classification. dnaSORA transfer learns from synthetic data emulating real genome point clouds to classify misrepresented tokens in C. elegans Hawaiian data at state-of-the-art 0.3 Mb resolution. Pre-training large genome models typically requires expensive and difficult-to-obtain genomes. However, our solution provides nearly unlimited synthetic training data at negligible compute costs. Inference for new token assignments (e.g., new diseases) requires genomes from several dozen rather than thousands of individuals. These efficiencies, combined with state-of-the-art resolution, provide a pathway for rapid, massive scaling of token annotation of the entire human genome at orders of magnitude below expected costs.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

Recent developments in Natural Language Processing, particularly in multilingual neural network language models, offer a promising avenue to answer this question by providing a theory-agnostic way of representing linguistic content across languages. Our study leverages these advances to ask how the brains of native speakers of 21 languages respond to linguistic stimuli, and to what extent linguistic representations are similar across languages. We combined existing (12 languages across 4 language families; n=24 participants) and newly collected fMRI data (9 languages across 4 language families; n=27 participants) to evaluate a series of encoding models predicting brain activity in the language network based on representations from diverse multilingual language models (20 models across 8 model classes). We found evidence of cross-lingual robustness in the alignment between language representations in artificial and biological neural networks. Critically, we showed that the encoding models can be transferred zero-shot across languages, so that a model trained to predict brain activity in a set of languages can account for brain responses in a held-out language, even across language families. These results imply a shared component in the processing of different languages, plausibly related to a shared meaning space.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

The synergistic binding of group A and B streptogramins to the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) and nascent peptide exit tunnel (NPET), respectively, yields a bactericidal effect. However, the efficacy of streptogramins is compromised by resistance mechanisms, including the enzymatic acetylation of group A streptogramins by Virginiamycin Acetyl Transferase (Vat) enzymes, which reduce antibiotic affinity for the bacterial ribosome. Here, we applied fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) to identify starting points for the development of inhibitors of VatD. X-ray crystallography screening revealed three primary fragment-binding sites on VatD. In the acetyl-CoA binding site, fragments bound to stabilize distinct conformational states in critical residues, His82 and Trp121, within the acetyl subsite. In the antibiotic binding site, two fragments were identified that form unique hydrogen/hydrophobic bonds, suggesting specific interactions that could be leveraged for competitive inhibition by disrupting streptogramin modification. Elaborations of these fragments showed weak inhibition of VatDs acetyltransferase activity, indicating the potential for further optimization. These findings establish initial hits that could restore streptogramin efficacy by targeting VatD directly, providing a structural foundation for inhibitor development against resistant bacterial strains.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

In particular, it allows inference of the unfolded site-frequency spectrum (uSFS). The most widely used approaches are based on outgroup data. However, for studies on species for which closely related outgroups are difficult to obtain, information on many sites of interest may be missed due to alignment problems. Here, we present PolarBEAR (Polarization By Estimation of the Ancestral recombination graph), a method that uses the local genealogies from the ancestral recombination graph (ARG) to infer ancestral states. We show that PolarBEAR can reach high accuracy in polarization and uSFS estimation using simulations under several scenarios. This accuracy, however, heavily depends on the ARG used as input. It is maximal when the true ARGs is used, but can be very low depending on the ARG reconstruction method employed. We also applied our method to human population data and compared it with the outgroup-based method est-sfs. Although our method could not infer the ancestral state with high confidence at certain positions, it obtained results for positions that est-sfs could not polarize due to missing outgroup data. The polarization results of the two methods were highly consistent at positions inferred by both methods. The two methods inferred similar uSFS, with PolarBEAR estimating slightly fewer high-frequency derived alleles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PolarBEAR is robust to the mutation model used, while est-sfs exhibits a bias in the presence of heterogeneous base composition. PolarBEAR can complement outgroup-based methods, or replace them when no appropriate outgroup sequence is available.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

Factors modulating microbiome abundance and composition include host genetic background, environmental parameters, and pathogen exposure. Conversely, the microbiome profoundly influences pathogen infection of the mosquito host and thus harbours considerable potential to impact the transmission of vector-borne diseases. As such, there is a growing interest in using the microbiome in novel vector-control strategies, including exploiting the natural ability of some microbes to interfere with infection of the vectors by pathogens. However, before novel microbiome-based vector control approaches can move towards translation, a more complete understanding of the interactions between mosquitoes, their microbiome, and the pathogens they transmit, is required to better appreciate how variation in the microbiome of field mosquitoes affects these interactions. To examine the impact of the host background and the associated diversity of microbiomes within distinct hosts, but without artificially manipulating the microbiome, we exposed several laboratory-reared and field-collected Aedes aegypti mosquito lines to Zika virus (ZIKV) and correlated their microbial load and composition to pathogen exposure and viral infection success. We observed significant differences in ZIKV exposure outcomes between the different mosquito lines and their associated microbiomes, and found that ZIKV alteration of the microbiomes was distinct in different lines. We also identified microbial taxa correlating with either ZIKV infection or a lack of infection. In summary, our study provides novel insights into the variability of pathogen interactions within the mosquito holobiont. A more complete understanding of which factors influence the tripartite interactions between Aedes mosquitoes, their microbiome, and arboviral pathogens, will be critical for the development of microbial-based interventions aimed at reducing vector-borne disease burden.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

To address this, we developed 2 um phagocytic Ag conjugated bead targets that target phagocytic pathways including the BCR, scavenger, Fc, and complement receptors to study potential pathways by which B cells phagocytose both cognate and non-cognate Ags. We found that while follicular B2 (Fo B), marginal zone, and B1 B cells are highly phagocytic of BCR-engaging targets through their BCR, only peritoneal cavity B1 cells could uptake non-cognate Ag-coated beads or bacteria. Despite this, B1 cells were not effective at presenting Ag to activate cognate T cells or at killing phagocytosed bacteria. Finally, analysis of scRNA-seq data revealed that these differences in phagocytic capacity could not be explained by differential expression of relevant phagocytic receptors, implying that there is likely some form of regulation in place preventing non-cognate Ag uptake by Fo B cells. Our work will help contribute to a better understanding of non-classical Ag uptake mechanisms employed by B cells and their relevance to inflammation.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

The trafficking of cargoes, such as organelles and proteins, is particularly challenging within the long projections of neurons, which, in the case of axons, can be more than four orders of magnitude longer than cell bodies. It is therefore unsurprising that disruptions in axonal transport have been reported across neurological diseases. A decline in this essential process has also been identified in many aging models, perhaps compounding age-related neurodegeneration. Via intravital imaging, we recently determined that, despite a reduction in overall motility, the run speed and displacement of anterograde mitochondrial transport were unexpectedly enhanced in aged mouse peripheral nerves. Here, to determine how aging impacts a different axonal cargo, we evaluated in vivo trafficking of signalling endosomes in motor axons of mouse sciatic nerves from 3 to 22 months. Contrasting with mitochondria, we did not detect alterations in signalling endosome speed, but found a consistent rise in pausing that manifested after 18 months. We then treated muscles with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which regulates axonal transport of signalling endosomes in motor neurons; however, we observed no change in the processivity defect at 22 months, consistent with downregulation of the BDNF receptor TrkB at the neuromuscular junction. Together, these findings indicate that aging negatively impacts signalling endosome trafficking in motor axons likely through dampened BDNF signalling at the motor neuron-muscle interface.

Traditionally considered non-essential in terminally differentiated cells, recent evidence suggests that centrosomes play vital roles in specialized cellular contexts. In mammalian neurons, centrosome-mediated microtubule remodeling is essential for axon elongation, with centrosome dysfunction leading to axonal misrouting and growth defects. Although active centrosomes have been detected in the tracheal terminal cells of Drosophila melanogaster, their activity in neurons in vivo has not been observed. Their gradual loss during embryogenesis has been reported as non-essential for organogenesis, as adult flies can eclose without centrioles.

To investigate centrosome activity in neurons, we revisited Drosophila Sas-4 mutants, which exhibit centrosome loss (CL), and observed that 50% of homozygous mutant individuals fail to hatch as larvae. We analysed their development, focusing on the expressivity and penetrance of nervous system phenotypes, and examined centriole localization in neurons. Our findings confirm the presence of centrosomes in motor and sensory neurons in Drosophila and their localization near the nascent axon. CL conditions resulted in axonal misrouting and muscle developmental abnormalities. Targeted downregulation of Sas-4 in the pioneer motor neurons aCC and RP2 induced axon guidance errors, indicating an autonomous role for centrosomes in axonal navigation. Colocalization of acetylated- and {gamma}-tubulin with centrioles in motor neurons further confirmed the presence of functional centrosomes in these cells. Analysis of motor axons revealed that CL leads to axonal tortuosity, a characteristic associated with neurodegeneration. This is the first direct association of CL with axonal morphological phenotypes, highlighting the role of centrosomes in neuronal development and their broader influence on nervous system structure and function.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

The sodium channel subtype NaV1.8 has emerged as a potential target for treating pain, leading to the development of NaV1.8 inhibitors in clinical trials. We previously identified Magi-1, a WW domain-containing scaffold protein, as a regulator of NaV1.8 at the plasma membrane of nociceptive neurons. Disrupting the interaction between NaV1.8 and Magi-1 facilitated channel degradation in neurons, reducing pain behavior in multiple animal models. In this study, we investigated the impact of disrupting NaV1.8 scaffolding on an animal model of OA pain using genetic and pharmacological approaches. Genetic Magi-1 knockdown effectively attenuated established OA pain in mice. Pharmacological targeting of the NaV1.8-Magi-1 interaction in rats with a lipidated NaV1.8 WW binding domain decoy peptide inhibited pain behavior for multiple weeks. MicroCT imaging revealed minimal alterations in subchondral bone remodeling in animals injected with the lipidated decoy peptide compared to those receiving scrambled peptide-control animals. This suggested that the NaV1.8 peptidomimetic not only alleviated OA pain but also delayed joint degeneration. Our preclinical studies indicate that intraarticular injection of lipidated peptides capable of disrupting ion channel scaffolding in neurons can provide effective and sustained analgesia for several weeks after a single administration.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

Mutations in GRIN2A, encoding GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors, impair cognitive flexibility and psychiatric resilience, yet the circuit mechanisms remain unclear. Optogenetic LC[-&gt;]mPFC activation improved reversal learning in wild-type and Grin2a heterozygous (HET) mice but not in knockouts (KO), indicating a loss of noradrenergic modulation. Grin2a mutants displayed disrupted gamma and high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the mPFC. Exogenous norepinephrine failed to restore oscillatory activity, implicating 2-adrenoceptors in NE-driven cortical dynamics. Increased LC innervation and norepinephrine transporter (NET) expression in Grin2a mutants suggest excessive noradrenergic input and impaired NE clearance. These findings identify GluN2A as essential for LC-driven prefrontal network synchronization and cognitive flexibility, offering insights into NE dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

We visualized brain motion relative to the skull in awake head-fixed mice using high-speed, multi-plane two-photon microscopy. Brain motion was primarily rostrally and laterally directed, and was tightly correlated with locomotion, but not with respiration or the cardiac cycle. Electromyography recordings in abdominal muscles and microCT reconstructions of the trunk and spinal vasculature showed that brain motion was driven by abdominal muscle contractions that activate a hydraulic-like vascular connection between the nervous system and the abdominal cavity. Externally-applied abdominal pressure generated brain motion similar to those seen during abdominal muscle contractions. Simulations showed that brain motion drives substantial volumes of interstitial fluid through and out of the brain (at volumetric rates several times higher than production) into the subarachnoid space, in the opposite direction of fluid flow seen during sleep. The brain is hydraulically linked to the abdominal compartment, and fluid flow in the brain is coupled to body movements, providing a mechanism by which the mechanics of the viscera directly impact brain health.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

In this study, we present a comparison of two cutting-edge long-read sequencing telomere length analysis tools, TECAT and Telogator. We perform a comprehensive bench-marking of these two tools using Telseq as the standard. Our analysis included evaluating these tools on sensitivity, accuracy, and computational efficiency using a diverse data set of 9 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project which have matched long-read and short-read sequencing data. We found that while Teloga-tor demonstrated superior sensitivity, identifying on average 31% more telomeric reads across all samples, TECAT showed better accuracy with measurements more closely aligned with established literature values and Telseq benchmarks (R-squared = 0.74 vs 0.37), and TECAT displayed better computational efficiency, completing tasks approximately 41% faster. Both tools successfully mapped telomere lengths to individual chromosome arms, demonstrating unprecedented resolution for telomere length analysis. Our results provide crucial insights for researchers selecting tools for telomere length analysis and highlight the current capabilities and limitations of computational approaches in telomere biology.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

However, the mechanisms that underlie dedifferentiation are poorly understood. Building on prior evidence that exploratory eye movements differ with age, we investigated the role that eye movement might play in age-related declines in neural selectivity. Healthy young and older adults of both sexes underwent fMRI with simultaneous eye-tracking as they viewed words paired with images of scenes and objects prior to a memory test. Consistent with numerous prior reports, multivoxel pattern similarity analysis (PSA) of the fMRI data revealed age-related neural dedifferentiation in scene-selective, but not object-selective cortex. Eye movements, operationalized as the number of gaze fixations made during stimulus viewing, were elevated in older adults. Analyses examining the relationship between trial-wise estimates of neural selectivity and fixation count revealed an age-invariant positive relationship in the object-selective lateral occipital complex. However, this association was found to be age-dependent in scene-selective cortex, such that there was a robust positive relationship between scene selectivity and fixation count in young, but not older adults. Lastly, scene-related selectivity in the parahippocampal place area predicted subsequent memory performance independently of age group and fixation counts at encoding. These findings suggest that age-related neural dedifferentiation in scene-selective cortex may relate to declines in the functional specialization of exploratory eye movements during scene viewing.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

We have developed an in vitro screening platform based on ddPCR and in-cell western to quantify these mRNAs and proteins and characterised more than 20 cell models to define DM1 biomarkers that could be useful for drug screening. DMPK protein levels were reduced in DM1-immortalised myoblasts and myotubes, but not in fibroblasts, while MBNL1 protein was consistently lower in all DM1 myogenic cultures, whether primary or immortalised. Myogenic differentiation of cultures led to an increase in DMPK mRNA expression, which was translated into increased MBNL1 sequestration in foci. We further corroborated the platforms ability to assess therapeutic outcomes, evaluating the effect of a DMPK gapmer ASO and one siRNA: while the gapmer increased MBNL1 protein levels, the siRNA had no significant effect on MBNL1 release. Our platform and the in-depth characterisation of some of the most used models would be of use to the DM1 research community.

Significance statementMyotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) is a multisystemic disease with a complex pathogenesis and multiple outcome measures for drug assessment in vitro.

Here, we present a new cell-based platform that enables robust quantification of DMPK and MBNL1 in cell culture for cell model characterisation and drug screening. Indeed, we highlight the differences observed in DMPK and MBNL1 protein quantification in primary fibroblasts and myotubes, immortalised fibroblasts, myoblasts and myotubes.

Traditional methods include fluorescent protein fusion (e.g., GFP) or organic fluorophores linked to ligands targeting the protein of interest. However, these approaches often introduce functional disruptions or ligand-associated biological effects. Herein, we address these challenges by developing covalent fluorescent probes for endogenous tubulin, a critical cytoskeletal protein involved in processes such as cell movement, division, and biomolecule trafficking. Using well-known tubulin binder cabazitaxel and cell permeable fluorophore silicon-rhodamine--as a basis, we introduce a novel biocompatible cleavable linker containing a sulfonium center. This allowed the construction of the optimized probe, 6-SiR-o-C9-CTX, demonstrating excellent cell permeability, fluorogenic properties, and the ability to covalently label tubulin across various human cell lines. Importantly, the targeting moiety could be washed out while preserving tubulin staining, ensuring minimal disruption of tubulin function. This labeling technique is compatible with STED nanoscopy in both live and fixed cells, offering a powerful high-resolution imaging tool.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

In particular, this has been enabled by the estimation of RNA velocity, the derivative of gene expression, from separate count matrices for different splice states, which provides information about a cells immediate future even in snapshot data. Useful velocity estimates strongly depend on accurate counts for spliced and unspliced transcripts. Velocyto remains the standard tool for spliced and unspliced mRNA molecule quantification. However, despite considerable advances in scRNA-seq protocols, velocyto has not been updated to account for peculiarities of new protocols, such as popular approaches based on 5 chemistry.

ResultsTo address this shortcoming, we present tidesurf, a command line tool for the quantification of spliced and unspliced transcript molecules from scRNA-seq libraries. Employing it on four different publicly available 10x Genomics Chromium datasets, we show the accuracy on various datasets generated with either 3 or 5 chemistry, whereas velocytos results are highly erroneous for the latter. Considering broader applicability, our results highlight tidesurf as a potential replacement for velocyto.

In mice, the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome provides robust protection against bacterial pathogens that infect intestinal epithelial cells, including the gastrointestinal pathogen Shigella flexneri. By contrast, humans are highly susceptible to Shigella, despite the ability of human NAIP-NLRC4 to robustly detect Shigella T3SS proteins. Why the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome protects mice but not humans against Shigella infection remains unclear. We previously found that human THP-1 cells infected with Shigella lose responsiveness to NAIP-NLRC4 stimuli, while retaining sensitivity to other inflammasome agonists. Using mT3Sf, a minimal Shigella system, to express individual secreted Shigella effector proteins, we found that the OspF effector specifically suppresses NAIP-NLRC4-dependent cell death during infection. OspF was previously characterized as a phosphothreonine lyase that inactivates p38 and ERK MAP kinases. We found that p38 was critical for rapid priming of NAIP-NLRC4 activity, particularly in cells with low NAIP-NLRC4 expression. Overall, our results provide a mechanism by which Shigella evades inflammasome activation in humans, and describe a new mechanism for rapid priming of the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

While significant advances have been made in elucidating the anterior-posterior (AP) axis patterning across well-studied bilaterian lineages, our understanding of the conservation of AP-patterning gene expression in underexplored protostomes with a phylogenetically informative position remains limited. Chaetognaths, a group of marine invertebrates, form a clade with Gnathifera as a sister to the remaining Lophotrochozoa, occupying an early-diverging branch of the spiralian lineage. Their phylogenetic position provides potentially valuable evolutionary insights into whether the AP patterning reflects conserved bilaterian mechanisms or reveals distinct lineage-specific adaptations. Here, we investigate the expression patterns of anterior nervous system markers (otx, nk2.1, six3/6) and Hox genes in post-embryonic stages of the chaetognath Spadella cephaloptera using fluorescence whole-mount in situ hybridization. We identify expression domains of anterior-patterning genes in the cerebral ganglion and head structures, consistent with their conserved role in anterior central nervous system (CNS) specification in bilaterians. Additionally, we describe a staggered expression pattern of Hox genes, including previously undescribed central (Sce-med6) and posterior class (Sce-postC and Sce-postD), along the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and post-anal tail. Our results demonstrate that chaetognaths exhibit the most extensive repertoire of Hox genes among protostomes, within metazoans only surpassed by chordates. All AP patterning genes are expressed in a staggered manner, with Hox gene expression absent in the head region. This pattern resembles the conserved expression profile inferred for the last common bilaterian ancestor and is only rudimentarily visible in other spiralians, including annelids and mollusks. Posterior Hox genes including the newly discovered postC and postD genes are absent in the hitherto investigated gnathiferan sister groups such as rotifers. The absence of a postanal tail in rotifers and other gnathiferans, combined with the expression of posterior Hox genes in the elongated postanal tail region, suggests their involvement in the formation of this unique chaetognath structure. Posterior flexibility of Hox genes, as previously hypothesized for chordates, likely contributed to the formation of the chaetognath tail during the early Cambrian period.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is associated with increased long-term mortality, but it is unclear if this can be explained by pre-existing comorbidities that predispose individuals to pneumococcal infection. Methods. We conducted a matched cohort study comparing long-term survival (beyond 120 days after infection) in individuals with IPD and comparators without IPD. Cases were individuals in England aged 65+ years with laboratory-confirmed IPD (2012-2019) identified through enhanced national surveillance. Comparators matched on age, sex, and calendar date were drawn from primary care electronic health records in Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD. We used Cox regression (stratified by matched set) to compare mortality in people with and without IPD, adjusting for relevant comorbidities, deprivation, and ethnicity. Results. We included 13,401 IPD cases and 67,005 comparators. After adjusting for comorbidities, deprivation, and ethnicity, we found increased all-cause mortality in IPD cases compared to comparators (hazard ratio 3.74, 95% CI: 3.50-3.99). The predicted median survival from adjusted models was 4.7 years (IQR: 2.9-7.4) for IPD cases and >11.9 (IQR : 8.7-11.9) for comparators. This increased mortality was consistent across subgroups defined by age, vaccination history, and comorbidity status (including diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and chronic heart disease). Conclusions. IPD was associated with increased mortality at least 5 years after infection. These findings demonstrate the long-term consequences of IPD, emphasising the value of IPD prevention and the need for more research into clinical management of IPD survivors. Long-term mortality should be incorporated in cost-effectiveness analyses for pneumococcal vaccines.","NA","medrxiv",1738620528845

Subsequently, 24 of these nNILs, and all the parental lines, were re-genotyped using a high-density SNP chip. A novel pipeline for calling introgressions, which does not rely on knowing the donor parent of each nNIL, was developed based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) algorithm. By comparing the introgressions detected using GBS data with those identified using chip data, we optimized the HMM parameters for analyzing the entire nNIL population. A total of 2,972 introgressions were identified across the 884 nNILs. Individual introgression blocks ranged from 21 bp to 204 Mbp, with an average size of 17 Mbp. By comparing SNP genotypes within introgressed segments to the known genotypes of the donor lines we determined that in about one third of the lines, the identity of the donors did not match expectation based on their pedigrees. We characterized the entire nNIL population for three foliar diseases. Using these data, we mapped a number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for disease resistance in the nNIL population and observed extensive variation in effects among the alleles from different donor parents at most QTL identified.

Profiling of RNA splicing-related genes revealed stage-preferential expression of several factors, including RS2Z36, a serine/arginine-rich splicing factor highly expressed during the early stages of fruit development. Mutations in RS2Z36 lead to smaller ellipsoid fruits than the wild type, with histological analysis showing elongated pericarp cells in the ovaries along the longitudinal axis. RNA-seq analysis uncovered numerous alternatively spliced genes involved in different biological processes. Complementary proteome analysis identified proteins with altered abundance and peptides corresponding to novel RNA splice isoforms, underscoring the role of RS2Z36 in shaping both transcriptome and proteome diversity.

Sparse infection of epithelial monolayers by L. monocytogenes results in the formation of distinct infectious foci, where each focus originates from the initial infection of a single host cell followed by multiple rounds of active bacterial cell-to-cell spread into neighboring host cells in the monolayer. We used time-lapse microscopy to measure changes in bacterial growth rate in individual foci over time and found that intracellular bacteria initially replicate exponentially, but then bacterial growth rate slows later in infection, particularly in the center of the infectious focus. We found that the intracellular replication rate of L. monocytogenes is measurably decreased by limiting host cell glucose availability, by decreasing the rate of intracellular bacterial oligopeptide import, and, most interestingly, by alterations in host cell junctional proteins that limit bacterial spread into neighboring cells without directly affecting bacterial growth or metabolism. By measuring the carrying capacity of individual host cells, we found that the nutritional density of cytoplasm is comparable to rich medium. Taken together, our results indicate that the rate of intracellular L. monocytogenes growth is governed by a balance of the rate of nutrient depletion by the bacteria, the rate of nutrient replenishment by the metabolically active host cells, and the rate of bacterial cell-to-cell spread which enables the bacteria to seek out ""greener pastures"" before nutrient availability in a single host cell becomes limiting.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

Previous investigations on hematophagous (blood-feeding) arthropod vectors, including mosquitoes, have indicated that ingesting blood containing inhibitors of the second enzyme in the tyrosine metabolism pathway, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), results in high insect mortality. Building upon this foundation, we evaluated the insecticidal efficacy of the HPPD inhibitor, nitisinone, against susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of three mosquito species: Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. These mosquitoes are vectors of historical diseases such as malaria, emerged diseases such as Dengue and Zika and emerging viral diseases such as the Oropouche and Usutu viruses. We demonstrate, by employing standard screening assays designed to assess the cuticular uptake of mosquitocidal agents, that nitisinone has mosquitocidal activity when blood-fed mosquitoes contact a nitisinone-coated surface. Notably, there is no discernible disparity in susceptibility to nitisinone between an insecticide-susceptible strain of Anopheles gambiae and two strains carrying multiple insecticide-resistance mechanisms. We conclude that the mosquitocidal mode of action of nitisinone differs from any of the current 37 classes of insecticides as none have a mode of action that specifically interferes with blood digestion. By highlighting the efficacy of nitisinone as a contact-based insecticide, our findings support the potential expansion of vector control strategies where nitisinone is incorporated into classic interventions like treated bednets and indoor residual spraying.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

Coinfection is restricted by a mechanism known as superinfection exclusion (SIE), which prohibits the infection of a previously infected cell by a related virus after a period of time. SIE regulates coinfection for many different viruses, but its relevance to the infection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was unknown. In this study, we investigated this using a pair of SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses encoding distinct fluorescent reporter proteins. We show for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 coinfection of individual cells is limited temporally by SIE. We defined the kinetics of the onset of SIE for SARS-CoV-2 in this system, showing that the potential for coinfection starts to diminish within the first hour of primary infection, and then falls exponentially as the time between the two infection events is increased. We then asked how these kinetics would affect the potential for coinfection with viruses during a spreading infection. We used plaque assays to model the localised spread of SARS-CoV-2 observed in infected tissue, and showed that the kinetics of SIE restrict coinfection, and therefore sites of possible genetic exchange, to a small interface of infected cells between spreading viral infections. This indicates that SIE, by reducing the likelihood of coinfection of cells, likely reduces the opportunities for genetic exchange between different strains of SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is an underappreciated factor in shaping SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

However, when activated by WISH/DIP/SPIN90 family proteins, Arp2/3 nucleates linear actin filaments. Unexpectedly, we found that human SPIN90 is a dimer that can nucleate bidirectional actin filaments. To understand the basis for this, we determined a 3 [A] resolution structure of human SPIN90-Arp2/3 complex nucleating actin filaments. Our structure shows that SPIN90 dimerises via a 3-helix bundle and interacts with two Arp2/3 complexes. Each SPIN90 molecule binds both Arp2/3 complexes to promote their activation. Our analysis demonstrates that single filament nucleation by Arp2/3 is mechanistically more like branch formation than previously appreciated. The dimerisation domain in SPIN90 orthologues is conserved in metazoans, suggesting that this mode of bidirectional nucleation is a common strategy to generate anti-parallel actin filaments.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

In the current study, we evaluated the relative contributions of action, agent, and scene features in predicting cortical activity while participants viewed a 1-hour nature documentary. We tested four sets of model features: semantic vectors capturing the observed action, agent, and scene features derived from an annotation of the stimulus, as well as low-level visual motion-energy features. We used banded ridge regression to fit vertex-wise encoding models from the combination of all four sets of features. While each set of features predicted neural activity in the expected areas, the action features predicted more widespread activity. A variance partitioning analysis revealed that the action features captured the most unique variance in neural activity across ten times as many cortical vertices as the agent or scene features. Our findings suggest that cortical activity during dynamic, natural vision is dominated by features for understanding the actions of others.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

Whilst aspects of quantitative agreement have been achieved for flat monolayers, the most striking features of tissue morphogenesis -- such as symmetry breaking, folding and invagination -- concern surfaces with complex curved geometries. As yet, however, characterizing such complex behaviors in three dimensions has been frustrated due to the absence of proper image analysis methods; current state-of-the-art methods almost exclusively rely on two-dimensional (2D) intensity projections of multiple image planes, which superimpose data and lose geometric information that can be crucial. Here, we describe an analysis pipeline that properly captures the nematic order of tissue surfaces of arbitrary geometry, which we demonstrate in the context of in vitro multicellular aggregates, and in vivo zebrafish hearts. For the former, we correlate the number of topological defects with the aggregates surface area and verify theoretical predictions, whilst for the latter, we link biological properties to physical concepts (Laplace pressure) through spatio-temporal correlations of the heart geometry with fluorescence signals of intracellular proteins. Our analysis enables access to the  hidden third dimension of conventional image acquisition via stacked 2D planes and highlights how such characterizations can deliver meaningful physical insight.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

We find that the growth of up to 50% of all community members depended essentially on supplementation with amino acids, vitamins, or nucleotides. In 73% of cases, supplementation with multiple amino acids was necessary. Genomic analysis of 62 strains revealed that accumulation of insertion sequences and specific gene loss was associated with the observed auxotrophies. Finally, genome-scale metabolic models, computational analyses, and cocultivation experiments demonstrated that other co-occurring genotypes complemented the metabolic needs of auxotrophs, thus facilitating their growth.

FastCCC relies on fast Fourier transformation-based convolution to compute p-values analytically without permutations, introduces a modular algebraic operation framework to capture a broad spectrum of CCC patterns, and can leverage atlas-scale single cell references to enhance CCC analysis on user-collected datasets. To support routine reference-based CCC analysis, we constructed the first human CCC reference panel, encompassing 19 distinct tissue types, over 450 unique cell types, and approximately 16 million cells. We demonstrate the advantages of FastCCC across multiple datasets, most of which exceed the analytical capabilities of existing CCC methods.

Efforts have been made to experimentally define the escape mutations from specific antibodies in specific viral strains, but it remains unclear how much the effects of mutations on neutralization differ among HIV strains. Here, we use pseudovirus deep mutational scanning to comprehensively map escape mutations from the V3 loop targeting antibody 10-1074 and the CD4-binding site targeting antibody 3BNC117 for both a clade A (BF520) and a clade B (TRO.11) HIV Envelope (Env). Mutations that escape neutralization by antibody 10-1074 are largely similar for the two Envs, but mutations that escape 3BNC117 differ greatly between Envs. Some differences in the effects of mutations on escape between Envs can be explained by strain-to-strain variation in mutational tolerance or glycosylation patterns, but other mutations have different effects on escape for unclear reasons. Overall, the extent that measurements of mutational effects on antibody neutralization can be generalized across HIV strains differs among antibodies.

Retrons typically comprise a reverse transcriptase, a template noncoding RNA that is partially reverse transcribed into RT-DNA, and a toxic effector. The reverse transcriptase, noncoding RNA, and RT-DNA complex sequester the toxic effector until triggered by phage infection, at which point the toxin is released to induce cell death. Due to their ability to produce single-stranded DNA in vivo, retrons have also been engineered to produce donor templates for genome editing in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

Fine-mapping of such variants has become a priority and since most associations are located within regulatory regions, it is also assumed that they colocalize with regulatory variants that influence the expression of nearby genes. Here we examine these assumptions by using a moderate throughput expression CROPseq protocol in which Cas9 nuclease is used to induce small insertions and deletions across the credible set of SNPs that may account for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for genes associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Of the 4,384 SNPs targeted in 88 loci (an average of 50 per locus), 439 were significant and further examined for validation. From these, 98 significantly altered target gene expression in HL-60 myeloid cell line, 74 in induced macrophages from these HL-60 cells, and 78 in induced neutrophils for a total of 201 validated effects (46%), 43 of which were observed in at least two of the cell types. Considering the observed sensitivity and specificity of the controls, we estimate that there are at least 150 true positives per cell type, an average of almost 2.4 for each of the 64 eQTL for which putative causal variants have been fine-mapped. This implies that haplotype effects are likely to explain many of the associations.

We identify the TNL-class nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR) BURNOUT1 (BNT1) from Arabidopsis thaliana as localized to plastids, key organelles for plant immunity. Alternative transcription start site usage generates two isoforms of BNT1: BNT1.2, which is targeted to the plastid envelope via an N-terminal signal-anchored mechanism, and BNT1.1, which resides in the cytoplasm. Moreover, BNT1.2 is predominantly expressed in epidermal cells, where it localizes to the so-called sensory plastids. Functional analysis revealed that bnt1 mutants exhibit compromised PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) responses, including impaired callose deposition and reduced flg22-induced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, while flg22-induced apoplastic reactive oxygen species production remains unaffected. Notably, only the plastid-localized BNT1.2 isoform is required for these PTI responses. Our findings reveal a role for NLRs in regulating PTI responses from plastids and highlight these organelles as key hubs for signal(s) integration during plant-pathogen interactions.

To begin to understand how Mtb survives aerosolization, we mimicked liquid and atmospheric conditions experienced by Mtb before and after exhalation using a model aerosol fluid (MAF) based on the water-soluble, lipidic and cellular constituents of necrotic tuberculosis lesions. MAF induced drug tolerance in Mtb, remodeled its transcriptome and protected Mtb from dying in microdroplets desiccating in air. Yet survival was not passive: Mtb appeared to rely on hundreds of genes to survive conditions associated with transmission. Essential genes subserving proteostasis offered most protection. A large number of conventionally nonessential genes appeared to contribute as well, including genes encoding proteins that resemble anti-desiccants. The candidate transmission survival genome of Mtb may offer opportunities to reduce transmission of tuberculosis.

Bivalves, a diverse class of molluscs with a variety of reproductive modes, represent an ideal yet challenging clade for investigating SD and the evolution of sexual systems. However, the absence of a comprehensive framework has limited progress in this field, particularly regarding the study of sex-determination related genes (SRGs). In this study, we performed a genome-wide sequence evolutionary analysis of the Dmrt, Sox, and Fox gene families in more than 40 bivalve species. For the first time, we provide an extensive and phylogenetic-aware dataset of these SRGs, and we find support to the hypothesis that Dmrt-1L and Sox-H may act as primary sex-determining genes, by showing their high levels of sequence diversity within the bivalve genomic context. To validate our findings, we studied the same gene families in two well-characterized systems, mammals and Drosophila. In the former, we found that the male sex-determining gene Sry exhibits a pattern of amino acid sequence diversity similar to that of Dmrt- 1L and Sox-H in bivalves, consistent with its role of master SD regulator. In contrast, no such pattern was observed among genes of the fruit fly SD cascade, which is controlled by a chromosomic mechanism. Overall, our findings highlight similarities in the sequence evolution of some mammal and bivalve SRGs, possibly driven by a comparable architecture of SD cascades. This work underscores once again the importance of employing a comparative approach when investigating understudied and non-model systems.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

This study investigates the role of plasmid mobility types in disseminating antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence genes (VGs). By analyzing 142,492 fully sequenced plasmids from bacterial isolates and metagenomes, we offer a comprehensive representation of plasmid distribution in microbial communities. Our findings reveal that conjugative plasmids (pCONJ) are less common than previously estimated, comprising only 4.14% of the dataset. Mobilizable plasmids (pMOB) are the most prevalent (66.82%), followed by non-transmissible plasmids (pNT) at 29.04%. Although plasmids are recognized as key drivers of ARG dissemination, only 3.8% of plasmids encode ARGs. Among pCONJ plasmids, 6.9% harbor ARGs, and just 0.18% carry VGs. These findings contrast with earlier estimates, which overrepresented clinically associated plasmids. Interestingly, ARGs are more frequently associated with pMOB plasmids, which exhibit higher ARG density. In contrast, VGs are primarily found in pCONJ plasmids. This study highlights the significance of pMOB plasmids in ARG dissemination, emphasizing their role in resistance spread. Our results challenge prevailing assumptions about plasmid-mediated gene transfer and underscore the need to prioritize pMOB plasmids in future epidemiological studies. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of plasmid dynamics and their implications for public health.

In areas with lower UV radiation, light pigmentation alleles increased in frequency because of their adaptive advantage and of other contingent factors such as migration and drift. However, the tempo and mode of their spread is not known. Phenotypic inference from ancient DNA is complicated, both because these traits are polygenic, and because of low sequence depth. We evaluated the effects of the latter by randomly removing reads in two high-coverage ancient samples, the Paleolithic Ust-Ishim from Russia and the Mesolithic SF12 from Sweden. We could thus compare three approaches to pigmentation inference, concluding that, for suboptimal levels of coverage (<8x), a probabilistic method estimating genotype likelihoods leads to the most robust predictions. We then applied that protocol to 348 ancient genomes from Eurasia, describing how skin, eye and hair color evolved over the past 45,000 years. The shift towards lighter pigmentations turned out to be all but linear in time and place, and slower than expected, with half of the individuals showing dark or intermediate skin colors well into the Copper and Iron ages. We also observed a peak of light eye pigmentation in Mesolithic times, and an accelerated change during the spread of Neolithic farmers over Western Eurasia, although localized processes of gene flow and admixture, or lack thereof, also played a significant role.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

The helicase RECQL5 has been proposed as an important factor to help safeguard the genome, and is the only member of the human RecQ helicase family that directly binds to RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) and affects its progression. RECQL5 mitigates transcription stress and genome instability in cells, yet the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unclear. Here, we employ cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of stalled Pol II elongation complexes (ECs) bound to RECQL5. Our structures reveal the molecular interactions stabilizing RECQL5 binding to the Pol II EC and highlight its role as a transcriptional roadblock. Additionally, we find that RECQL5 can modulate the Pol II translocation state. In its nucleotide-free state, RECQL5 mechanically twists the downstream DNA in the EC, and upon nucleotide binding, it undergoes a conformational change that allosterically induces Pol II towards a post-translocation state. We propose this mechanism may help restart Pol II elongation and therefore contribute to reduction of transcription stress.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

We find that the previously identified open-interface trimer conformation is sampled in all eVLP-displayed spike variants studied including sequences from engineered vaccine constructs and native viral sequences. The D614G mutation, which arose early in the pandemic, favors the canonical  closed-interface prefusion conformation, potentially mitigating premature S1 shedding in the presence of a cleaved furin site and providing an evolutionary advantage to the virus. Remarkably, furin cleavage at the S1/S2 boundary allosterically increases the flexibility of the S2 site, which may facilitate increased TMPRSS2 processing, enhancing viral infectivity.

Here we report the synthesis and chemical proteomic characterization of stereoprobes bearing a P(V)-oxathiaphospholane (OTP) reactive group. ABPP experiments identified numerous proteins in human cancer cells that showed stereoselective reactivity with OTP stereoprobes, and we confirmed several of these liganding events with recombinant proteins. OTP stereoprobes engaging the poorly characterized transmembrane protein TLCD1 impaired the incorporation of monounsaturated fatty acids into phosphatidylethanolamine lipids in cells, a lipidomic phenotype that mirrored genetic disruption of this protein. Using AlphaFold2, we found that TLCD1 structurally resembles the ceramide synthase and fatty acid elongase families of coenzyme A-dependent lipid processing enzymes. This structural similarity included conservation of catalytic histidine residues, the mutation of which blocked the OTP stereoprobe reactivity and lipid remodeling activity of recombinant TLCD1. Taken together, these data indicate that TLCD1 acts as a lipid acyltransferase in cells, and that OTP stereoprobes function as inhibitors of this enzymatic activity. Our findings thus illuminate how the chemical proteomic analysis of electrophilic compounds can facilitate the functional annotation and chemical inhibition of a key lipid metabolic enzyme in human cells.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

Although micro-arousals are an inherent feature of both human and animal sleep, knowledge about the neural correlates of micro-arousals across the cortical column is sparse. We here developed an algorithm for automatic detection of micro-arousals based on EMG activity and used it to explore how micro-arousals modulate laminar neural activity in the motor cortex, and how this relationship is affected by sleep pressure in mice. Our analysis showed that micro-arousals were associated with a general suppression of local field potential (LFP) power across the cortical column. Slow wave activity (SWA, 1-4 Hz) immediately after micro-arousals was tightly correlated with sleep pressure and even surpassed average SWA levels during NREM sleep in sleep deprived animals. In addition, analysis of single-channel firing showed that some channels exhibited increased activity immediately prior to micro-arousals, while others exhibited decreased activity. This study provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying micro-arousals and identifies a new link between micro-arousals and sleep homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

RNA-free capsids exhibit remarkable stability at physiological salt concentrations, suggesting an evolutionary adaptation for capsid reuse during the viral life cycle. This observation challenges the notion that empty capsids are exclusively products of abortive assembly, positioning them instead as functional intermediates in viral reproduction. Additionally, RNA encapsidation creates electrostatic dependencies that magnesium ions mitigate, stabilizing both RNA and capsid through long-residence-time interactions with phosphate groups. Chloride ions further influence capsid permeability by modulating salt-bridge disruptions and interprotomeric interactions, with these effects being pH-dependent: enhanced at pH < 7, preserving nucleocapsid integrity, or weakened at pH = 7, facilitating disassembly and RNA release.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

Recurrence happens often with metastasis, for which cancer cells must adapt to isolation stress to successfully colonize distant organs. While the fibronectin-integrin axis has been implicated in this adaptation, its regulatory mechanisms require further elaboration. Here, we identify c-Rel as an oncogenic driver in PDAC, promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plasticity, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and resistance to isolation stress. Mechanistically, c-Rel directly regulates fibronectin (Fn1) and CD61 (itgb3) transcription, enhancing cellular plasticity and survival under anchorage-independent conditions. Fibronectin is not essential for EMT, but its absence significantly impairs metastatic colonization, highlighting a tumor-autonomous role for FN1 in isolation stress adaptation. These findings establish c-Rel as a key regulator of PDAC metastasis by controlling circulating tumor cell (CTC) niche and survival, suggesting that targeting the c-Rel-fibronectin-integrin axis could provide new therapeutic strategies to mitigate disease progression and recurrence.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

Here, we aimed to better understand this relation between these phenomena by investigating how information flows through the EGF-receptor centered network upon targeted drug treatment, and how this is affected by cell-to-cell-state differences. Using single-cell ID-seq, we profiled the cell-state and signaling activity of primary human epidermal stem cells by measuring 69 (phospho-)proteins upon inhibition of the Erk/MAPK (p90RSK) and Akt/mTOR (p70S6K) routes downstream of the EGF pathway. We found that the effects of drug treatment propagated from the EGF-signaling pathway to other connected parts of the cellular signaling network, indicating altered signaling flow. We identified nine distinct cell-states that show pervasive state-dependent drug-responses for many (phospho-)proteins. Computational modeling of the signaling network using single-cell Comparative Network Reconstruction showed that many interactions between phospho-proteins (i.e. network wiring) were quantitatively different between cell-states. Furthermore, (phospho-)proteins with a cell-state dependent drug response, were more likely to be involved in interactions that showed a cell-state dependent strength. Overall, our results indicate that drug treatment response and signaling interactions between proteins are closely related and modulated by cell-state.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

Despite their evolutionary importance, the drivers of their diversity dynamics remain poorly understood. This study investigates the diversification patterns of Demospongiae, the largest class of sponges with a well-documented fossil record throughout the Phanerozoic Eon (541-0 Ma). Using fossil occurrence data and a Bayesian framework, we modeled origination and extinction rates to understand their evolutionary history.

Our findings reveal key extinction events, including three previously unrecognized events in the Cambrian, Late Silurian, and Late Jurassic, alongside known events such as the Permian-Triassic and Triassic-Jurassic extinctions. Notably, there was no statistical evidence for mass extinction during the Late Ordovician or Late Devonian. Additionally, Demosponges underwent a significant decline prior to the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction.

To explore abiotic influences, we applied the Multivariate Birth-Death (MBD) model across all extinction events. This analysis identified correlations between major speciation and extinction events and key variables, including temperature, continental fragmentation, oxygen levels, and sea level, as well as geochemical proxies such as sulfur and strontium, which may reflect underlying drivers like anoxia, weathering, or tectonic activity. Temperature and oxygen levels, in particular, correlated with speciation and extinction during the Permian-Triassic extinction.

These findings underscore the role of environmental fluctuations in shaping demosponge diversity and highlight the complex interplay between changes in abiotic factors and sponge evolution. Our work provides critical insights into the factors driving sponge biodiversity and offers perspectives on how modern sponges might respond to ongoing climate change.

Significance StatementSponges are ancient and ecologically pivotal marine organisms that have persisted through Earths major environmental upheavals. Despite their resilience, the mechanisms driving their evolutionary responses to past climate shifts remain unclear. By leveraging the fossil record of Demospongiae, this study identifies previously unrecognized extinction events and elucidates how abiotic factors, including temperature and oxygen levels, shaped their diversity during these crises. These findings enhance our understanding of sponge evolutionary dynamics and resilience, offering critical insights into the vulnerability of marine ecosystems under current and future climate change scenarios.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

We evaluated associations between H3.1 levels and mortality and the need for renal replacement therapy using multivariable Cox regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses.

ResultsWe analysed 971 critically ill patients with complete data including admission H3.1 levels. 443 patients (45.6%) presented with sepsis, 520 (53.6%) had septic shock, and eight patients had an unknown diagnosis as defined by Sepsis-3. Admission H3.1 levels were higher in patients with septic shock than with sepsis (median 921.84 vs 432.71 ng/mL; p<0.001). Admission H3.1 levels were higher in non-survivors, and in a univariate Cox analysis, each log-10 increase in H3.1 was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.86 (95% confidence interval 1.41-2.47, p<0.05). H3.1 was also higher in patients requiring renal replacement therapy with septic shock vs sepsis (1832 ng/mL vs 801.4 ng/mL, p=0.01) and demonstrated a dose-response relationship with the severity of AKI.

ConclusionElevated levels of H3.1 nucleosomes at admission are independently associated with mortality and severe kidney dysfunction requiring renal replacement therapy.

However, only a minority of patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) benefit from ICI, and the determinants of response remain largely unknown. To better understand the factors influencing patient outcome, we assembled a longitudinal cohort with tissue from multiple timepoints, including primary tumor, pre-treatment metastatic tumor, and on-treatment metastatic tumor from 117 patients treated with ICI (nivolumab) in the phase II TONIC trial. We used highly multiplexed imaging to quantify the subcellular localization of 37 proteins in each tumor. To extract meaningful information from the imaging data, we developed SpaceCat, a computational pipeline that quantifies features from imaging data such as cell density, cell diversity, spatial structure, and functional marker expression. We applied SpaceCat to 678 images from 294 tumors, generating more than 800 distinct features per tumor. Spatial features were more predictive of patient outcome, including features like the degree of mixing between cancer and immune cells, the diversity of the neighboring immune cells surrounding cancer cells, and the degree of T cell infiltration at the tumor border. Non-spatial features, including the ratio between T cell subsets and cancer cells and PD-L1 levels on myeloid cells, were also associated with patient outcome. Surprisingly, we did not identify robust predictors of response in the primary tumors. In contrast, the metastatic tumors had numerous features which predicted response. Some of these features, such as the cellular diversity at the tumor border, were shared across timepoints, but many of the features, such as T cell infiltration at the tumor border, were predictive of response at only a single timepoint. We trained multivariate models on all of the features in the dataset, finding that we could accurately predict patient outcome from the pre-treatment metastatic tumors, with improved performance using the on-treatment tumors. We validated our findings in matched bulk RNA-seq data, finding the most informative features from the on-treatment samples. Our study highlights the importance of profiling sequential tumor biopsies to understand the evolution of the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the temporal and spatial dynamics underlying patient responses and underscoring the need for further research on the prognostic role of metastatic tissue and its utility in stratifying patients for ICI.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

However, functional characterization of smRNAs remains limited by the scale and simplicity of phenotypic readouts. Recently, single-cell perturbation screening methods, which link CRISPR-mediated genetic perturbations to rich transcriptomic profiling, have emerged as foundational and scalable approaches for understanding gene functions, mapping regulatory networks, and revealing genetic interactions. However, a comparable approach for probing the regulatory consequences of smRNA perturbations is lacking. Here, we present Decoy-seq as an extension of this approach for high-content, single-cell perturbation screening of smRNAs. This method leverages U6-driven tough decoys (TuD), which form stable duplexes with their target smRNAs, for inhibition in the cell. Lentiviral-encoded TuDs are compatible with conventional single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, allowing joint identification of the smRNA perturbation in each cell and its associated transcriptomic profile. We applied Decoy-seq to 336 microRNAs (miRNAs) and 196 tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) in a human breast cancer cell line, demonstrating its ability to uncover complex regulatory pathways and novel functions of these smRNAs. Notably, we show that tRFs influence mRNA polyadenylation and regulate key cancer-associated processes, such as cell cycle progression and proliferation. Therefore, Decoy-seq provides a powerful framework for exploring the functional roles of smRNAs in normal physiology and disease, and holds promise for accelerating future discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

Atherosclerosis is driven by the accumulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the formation of foam cells, accompanied by oxidative stress and the deposition of oxidized LDL (OxLDL), a pro-inflammatory molecule. Lowering LDL is the mainstay of current medical treatment in addition to blood pressure control and lifestyle changes, but to date, specifically targeting the inflammatory pathways contributing to plaque development without significant systemic side effects has not been feasible. Over the past decade, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have treated cancer and restored immune imbalance in autoimmune diseases in patients and resolved cardiac fibrosis in preclinical models. Using an inducible T regulatory cell (Treg) platform, we created an anti-OxLDL-specific CAR Treg therapy that exerts cell- and cytokine-mediated immunosuppression to reduce macrophage-foam cell formation in vitro. Murine anti-OxLDL CAR Tregs inhibited 80% of atherosclerotic plaque formation in immunocompetent mouse models of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. These studies illustrate the potential of anti-OxLDL CAR Tregs to mitigate the inflammation and plaque deposition associated with OxLDL, potentially offering a new therapeutic option for atherosclerosis.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

We hypothesized that sensory-evoked awakenings are predominantly regulated by specific LC-NE efferent pathways. Anatomical, physiological, and functional modularities of LC-NE pathways involving the mouse basal forebrain (BF) and pontine reticular nucleus (PRN) were tested. We found partial anatomical segregation between the LC->PRN and LC->BF circuits. Extracellular NE dynamics in BF and PRN exhibited distinct sound-evoked activation during sleep, including a fast sound-evoked NE peak specific to PRN. Causal optogenetic interrogation of LC efferent pathways, by retro-ChR2 activation or PdCO silencing of synapses in target regions, revealed a pivotal role for early LC->PRN activity in driving arousal and sound-evoked awakenings. Together, our results uncover a prominent role for early LC-NE PRN activity in connecting sensory and arousal pathways and establish LC heterogeneity in regulating arousal.

Cilia structures rely on intraflagellar transport (IFT), which involves dynein-2 for retrograde and kinesin-2 for anterograde movements along doublet microtubules. Unlike dynein-1, which works on singlet microtubules within the cytoplasm, dynein-2 specifically works on the doublet microtubules inside the cilia. Previous cryo-electron tomography studies have shown that retrograde IFT, driven by dynein-2, occurs on the A-tubule of the doublet, suggesting a specialized regulatory mechanism involving dynein-2. However, the molecular basis of this specificity remains unclear. Here, we investigated this mechanism using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) with Volta Phase Plate (VPP), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and biochemical analysis. Our biochemical assay revealed that the microtubule-binding domain of dynein-2 exhibits a higher affinity for the ciliary doublet microtubule compared to dynein-1. Cryo-ET with VPP further visualized the preferential binding of dynein-2 to the A-tubule of the doublet microtubule. MD simulations suggest that the preferential binding of dynein-2 is attributed to the tyrosinated tubulin in the A-tubule. These findings uncover a tyrosination-dependent regulatory mechanism that governs the bidirectional transport of IFT on doublet microtubules, providing new insights into the spatial and functional specialization of ciliary transport systems.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

Using deep-learning classifiers we evaluate the information contained in readily accessible extracellular features for neuron identification.

We observe that LexA properties are insufficient in predicting the temporal hierarchy of these genes. Instead, we find that intrinsic promoter strength underlies the order of gene activation, with differential sigma factor association as a key factor in modulating gene expression timing. Our findings highlight a novel regulatory layer in SOS dynamics and underscore the importance of promoter properties in shaping bacterial stress responses.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

As the scale of single-cell datasets expands, linking cell-level phenotypic alterations with clinical outcomes becomes increasingly challenging. To address this, we introduce CellPhenoX, an eXplainable machine learning method to identify cell-specific phenotypes that influence clinical outcomes. CellPhenoX integrates classification models, explainable AI techniques, and a statistical framework to generate interpretable, cell-specific scores that uncover cell populations associated with relevant clinical phenotypes and interaction effects. We demonstrated the performance of CellPhenoX across diverse single-cell designs, including simulations, binary disease-control comparisons, and multi-class studies. Notably, CellPhenoX identified an activated monocyte phenotype in COVID-19, with expansion correlated with disease severity after adjusting for covariates and interactive effects. It also uncovered an inflammation-associated gradient in fibroblasts from ulcerative colitis. We anticipate that CellPhenoX holds the potential to detect clinically relevant phenotypic changes in single-cell data with multiple sources of variation, paving the way for translating single-cell findings into clinical impact.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

Understanding the relationships and evolutionary histories of different limbs is a central task, but their sheer diversity makes this a daunting if not impossible task using morphology alone. Here, the in situ expression patterns and CRISPR-Cas9 phenotypes for the five best-studied leg-patterning genes - Distal-less, Sp6-9, dachshund, extradenticle, and homothorax - are described for all limbs of the crustacean Parhyale.

Crustaceans are well-suited for this task because their limbs are more diverse than those of other arthropods, and each individual possesses a wide range of limb types that are relevant to many other arthropods, living and extinct. These results will a) provide a template for understanding the genetic basis of limb construction in arthropods more generally based on the strong phenotypes that can be obtained with CRISPR-Cas9, and b) contribute to our understanding of the evolution and affinities of highly modified legs like mouthparts and genitalia using molecular methods to complement previous morphological and embryological approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1738620528845

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1738620528845
