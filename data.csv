The availability of algae in culture poorly represents their large environmental diversity, and we still have a limited understanding of their convoluted evolution by endosymbiosis. Here, we performed a phylogeny-guided plastid genome-resolved metagenomic survey of Tara Oceans expeditions. We present a manually curated resource of nearly 700 new non-redundant plastid genomes of environmental pelagic algae. This catalogue vastly expands the plastid genome diversity within major algal groups, often corresponding to algae without closely related reference genomes. We also recovered four genomes, including one near complete, forming a deep-branching plastid lineage of nano-size algae (<5 um) that we informally named leptophytes. This group is globally distributed and generally rare, although it can reach relatively high abundance notably in the Arctic. Leptophytes encompass the enigmatic marine plastid group DPL2, one of the very few known plastid groups not clearly belonging to any major algal groups and for which only 16S amplicon data is available. Extensive phylogenetic analyses based on 93 plastid genes and gene content comparison firmly place leptophytes together with haptophytes and cryptophytes, although the exact relationships remain ambiguous. Collectively, our study demonstrates that metagenomics can reveal currently hidden diversity of organellar genomes, and shows the importance of including this diversity to improve models for plastid evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

While ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) mechanisms that degrade these polypeptides are well-characterized in the cytosol, how stalled endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-bound ribosomes are cleared remains poorly understood. Stalled ER-bound ribosomes are marked by ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1) on large ribosomal subunit protein RPL26, but the precise function and regulation of this process are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that canonical RQC factors associate with ribosomes stalled at the ER. Functional cellular assays using ER-targeted stalling reporters reveal that while ribosome splitting is a prerequisite for UFMylation of RPL26, the UFMylation persists without late RQC components that are involved in the clearance of arrested nascent chains (NEMF and LTN1). The UFM1 E3 ligase complex binds to and UFMylates the 60S-peptidyl-tRNA complex and, in concert with the canonical RQC pathway, facilitates the clearance of arrested polypeptides. Our findings reveal that UFMylation acts to maintain translational integrity at the ER.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

This underexplored phenomenon arises when microbial content is inadvertently exchanged among concurrently processed samples. Such contamination that distort microbial profiles, poses significant risks to the reliability of metagenomic data and downstream analyses. Despite its critical impact, this issue remains insufficiently addressed. To fill this gap, we introduce CroCoDeEL, a decision-support tool for detecting and quantifying cross-sample contamination. Leveraging a pre-trained supervised model, CroCoDeEL identifies contamination patterns in species abundance profiles with high accuracy. Unlike existing tools, it requires no negative controls or prior knowledge of sample processing positions, offering improved accuracy and versatility. Benchmarks across three public datasets demonstrate that CroCoDeEL accurately detects contaminated samples and identifies their contamination sources, even at low rates (<0.1%), provided sufficient sequencing depth. Our findings suggest that cross-sample contamination is prevalent in metagenomics and emphasize the necessity of systematically integrating contamination detection into sequencing data quality control.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

The identification of new agents with differentiated pharmacokinetic and drug resistance profiles will increase therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients and bolster pandemic preparedness generally. Starting with a lead-like dihydrouracil chemotype from a large-library docking campaign, we improved MPro inhibition >1,000 fold by engaging additional subsites in the MPro active site, most notably by employing a latent propargyl electrophile to engage the catalytic Cys145. Advanced leads from this series, including AVI 4516 and AVI 4773 show pan-coronavirus antiviral activity in cells, very low clearance in mice, and for AVI 4773 a rapid reduction in viral titers more than a million fold after just three doses, more rapidly and effectively than the approved drugs, nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir. Both AVI 4516 and AVI 4773 are well distributed in mouse tissues, including brain, where concentrations ten or fifteen-thousand times the EC90, respectively, are observed eight hours after an oral dose. As exemplar of the series, AVI 4516 shows minimal inhibition of major CYP isoforms and human cysteine and serine proteases, likely due to its latent electrophilic warhead. AVI 4516 also exhibits synergy in cellular infection models in combination with the RdRp inhibitor molnupiravir, while related analogs strongly inhibit nirmatrelvir-resistant MPro mutant virus in cells. The in vivo and antiviral properties of this new chemotype are differentiated from existing clinical and pre-clinical MPro inhibitors, and will advance new therapeutic development against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and other coronaviruses.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

Downregulation of the KCC2 chloride extrusion transporter is a key mechanism underlying this decreased inhibitory efficacy, but to-date there is no evidence supporting or opposing this hypothesis in humans. Here we demonstrate that KCC2 expression is decreased in superficial dorsal horn neurons of organ donors who died with a documented history of pain, or of long-term opioid use. We show profoundly decreased KCC2 dorsal horn membrane expression in a primary cohort associated with either chronic pain or opioid use, and in a replication cohort of mixed chronic pain and opioid use history. These results show that decreased dorsal horn inhibitory efficacy likely promotes chronic pain in humans and support the development of therapeutics augmenting KCC2 function as a treatment for chronic pain and opioid use disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

Nevertheless, more often than not, vaccine candidates fail in advanced stages of development and clinical trials. A key reason is the poor predictive value of non-clinical in vivo and in vitro models, due to either species-specific differences in the immune response or insufficient reflection of physiological vaccine mechanisms. Reliable modeling of human adaptive immune responses is a prerequisite to understand processes leading to vaccine-induced protective immunization and to drive informed decisions in vaccine development pipelines. Here, we present a centrifugal microfluidics based organ-on-chip approach to generate an organotypic high density lymphoid tissue on-chip. The model enables long-term culture of lymphoid tissue and raised antigen-specific antibody responses against influenza vaccines even after four weeks on-chip. Antibody response of different magnitude and quality could be induced both by direct antigen exposure as well as by recruitment of antigen-presenting cells from the periphery. The model represents an attractive approach to evaluate the impact of the mode of antigen delivery on adaptive immune responses. Beyond applications in vaccine development, the lymphoid-tissue-on-chip provides a platform to study cellular interactions during homeostasis, immune responses and long-term impact of immunomodulators over several weeks.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

We considered whether the paucity of natural IL-9R expression could be exploited for T cell immunotherapy given that, in mice, high doses of IL-9 were well-tolerated without discernible immune modulation. Compared to o9R, T cells engineered with IL-9R exhibit superior tissue infiltration, stemness, and anti-tumor activity. These qualities are consistent with a stronger JAK/STAT signal, which in addition to STAT1/3/5, unexpectedly includes STAT4 (canonically associated with IL-12 but not common gamma-chain cytokines). IL-9R T cells are exquisitely sensitive to perturbations of proximal signaling, including structure-guided attenuation, amplification, and rebalancing of JAK/STAT signals. Biased IL-9R mutants uncover STAT1 as a rheostat between proliferative stem-like and terminally differentiated effector states. In summary, we identify native IL-9/IL-9R as a natural cytokine-receptor pair with near-orthogonal qualities and an optimal JAK/STAT signaling profile for engineered T cell therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

Here, we sought to understand how new types of centromeres emerge and reach fixation by mapping centromere evolution across 138 budding yeast species and over 2,500 natural strain isolates.

Thymic output has been correlated with favorable prognosis in cancer patients across a range of ages, suggesting that the thymus is an important source for replenishing T cells capable of controlling cancer progression. However, the effector potential of thymic mature CD8+ T cells and their regulation have not been clearly defined. In this study, we identified the ability of thymic single positive CD8+ T cells to gain effector potential after thymic selection, but they are subject to the regulation of PD-1. We found a previously undisclosed role of PD-1 in limiting both the cytotoxic and exhaustion potential of thymic and peripheral CD8+ T cells. Our results show that although PD-1 inhibition facilitates the expansion of effector CD8+ T cells, effector CD8+ cells gradually lose their antitumor activity within tumor tissues due to advanced exhaustion in the absence of PD-1. Thus, although the preset effector potential in thymic mature CD8+ T cells allows them to rapidly respond to malignant cells in the periphery, PD-1, as a checkpoint, is embedded in the thymic mature CD8+ T cells after positive selection to balance their effector function from exaggeration and exhaustion. Therefore, we propose that a strategy capable of upholding the cytotoxic capacity and avoiding exhaustion of CD8+ T cells during the early stages of PD-1 inhibition therapy is needed to achieve durable antitumor immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

Despite existing research, it remains unclear how the gut microbiome is affected by different intensities of PA, and how other lifestyle factors influence this relationship. Here we study the relation between PA intensity and gut microbiome composition and function in a large Lifelines Dutch Microbiome Project dataset.

MethodsA cross-sectional design was performed on 5409 adults aged 40 to 60 from the community-based Lifelines Dutch Microbiome Project and from all these participants metagenomic shotgun data was available. Participants were categorized into sedentary (N=2501), moderate (N=1915), and vigorous (N=993) PA groups, based on self-reported activity levels. We investigated association between PA intensity and microbial diversity, bacterial species, and metabolic pathways by multiple regression models sequentially adjusted for the covariates age/sex, BMI, stool consistency and diet quality/alcohol intake.

ResultsVigorous PA, but not moderate PA, was significantly associated with higher gut microbiome alpha diversity (i.e., species richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity) as compared to sedentary PA. Compared to the sedentary group, the vigorous PA group showed a lower abundance of the bacterial species Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus ({beta} = -0.003, p = 0.042), even after extensive covariate adjustments and correction for multiple testing. Other species were initially also significantly associated with vigorous PA, but they disappeared after adjusting for covariates resulting in a loss of significance. Pathway analysis showed significant enrichment of two distinct metabolic pathways related to cellular energy recycling (Pyruvate fermentation to acetate and lactate II, {beta} = 8.11x10-05, p = 0.035) and purine metabolism (Purine ribonucleosides degradation, {beta} = 3.36x10-04, p = 0.039) in participants engaging in vigorous PA as compared to sedentary PA.

ConclusionsVigorous PA is associated with higher gut microbiome diversity and with specific alterations of microbial composition. The lower abundance of Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus within the vigorous PA group may be linked to increased gut permeability. The identified enrichment of microbial fermentation and purine metabolism in vigorous PA hints at a potential role of PA in affecting gut microbiome functionality and host health. The results of our modeling strategy highlight the importance of adjusting for dietary covariates to understand how PA may impact the gut microbiome independently from other influences.","NA","medrxiv",1737410865409

Recently, two models have been proposed: A specialized model, where each hemisphere governs contralateral behavior, and a redundant model, where both hemispheres equally guide behavior in the full visual space. To explore these alternatives, we analyzed simultaneous bilateral prefrontal cortex recordings from three macaque monkeys performing a visuo-spatial WM task. Each hemisphere represented targets across the full visual field and equally predicted behavioral imprecisions. Furthermore, memory errors were weakly correlated between hemispheres, suggesting that redundant, weakly coupled prefrontal hemispheres support spatial WM. Attractor model simulations showed that the hemispheric redundancy improved precision in simple tasks, whereas weak inter-hemispheric coupling allowed for specialized hemispheres in complex tasks. This interhemispheric architecture reconciles previous findings thought to support distinct models into a unified architecture, providing a versatile interhemispheric architecture that adapts to varying cognitive demands.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

To use such approaches, training data with known inputs and outputs are required. Since such data are generally unavailable in population genetics, researchers typically rely on simulations under the models of interest to train machine learning algorithms. While powerful, this approach depends heavily on the models used to generate training data. Because of the variety and complexity of processes shaping genetic variation, it is inevitable that not all processes important in an empirical system will be included when generating training data. This leads to a mismatch between the data used to train a machine learning algorithm and the data to which the trained model is ultimately applied--i.e., a domain shift-- and can negatively impact inference. Here, we train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect introgression between sister populations and demonstrate that it has near perfect accuracy when applied to data generated under the models used for training. To evaluate the impacts of domain shifts on inference, we generated new data with introgression from a third, unsampled population into one of the two focal populations (i.e., ghost introgression), and accuracy was substantially reduced on these data. Finally, we used domain adaptation, which aims to train a network that performs well in the presence of a domain shift. Notably, this requires no knowledge of the target or empirical domain. Our domain adaptation network was able to accurately detect introgression, even in the presence of unmodelled ghost introgression. We also applied this approach to empirical data to detect introgression between ABC Island brown bears and other populations of brown bears. Previous work has suggested that introgression between ABC Island bears and polar bears can mislead tests of introgression between populations of brown bears. We found that using domain adaptation reduced support for introgression between geographically isolated populations of brown bears, suggesting that our approach reduces false inferences of introgression due to ghost introgression.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

Humans employ diverse strategies to support spatial memory, including the use of cognitive maps. Cognitive maps are mental representations of the environment that organize its content along two or more continuous dimensions. In allocentric cognitive maps, these dimensions form a Cartesian coordinate system referenced to the environment. In egocentric cognitive maps, the dimensions form a polar coordinate system centered on the subject. To better understand how humans employ allocentric and egocentric cognitive maps for spatial memory, we performed a behavioral study with a novel task designed to directly and explicitly assess both types of cognitive maps. During encoding periods, participants navigated through a virtual environment and encountered objects at different locations. During recall periods, participants aimed at remembering these locations in abstract allocentric and egocentric coordinate systems. Our results show that relationships between the objects and the environment, such as their distance to boundaries and corners, were associated with allocentric memory performance. Relationships between the objects and the participant, including their distance and orientation to the participant's starting position, were linked to egocentric memory performance. Spatial feedback during recall supported performance within allocentric and egocentric domains, but not across domains. These findings are compatible with the notion that allocentric and egocentric cognitive maps operate as (partially) independent systems for spatial memory, each specialized in processing specific types of spatial relationships.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

However, growing evidence suggests that subcortical structures, particularly the thalamus, may play a crucial role in initiating and synchronizing slow waves. We tested the hypothesis that slow waves may arise from distinct cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical mechanisms using simultaneous EEG-fMRI in healthy adults. Spatial mapping based on thalamic fMRI responses revealed two slow-wave associated clusters. Cluster-1 C1, characterized by an early thalamic fMRI-signal increase, corresponded to large, efficiently synchronized waves associated with sleep spindles and with markers of higher arousal and autonomic activation. Cluster-2 C2, marked by an initial negative fMRI response, corresponded to smaller slow waves potentially resulting from cortico-cortical synchronization. These waves tended to more often occur during low-fragility phases of NREM sleep. These findings highlight distinct slow-wave subtypes with different thalamic involvement and, potentially, synchronization mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

Yet it remains unclear how inflammation promotes these aging phenotypes. NFkappaB both responds to and directs inflammation, and we present an experimental model of elevated NFkappaB activity (IkappaBminus) to dissect its role in hematopoietic aging phenotypes. We found that while elevated NFkappaB activity is not sufficient for HSC accumulation, HSC-autonomous NFkappaB activity impairs their functionality, leading to reduced bone marrow reconstitution. In contrast, myeloid bias is driven by the IkappaBminus proinflammatory bone marrow milieu as observed functionally, epigenomically, and transcriptomically. A new scRNA-seq HSPC labeling framework enabled comparisons with aged murine and human HSC datasets, documenting an association between HSC-intrinsic NFkappaB activity and quiescence, but not myeloid bias. These findings delineate separate regulatory mechanisms that underlie the three hallmarks of hematopoietic aging, suggesting that they are specifically and independently therapeutically targetable.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

To detect C. auris we aimed to compare different culture-, and molecular-based methods. Methods: Rectal swabs routinely collected in clinical care were spiked with different concentrations of C. auris. Co-infection/colonization was mimicked by spiking part of these samples with other pathogenic Candida species. Spiked materials were cultured at 37{degrees}C or 42{degrees}C using CHROMagar Candida and CHROMagar CandidaPlus plates. In parallel, samples were incubated in a dulcitol salt enrichment broth. Additionally, we compared seven in-house and commercial molecular tests on the direct material and from the broth one day after inoculation. Results: Culture-based methods showed sensitivities up to 100% within 48 hours of incubation, although sensitivity decreased as low as 44% at lower concentrations (<50 CFU per inoculum), in the presence of an abundance of other species and at higher temperature (42{degrees}C). Incubation at 42{degrees}C made visual identification possible since other species with similar colony morphologies did not grow at this temperature. No added value of using the dulcitol salt enrichment broth was found. qPCR on direct materials was highly sensitive and specific (both up to 100%) but major differences between various molecular tests were observed. Conclusion: We showed that both culture-based and molecular methods are sensitive for diagnosing C. auris. The clinical setting (routine screening versus an outbreak), local prevalence and the load in those that carry or are infected by C. auris are important factors to consider when determining which diagnostic tests should be employed.","NA","medrxiv",1737410865409

As the field moves towards quantitative cryoET, the scale of the resulting datasets presents a significant challenge for analysis and interpretation. To explore ways of handling datasets comprising thousands of tomograms, we investigated a comprehensive segmentation strategy - assigning an ontology-based identity to every voxel in a dataset - that is based on the sequential application of multiple convolutional neural networks. Using an openly available dataset of over 1800 Chlamydomonas reinhardtii tomograms as a test case, we demonstrate the segmentation of 25 different subcellular features across the full dataset, while requiring only a few seconds of processing time per tomogram. We show how the approach enables the representation of large datasets as searchable databases and propose the usage of ontology-based segmentations for improving two common processing tasks in cryoET. First, we explore context-aware particle picking as a method to retain biological context when selecting particles for subtomogram averaging and other downstream analyses. Secondly, we demonstrate area-selective template matching, where we use segmentation-based masks to avoid redundant computations in template matching and enable >500-fold faster processing in specific cases.

Its anticancer mechanism is thought to rely on mitotic arrest of fast-dividing cells and subsequent apoptosis following mitotic spindle disruption. However, paclitaxel reduces tumour size even in slow-dividing tumours, indicating an alternative, poorly characterised mechanism in interphase. Understanding the less characterised effects of paclitaxel is important for more effective cancer treatments, reducing tumour resistance and drug toxicity in healthy cells. Here, we found that paclitaxel-induced microtubule reorganisation in interphase also affects the perinuclear distribution of actin and vimentin filaments. The formation of large microtubule-vimentin bundles coincided with nuclear shape deformation, nuclear envelope invaginations, loss of control of nuclear membrane spacing, and changes to nuclear lamina organisation. Concurrently, Lamin A/C protein levels were decreased, and this depended on nuclear-cytoskeletal connectivity through LINC complex component SUN2. Finally, we show that Lamin A/C expression levels, which are often aberrant in cancer cells, are important in determining cell sensitivity to paclitaxel and recovery from treatment. Overall, our data supports nuclear architecture disruption as an additional mechanism for paclitaxel during interphase and independent of mitotic arrest.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

Using connectome-based predictive modelling, we interrogate three datasets to determine scanning conditions that can boost prediction of clinically relevant phenotypes and assess generalizability. In dataset one, a sample of youth with autism and neurotypical participants, we find that a sustained attention task (the gradual onset continuous performance task) results in high prediction performance of autistic traits compared to a free-viewing social attention task and a resting-state condition. In dataset two, we observe the predictive network model of autistic traits generated from the sustained attention task generalizes to predict measures of attention in neurotypical adults. In dataset three, we show the same predictive network model of autistic traits from dataset one further generalizes to predict measures of social responsiveness in data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange.

Consequently, PAX3-FOXO1+ cells display increased sensitivity to inhibition of DHFR by the chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate, and this dependence is rescued by provision of pyrimidine nucleotides. Methotrexate treatment mimics the metabolic and transcriptional impact of PAX3-FOXO1 silencing, reducing expression of genes related to PAX3-FOXO1-driven malignant cell states. Accordingly, methotrexate treatment slows growth of multiple PAX3-FOXO1+ tumor xenograft models, but not fusion-negative counterparts. Taken together, these data demonstrate that PAX3-FOXO1 induces cell states characterized by altered pyrimidine dependence and nominate methotrexate as an addition to the current therapeutic arsenal for treatment of these malignant pediatric tumors.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

However, persistently elevated interferons and receptor-activation of the MNK1/2-eIF4E signaling pathway at all disease phases caused sensory-motor dysfunction and pain by inducing hyperexcitability and sensitization of Gfra3+ sensory neurons.

Knowledge regarding the tissue tropism and pathogenesis of EV-D68 within the respiratory tract and central nervous system remains limited, primarily due to an incomplete understanding of the host factors that facilitate EV-D68 entry into host cells. Several cellular receptors involved in EV-D68 infections have been identified, including ICAM-5, sialylated glycoproteins, and heparan sulfate (HS). Here, we investigate the receptor requirement of a panel of EV-D68 strains covering all clades focusing on HS and sialosides utilizing glycan arrays. We found that all EV-D68 strains binding to HS harbour a cell culture adaptative substitution in the structural protein VP1 at position 271 which changes the amino acid into a positive charged one. Glycan array analyses revealed that EV-D68 strains either prefer 2,6-linked sialic acids presented on N-glycans, 2,8 linked sialic acids on gangliosides, or both. Inhibition of glycolipid biosynthesis or multivalent glycolipid mimics confirmed that ganglioside structures serve as entry receptors for certain EV-D68 strains. Lastly, we examined whether EV-D68 strains that bind to HS or glycolipids require different uncoating mechanisms.

Together, we identified that EV-D68 strains can use disialoglycolipids as novel receptors and that different EV-D68 strains show a promiscuous sialic acid binding repertoire.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

Here, we employed a traveling waves approach to investigate how alpha oscillations integrate prior expectations during a perceptual decision-making task. Our findings demonstrated that expectation-based knowledge triggers the propagation of alpha traveling waves from frontal to occipital areas, with this increase associated with enhanced modulation of brain regions involved in stimulus processing and directly linked to prior-driven bias at the behavioral level. Moreover, participants who relied more on prior expectations exhibited stronger top-down signaling, whereas those who focused on sensory input showed a contrasting forward signaling pattern. These results highlight the role of alpha-band traveling waves in predictive mechanisms, suggesting that rhythmic interactions across brain regions facilitate this process and contribute to inter-individual differences in its implementation.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

Tolerance to mild replication stress (RS) relies on active fork slowing, mediated by transient fork reversal and RECQ1-assisted restart, and modulated by PARP1 and nuclear architectural components via yet-elusive mechanisms. We combined acute protein inactivation with cell biology and single-molecule approaches to investigate the role of Lamin A/C upon mild RS. We found that Lamin A/C dynamically interacts with replication factories throughout the nucleus and, together with its nucleoplasmic partner LAP2alpha;, is required to induce active fork slowing and maintain chromosome stability upon mild genotoxic treatments. Inactivating nucleoplasmic Lamin A/C reduces poly-ADP-ribosylation (PAR) levels at nascent DNA, triggering deregulated RECQ1-mediated restart of reversed forks. Moreover, we found that the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3, previously reported at stalled forks, also accumulates in response to mild RS. H3K9me3 accumulation requires Lamin A/C, which prevents its premature removal by the histone demethylase JMJD1A/KDM3A. H3K9me3 loss per se phenocopies Lamin A/C inactivation, reducing PAR levels and deregulating RECQ1 activity at forks. Hence, nucleoplasmic Lamin A/C, H3K9me3 and PARylation levels are crucial, mechanistically-linked modulators of fork slowing, remodelling and restart upon mild RS, with important implications for chemotherapy response and Lamin A/C deregulation in human disease.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

In the past decade, naive hPSCs, representing a pre-implantation stage, have been derived. Naive hPSCs efficiently differentiate towards embryonic and extraembryonic lineages such as trophectoderm, primitive endoderm, and extraembryonic mesoderm, and also self-organize into blastocyst-like structures called blastoids. However, their culture typically relies on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which are variable, resource-intensive, and can confound analyses. We report the long-term maintenance of naive hPSCs in a feeder-free, serum-coated system. We successfully expanded for up to 25 passages 8 different naive hPSCs lines across 5 laboratories. Growth rate, clonogenicity, and gene expression profiles on serum coating were comparable to MEF-based cultures, but serum coating eliminated fibroblast contamination. Naive hPSCs cultured on serum exhibited more efficient germ layer specification, retained trophectoderm potential and high blastoid formation efficiency. Exome sequencing revealed fewer mutations in serum-cultured cells, and mass spectrometry identified extracellular matrix proteins such as vitronectin, fibronectin, and collagens in the serum coating. Overall, serum coating offers a scalable, cost-effective and therefore widely applicable alternative for naive hPSC culture, maintaining developmental potential, reducing DNA mutations, and eliminating MEF-related confounding factors. We believe serum coating will expand the use of naive hPSCs to large-scale studies and facilitate the investigation of mechanistic insights into developmental and disease modelling.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

Here we considered models for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a cancer that has dramatically increased in incidence over the past few decades in Western populations, with high case fatality rates due to late-stage diagnoses. Despite advancements in genomic analyses of the precursor Barretts esophagus (BE), prevention of late-stage EAC remains a significant clinical challenge. Previous microbiome studies in BE and EAC have focused on quantifying static microbial abundance differences rather than evolutionary dynamics. Using whole genome sequencing data from esophageal tissues, we first applied a robust bioinformatics pipeline to extract non-host DNA reads, mapped these putative reads to microbial taxa, and retained those taxa with high genomic coverage. When applying mathematical models of microbial evolution to sequential stages of progression to EAC, we observed evidence of neutral dynamics in community assembly within normal esophageal tissue and BE, but not EAC. In a case-control study of BE patients who progressed to EAC cancer outcomes (CO) versus those who had non-cancer outcomes (NCO) during follow-up (mean=10.5 years), we found that Helicobacter pylori deviated significantly from the neutral expectation in BE NCO, suggesting that factors related to H. pylori or H. pylori infection itself may influence EAC risk. Additionally, simulations incorporating selection recapitulated non-neutral behaviors observed in the datasets. Formally modeling dynamics during progression holds promise in clinical applications by offering a deeper understanding of microbial involvement in cancer development.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

While the effects of plant domestication at the genetic and phenotypic levels are well-documented, its impact on plant microbiome remains less understood. Root microbiomes play crucial roles in nutrient acquisition, pathogen defense, and biotic stress tolerance, yet the influence of domestication on their diversity and assembly is still debated. Two primary hypotheses have been proposed: 1) the reduction in microbial diversity resulting from the domestication process, and 2) the diminished ability of host plants to control their microbiomes. To evaluate these hypotheses, we conducted a meta-analysis of multiple crops, comparing the root microbiomes of domesticated plants and their wild relatives. Our results indicate that the effects of domestication are species-specific and context-dependent, with most domesticated plants exhibiting increased microbial diversity and more structured communities, while others show no significant change. Overall, this study provides evidence that plant domestication does not lead to a uniform reduction in microbial diversity or a consistently diminished ability of plants to influence their microbiomes. Based on these findings, we discuss new perspectives and the need for future studies incorporating native soils and host genetic variation in such experiments, analyzing not only diversity but also microbiome function, and considering how root morphology might affect microbiome recruitment. Finally, we highlight the need for research on the potential adaptive or maladaptive consequences that introgression between wild and domesticated plants could have from a microbiome perspective.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTPlant domestication has had profound impacts on plant traits and their genetic makeup. These traits are likely to influence microbial interactions with the plants, but the overall effect of domestication on plant microbiomes is still subject to debate. In this work, we challenge two primary hypotheses regarding the effects of domestication on root microbiomes; we compared published microbiomes of wild and domesticated plants and found that domestication does not reduce microbial diversity or the plants contribution to their associated microbial communities. Instead, these effects vary between plant species and environmental conditions. This work provides insights into how domestication shapes plant-microbe relationships and discusses new approaches that are critical for advancing this area of research.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

To assist scientists in designing proteins with improved solubility and better understand solubility-related diseases, we introduce SOuLMuSiC, a computational tool for the fast and accurate prediction of the impact of mutations on protein solubility. Our model is based on a simple shallow artificial neural network that takes as input a series of features, including biophysical properties of wild-type and mutated residues, energetic values computed using various statistical potentials, and mutational scores derived from protein language models. SOuLMuSiC has been trained on a curated dataset of about seven hundred mutations with known solubility values, collected and manually verified from original literature. It significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art predictors in strict cross-validation and shows good performance on external datasets containing high-throughput enzyme solubility-related data as well as protein aggregation propensities. In summary, SOuLMuSiC is a valuable tool for identifying mutations that impact protein solubility, and can play a major role in the rational design of proteins with improved solubility and in understanding genetic variants' effect.

Yet, studies of microbial population differentiation across environmental gradients have been surprisingly scarce. In this study, we tested for phenotypic and genetic divergence in rhizobia bacteria (genus Sinorhizobium) associated with the legume Medicago lupulina across two environmental gradients: an elevation gradient in the Appalachian Mountains and an urbanization gradient in Philadelphia. Common garden experiments in Medicago sativa revealed that symbiotic traits differed significantly between high- and low-elevation rhizobia populations, but not between urban and suburban populations. Nitrogen supplementation erased the trait differences between low- and high-elevation populations, consistent with the hypothesis that these differences arise from the nitrogen that rhizobia provide. In contrast to symbiotic traits, free-living growth traits showed minimal differentiation across gradients. To test the hypothesis that greater gene flow constrains phenotypic divergence in the urbanization gradient, we compared the strength of isolation by distance in the core and accessory genomes across the two gradients. Contrary to our expectation, isolation by distance was significantly stronger in the urbanization gradient in both the core and accessory genomes. These results suggest that our focal elevation gradient imposed stronger divergent selection on rhizobia than our focal urbanization gradient. Together, this study highlights the need for a holistic understanding of microbial evolution with regard to the traits across life stages, molecular evolution across genomic levels, and evolutionary processes across environmental gradients.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

Epigenomic modulation of these cells offers a strategy to reprogram pathogenic pathways without altering the genome, potentially restoring immune balance. Epigenetic inhibitors are already utilized in oncology but often exhibit adverse effects due to lack of selectivity and cytotoxic concentrations. Applying these drugs to treat autoimmune diseases necessitates more selective inhibitors and the use of tolerable concentrations. In this study, we screened a library of 25 compounds with varying degrees of target selectivity and different concentrations. Spectral cytometry enabled the analysis of cell-subset distribution and activation, followed by bulk RNA-sequencing for transcriptomic profiling. We could demonstrate cell-subset specific and concentration-dependent immune modulation in PBMCs. Transcriptomic analysis showed that inhibitors of histone acetylation-modulating enzymes significantly altered gene expression, particularly in immune regulation pathways relevant to autoimmune diseases. Comparative analysis between in-vitro treated healthy controls and RA patients demonstrated both shared and selective drug effects, with some inhibitors like Ricolinostat overlapping with established RA drug pathways. Our findings highlight the potential of epigenetic inhibitors, especially those targeting histone acetylation, to modulate immune responses in a target-selective manner.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

While, licensed vaccines for protection of avian or mammalian species are not yet available, a few candidate vaccines are being trialled. Here, we report on the experimental vaccination of chickens and captive wild birds using a propagation-defective vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), in which the essential envelope glycoprotein (G) protein gene was replaced by a modified hemagglutinin gene derived from a clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 isolated in 2022 in the animal park of Bern, Switzerland. VSV{Delta}G(H5mb) was produced on helper cells providing the VSV G protein in trans. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens that were immunized twice via the intramuscular route with adjuvant-free VSV{Delta}G(H5mb) replicon particles induced high levels of virus-neutralizing serum antibodies and were fully protected against lethal infection by H5N1 HPAIV (clade 2.3.4.4b). Notably, immunized animals did not shed challenge virus from the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that herd immunity can be achieved. The same vaccine was used to immunize a total of 317 captive wild birds at Bern Animal Park and Zoo Basel, representing 24 different species. No vaccine-associated side effects were observed. Birds without previous contact to H5Nx viruses produced high to very high H5-specific neutralizing antibody titers following the second immunization, while birds showing H5-specific antibodies prior to vaccination, already developed high neutralising antibody titers after a single immunization. One year after vaccination, most animals still showed significant neutralizing antibody titers, indicating that VSV{Delta}G(H5mb) is able to induce a long-lasting protective immune response. Our results indicate that VSV{Delta}G(H5mb) is an extraordinary safe and highly efficacious vaccine to stop H5N1 replication in various avian species.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

However, the accessibility of this therapy is limited by factors such as complex manufacturing process, limited capacity of manufacturing facilities and the requirement of highly skilled workforce for the manual steps of CAR-T cell production. To minimize the manual processes, CAR-T cell manufacturing field is shifting towards closed and automated systems, including analytical tools that offer intermittent monitoring of cells in production. Therefore, label-free technologies for closely monitoring CAR-T cells in closed systems are needed. Here, we evaluate the use of a flow cytometer equipped with a 405nm violet laser for investigating the NADH and FAD autofluorescence in T cells. Our results revealed the increase of NADH and FAD autofluorescence were significantly correlated with the upregulation of T cell activation marker, CD25 and the increase of extracellular lactate in spent media in the first three days after T cell activation. We demonstrate the potential use of FAD for determining the endpoint of CAR-T cell manufacture by establishing a relationship between the rate of change in the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of FAD in CAR-T cells and the rate of change in T cell proliferation using a G-Rex bioreactor. Collectively, these findings suggest that autofluorescence, particularly FAD autofluorescence, can serve as a label-free biomarker (cellular attribute) for monitoring T cell activation and expansion during CAR-T cell production. The use of 405nm visible light to substitute the genotoxic UV wavelengths for assessing the NADH and FAD autofluorescence, paves the way to incorporate autofluorescence measurements into closed and automated systems for in-process monitoring of CAR-T cell manufacturing.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

Additionally, scRNAseq analyses are widely applied to cancer research to understand tumor heterogeneity, disease progression, and resistance to therapy. Single-cell data processing is a challenging task due to its high-dimensionality, sparsity, and having imbalanced class distributions. An accurate cell-type identification is highly dependent on preprocessing and quality control steps. To address these issues, generative models have been widely used in recent years. Techniques frequently used include Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Gaussian-based methods, and, more recently, Flow-based (FB) generative models. We conducted a comparative analysis of fundamental generative models, aiming to serve as a preliminary guidance for developing novel automated scRNAseq data analysis systems. We performed a meta-analysis by integrating four datasets derived from pancreatic tissue sections. To balance class distributions, synthetic cells were generated for underrepresented cell types using VAE, GAN, Gaussian Copula, and FB models. To evaluate the performances of generative models, we performed automated cell-type classification tasks in original and dimensionality-reduced spaces in a comparative manner. We also identified differentially expressed genes for each cell type, and inferred cell-cell interactions based on ligand-receptor pairs across distinct cell-types. Among the generative models, FB consistently outperformed others across all experimental setups in cell-type classification (with an F1-score of 0.8811 precision of 0.8531 and recall of 0.8643). FB produced biologically more relevant synthetic data according to correlation structures (with a correlation discrepancy score of 0.0511) and cell-cell interactions found from synthetic cells were closely resembling those of the original data.

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus on chromosome 6 is a polymorphic region with complex linkage patterns that has been implicated in several autoimmune and neurological disorders. The HLA locus has not been systematically examined in PSP. It is unclear whether tau and HLA can interact to induce an autoimmune disease mechanism. Methods We evaluated an autopsy confirmed PSP cohort (n=44) and compared allele/haplotype frequencies to those of the reference group of a local deceased Canadian donor pool. We performed HLA/Tau peptide binding prediction and modelling of HLA Class II and Tau Peptide interactions. Findings Odds ratio was 2.94 (95% CI 1.01 to 8.55; p=0.047) for DQB1*06:01 allele, and 2.59 (95% CI 1.39 to 4.83; p=0.0025) for the narcolepsy associated haplotype (DRB1*15:01DQB1*06:02).

Several laboratories around the world can now generate single-cell transcriptomic data from different tissues. Unsupervised clustering, followed by annotation of the cell type of the identified clusters, is a crucial step in single-cell analyses. However, there is no consensus on the marker genes to use for annotation, and celltype annotation is currently mostly done by manual inspection of marker genes, which is irreproducible, and poorly scalable. Additionally, patient-privacy is also a critical issue with human datasets. There is a critical need to standardize and automate celltype annotation across datasets in a privacy-preserving manner. Here, we developed SwarmMAP that uses Swarm Learning to train machine learning models for cell-type classification based on single-cell sequencing data in a decentralized way. SwarmMAP does not require any exchange of raw data between data centers. SwarmMAP has a F1-score of 0.93, 0.98, and 0.88 for cell type classification in human heart, lung, and breast datasets, respectively. Swarm Learning-based models yield an average performance of 0.907 which is on par with the performance achieved by models trained on centralized data (p-val=0.937, Mann-Whitney U Test). We also find that increasing the number of datasets increases cell-type prediction accuracy and enables handling higher cell-type diversity. Together, these findings demonstrate that Swarm Learning is a viable approach to automate cell-type annotation.

Despite advances in our understanding of bacterial plant colonization, the extent to which growth substrate influences the molecular mechanisms enabling bacteria to efficiently colonize plants remains poorly understood. To evaluate if genes important for plant colonization are influenced by substrate, we used randomly barcoded transposon mutagenesis sequencing (RB-TnSeq) in Paraburkholderia graminis OAS925, an efficient rhizosphere colonizer, and Brachypodium distachyon plants grown in six different substrates. Of the 382 rhizosphere colonization genes that we identified in strain OAS925, 348 genes (91.1%) are dependent on the growth substrate evaluated, and 34 genes (8.9%) are shared across all the substrates. To further characterize the plant colonization fitness genes, we compared our data to growth in 110 distinct in vitro conditions. To validate our results, we used individual mutants of selected genes and tested them in different growth substrates. We also show the influence of substrate on colonization by P. phytofirmans PsJN, Variovorax sp. OAS795 and Rhizobium sp. OAE497. Our data confirms that bacterial fitness for plant colonization is strongly influenced by plant growth substrate type, and it highlights the importance of taking this parameter into consideration when engineering bacterial strains for improved host colonization.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

Mapping of individual preys across the baits and subcellular compartments identified a group of 30 proteins that we tested by loss-of-function in zebrafish.

Whether and how frequently that resistance occurred before the introduction is harder to determine, as isolates could not have been tested for resistance before an antibiotic was discovered. Historical collections, like the British National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC), stretching back to 1885, provide a window into this history. Here we match 1,817 sequenced high-quality genomes from the NCTC collection to their respective year of isolation to study resistance genes before and concurrent with the age of antibiotics. Concordant with previous work, we find resistance genes in both pathogens and environmental samples before the age of antibiotics. While generally rare before the introduction of an antibiotic, we find an associated increase in frequency with antibiotic introduction. Finally, we observe a trend of resistance elements becoming both increasingly mobile and nested within multiple mobile elements as time goes on. More broadly, our findings suggest that likely-functional antibiotic resistance genes were circulating in clinically relevant isolates before the age of antibiotics, but human usage is associated with increasing both their overall prevalence and mobility.

DATA SUMMARYGenome assemblies downloaded and analyzed are in Supplementary Table 1, and computational tools used are found in the Methods. The authors confirm all supporting data, code and protocols have been provided within the article or through supplementary data files.

Impact statementHistorical collections of microbial isolates enable researchers to both investigate the past and identify interesting trends over time. In this study, we queried over 1,800 isolate genomes in one such collection for genomic variation linked to antibiotic resistance. We show that numerous isolates cultured before the introduction of a given antibiotic contain genomic variation linked to antibiotic resistance; however, this phenomenon remained relatively rare. We demonstrate a strong association between the year a given antibiotic was clinically introduced and a rise in prevalence of genomic resistance to that antibiotic. Finally, we show that while mobile elements are common throughout the isolates and timeframe analyzed, genomic resistance has become increasingly mobile as time has gone on. This study shows that as expected, the clinical introduction of a given antibiotic is correlated with an increase in resistance to that antibiotic but also was linked with increased mobility of genes and alleles conferring resistance. However, we note that the effect of deposition bias in the collection cannot be excluded. Our work also indicates that numerous microbial pangenomes of pathogens naturally contained genomic resistance to a given antibiotic even before anthropogenic use of that antibiotic. Taken together, we demonstrate that although human use may affect the prevalence and mobility of genomic resistance in clinical isolates; for most antibiotics, genomic resistance existed within the pangenomes of sampled pathogens prior to clinical introduction. Quantifying and understanding the impact of antibiotic introduction in the past helps us understand how the introduction of novel antibiotics can impact bacteria; allowing better reaction to novel resistant infections as they arise.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

Here, we use a comprehensive and environmentally balanced collection of metagenomes to survey the defence landscape across complex microbial communities. We also assess the association between the viral community and the prevalence of defence systems. We identify strong environmental effects in predicting overall defence abundance, with animal-host-associated environments and hot environments harbouring more defences overall.

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1737410865409

We find that the looped state is generally rare, with a mean probability of 2.3% and a maximum of 26% across the quantified loops.

Agonists which bind and stimulate multiple receptors have shown particular promise. However, off target effects, including nausea and diarrhoea, remain a complication of using these agents, and modified versions with optimized pharmacological profiles and/or biased signaling at the cognate receptors are increasingly sought. Here, we describe the synthesis and properties of a molecule which binds to both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors (GLP-1R and GIPR) to enhance insulin secretion. HISHS-2001 shows increased affinity at the GLP-1R, as well as a tendency towards reduced internalization and recycling at this receptor versus FDA-approved dual GLP-1R/GIPR agonist tirzepatide. HISHS-2001 also displayed significantly greater bias towards cAMP generation versus {beta}-arrestin 2 recruitment compared to tirzepatide. In contrast, Gs recruitment was lower versus tirzepatide at the GLP-1R, but higher at the GIPR. Administered to obese hyperglycaemic db/db mice, HISHS-2001 increased circulating insulin whilst lowering body weight and HbA1c with similar efficacy to tirzepatide at substantially lower doses.

In mice, reducing dietary levels of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) recapitulates many of the benefits of a low protein diet; BCAA-restricted diets extend lifespan, reduce frailty, and improve metabolic health, while BCAA supplementation shortens lifespan, promotes obesity, and impairs glycemic control. Recently, high protein diets have been shown to promote cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging implicated in many age-related diseases, in the liver of mice. Here, we test the hypothesis that the effects of high protein diets on metabolic health and on cell senescence are mediated by BCAAs. We find that reducing dietary levels of BCAAs protects male and female mice from the negative metabolic consequences of both normal and high protein diets. Further, we identify tissue-specific effects of BCAAs on cellular senescence, with restriction of all three BCAAs - but not individual BCAAs - protecting from hepatic cellular senescence while potentiating cell senescence in white adipose tissue. We find that the effects of BCAAs on hepatic cellular senescence are cell-autonomous, with lower levels of BCAAs protecting cultured cells from antimycin-A induced senescence.

This study reveals that LTA binds to multiple proteins involved in cell wall processes and preserves cell wall integrity by regulating one of the LTA-binding proteins, ScaH. ScaH is a peptidoglycan hydrolase predicted to have N-acetylglucosaminidase and amidase/peptidase activities. LTA inhibits ScaHs enzymatic activities by direct binding and represses scaH transcription by an unknown mechanism. During early growth, LTA is highly expressed and sequesters ScaH at the cell membrane, preventing ScaH activity in the cell wall. However, LTA expression decreases during the late growth phase, leading to ScaH translocation into the cell wall. This reduction in LTA coincides with increased wall teichoic acid (WTA) expression and cleavage of the LTA synthase LtaS. In the LTA-null mutant, ScaH inactivation restored peptidoglycan crosslinking, osmoresistance, and beta-lactam resistance both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that LTA protects the cell wall by suppressing ScaH expression and activity while sequestering it during active growth. Additionally, the reciprocal expression patterns of LTA and WTA indicate an interconnected regulation of teichoic acids in S. aureus, with their roles likely depending on the growth phase.

ImportanceStaphylococcus aureus is a significant human pathogen, with LTA playing a crucial role in cell viability, division, and maintaining cell wall integrity. Targeting LTA synthesis holds promise for the development of new therapeutics against S. aureus. Disruption of LTA synthesis leads to phenotypes indicative of compromised cell wall integrity, such as reduced crosslinking, osmosensitivity, and heightened beta-lactam sensitivity, although the precise underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our research demonstrates that LTA contributes to cell wall integrity by regulating the expression, activity, and translocation of the peptidoglycan hydrolase ScaH. Additionally, LTAs binding to the cell wall synthesis enzymes suggests a role in modulating cell wall integrity through these interactions. These findings significantly advance our understanding of LTAs physiological functions and may serve as a foundation for the development of novel therapeutics targeting S. aureus and other Gram-positive pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

How this position is regulated and its role in genome photoprotection remains unknown. By developing a model of human keratinocytes internalizing extracellular melanin into pigment organelles, we show that keratin 5/14 intermediate filaments mechanically control the 3D perinuclear position of pigments, shielding DNA from photodamage. Imaging and microrheology in human disease-related model identify structural keratin cages surrounding pigment organelles to stiffen their microenvironment and maintain their 3D position. Optimum pigment spatialization is required for DNA photoprotection and rely on the interplay between intermediate filaments and microtubules bridged by plectin cytolinkers. Thus, the mechanically-driven proximity of pigment organelles to the nucleus is a key photoprotective parameter. Uncovering how human skin counteracts solar radiation by positioning the melanin microparasol next to the genome anticipates that dynamic spatialization of organelles is a physiological UV stress response.

We studied this paradox in the Drosophila olfactory system by establishing a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of all developing antennal sensory lineages, including latent neural populations that normally undergo programmed cell death (PCD). This atlas reveals that transcriptional control is robust, but imperfect, in defining selective sensory receptor expression. A second layer of precision is afforded by the intersection of expression of functionally-interacting receptor subunits. A third layer is defined by stereotyped PCD patterning, which masks promiscuous receptor expression in neurons fated to die and removes ""empty"" neurons lacking receptors. Like receptor choice, PCD is under lineage-specific transcriptional control; promiscuity in this regulation leads to previously-unappreciated heterogeneity in neuronal numbers. Thus functional precision in the mature olfactory system belies developmental noise that might facilitate the evolution of sensory pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

Typically, double-strand DNA phages possess genomes around 50 kilobase pairs (kbp) in size, although the largest known genome surpasses 735 kbp. This raises intriguing questions about the potential maximum size of phage genomes. In this study, we present the first phage genome over 800 kbp, named BF3, which was reconstructed from oil reservoir production water. BF3 encodes 1,164 protein-coding genes (code 11) and 46 tRNA genes, and is classified within the Caudoviricetes, though its bacterial host remains unidentified. We utilized ColabFold to predict the structures of 744 protein-coding genes with high confidence, finding that 395 and 591 of these genes corresponded with known structures in the Protein Data Bank and the Big Fantastic Virus Database (BFVD), respectively. Notably, 153 of BF3s predicted structures exhibited no similarity to those catalogued in the BFVD, which is currently the most extensive viral protein structure database. This study not only expands our understanding of phage genome capacities but also underscores the need for specialized analytical tools and pipelines to investigate exceptionally large phages.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

Melbournevirus encodes a distinct H2B-H2A histone doublet variant in addition to the canonical H4-H3 and H2B-H2A doublets. This viral histone variant has a truncated H2B portion and its amino acid sequence deviates from that of the main viral H2B-H2A throughout the entire coding region. It is less abundant than the main H2B-H2A doublet, is essential for melbournevirus fitness, and is conserved in all Marseilleviridae. The cryo-EM structure of a nucleosome-like particle reconstituted with this H2B-H2A variant and viral H4-H3 reveals that only 90 base pairs of DNA are stably bound, significantly less than in eukaryotic nucleosomes and viral nucleosomes made with the main fused viral histone doublets. The reduced ability to bind DNA can be attributed to structural differences between variant and main H2B-H2A. Variant melbournevirus nucleosomes are less stable, possibly aiding rapid genome unpacking to initiate gene expression. Our results highlight the remarkable propensity of giant viruses to appropriate the utility of histones for their specialized purposes.","NA","biorxiv",1737410865409

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1737410865409
"Covid-19 vaccination decisions and impacts of vaccine mandates: A cross sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia, Canada.","10.1101/2024.12.09.24318733","medrxiv",98.14999999999992,0,0,0,94.89999999999993,"Chaufan, C.; Hemsing, N.; Moncrieffe, R.","Claudia Chaufan","York University","2024-12-10","1","PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","cc_by_nc_nd","health policy","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2024/12/10/2024.12.09.24318733.source.xml","BackgroundSince vaccination mandates in the healthcare sector were introduced across Canada, public health authorities in the province of British Columbia implemented among the strongest ones in the country. While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1737410865409
