With no known effective FDA-approved treatments for either condition, patient-reported outcomes of treatments are invaluable for guiding management strategies in patient care and generating new avenues for research. Here, we present the results of an ME/CFS and Long COVID treatment survey with responses from 3,925 patients. We assessed the experiences of these patients with more than 150 treatments, as well as their demographics, symptoms, and comorbidities. Patients with each condition who participated in the study shared similar symptom profiles, including all the core symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g., 89.7% of ME/CFS and 79.4% of Long COVID reported post-exertional malaise (PEM). Treatments with the greatest perceived benefits were identified, which had varied effects on different core symptoms. In addition, treatment responses were significantly correlated (R2 = 0.68) between the two patient groups. Patient subgroups with distinct profiles of symptoms and comorbidities showed varied responses to treatments, e.g., a POTS-dominant cluster benefiting from autonomic modulators and a cognitive-dysfunction cluster from CNS stimulants. This study underscores the symptomatic and therapeutic similarities between ME/CFS and Long COVID and highlights the commonalities and nuanced complexities of infection-associated chronic diseases and related conditions. Insights from patient-reported experiences, in the absence of approved treatments, provide urgently needed real-world evidence for targeted therapies in patient care and for developing future clinical trials.

However, most non-model organisms lack integral genomic resources such as reference genomes and recombination maps, limiting accurate evolutionary inference. Here, we explore the consequences of reference genome bias on the inference of genetic diversity, demographic histories, and recombination rates using gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), which, like most members of Canidae, are traditionally mapped to the dog (Canis lupus familiaris) reference genome. Whole genome sequence data from gray foxes were mapped to the gray fox reference genome and two heterospecific canid references (dog and Arctic fox; Vulpes lagopus). Our results reveal that reference bias significantly affects population genomic analyses. Mapping to the conspecific gray fox genome improved read pairing, increased detection of SNPs, especially rare variants, and reduced spurious variants. Estimates of nucleotide diversity ({pi}) and genetic differentiation (FST) were higher using the gray fox genome. We observed that mapping to heterospecific references leads to underestimates of population sizes, distorted demographic trajectories, and more variable recombination rates. These effects are further complicated by population-specific biases, which vary in their magnitude and direction across populations, highlighting the need for tailored approaches to mitigate reference bias. Importantly, FST outlier detection also differed among references, affecting functional interpretations. Collectively, this work addresses a critical gap in the rapidly expanding field of non-model species genomics by demonstrating the importance of using conspecific genomic resources in evolutionary research and illustrating how reliance on distantly related reference genomes can distort population genetic analyses.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

The conventional method of aligning sequences of the query genome in parallel is to utilize a single thread per sequence. This results in poor CPU utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we designed optimizations to accelerate whole-genome alignment on multi-core processors and implemented them in a commonly used aligner, minimap2.

Such targeting is challenging as it requires readout of the few outward facing peptide antigen residues and the avoidance of extensive contacts with the MHC carrier which is present on almost all cells. Here we describe the use of deep learning-based protein design tools to de novo design small proteins that arc above the peptide binding groove of pMHC complexes and make extensive contacts with the peptide. We identify specific binders for ten target pMHCs which when displayed on yeast bind the on-target pMHC tetramer but not closely related peptides. For five targets, incorporation of designs into chimeric antigen receptors leads to T-cell activation by the cognate pMHC complexes well above the background from complexes with peptides derived from proteome. Our approach can generate high specificity binders starting from either experimental or predicted structures of the target pMHC complexes, and should be widely useful for both protein and cell based pMHC targeting.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

To uncover the evolutionary diversity of ribosome biogenesis, we analyzed over 30,000 bacterial genomes and revealed that Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR), also known as the phylum Patescibacteria, characterized by reduced genomes and smaller ribosomes, has about half the average number of RBFs compared with non-CPR bacteria. Notably, key RBFs such as der, obgE, and rbfA, considered indispensable, are conserved in only around 20%-70% of CPR genomes. Since such repertoires were not observed in reduced genomes of other phyla, CPR presumably diverged early in bacterial evolution. We further confirmed that ribosomal structural changes correlate with reduced RBFs, evidencing co-evolution between RBFs and the ribosome. These findings suggest that ribosomal biogenesis is more flexible than recognized, and the small cell and genome sizes of CPR bacteria and their early divergence may influence the unusual repertoires of RBFs.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

However, healthcare decision makers need evidence of cost effectiveness to understand the cost/benefit of adopting this approach.

MethodsTo evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different smoking cessation interventions, and service delivery, we used a Markov model, adapted from previous National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on smoking cessation. This uses long-term epidemiological data to capture the prevalence of the smoking-related illnesses, where prevalence is estimated based on age, sex, and smoking status. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to capture joint parameter uncertainty.

ResultsAll smoking cessation interventions appeared cost-effective at a threshold of {pound}20,000 per quality-adjusted life year, compared to no intervention or behavioural support alone. Offering immediate smoking cessation as part of lung cancer screening appointments, compared with usual care (onward referral to stop smoking services) was also estimated to be cost-effective with a net monetary benefit of {pound}2,198 per person, and a saving of between {pound}34 and {pound}79 per person in reduced workplace absenteeism among working age attendees. Estimated healthcare cost savings were more than four times greater in the most deprived quintile compared to the least deprived, alongside a fivefold increase in QALYs accrued.

ConclusionsSmoking cessation interventions within lung cancer screening are cost-effective and should be integrated so that treatment is initiated during screening visits. This is likely to reduce overall costs to the health service, and wider integrated care systems, improve quality and length of life, and may lessen health inequalities.

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topic?C_ST_ABSSmoking cessation interventions are known to be cost-effective in general. However, their cost-effectiveness specifically within lung cancer screening programmes, where they are not routinely commissioned, remains to be established.

What this study addsThis health economic analysis estimates that offering smoking cessation immediately within a lung cancer screening visits is a cost-effective intervention, with a substantial return on investment for the healthcare service, alongside a reduction in health inequalities and an increase in productivity for the wider economy.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyThis economic evaluation will provide those commissioning and planning healthcare services with evidence that supports the case for funding smoking cessation services integrated within lung cancer screening programmes as immediate, opt-out services.","NA","medrxiv",1733090872241

These two groups of taxa show contrasting trends in the molecular mechanisms of 3D chromatin organization and long-term evolutionary dynamics of cis-regulatory element (CREs) conservation. To help us identify shared versus derived features that could be responsible for the evolution of these different regulatory architectures in animals, we studied the evolution and organization of the regulatory genome of echinoderms, a lineage whose phylogenetic position and relatively slow molecular evolution has proven particularly useful for evolutionary studies. First, using PacBio and HiC data, we generated new reference genome assemblies for two species belonging to two different echinoderm classes: the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the bat sea star Patiria miniata. Second, we characterized their 3D chromatin architecture, identifying TAD-like domains in echinoderms that, like in flies, do not seem to be associated with CTCF motif orientation. Third, we systematically profiled CREs during sea star and sea urchin development using ATAC-seq, comparing their regulatory logic and dynamics over multiple developmental stages. Finally, we investigated sea urchin and sea star CRE evolution across multiple evolutionary distances and timescales, from closely related species to other echinoderm classes and deuterostome lineages. This showed the presence of several thousand elements conserved for hundreds of millions of years, revealing a vertebrate-like pattern of CRE evolution that probably constitutes an ancestral property of the regulatory evolution of animals.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

Mass spectrometry confirmed the transported proteins as the most abundant in EV membranes, and the presence of many receptor-interacting proteins demonstrates the utility of EVs for characterizing membrane protein interactomes. Cryo-electron tomography of EGFR-containing EVs reveals that EGFR forms clusters in the presence of EGF with a [~]3 nm gap between the inner membrane and cytoplasmic density. EGFR extracellular regions do not form regular arrays, suggesting that clustering is mediated by the intracellular region. Subtomogram averaging of the EGFR extracellular region (ECR) yielded a 15 [A] map into which the crystal structure of the ligand-bound EGFR ECR dimer fits well. These findings refine our understanding of EGFR activation, clustering, and signaling, and they establish EVs as a versatile platform for structural and functional characterization of human membrane proteins in a native-like environment.

Significance StatementAtomic or near-atomic resolution structural studies of proteins embedded in cell membranes have proven challenging. We show that transporting integral membrane proteins to cell-derived extracellular vesicles enables structural and functional studies of human membrane proteins in a native membrane environment. We have used this approach to visualize an active form of full-length Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and show that it forms clusters in the membrane and projects its cytoplasmic signaling domains [~]3 nm away from the membrane surface. EGFR is essential for normal development, but abnormal EGFR activity is associated with several human cancers and is the target of many anticancer therapies. Our studies refine current models of how ligand binding to EGFR transmits signals across cell membranes.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

However, the effective indexing and analysis of this vast amount of data pose significant challenges to the scientific community. K-mer indexing has proven crucial in managing extensive datasets across a wide range of applications, including alignment, compression, dataset comparison, error correction, assembly, and quantification. As a result, developing efficient and scalable k-mer indexing methods has become an increasingly important area of research. Despite the progress made, current state-of-the-art indexing structures are predominantly static, necessitating resource-intensive index reconstruction when integrating new data. Recently, the need for dynamic indexing structures has been recognized. However, many proposed solutions are only pseudo-dynamic, requiring substantial updates to justify the costs of adding new datasets. In practice, applications often rely on standard hash tables to associate data with their k-mers, leading to high k-mer encoding rates exceeding 64 bits per k-mer. In this work, we introduce Brisk, a drop-in replacement for most k-mer dictionary applications. This novel hashmap-like data structure provides exceptional throughput while significantly reducing memory usage compared to existing dynamic associative indexes, particularly for large k-mer sizes. Brisk achieves this by leveraging hierarchical minimizer indexing and memory-efficient super-k-mer representation. We also introduce novel techniques for efficiently probing k-mers within a set of super-k-mers and managing duplicated minimizers. We believe that the methodologies developed in this work represent a significant advancement in the creation of efficient and scalable k-mer dictionaries, greatly facilitating their routine use in genomic data analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

Yet research to date has not compared these patients with healthy controls with a history of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, making it difficult to understand why certain COVID patients develop post-COVID cognitive symptoms while others do not. The objective of this pilot study was to compare two groups of laboratory-confirmed post-COVID patients, with and without cognitive symptoms, on measures of cognitive and psychological functioning, self-reported perceptions of functional status and quality of life, and biomarkers of stress, inflammation, and neuroplasticity. Methods: Using a case-control design, 17 participants were recruited from a healthcare system in western Michigan, USA in 2022 through 2024. All participants were aged 25-65 and had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test confirming previous COVID-19 infection. Ten participants reported cognitive symptoms (long COVID group) while seven were fully recovered with no residual symptoms (controls). All participants underwent an interview on their self-rated health and quality of life, a battery of neurocognitive tests, and blood draw for biomarker analysis. Results: No group differences were detected for neuropsychological test measures except for letter fluency where the long COVID group scored significantly lower (p<.05).  The long COVID group had significantly lower ratings than controls on quality of life, physical health, emotional functioning, and psychological well-being. Serum levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), a biomarker of brain plasticity, were significantly lower in the long COVID group, which was significantly more likely than controls to have serum levels of inflammatory marker (interleukin (IL)-10) values greater than or equal to the median (p=0.015). Conclusion: Biomarker analyses suggest possible prolonged inflammatory processes in long COVID patients compared to fully recovered patients. Results of decreased neuroplastic functioning give credence to patients reports of post-COVID changes in brain function.","NA","medrxiv",1733090872241

By timely administering molecular regulators - such as transcription factors, RNAs, or small molecules - in a process that mimics in vivo embryonic development, stem cell differentiation can be guided toward a specific cell fate. A significant challenge in scaling up these therapies is that such differentiation strategies often result in mixed cellular populations. While synthetic biology approaches have been proposed to increase the yield of desired cell types, designing gene circuits that effectively redirect cell fate decisions requires mechanistic insight into the dynamics of endogenous regulatory networks that govern decision-making. In this work, we present a biomolecular adaptive controller based on an Incoherent Feedforward Loop (IFFL)-like topology designed to favor a specific cell fate. This controller requires minimal knowledge of the endogenous network as it exhibits adaptive, non-reference-based behavior. The synthetic circuit operates through a sequestration mechanism and a delay introduced by an intermediate species, producing an output that asymptotically approximates a discrete temporal derivative of its input, provided there is a sufficiently fast sequestration rate. By allowing the controller to actuate over a target species involved in the decision-making process, a tunable, synthetic bias is created that favors the production of the desired species with minimal alteration to the overall equilibrium landscape of the endogenous network. Through theoretical and computational analysis, we provide design guidelines for the controller's optimal operation, evaluate its performance under parametric perturbations, and extend its applicability to various examples of common multistable systems in biology.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

However, OrthoRep-based GOI evolution has almost always started from single GOI sequences, limiting the number of locations on a fitness landscape from where evolutionary search begins. Here, we present a simple approach for the high-efficiency integration of GOI libraries onto OrthoRep. By leveraging integrases, we demonstrate recombination of donor DNA onto the cytosolic p1 plasmid at exceptionally high transformation efficiencies, even surpassing the transformation efficiency of standard circular plasmids into yeast. We demonstrate our method's utility through the straightforward construction of mock nanobody libraries encoded on OrthoRep, from which rare binders were reliably enriched. Overall, integrase-assisted manipulation of yeast cytosolic plasmids should enhance the versatility of OrthoRep in continuous evolution experiments and support the routine construction of large GOI libraries in yeast in general.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

A higher prevalence of NMFIs occurred in females (45.8%) than males (42.8%), adults (aged [&ge;] 15 years, with 50.6%) compared to under-fives (42.6%) and school children (aged 5 -< 15 years, 34.3%), and in very low (71.5%) compared to high transmission areas (33.9%). NMFIs were significantly more likely in females than in males (aOR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.07-1.22), in very low transmission areas (aOR = 4.85, 95% CI = 4.42-5.33), adults (aOR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.46-1.75) and under-fives (aOR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.47-1.76). The findings show a high prevalence of NMFIs overall, and higher prevalence and odds of NMFIs in females, under-fives and individuals from low and very low transmission areas. These groups should be targeted with appropriate point-of-care tests and treatment strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1733090872241

While considerable attention has been paid to the encoding of noxious temperatures by thermoreceptors, it is far less clear how they encode innocuous cool and warm which are more commonly encountered in the environment. To address this, we sampled the entire thermoreceptor population using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia of awake and anesthetized mice. We found that the vast majority of thermoreceptors respond bidirectionally, with an enhanced response to cool and a suppressed response to warm. Using in vivo pharmacology and computational modelling, we demonstrate that conductance changes in the cool-sensitive TRPM8 channel are sufficient to explain this bidirectional response type. Our comprehensive dataset reveals the fundamental principles of the peripheral encoding of innocuous temperatures and suggests that the same population of thermoreceptors underlie the distinct sensations of cool and warm.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

Patients with PTSD often have high healthcare utilization rates, particularly for acute services. This study examines the association between medical cannabis treatment and healthcare utilization among patients with PTSD.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using cross-sectional data with tem-poral elements, derived from administrative records provided by Leafwell, among patients with PTSD. The cohort was defined based on medical cannabis use: the treated group included patients who had used medical cannabis for at least one year (returning for medical card renewal), while the untreated group consisted of cannabis-naive patients reporting no prior cannabis use. The primary outcomes were healthcare utilization within the past six months, including at least one urgent care visit, emergency department (ED) visit, or hospitalization related to their primary medical condition. We used inverse probability weighting with regression adjustment (IPWRA) to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of medical cannabis use on healthcare utilization, controlling for key demographics and health factors, including PTSD severity. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of our findings.

ResultsAmong the 1,946 participants, the treated group (n = 1,261) had significantly lower healthcare utilization rates compared to the untreated group (n = 685). Using the doubly robust IPWRA model, medical cannabis treatment was associated with a significant 35.6% reduction in urgent care visits (coefficient = -0.024, Standard Error (SE) = 0.0117) and a 35.1% reduction in ED visits (coefficient = -0.027, SE = 0.0124). Hospitalization rates were 26.3% lower among the treated group but did not reach statistical significance. Sensitivity analyses utilizing alternative ATE estimation strategies displayed consistent reductions in urgent care and ED visits among cannabis users, though hospitalizations remained non-significant. Adjusting the IPWRA models tolerance levels strengthened the found associations while maintaining strong covariate balance. Fewer than 2% of the treated group reported an adverse event.

DiscussionThese findings suggest that medical cannabis treatment among patients with PTSD may be associated with reduced utilization of urgent care and ED services. This relationship remains robust across multiple statistical models and sensitivity analyses, underscoring the potential role of medical cannabis in reducing acute healthcare needs in this population. Further longitudinal research is warranted to explore causality and assess its impact on hospitalization rates.","NA","medrxiv",1733090872241

This creates challenges for identifying causal relationships between neural populations and behavior. We developed a calcium imaging-based brain-machine interface (BMI) to study the role of posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in controlling navigation in virtual reality. By training a decoder to estimate navigational heading and velocity from PPC activity during virtual navigation, we discovered that mice could immediately navigate toward goal locations when control was switched to BMI. No learning or adaptation was observed during BMI, indicating that naturally occurring PPC activity patterns are sufficient to drive navigational trajectories in real time. During successful BMI trials, decoded trajectories decoupled from the mouse's physical movements, suggesting that PPC activity relates to intended trajectories. Our work demonstrates a role for PPC in navigation and offers a BMI approach for investigating causal links between neural activity and behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

Previous work focused mainly on Tibetans, establishing their genetic relatedness to East Asians and their genetic adaptation to high altitude, especially at EPAS1. Here, we present 87 new whole-genome sequences from 16 Himalayan populations and the insight they provide into the genomic history of the region. We show that population structure in the Himalayas began to emerge as early as 10,000 years ago, predating archaeological evidence of permanent habitation above 2,500 meters by approximately 6,000 years. The high prevalence of the introgressed adaptive EPAS1 haplotype in all high-altitude populations today supports a shared genetic origin and its importance for survival in this region. We also identify additional selection signals in genes associated with hypoxia, physical activity, immunity and metabolism which could have facilitated adaptation to the harsh environment. Over time, increasing genetic structure led to the diverse and strongly differentiated ethnic groups observed today, most of which maintained small population sizes throughout their history or experienced severe bottlenecks. Between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago, a few uniparental lineages became predominant, likely coinciding with the advent of agriculture, although significant population growth was not observed in the Himalayas except in the Tibetans. In more recent times, we detect bidirectional gene flow between high-altitude and lowland groups, occurring on both sides of the Himalayan range. The timing of this admixture aligns with the rise and expansion of historical regional powers, particularly during the Tibetan Empire and the northern Indian Gupta Empire. In the past few centuries, migrations to the Himalayas seem to have occurred alongside conflicts and population displacements in nearby regions and show some sex bias.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

Although some alternative coding TF isoforms have been experimentally studied, a genome-wide characterisation of all such isoforms in normal human physiology is still lacking. Here, we integrate RNA sequencing and protein domain data to reveal the expression levels, tissue specificity and putative functional classes of alternative coding isoforms of human TF genes. We found that isoforms lacking a DNA-binding domain (DBD) are annotated for almost a third of known TF genes, comprise 17% of all annotated TF isoforms and likely reverse the regulatory effects of DBD-containing isoforms. Considering all coding TF isoforms, we uncovered 536 switches between the highest-expressed alternative isoforms produced by 360 TF genes across 43 adult tissues. We predicted functional consequences of these switches using a functional annotation of structural domains present in switching isoforms. Furthermore, we found 45 isoform switches between the brain and non-brain tissues and interpreted six of these switches in detail. Finally, we assembled a literature-based compendium of human TF genes with experimentally studied alternative isoforms. In total, our results suggest that the switches of alternative coding TF isoforms between adult tissues represent a widespread, yet understudied, functional mechanism.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

To this end, we have developed a user-friendly graphical interface toolbox called NaDyNet (Naturalistic Dynamic Network Toolbox), which integrates existing dynamic brain network analysis methods and their enhanced versions. The main features of NaDyNet are: 1) extracting signals of interest from naturalistic fMRI signals; 2) incorporating six commonly used dynamic analysis methods and three static analysis methods; 3) enhanced versions of these dynamic methods by adopting inter-subject analysis to eliminate the effects of non-interest signals; 4) performing K-means clustering analysis to identify temporally reoccurring states along with their temporal and spatial attributes. We then introduced the rationale for incorporating inter-subject analysis to improve existing dynamic brain network analysis methods, and presented numerous examples. We also summarized research progress in comparing methodological efficacy, offered our recommendations for method selection in dynamic network analysis, and discussed the limitations of current approaches and directions for future research.

Immunopathological damage plays a role in driving pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiorgan failure in severe COVID-19. Therefore, dissecting the pulmonary immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to understand disease pathogenesis and identify immune pathways targetable by therapeutic intervention. Considering that the type 2 cytokine IL-13 enhances COVID-19 disease severity, therapeutic targeting of upstream signals that drive type 2 immunity may confer further protection. In this study, we investigate the role of the IL-33/ST2 signaling axis, a potent inducer of type 2 immunity in the lung, in a mouse model of COVID-19. Upon infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA10, ST2-/- mice had significantly improved weight loss and survival (69.2% vs 13.3% survival; P = 0.0005), as compared to wild-type mice. In a complementary pharmacologic approach, IL-33/ST2 signaling was inhibited using HpBARI_Hom2, a helminth derived protein that binds to mouse ST2 and blocks IL-33 signaling. In SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection, HpBARI_Hom2-treated mice had significantly improved weight loss and survival (60% vs 10% survival; P = 0.0035), as compared to inert control-treated mice. These data demonstrate that loss of IL-33/ST2 signaling confers protection during acute SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection, implicating the IL-33/ST2 signaling axis as an enhancer of COVID-19 disease severity. The protection conferred by pharmacologic blockade of IL-33/ST2 signaling was independent of viral control, as HpBARI_Hom2-treated mice had no reduction in viral titers. This finding suggests an immunopathogenic role for IL-33/ST2 signaling. One potential mechanism through which IL-33/ST2 signaling may drive severe disease is through enhancement of type 2 immune pathways including IL-5 production, as pulmonary IL-5 concentrations were found to depend on IL-33/ST2 signaling in acute SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

This genome was subsequently annotated and incorporated into multiple whole genome alignments in the Ensembl database. Our long-read assembly identified thousands of repeats and genes that were previously unassembled in the NMR and improved the results of routinely used short-read sequencing-based experiments such as RNA-seq, snRNA-seq, and ATAC-seq.

In cohort analysis, the hazard ratio (HR) in the second decile was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.85), with a difference in the standardized cumulative incidence at age 65 of 4.3 (3.8 to 4.8) percentage points, dropping to a HR of 0.38 (0.36 to 0.39; incidence difference 17.8 [17.3 to 18.3] percentage points) in the tenth decile. When comparing full siblings, and thus controlling for all unobserved behavioral, environmental, and genetic confounders that they share, the association replicated, although with attenuation in magnitude. The HR in the second decile was 0.89 (0.85 to 0.94; incidence difference 2.3 [1.3 to 3.3] percentage points), and in the tenth decile it was 0.53 (0.50 to 0.57; incidence difference 10.9 [9.7 to 12.1] percentage points). Hypothetically shifting everyone in the first decile of fitness to the second decile was estimated to prevent 7.2% (6.4 to 8.0) of cases at age 65 in cohort vs. 4.6% (2.6 to 6.5) in full-sibling analysis. The association was similar in those with overweight as in those without.

InterpretationHigher levels of adolescent cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with lower risk of T2D in late adulthood, with clinically relevant associations starting already from very low levels of fitness, and similarly in those with overweight compared to those without. The association replicates, but becomes weaker, after adjusting for unobserved familial confounders shared between full siblings. This suggests that adolescent cardiorespiratory fitness is a robust marker of long-term T2D risk, but that conventional observational analysis may yield biased estimates.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSType 2 diabetes is a growing public health issue, affecting at least half a billion people globally. Modifiable factors such as physical activity and the closely related trait cardiorespiratory fitness, which are inversely associated with type 2 diabetes, are declining, particularly among youth. Since these traits track from youth into adulthood, early-life interventions might have important implications for prevention. However, previous studies have typically focused on middle-aged individuals, leaving gaps in understanding whether fitness in youth is associated with type 2 diabetes in the long-term. Moreover, they have not been designed to adequately account for unobserved confounders. Triangulating the evidence across different methods, such as using sibling comparison analysis, would be important to obtain more accurate and reliable estimates of the causal relationship.

Added value of this studyIn this nationwide sibling-controlled cohort study encompassing more than 1 million young men, of which half a million were full siblings, higher levels of adolescent cardiorespiratory fitness were associated with a substantially lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes up to five decades later. The association was clinically relevant already from low levels of fitness, and it appeared similar in those with overweight as in those without overweight. While the association replicated after adjusting for unobserved familial confounders shared between full siblings, the magnitude of association attenuated by an amount that appeared clinically relevant. For example, the incidence differences between deciles of fitness were about 40% smaller in sibling-comparison analyses as compared to cohort analysis, and the preventable share of type 2 diabetes associated with hypothetical interventions shifting the population-level of fitness was reduced by about one-third.

Implications of all the available evidenceAdolescent cardiorespiratory fitness is a strong marker of long-term risk of type 2 diabetes, both in those with and without overweight. These findings render support to large-scale surveillance of fitness from a prevention perspective, and if the findings are confirmed using other lines of causal analysis, they may render support to interventions targeting fitness already from a young age. Yet, these findings also highlight the importance of triangulation for obtaining more reliable evidence of the magnitude of association, and shed light on the pitfalls of conventional observational analysis which may yield biased estimates.","NA","medrxiv",1733090872241

Although IGF-1 plays a key role in early hypertrophic responses in the single kidney state, its impact on KTx outcomes remains uncertain. This report tests the hypothesis that early IGF-1 exposure reduces KTx survival. Methods: Population datasets compared incident Death Censored Graft Failure (DCGF) rates by age at KTx (n=366,404) with IGF-1 levels by age (n=15,014). A clinical study of 216 KTx recipients evaluated the association of IGF-1 exposure with DCGF and secondary outcomes of proteinuria and Biopsy-Proven Acute Rejection. IGF-1 exposure was modeled using pre-KTx IGF-1 levels and donor kidney dose estimated from the donor:recipient body surface area ratio reflecting allograft hyperfiltration. The association of DCGF with an IGF1 SNP linked to high IGF-1 levels was assessed in 724 genotyped allograft recipients. Single-cell transcriptomic data from first-year post-KTx patients (n=14) and binephric donors (n=18) were compared to assess intrarenal cellular expression of IGF1, IGF1R, and GHR transcripts. Results: DCGF risk by age at KTx paralleled IGF-1 levels by age. Higher IGF-1 exposure was associated with significantly increased risks of DCGF, proteinuria and T-Cell mediated rejection. Genotypic analysis showed a 50% increase in DCGF risk per risk allele at IGF1 eQTL rs35767. First-year biopsy results revealed no increase in intrarenal IGF1 transcript, while GHR and IGF- 1R transcripts were suppressed, consistent with circulating IGF-1 (vs. graft-derived IGF-1) being the primary source of IGF-1 exposure. Conclusion: We identify a novel role for the GH-IGF-1 axis in reducing KTx survival.","NA","medrxiv",1733090872241

Given the success of deep learning methods in a wide range of fields, a timely question concerns whether these methods could be leveraged to improve the efficiency of MD simulations. To investigate this possibility, we introduce Molecular Dynamics Language Models (MDLMs), to enable the generation of MD trajectories. In the present implementation, an MDLM is trained on a short classical MD trajectory of a protein, where structural accuracy is maintained through kernel density estimations derived from extensive MD datasets. We illustrate the application of this MDLM in the case of the determination of the free energy landscape a small protein, showing that this approach makes it possible to discover conformational states undersampled in the training data. These results provide initial evidence for the use of language models for the efficient implementation of molecular dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

This study explores how geographic latitude, sunshine duration, and vitamin D status were associated with the incidence and fatality rates of COVID-19 across 187 countries during the crucial early months of the outbreak. Data on the total number of COVID-19 cases by country were obtained from the United Nations database as of June 30, 2020. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to determine the associations between COVID-19 cases and latitude, average hours of sunshine from January to June, and mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels. The average COVID-19 prevalence and mortality per million population were 2,087 and 69, respectively, with a case fatality rate of 3.19%. COVID-19 case fatality rate was positively associated with latitude ({beta} = 0.030; 95% CI: 0.008, 0.052) and negatively associated with hours of sunshine ({beta} = -1.51; 95% CI: -4.44, 1.41) and 25(OH)D levels ({beta} = -0.054; 95% CI: -0.089, -0.019) in adjusted regression analyses. Findings were similar for COVID-19 prevalence and mortality rate. These findings indicate that higher latitude and lower 25(OH)D levels was associated with increased COVID-19 severity and mortality. While the data highlight potential links between vitamin D status and COVID-19 outcomes, causality cannot be inferred. Further research, including large-scale, well-controlled trials, is essential to determine whether vitamin D plays a definitive role in COVID-19 prevention and management.","NA","medrxiv",1733090872241

However, the roles of the specific pre-synaptic inputs to the LHA in driving stress and resultant physiological effects are yet to be fully understood. Here, taking advantage of mouse viral genetics, rabies tracing, optogenetics, chemogenetics, and fiber photometry, we show that the excitatory projections from the RVM to LHA drive stress-induced anxiety. This is a surprising finding since, traditionally, RVM has been studied in the context of opioidergic pain modulation through its inhibitory projections to the spinal cord. We find that the LHA neurons receiving inputs from the RVM, when activated, do not alter the nociceptive thresholds yet are sufficient to drive anxiety-like behaviors. These LHA neurons are recruited by acute restraint, which is known to cause stress. On the other hand, the LHA-projecting RVM neurons are responsive to both noxious thermal stimuli and acute restraint, promoting stress-induced anxiety, yet with no effect on pain thresholds. Together, we found an ascending neural pathway between RVM and LHA that mediates stress-induced anxiety.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

Unlike the structure of an enzyme which is directly impacted by its sequence, substrate specificity as an enzyme attribute involves a rather indirect relationship with sequence as it also depends on structural aspects that dictate substrate accessibility and active site dynamics. In this study, we explore the performance of classifier-based machine learning models trained on curated sequence and structural data for a class of glycosyltransferases (GTs), namely GT-Bs, to understand their substrate specificity determining factors. GTs enable the transfer of sugar moieties to other biomolecules such as oligosaccharides or proteins and are found in all kingdoms of life. In plants, GTs participate in the biosynthesis of plant cell wall biopolymers (eg: hemicelluloses and pectins) and are an integral part of the enzymatic machinery that enables the storage of carbon and energy as plant biomass. To elucidate the substrate specificity of uncharacterized GT-Bs, we constructed multi-label machine learning models (Support Vector Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive-Bayes, Random Forest) that incorporate both sequence and structural features. These models achieve good predictive accuracies on test datasets. However, despite our use of structural information, we highlight that there is further scope for improvement in training these models to draw interpretable relationships between sequence, structure and substrate specificity determining motifs in GT-Bs.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

When delivered via implantable osmotic pumps, this immunogen primed immune responses against the FP, which were then boosted with heterologous trimers resulting in a focused immune response targeting the conserved FP epitope. Although autologous immunizations did not elicit high affinity FP-targeting antibodies, the conserved FP epitope on a heterologous trimer further matured the lower affinity, FP-targeting B cells.

The National Schistosomiasis and Soil-Transmitted Helminthiasis Control Program distributes praziquantel annually for schistosomiasis control. The main objective of this study was to describe the shellfish cooking habits among school children and the impact of praziquantel mass distribution on schistosomiasis burden in the most endemic focus in Cameroon. Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional descriptive study from November 2013 to March 2014. Pupils of five government primary schools in 5 villages around Kumba underwent both parasitological and clinical investigations in search of signs and symptoms of paragonimiasis. Chi square and fisher exact tests were used to compared proportions. p-values<0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: We recruited 175 children, 96 females and 79 males with a sex ratio of 0.86. They ranged in age from 05 to 15 years, with a mean age of 10 years. The age group 6-10 years was the most represented. All participants reported eating crabs. The prevalence of paragonimiasis was 0.57% (95%CI: 0.0143%; 3.143%) among the school children. This result was statistically inferior to that of the last study conducted ten years ago using the same diagnostic method in this area (12.3%). Slightly more than half of the students (58.9%) reported that they prepared their crabs by boiling, and two-thirds (69%) estimated the cooking time to be more than 30 minutes. More than two-thirds (78%) of the children who estimated the cooking time to be more than 30 minutes consumed shrimp with their family, a statistically significant proportion. Pulmonary symptoms were the most common. Cough was the most common. In addition, we did not register any case of hemoptysis. Cases of coinfection were also found in the population studied. Conclusions: The prevalence of paragonimiasis has decreased in this focus, known to be the most endemic for this disease in Cameroon. This is due to the large distribution of praziquantel in this area and probably to changes from unhealthy cooking habits to healthier ones.","NA","medrxiv",1733090872241

Under heat stress, global transcription and translation are inhibited, while the expression of chaperone proteins are preferentially favored. As the direct link between mRNA transcription and protein translation, tRNA expression is intricately regulated during the stress response. Despite extensive research into the heat shock response (HSR), the regulation of tRNA expression by RNA Polymerase III (Pol III) transcription has yet to be fully elucidated in mammalian cells. Here, we examine the regulation of Pol III transcription during different stages of heat shock stress in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We observe that Pol III transcription is downregulated after 30 minutes of heat shock, followed by an overall increase in transcription after 60 minutes of heat shock. This effect is more evident in tRNAs, though other Pol III gene targets are also similarly affected. Notably, we show that the downregulation at 30 minutes of heat shock is independent of HSF1, the master transcription factor of the HSR, but that the subsequent increase in expression at 60 minutes requires HSF1. Taken together, these results demonstrate an adaptive RNA Pol III response to heat stress, and an intricate relationship between the canonical HSR and tRNA expression.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

Pooled perturbation assays applied to cellular models, probing the effect of many perturbations coupled with an scRNA-seq readout (Perturb-seq), are especially potent references for interpreting disease-linked mutations or gene expression changes. However, the utility of existing maps has been limited by the comprehensiveness of perturbations possible, and the relevance of their cell line context. Here, we present the first genome-scale CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) perturbation map with single-cell RNA sequencing readout across many human genetic backgrounds in human pluripotent cells. To do so, we establish large-scale CRISPRi screening in human induced pluripotent stem cells from healthy donors, using over 20,000 guide RNAs to target 7,226 genes across 34 cell lines from 26 genetic backgrounds, and gather expression data from nearly 2 million cells. We comprehensively map trans expression changes induced by the target knockdowns, which complement co-expression patterns in unperturbed cells and facilitate the functional annotation of target genes to biological processes and complexes. Consistency of targeting protein complex members point to protein complexes as a nexus for aggregating transcriptional variation, revealing novel interaction partners. We characterise variation in perturbation effects across donors, with expression quantitative trait loci linked to higher genetic modulation of perturbation effects but overall low replication of trans effects due to knockdown of their corresponding cis regulators. This study pioneers population-scale CRISPR perturbations with single cell readouts that will fuel foundation models for the future of effective modulation of cellular disease phenotypes.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

Here, we investigated whether dolphins exhibit similar future-oriented encoding of information known to be needed in the future. Dolphins were trained to remember specific, randomly assigned actions for later re-enactment, with either immediate or delayed recall. When an unexpected delay was introduced in trials anticipating immediate recall, memory was retained for only 13 seconds, suggesting working memory encoding. However, when instructed to expect delayed recall, dolphins accurately reproduced actions after delays even after 16 hours. These results suggest that dolphins, anticipating future need, intentionally encode actions to be performed in the future into long-term memory, implying prospective encoding and prospective memory capacities. Their memory also displayed key features of episodic memory: encoding occurred in a single episode, and memory was declarative, as the action itself declared its content. Moreover, dolphins more effectively recalled self-performed actions compared to gestural codifications of the same actions, mirroring the human-typical ""enactment effect"" and supporting episodic-like memory over semantic memory. Our findings indicate that dolphins show awareness of future memory demands and seem to use a future-oriented, episodic-like memory system, capable of storing prospectively encoded, intended actions in long-term memory.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

While many tools generate standardized output, advanced programming skills are necessary to create high-quality visualizations. Therefore, user-friendly tools that simplify this crucial yet time-consuming step are essential. We developed EasyPubPlot (Easy Publishable Plotting), a straightforward, easy-to-use, user experience-oriented, open-source, and shiny web application along with its associated R package to streamline data exploration and visualization for functional omics-empowered research. EasyPubPlot generates publishable scores plots, volcano plots, heatmaps, box plots, dot plots, and bubble plots with minimal necessary steps. The tool was designed to guide new users for accurate and efficient navigation. Step-by-step tutorials for each type of plot are also provided. Herein, we demonstrated EasyPubPlots competent functionality and versatility by showcasing metabolomics and transcriptomics data. Collectively, EasyPubPlot reduces the gap between data analysis and stunning visualization, thereby diminishing friction and focusing on science. The app can be downloaded and installed locally (https://github.com/Pharmaco-OmicsLab/EasyPubPlot) or used through a web application (https://pharmaco-omicslab.shinyapps.io/EasyPubPlot).","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241

Autonomous flower cooling could help to alleviate exposure of pollen and ovules to harmful temperatures, yet investigations on the thermal ecology of flowers in hot environments are still needed to evaluate the frequency, magnitude and ecological significance of floral thermoregulatory cooling. This paper reports a study on the thermal ecology of flower heads (=capitula) of 15 species of summer-blooming Asteraceae, tribe Cardueae, from hot-dry habitats in the southern Iberian Peninsula. Temperature inside (Tin) and outside (Tout) capitula were assessed under natural field conditions by two complementary sampling and measurement procedures, which provided information on the relationships between the two temperatures at the levels of individual capitula (""continuous recording"") and local plant populations (""instantaneous measurements""). Baselines for the Tin-Tout relationship in absence of physiological activity were obtained by exposing dehydrated capitula to variable ambient temperatures. To assess whether the co-flowering capitula of summer-blooming Asteraceae collectively defined a distinct thermal layer, the vertical distribution of capitula relative to the ground was quantified. Bees visiting capitula were watched and the temperature of the air beside the visited capitulum was measured. Capitula of all species were exposed to high ambient temperatures during long periods, yet their interior was cooler than the air for most of the time, with temperature differentials ({Delta}T=Tin-Tout) quite often approaching, and sometimes exceeding -10{degrees}C. The relationship between Tin and Tout was best described by a composite of steep and shallow linear relationships separated by a breakpoint ({Psi}, interspecific range=25{degrees}C-35{degrees}C). Capitula were weakly or not thermoregulated for Tout<{Psi}, but switched to intense, thermoregulated cooling when Tout>{Psi}. Narrow vertical distribution of capitula above ground and similar cooling responses by all species produced a refrigerated floral layer where most bees foraged at Tout>{Psi} and presumably visited cooled capitula. Thermoregulatory cooling of capitula can benefit plant reproduction by reducing pollen and ovule exposure to high temperature, but also the populations of insect mutualists and antagonists through habitat improvement via a refrigerated flower layer.

Distinct protein pools, parental and nascent MCMs, and their precise equilibrium are essential to sustain error-free DNA replication1. However, the mechanism responsible for generating these pools and maintaining their equilibrium remains largely unexplored. Here, we identified CRL4DCAF12 as a new factor controlling the assembly of nascent MCM complexes. During MCM biogenesis, MCMBP facilitates the assembly and transport of newly synthesized MCM3-7 subcomplexes into the nucleus2,3. Once in the nucleus, the MCM2 subunit must be incorporated into the MCM3-7 subcomplex, while MCMBP needs to be removed. CRL4DCAF12 facilitates the degradation of MCMBP and thereby regulates the assembly of MCM2-7 complexes. The absence of CRL4DCAF12 adversely affects the level of chromatin-bound nascent MCMs, resulting in accelerated replication forks and genome instability. Collectively, our findings uncovered the molecular mechanism underlying nascent MCM production essential to counteract genome instability and tumor formation.","NA","biorxiv",1733090872241
