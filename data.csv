In contrast, using within-family variation in DNA sharing is robust to most confounding factors including shared environmental effects and population stratification. Yet, accurate estimates for most traits are not available using this design, and none for non-European ancestry populations. Here, we analyse approximately 500,000 sibling pairs with diverse ancestries and obtain robust and precise heritability estimates for 14 phenotypes, including two well-studied model traits (height and BMI), five behavioural phenotypes and two common diseases. We find substantial heritability for smoking initiation (0.34, standard error (s.e.) 0.05), alcohol consumption (0.18, s.e. 0.04), number of children (0.27, s.e. 0.11) and personality (""talk versus listen"", 0.48, s.e. 0.13). In addition, we estimated large heritability for two common diseases, type 2 diabetes (T2D: 0.43, s.e. 0.06) and asthma (0.34, s.e. 0.06), whose risk factors include behavioural traits. Overall, we show concordant estimates across ancestry groups and highlight a significant contribution of shared environmental effects for behaviour and T2D risk, which may have inflated between-family estimates. Altogether, our results demonstrate that substantial genetic variation underlies complex traits, common disease and exposures, that estimates are concordant across ancestries and that they are larger than has been accounted for by GWAS to date.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758406098685

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we show that L-type pyocins bind a surface-exposed region of BamA and deploy a C-terminal peptide that competitively inhibits the BAM complex, demonstrating that cell entry is not required for antibiotic activity. We combine genetics, multi-omics and cryo-electron tomography to show that BAM complex inhibition by L-type pyocins or the peptide antibiotic darobactin triggers a multifaceted transcriptomic, proteomic and morphological response. Despite this, BAM inhibition ultimately leads to a catastrophic loss of membrane integrity and cell death.

Whether chromatin assembly on newly replicated strands is also asymmetric remains unknown, as visualizing this short-lived state in cells is impossible. To circumvent this limitation, we combine in vitro reconstitution of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA and chromatin replication machineries with replication-aware single-molecule chromatin footprinting, to study how chromatin is re-assembled on replicated DNA. Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid. These pathways have implications for essential chromatin-templated processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and gene silencing at replication forks.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""851564;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04jsz6e67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Vidi.233.038;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2-HG012442;""},{""name"":""W.

However, the robustness of this control strategy across the wide genetic diversity of DENV remains unknown. Here, we systematically tested two commonly used Wolbachia strains (wAlbB and wMelM) for their ability to inhibit 60 genetically diverse DENV isolates spanning all four serotypes. We found stronger inhibition by wMelM (median relative dissemination: 0.04) than wAlbB (median relative dissemination: 0.19). Furthermore, while we found substantial heterogeneity in inhibition across DENV isolates, we found that more DENV-3 isolates were weakly inhibited (median relative dissemination: 0.47 for wAlbB and 0.39 for wMelM) compared to the other serotypes (median relative disseminations: 0.10-0.18 for wAlbB and 0-0.11 for wMelM). Using transmission dynamic models, we further showed that differential Wolbachia inhibition results in increased probability of reemergence, particularly in high transmission intensity settings, with strong selection for DENV strains that have higher relative dissemination in mosquitoes. Our work highlights the importance of considering DENV genetic diversity, including the long-term risk of selection, in Wolbachia-based control interventions.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

Although ""correlation does not imply causation"" has become a cliche, leveraging correlations effectively--and understanding their inferential pitfalls--remains a nuanced challenge. Correlation-based analyses are typically not able to yield causal conclusions, yet they are frequently used to underpin causal narratives in neuroscience research and especially in clinical contexts, which represent a problematic case of overinterpretation. Using causal inference reasoning, simulations and analytic methods, we address three critical questions when performing resting-state fMRI: (1) How reliable are correlation estimates for capturing cross-regional synchrony? (2) What are the consequences of inaccuracies in estimated correlations? (3) To what extent do estimated correlations reflect causal neural interactions? We identify two principal pitfalls. First, correlation estimates are systematically distorted by diverse noise sources, including variability in neurovascular coupling, which can generate spurious, suppressed, or even reversed effects. Second, graph-based approaches lack causal interpretability, meaning that even large samples and strong statistical evidence may obscure fundamental ambiguities in what the correlations represent. In light of these challenges, we advocate for three priorities: (1) cautious interpretation that avoids causal overreach, (2) multimodal validation to cross-check findings against independent measures, and (3) enhanced methodological rigor, particularly in biomarker discovery and clinical trials, to ensure that resting-state fMRI provides meaningful insights.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ZICMH002888;ZIAMH002783;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

The worldwide pest Drosophila suzukii, which oviposits in ripe rather than overripe fruits, provides a powerful model to study these mechanisms and their behavioral consequences. Here, we show that this shift is linked to functional remodeling in four olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs): ab2B, ab3A, ab4B, and ab10A. While ab3A and ab10A exhibit tuning changes shared with the non-pest relative D. biarmipes, ab2B and ab4B display species-specific adaptations in D. suzukii. These changes result not only from receptor sequence divergence but also from novel innovations: receptor co-expression in ab3A and partitioned expression of Or67a paralogs in ab2B and ab10A.

Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits.

To this end, large-scale CRISPR screens have been conducted to perturb thousands of candidate enhancers. Using these data, predictive models have been developed that aim to generalize such findings to predict which enhancers regulate which genes across the genome. However, existing CRISPR methods and large-scale datasets have limitations in power, scale, or selection bias, with the potential to skew our understanding of the properties of distal regulatory elements and confound our ability to evaluate predictive models. Here, we develop a new framework for highly powered, unbiased CRISPR screens, including an optimized experimental method (Direct-Capture Targeted Perturb-seq (DC-TAP-seq)), a random design strategy, and a comprehensive analytical pipeline that accounts for statistical power. We applied this framework to survey 1,425 randomly selected candidate regulatory elements across two human cell lines. Our results reveal fundamental properties of distal regulatory elements in the human genome. Most element-gene regulatory interactions are estimated to have small effect sizes (<10%), which previous experiments were not powered to detect. Most cis-regulatory interactions occur over short genomic distances (<100 kb). A large fraction of the discovered regulatory elements bind CTCF but do not show chromatin marks typical of classical enhancers. Housekeeping genes have similar frequencies of distal regulatory elements compared to other genes, but with 2-fold weaker effect sizes. Comparisons to the predictions of the ENCODE-rE2G model suggest that, while performance is similar across two cell types, new models will be needed to detect elements with weaker effect sizes, regulatory effects of CTCF sites, and enhancers for housekeeping genes. Overall, this study describes the first unbiased, perturbation-based survey of thousands of distal regulatory element-gene connections, and provides a framework for expanding such efforts to build more complete maps of distal regulation in the human genome.","[{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Genomic Mechanisms of Disease"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF21SA0072102;""},{""name"":""NHGRI Impact of Genomic Variation on Consortium"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UM1HG011972;""},{""name"":""NHLBI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HL159176;""},{""name"":""NHGRI Genomic Innovator Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35HG011324;""},{""name"":""NSF Graduate Research Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DGE-1656518;""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG011664;""},{""name"":""AHA Postdoctoral Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""821920 and 23POSTCHF1019753;""},{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DMS-2113072 and NSF DMS-2310654.;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

Understanding the evolutionary history of virulence elements requires genomes sampled in commensalism in healthy hosts, as genomes from bacterial infections are biased towards higher pathogenicity. Here, using a rare collection of human commensal Escherichia coli sampled in France from 1980 to 2020, we inferred the evolutionary history of the High Pathogenicity Island (HPI), a key virulence factor of E. coli with an uncertain evolutionary origin. We showed that the HPI was horizontally transferred from Yersinia pestis to E. coli and other Enterobacterales approximatively 4,800 years ago, coinciding with a period of high prevalence of the plague in the Neolithic.

WGD is sensed indirectly due to the presence of extra centrosomes, which activate the PIDDosome to induce a p53-dependent G1-arrest. Here we uncouple WGD from centrosome amplification and show that p53 still arrests tetraploid cells, but via the mitotic stopwatch; a p53/53BP1/USP28-dependent pathway that causes G1-arrest following an extended mitotic delay. Mitotic timing is unaffected by WGD, but the threshold mitotic delay needed to invoke a G1-arrest is reduced. This sensitivity to the stopwatch mechanism is not associated with altered levels of mitotic stopwatch components, but instead, is associated with enhanced p21 concentrations prior to mitosis. Similar effects are observed in diploid cells treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors to double their size, implicating G1 delays and cell size as key determinants of stopwatch sensitivity. This ability of the mitotic stopwatch to arrest proliferation after increases to genome or cell size has important implications for the progression and treatment of cancer. It also demonstrates that the stopwatch pathway can sense more than just mitotic delays.","[{""name"":""Cancer Research UK"",""id"":""https://ror.org/054225q67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""C4730/A21229;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""222494/Z/21/Z;""},{""name"":""Tenovus Scotland"",""id"":""https://ror.org/037866t57"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T22-23;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) represent a promising solution to enhance risk stratification in intermediate-risk groups by identifying individuals with high genetic risk; however, observed differences in performance across ancestry groups may cause health disparities. The emerging field of algorithmic fairness offers a principled framework to assess equity in model performance among relevant subgroups, but have rarely been applied to clinical risk tools and PRS. Objectives: To evaluate the fairness of incorporating PRS in CVD risk prediction, both as a standalone risk factor and as a risk-enhancing factor for individuals at intermediate risk (recommended in current clinical consensus statements). Methods: Using data from the UK Biobank (N = 327,923), we calculated 10-year CVD risk using QRISK3 (a guideline-endorsed prediction model) and quantified genetic risk using a validated PRS. We assessed fairness among population characteristics relevant for health equity (age, sex, ethnicity, and area-level deprivation) using four algorithmic fairness metrics relevant for prevention (accuracy equality, equal opportunity, conditional use accuracy equality, and treatment equality). Results: PRS, when used as a stand-alone risk factor, demonstrated fairness levels similar to or better than traditional clinical predictors (age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol). Some variation in fairness was observed across ethnic groups, especially at extreme risk thresholds. When integrated as a risk-enhancing factor for reclassifying intermediate-risk individuals into high-risk categories, PRS improved sensitivity of CVD risk prediction with minimal impact on fairness metrics across demographic groups. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that PRS, when incorporated into existing risk prediction frameworks, are unlikely to meaningfully exacerbate disparities in CVD risk stratification. Applying algorithmic fairness metrics provides insight into the equitable implementation of PRS and supports current recommendations for their use in risk-stratification for intermediate-risk individuals.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758406098685

Unexpectedly, cells are extremely sensitive to RPB1 dosage, with a mere 30% reduction sufficient to perturb cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and global transcription. Importantly, alterations in RPB1 abundance trigger hierarchical gene expression changes that are highly organized rather than stochastic. Using a combination of sequencing and proteomic approaches, we uncover the existence of multiple feedback loops between transcriptional initiation, promotor-proximal pause release, transcript elongation, splicing, and mRNA half-life, which together establish RNAPII abundance as a crucial systems-level regulator of transcriptional homeostasis.","[{""name"":""Danish National Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00znyv691"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DNRF166;""},{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04txyc737"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF19OC0055875;""},{""name"":""The Francis Crick Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04tnbqb63"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FC001166;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

Nucleosome remodeling complexes hydrolyze ATP to translocate DNA and thereby mobilize histone proteins. While nucleosome remodeling complexes have been extensively studied for their roles in regulating nucleosome positioning and accessibility, their contributions to higher-order chromatin architecture remain less well understood. Here, we investigate the roles of two key nucleosome remodelers, esBAF and INO80C, in shaping 3D genome organization in mouse embryonic stem cells. Using Hi-C, we find that loss of either remodeler has minimal effects on global compartment or TAD structures. In contrast, subcompartment organization is notably altered, suggesting that esBAF and INO80C contribute to finer-scale chromatin topology. To overcome the limited resolution of Hi-C for detecting regulatory loops, we employed promoter capture Micro-C (PCMC), which revealed that the loss of esBAF or INO80C alters a subset of promoter anchored looping interactions. Although these changes occur at distinct genomic loci for each remodeler, the affected sites are commonly enriched for bivalent chromatin regions bound by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG (OSN), as well as BRG1 and INO80 themselves. Together, our findings reveal that esBAF and INO80C selectively influence subcompartment identity and enhancer-promoter communication at key regulatory loci, highlighting a previously underappreciated role for nucleosome remodelers in higher-order chromatin organization.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 GM133732;HD072122;HG003143;DK107980;HG011536;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

While mechanobiology has primarily focused on factors such as cell-generated contractility and mechanical properties of extracellular matrix (ECM), a novel mechanobiological paradigm highlights the role of osmotic and mechanical pressures in shaping epithelial tissues. In our study, we developed an in vitro model of cell coated micro-sized hydrogel spheres (MHSs) which allows to decipher the interplay between cellular activities and tissue mechanics. Drastic, isotropic MHS compressions were observed once the epithelia reached confluence. Further studies revealed that the compression was a process independent of cell contractility but rather regulated by active transepithelial fluid flow. Compressive stresses of about 7 kPa are generated by such an active hydraulic mechanism. Tissue homeostasis is then maintained by a fine balance between cell proliferation and extrusion. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of fluid transport in generating mechanical forces within epithelial tissues. Supported by a theoretical mechano-hydraulic model, a mechanistic framework for understanding the intricate interplay between cellular processes and tissue mechanics was established. These results challenge traditional views of epithelial tissue mechanics, emphasizing the pivotal influence of osmotic and mechanical pressures in shaping tissues. We anticipate that this study will advance the understanding of epithelial tissue development, the maintenance of homeostasis, and the mechanisms underlying pathological conditions.

Significance StatementEpithelial tissues are vital for many bodily functions, but their mechanics remain poorly understood. Our study uncovers a novel mechanism by which epithelial cells generate mechanical stress, not through traditional cell contractility, but by actively pumping ions and water across their membranes. Using a model of micro-sized hydrogel spheres (MHSs) coated with epithelial cells, we demonstrate that epithelial cells actively transport fluid across the tissue to compress the MHSs. This facilitates the establishment of tissue homeostasis, which is further maintained by a balanced cell proliferation and extrusion rate. Supported by a theoretical model, our findings highlight the overlooked role of fluid transport in tissue mechanics, offering new insights into how epithelial tissues develop, maintain stability, and respond to disease.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Adv-101019835;""},{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0071;DFG-ANR-22-CE92-0048;ANR-10-INBS-04;""},{""name"":""Institut National Du Cancer"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03m8vkq32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INCa_16712;INCa_18429;""},{""name"":""Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012kf4317"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Alexander von Humboldt Professorship;""},{""name"":""La Ligue Contre le Cancer"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rkrv905"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Equipe labellisee 2029;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

To address this gap, we developed GFP-based recombination reporter assays to study the formation of L1 retrotransposition-mediated rearrangements. Using these reporters combined with long-read sequencing approaches, we find that L1 retrotransposition intermediates can recombine with distal DNA breaks to generate chromosomal rearrangements. We also find that two distinct L1 insertion intermediates can recombine with each other to generate chromosomal rearrangements. Both types of rearrangements depend on L1-encoded ORF2p endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities. Using these reporters, we discover that L1 retrotransposition-mediated rearrangements are robustly induced when the recombining sequences share homology and that their formation requires the homologous recombination factor BRCA1. Given the repetitive nature of our genome, these findings highlight the risk of L1 insertion intermediates becoming substrates for aberrant recombination and promoting genome instability.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01CA240816;R01CA276112;R01CA289390;""},{""name"":""American Cancer Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02e463172"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""C.-T.L. is supported by an American Cancer Society Postdoctoral Fellowship Award;""},{""name"":""Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04yhme281"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""C.M.-D. is a fellow of The Jane Coffin Childs Fund for Medical Research;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3NS132127;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility.

Whether individuals with comorbidities experience a greater functional impact of long COVID is unknown. We evaluated the functional impact of long COVID among healthcare workers (HCWs) with chronic cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, obesity, or a history of depression, and compared it with that of HCWs without comorbidities. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in Quebec, Canada. We compared self-reported long COVID cases to COVID-19-infected controls without long COVID on work ability, work functioning, health-related absenteeism, dyspnea-associated impairment, and psychological distress. We used inverse probability of exposure and robust Poisson regressions to estimate adjusted prevalence differences (aPD) and prevalence ratios. Comorbidity data were obtained from the Quebec integrated chronic disease surveillance system. Results: A total of 3,754 and 8,439 HCWs with and without comorbidities, respectively, were included.

Leveraging the large sample, we also addressed a longstanding debate about whether model-based knowledge is incorporated into reward prediction errors or if such signals are purely model-free. Surprisingly, ventral striatum prediction error activity was better explained by model-based computations, while a middle caudate error signal was more aligned with model-free learning. Moreover, individuals lacking both model-based behavior and model-based neural signals exhibited impaired state prediction errors, suggesting a difficulty in building or updating their internal model of the environment. These findings indicate that model-free signals are ubiquitous across individuals, even in those not behaviorally relying on model-free strategies, while model-based representations appear only in those individuals utilizing such a strategy at the behavioral level, the absence of which may depend in part on underlying difficulties in forming accurate model-based predictions.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01MH121089;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

While mechanistic investigations have uncovered many facets of GATA1 biology, how GATA1 co-regulates divergent cell fates remains only partially characterized. We previously described that loss of Stag2, a member of the cohesin complex and a recurrent mutational target in myelodysplastic syndrome and Down Syndrome associated acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, results in altered chromatin accessibility, transcription factor function, and cell differentiation. Hence, we hypothesized that chromatin accessibility facilitates lineage specificity of GATA1, thereby permitting efficient cellular differentiation. To understand the connection between chromatin accessibility and GATA1, we performed comprehensive studies of erythropoiesis in Stag2{triangleup} mice. Defects in Stag2-deficient hematopoiesis included reduced numbers of erythroid progenitors (EryPs), impaired terminal erythroid maturation, increased number of MkPs, and increased megakaryocytes. RNA- and ATAC-sequencing of EryPs revealed altered patterns of Gata1 target gene expression with altered accessibility in conjunction with loss of expression of erythroid targets and gain of megakaryocyte targets. Gata1 occupancy was lost at erythroid targets, while occupancy increased at megakaryocyte targets. Functionally, we observed that Stag2-deficient EryPs have diminished erythroid output and augmented megakaryocyte output in orthogonal differentiation assays. Human models and primary MDS patients recapitulated the essential phenotypic and molecular features of our in vivo murine MDS model. Collectively, this study advances the understanding of the interplay between TF function and chromatin accessibility. Moreover, these data suggest a novel conceptual paradigm of dyserythropoiesis in MDS.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R37CA28657;P30CA012696;""},{""name"":""American Society of Hematology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02nw48b86"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""HONORS Award;Scholar Award;""},{""name"":""American Society of Clinical Investigation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PSSF Fellowship;""},{""name"":""Edward P.

These sensors share the key mechanism of editing a stop codon opposite a specific sequence motif in the target transcript, where this motif requirement is dictated by ADAR's strong sequence preference. This constrains sensor design and precludes the sensing of short sequences that lack such motifs, often essential for key applications such as sensing viral RNAs and differentiating splice isoforms. Here we address this limitation with modular RNA sensors using adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (""modulADAR""). ModulADAR features two key elements that mirror the modularity of ADARs: regions that hybridize with the target transcript to recruit ADAR's dsRNA-binding domains, and a stem-loop for stop-codon editing by ADAR's catalytic domain. We optimize modulADAR and apply it to detect short subsequences that cannot be sensed by prior-generation sensors. We anticipate that modulADAR will empower broader basic science and therapeutic applications, especially those that will uniquely benefit from programmable RNA detection in living cells.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R21EB033858;DP2EB035891;R01AI173189;""},{""name"":""Longevity Impetus Grants"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Stanford Cancer Institute innovative award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Stanford Bio-X Interdisciplinary Initiatives seed grant program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R11-6;""},{""name"":""Wu Tsai Neuroscience Institute seed grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Stanford ChEM-H CBI training program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EDGE Doctoral Fellowship Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Stanford Bio-X Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

Hrp1 binds (UA)n repeats found in both mRNA 3'-UTRs and short noncoding RNA terminators, but its function in 3'-end formation is not fully understood. Our past microarray transcriptome analysis of the heat-sensitive hrp1-7 allele suggested Hrp1 functions in antitermination of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) on protein-coding genes. The hrp1-7 allele has four substitutions and one, M191T, was shown to be primarily responsible for NNS terminator readthrough. Here we show that Hrp1-7 protein has a four-fold and Hrp1-M191T a two-fold decreased affinity for (UA)5 in vitro. We used nanopore direct RNA sequencing to assess the transcriptome-wide effects of hrp1-7 and hrp1-M191T, which identified new examples of Hrp1-dependent small nucleolar RNA terminators and mRNA attenuators (regulatory terminators in the 5'-UTR and ORF). For some genes, including HRP1, attenuated transcript reads outnumber the corresponding mRNA reads in exponentially growing wild-type cells. We also observed widespread changes in mRNA polyA site selection. In the hrp1-M191T strain the polyA site shifts are mostly downstream, while in the hrp1-7 strain upstream and downstream shifts are more similar in frequency. Our results are consistent with a model in which some of the four substitutions in hrp1-7 weaken the affinity of Hrp1 for the RNAP II elongation complex, while others interfere with its recognition of specific sequences in nascent transcripts that would normally promote its release from the elongation complex.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 GM118075;S10 RR13790;""},{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BIR-9512577;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

As access to human cortical tissue is sparse, cerebral organoids (COs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells have emerged as a promising in vitro model for studying the human cortex. Astrocyte subtypes unique to humans are recapitulated in COs but have not been quantitatively assessed (1, 2). In this study, we characterized human astrocytes in situ in sliced COs cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI-COs). By 4 months of age, ALI-COs express many mature astrocyte markers and showed increasing levels of GFAP with longer culture durations. By employing immunostaining, tissue clearing, morphological reconstruction, and unsupervised clustering analysis, three major GFAP+ astrocyte subtypes were identified in ALI-COs. All subtypes exhibited greater morphological complexity than their mouse counterparts, as revealed by increased branching and longer branch extensions. However, consistent with the mid-gestation fetal stage of the ALI-COs, astrocytes did not fully recapitulate the complexity observed in adult human astrocytes, which are known to continue maturation postnatally.","[{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGPIN-2015-043;""},{""name"":""Brain Canada Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01bcmwk98"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

This heterogeneity is reflected by differential gene expression activity at various spatial location. Spatial transcriptomics technologies record genome-wide measurements of gene expression at the scale of entire tissues with high spatial resolution. While they have revolutionized our quantitative understanding of tissue architecture, these technologies generate large and high dimensional datasets encompassing tens of thousands of genes recorded at tens of thousands of spatial locations, requiring efficient automated methods for their analysis. In this study we introduce joint spatial PCA (jsPCA), a novel, fast, scalable and interpretable method for the automatic identification of spatial domains and variable genes in multi-slice and multi-sample spatial transcriptomics data. jsPCA relies on a simple mathematical formulation of a spatial covariance defined as the product of the gene expression covariance with the spatial autocorrelation. The principal components of this spatial covariance yield a biologically meaningful low-dimensional representation. From this representation, we can derive spatial domains by simple clustering. In addition, spatially variable genes can be identified directly from the principal components coefficients. Moreover, this approach enables the joint representation of multiple slices and samples, a frequent experimental setting. This joint representation is obtained without spatial alignment by computing common principal components via joint diagonalization of the set of spatial covariance matrices obtained for each slice. By leveraging sparsity and non-convex optimization on manifold, jsPCA leads to computing time in the order of seconds to minutes, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art approaches. We benchmarked jsPCA on the Visium 10x dataset of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the Stereo-seq MOSTA dataset of mouse embryonic development against 10 state-of-the-art methods. Our approach demonstrated excellent performances, comparable or better than state-of-the-art methods, such as SpatialPCA, BASS, GraphPCA or Stagate, while being much faster, interpretable, and scalable to very large datasets.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-CPJ12022-VILLOUTREIX-U125;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

A major challenge during outbreaks is not only detecting antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), but also unmasking their pathogen hosts and genomic context, as ARGs alone do not fully capture AMR risk. Pathogen identification is often essential for guiding effective treatment. While culture-based methods remain the diagnostic gold standard, they are slow and sometimes impractical. Faster metagenomic (mNGS) tools typically detect either ARGs, taxonomy, or genomic context, but rarely all three, resulting in fragmented surveillance. Existing k-mer classifiers like Kraken2 and CLARK, designed for general taxonomy, often perform poorly on AMR-specific sequences. We introduce CARD k-mers, the first tool built to jointly predict species-level taxonomy and genomic context (plasmid vs. chromosome) for ARGs in short metagenomic reads. Integrated with the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD), CARD k-mers enables rapid, context-aware assignment of ARGs to their likely pathogen and genomic element origin. In benchmarking with 103,456 in-silico pathogen-specific AMR alleles, CARD k-mers outperformed Kraken2 and CLARK by 10.85% and 15.2%, respectively, and correctly classified the genomic context of 4,590 chromosome- and 176 plasmid-specific ARGs. The tool operates at speeds exceeding 675,000 metagenomic reads per minute.

It has been shown to improve for example simulations of unstructured biomolecules such as RNA tetranucleotides or intrinsically disordered proteins. However, the performance for folded RNA structures was not specifically explored. In this study, we present a benchmark of the OPC water model on three different RNAs with highly intricate tertiary structures - the ribosomal L1 stalk RNA-protein protuberance, the mini tetraloop-tetraloop receptor (miniTTR-6) folded RNA, and the GAAA tetraloop-tetraloop receptor homodimer. We compare the OPC performance against SPC/E, TIP3P, OPC3, and TIP4P-EW along with the common OL3 AMBER RNA force field (FF). We found substantial effect of the water model on simulation behavior. For all three systems, we observe large-scale unfolding of the RNA, and even loss of the L1 stalk protein-RNA interface, when simulated with the OPC. In contrast, the simulations are entirely stable with the three-point water models. The underlying cause seems to be the higher affinity of the OPC waters to H-bond donor and acceptor groups of the RNA, disrupting the native solute-solute interactions. An identical issue can be observed also for the similar and widely used TIP4PD water model combined with the DES-Amber RNA FF. Our findings suggest that caution is warranted when using the four-point OPC and TIP4PD water models for simulations of structured RNAs.

Using double-serial retrocuing (DSR) with simultaneous EEG recording, we investigated how single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) to right intraparietal sulcus impacts neural representations of unprioritized memory items (UMI), relative to irrelevant memory items (IMI) that are no longer needed for the trial. Twelve human participants (8 female) performed DSR plus a single-retrocue task, while spTMS was delivered during delay periods. Multivariate pattern analysis revealed that spTMS restored decodability of the UMI concurrent with stimulation, and that of the IMI several timesteps later, after the evoked effects of spTMS were no longer present in the EEG signal. This effect was carried by the alpha and low-beta frequency bands. Analyses of the EEG showed two effects selective to the UMI: both the retrocue designating the UMI and spTMS produced phase shifts in the low-beta band. These results were mirrored by representational geometry analyses, which revealed larger cue-related and spTMS-related rotations of the UMI-representing subspace, compared to the prioritized subspace spTMS. These findings demonstrate that deprioritization involves active neural mechanisms distinct from the processing of the IMI, and that these are supported by low-beta oscillatory dynamics in parietal cortex.

We sequenced 92 genomes from clinical Enterobacterales isolates, collected in England under a national surveillance program, with long-read Nanopore (R10.4.1, Dorado v5.0.0 super-high-accuracy basecalled) and short-read Illumina (NovaSeq) sequencing approaches. Genomes were assembled using three long-read only (Flye; Hybracter long; Autocycler), and three hybrid assemblers (Hybracter hybrid; Unicycler normal; bold). Three polishing modalities (Medaka v2 with subsampled or un-subsampled long-reads; Polypolish + Pypolca with short-reads) were investigated. Autocycler circularised the most chromosomes (87/92 [95%]). Plasmid sequence reconstruction was comparable between all assemblers except Flye, all recovering 90-96% of plasmids, although the 'ground truth' was uncertain. Flye performed worse than other assemblers on almost all metrics. Autocycler + Medaka (un-subsampled long-reads) was the most accurate long-read only assembler/polisher combination, comparable to hybrid assemblies (median 0 [IQR:0-0] SNPs and 0 [IQR:0-1] indels per genome; quality value/Q score, 100 [IQR: 64-100]), with only 4/92 genome sequences having >10 SNPs/indels. Medaka polishing with un-subsampled long-reads resulted in small improvements in indels but not SNPs for both Flye and Autocycler assemblies. Seven-locus MLST, antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and stress gene annotation was equivalent across assembler/polisher combinations. Nanopore long-read only bacterial genome assembly with Autocycler combined with Medaka polishing (using un-subsampled reads) is similarly accurate and possibly more complete than hybrid assemblies, representing a viable alternative for incorporating high-quality genomic data, including plasmids, into Enterobacterales surveillance.","[{""name"":""National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR207397;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mating-type switching is a central feature of the life cycle that enables homothallism, i.e., mating between mitotic descendants of the same haploid cell. Yet heterothallic isolates that have lost this ability are found across diverse niches, indicating that this trait is polymorphic. Here we experimentally characterized loss of mating-type switching in a representative panel of strains. Analysis of 117 telomere- to-telomere genome assemblies revealed multiple independent loss-of-function mutations in the Ho endonuclease gene and structural variants in the silent HML and HMR cassettes, the three loci essential for switching. We estimated that at least 13 independent transitions from homothallism to heterothallism have occurred in the species history. Analysis of the HO genotype of 2,915 strains show that at least 27% are heterothallic. We found that heterothallism is strongly associated with polyploidy and elevated genome-wide heterozygosity, although the strength of these associations varies between populations. Heterothallic isolates are most prevalent in domesticated and clinical clades, consistent with an origin linked to human-associated environments. However, they are also found, though less frequently, in natural niches. Signatures of recombination in HO sequences suggest that outcrossing contributed to the ecological and geographical distribution of the trait. Our findings reveal that mating-type switching has undergone repeated losses in S. cerevisiae evolution, with major consequences for genome architecture and ecological diversification.

Significance StatementMating-type switching evolved multiple times in yeasts, enabling haploid selfing, which became a key feature of their life cycles. We show that this trait has been lost repeatedly in the history of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, producing heterothallic isolates that cannot switch mating type. Analysis of thousands of genomes reveals that these losses involve multiple mutations in the Ho endonuclease and structural changes in the silent mating-type cassettes. Heterothallism is associated with polyploidy and increased genome-wide heterozygosity. It is more frequent in domesticated and clinical lineages, but also occurs in natural ecological niches. Our findings illustrate how repeated changes in a single life-history trait can reshape genome architecture and highlight the dynamic interplay between genetics, environment, and evolution in a model eukaryote.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE12-0020;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

In this study we aimed to discover genetic mechanisms underlying fibromyalgia. We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of fibromyalgia in subjects of European (EUR), African (AFR) and Latin American (AMR) ancestries, combining data from several samples (total N, 85,139 cases; 1,642,433 controls). We also conducted a multi-trait analysis of GWAS (MTAG), leveraging pain summary statistics to achieve enhanced power for fibromyalgia analyses. We then applied a series of post-GWAS methods to analyze the genetic association between fibromyalgia and a variety of psychological and physiological phenotypes. We found 10 genome-wide significant (GWS) loci associated with fibromyalgia in EUR, 1 in AFR, 12 cross-ancestry, and 45 in the EUR MTAG. Most of these loci were previously associated with pain, cognitive function, autoimmune response, or general health measures like BMI and blood pressure. Genetic correlation analysis revealed a moderate negative correlation with physical activity, and strong genetic correlations with chronic pain, PTSD and depression (rg [&ge;] 0.69). Genomic structural equation modeling helped to place fibromyalgia in the context of a set of psychiatric, medical, and lifestyle traits. Additional findings regarding local genetic correlations and genetic causality point to genetic mechanisms that provide a strong basis for some of the main characteristics of fibromyalgia and its comorbidities. These findings provide potential targets for future studies to improve diagnosis and treatment of fibromyalgia.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758406098685

Understanding genomic adaptations during antimicrobial therapy in patients infected with this pathogen is crucial for preventing therapeutic failure. Here we investigated the population diversity and evolution of P. aeruginosa collected longitudinally from six patients who evolved MDR infections. Serial P. aeruginosa clinical isolates (n=63) and culture-enriched metagenomic populations (n=39) were collected and subjected to whole-genome sequencing. The resulting data were used to characterize and compare the species composition, multi-locus sequence types (STs), and resistance-associated mutations present within each sample type. Single-isolate sequencing showed that each patient was infected with a single P. aeruginosa strain that accumulated mutations and became increasingly antibiotic-resistant over time. Mutations in genes associated with {beta}-lactam resistance, including ampC, ftsI, and oprD, arose over time and corresponded with changes in antimicrobial susceptibility in single isolates. Species profiling of culture-enriched metagenomic populations revealed that all samples contained P. aeruginosa, but several also contained additional Gram-negative pathogens. Metagenomic analysis of culture-enriched populations identified resistance-associated mutations at variable frequencies, many of which were not identified in single isolates from the same sample. In some cases, resistance-associated mutations initially detected at low frequency rose to fixation after antimicrobial treatment. Overall, this study shows that population-based metagenomic sequencing effectively captures within-patient genomic diversity of P. aeruginosa during antimicrobial therapy, and could aid in the detection and interpretation of resistance-associated mutations in this pathogen.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

Quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa is a model to study cooperative behaviors in populations. Several studies of cooperation have been conducted using strain PAO1. Wildtype PAO1 harbors a mutation in mexS, which encodes a negative regulator of the transcription factor MexT, which in turn activates many genes, including the efflux pump MexEF-OprN. We hypothesized that the PAO1 mexS mutation might affect cooperative behaviors. When P. aeruginosa is passaged daily on casein as a sole carbon source, quorum sensing is required to induce synthesis of the extracellular proteases needed to acquire carbon and energy. During growth on casein, individuals with inactivating mutations in the quorum sensing regulator LasR are reproducibly enriched in the population. These LasR mutants are cheaters that benefit from cooperatively-produced proteases and have a fitness advantage over cooperators. We passaged wildtype PAO1, PAO1 with a gene-corrected version of mexS, or PAO1 with a null mutation of mexT on casein as the sole carbon and energy source. We found that correcting the mexS mutation resulted in unstable cooperation: bacterial cultures failed to propagate after about 15 days, whereas the wildtype propagated for the duration of our 30-day experiment. The MexS-corrected and MexT-deficient populations also reproducibly exhibited emergence of a particular quorum sensing variant, LasR-V226I. This variant activated a subset of quorum-sensing regulated genes, suggesting an evolutionary pathway to alter P. aeruginosa quorum sensing regulons.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 GM152107;R35 GM136218;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/043z4tv69"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 AI177575;""},{""name"":""Cystic Fibrosis Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00ax59295"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""KOSTYL20G0;""},{""name"":""Gilead Sciences (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/056546b03"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""A161091;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

Although several neural mechanisms have been proposed to support this capacity, it is not yet clear how the brain makes such predictions. A compelling hypothesis is that the brain pre-activates a sensory template of a predictable stimulus before it appears. In a recent study, Demarchi et al. had participants listen to sequences of sounds with different levels of predictability. For some sequences, participants could anticipate the next sound (in regular sequences), for others not (in random sequences). Using magnetoencephalography recordings and machine-learning methods to decode sounds from brain signals, Demarchi et al. concluded that auditory predictions pre-activate tone-specific neural templates before the sound onset. In our reanalysis of their data, we demonstrate that their results can be fully explained by a bias induced by the structure of the sequences: because the most likely stimulus also happens to be physically close to the previous one, spurious higher-than-chance decoding performance arises before the sound onset. We provide general criteria to assess whether a study is affected by this confound and requires a reexamination.

Solid-state PCFs were constructed by entrapping Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (efe mutant, strain S5), specifically engineered for ethylene biosynthesis, within TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TCNF) matrices. Two distinct formulations were tested: (i) Ca2+-PVA-TCNF, in which TCNF was crosslinked with Ca2+ and polyvinyl alcohol to produce hydrogel films approximately 200m thick; and (ii) an all-polysaccharide-based Ca2+-MLG-TCNF formulation, in which TCNF was crosslinked with Ca2+ and mixed-linkage glucan. The latter films were fabricated using an osmotic dehydration approach, yielding mechanically robust, fully biodegradable structures with a thickness of approximately 2mm. The integration of engineered cells with TCNF matrices created a biocatalytic system that improved the distribution of light, nutrients, and substrates to the cells, while facilitating ethylene separation, thereby supporting the fitness of immobilized cells and enhancing their metabolic performance. Using a custom-designed photobiofilm reactor optimized for semi-wet cultivation, the solid-state PCFs sustained ethylene production for over four months, representing the longest reported continuous ethylene production by cyanobacteria to date. Notably, the solid-state PCFs achieved up to a twofold increase in ethylene yield compared to the continuous-flow suspension culture. Importantly, the suspension-based system also represented the first demonstration of four-month ethylene production under continuous-flow operation. In addition, biodegradability assessments confirmed the environmental compatibility of the TCNF-based matrices, with the all-polysaccharide formulation being particularly advantageous due to its exclusively nature-based composition. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of solid-state PCFs as a scalable and sustainable platform for photosynthetic ethylene production.","[{""name"":""EU FET Open Project &#34;FuturoLEAF&#34;"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""899576;""},{""name"":""Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03vxy9y38"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

However, it remains unclear how the nutrients released during cell lysis affect the growth dynamics of the remaining bacterial population. Addressing this gap, we built a controlled system consisting of two Escherichia coli lysogenic strains: one carrying a wild-type {lambda} prophage and the other a temperature-inducible variant that can be induced to lyse at 38 {degrees}C. Using this system, we selectively induced phage lysis in a defined fraction of the population and quantified both total biomass and the biomass of surviving, non-lysed cells. We observed that the biomass loss was consistently smaller than expected based on the fraction of lysed cells, supporting the idea that some of the released biomass is rapidly recycled by the non-lysed population. To formalize the observed dynamics and obtain quantitative insight, we developed a mathematical model showing that nutrients released during lysis can transiently enhance the growth rate of the surviving, non-lysed cells. This effect emerges on a short timescale of minutes, consistent with the rapid onset of biomass compensation observed experimentally. The growth rate increase was confirmed in single-cell experiments using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, where we cultured wild-type lysogens in lysate-containing culture supernatants. In summary, the results suggest that nutrients released through lysis are rapidly consumed, leading to an acceleration in the growth rate of non-lysed cells. The consequent partial compensation for cell loss can substantially influence the population dynamics, highlighting phage lysis as a direct modulator of bacterial growth. Overall, our findings provide quantitative insights into how phage-mediated lysis affects the physiology of non-lysed bacterial cells, extending beyond its well-established role in biomass recycling.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""180575;225148;188642;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

These findings highlight the critical role of PIEZO channels in mechanotransduction during parturition and suggest therapeutic targets for labor dysfunction.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 NS105067;R01AT012051;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-2405-20;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CMMI-2135428;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2DK128800;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

Some members of this family have antiviral activity. Here, we report the bioinformatics-based stereochemical assignment, antiviral properties, and mechanism of action of the unusual type II spirotetronate MM 46115 (renamed pellemicin). We show that pellemicin is active against both influenza A and B viruses at non-toxic concentrations, and inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is required for virus internalisation.

LP.8.1 was designated a Variant Under Monitoring by the WHO in January 2025 due to its potential to displace prior circulating variants. Informed by early growth modeling and antigenic analysis, we selected LP.8.1 as a candidate strain for the 2025-2026 vaccine season. Here, we describe the development of updated LP.8.1-matched mRNA vaccine compositions encoding either the full-length spike protein for mRNA-1273 (monovalent) or the membrane-anchored receptor-binding and N-terminal domains for the mRNA-1283 vaccine. Initial in vitro characterization, including structural analysis, demonstrated robust antigen expression and intact antigenic features. Immunogenicity of both vaccines were evaluated in murine models following immunization as either a primary series in naive animals or as a booster dose. LP.8.1-matched vaccines elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses against the homologous LP.8.1 strain and more recently emerging JN.1-lineage subvariants, including XFG and NB.1.8.1.

However, this knowledge is fragmented across resources and often is not directly accessible for analytical methods. We developed OmniPath (https://omnipathdb.org/), a database combining diverse molecular knowledge from 168 resources. It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

The anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus broadcasts the head-direction (HD) signal, which is generated in the brainstem, particularly in the upstream lateral mammillary nucleus, and thalamic HD cells remain coordinated even during sleep. Here, by recording and manipulating neuronal activity along the mammillary-thalamic-cortical pathway, we show that coherence among thalamic HD cells persists even when their upstream inputs are decorrelated, particularly during non-Rapid Eye Movement sleep. These findings suggest that thalamic circuits are sufficient to generate and maintain coherent population dynamics in the absence of structured input.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

Primary sensory cortices receive topographically segregated information from first-order thalamic nuclei, which process distinct sensory modalities. In contrast, higher-order cortical regions integrate information from multiple information channels. While such hierarchical processing and integration of information is the foundation for neural computations in the mammalian cortex, the fundamental principles of thalamocortical computations in non-mammalian vertebrates remains unexplored. The zebrafish pallium, located in the dorsal telencephalon, is regarded as the homolog of the mammalian cortex. However, it remains unclear how the zebrafish pallium receives and processes sensory information, and how the architecture and function of these processes compare to the thalamocortical circuits in other vertebrates. Using anatomical tracing, electrophysiological circuit mapping, and in vivo Ca2+ imaging, we revealed a thalamocortical-like pathway in the zebrafish brain. We found that the preglomerular nucleus (PG) is the primary source of visual and mechano-vibrational information to the zebrafish pallium. We demonstrated that PG neurons and their pallial projections exhibit sensory-specific and topographically organized responses. In contrast, the sensory responses of pallial neurons display multiple layers of topographically organized hierarchies, ranging from simple sensory-specific responses to multimodal and coincidence-detecting nonlinear responses. Notably, we observed a progressive increase in the complexity of sensory computations, which is organized topographically along the posterior-anterior axis of the zebrafish pallium. Collectively, our results suggest that hierarchical sensory processing across topographically organized pallial regions is a conserved functional feature of the vertebrate pallium.","[{""name"":""JSPS KAKENHI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JP24K02008;""},{""name"":""European Horizon Marie-Curie individual postdoctoral fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101066743;""},{""name"":""NFR FRIPRO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""239973;314212;""},{""name"":""RCN Centres of Excellence scheme"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""332640;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

Using this approach, we screened over 1,750 opsins from a range of families. We discovered that the F240A mutation of the light-gated potassium channel WiChR abolished potassium selectivity, turning it into a sensitive excitatory channel that we dubbed ""WAChR"". We systematically mutated WAChR and identified variants that expand the frontier of speed-sensitivity tradeoffs. Multiple WAChR variants produced large inward currents in response to indoor ambient office light, and responded to irradiances as low as 15 nW/mm2, something that we did not observe with other ultra-sensitive opsins. In vivo recording from the mouse cortex confirmed that WAChRs exhibit enhanced sensitivity in neurons.

While molecular screening of ChRs requires high-cost experiments, recent machine-learning-based protein functionality prediction enables more efficient selection of target proteins for characterization. Here, we constructed an elastic-net machine-learning model trained on 1,163 experimental data to predict the maximum absorption wavelength ({lambda}max) of uncharacterized ChRs.

Due to its unique position in the phylogenetic tree and distinctive spectral properties, it serves as an important model for elucidating rhodopsin evolution and for engineering optogenetic tools with enhanced performance, but its structure and function remain poorly understood. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of ChR024 in detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs at resolutions of 3.22 and 2.45 [A], respectively. The structures reveal an architecture strikingly similar to that of ion-pumping rhodopsins, even more so than other pump-like channelrhodopsins such as ChRmine. Structural, theoretical, and spectroscopic analyses uncover a unique color-tuning mechanism, in which charged residues close and distant from the retinal chromophore cooperatively modulate the pKa of the Schiff base counterion and thereby determine the absorption maximum wavelength. Finally, comparative structural analysis of channel- and pump-type rhodopsins, combined with electrophysiology, provides insights into the molecular boundary between these two functional classes and demonstrates the conversion of an outward proton pump into a light-gated channel. Together, these findings illuminate diverse mechanisms of color tuning and functional specification within the rhodopsin family, paving the way for the rational engineering of next-generation optogenetic tools.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

Although limited zoonotic cases have resulted from the current epizootic outbreak, the wide diversity of influenza viruses in avian hosts means the emergence of new strains that could transmit to humans more readily cannot be ruled out. There is therefore a need to anticipate zoonotic potential before spillover occurs.

Here, we develop a novel zoonotic prediction model for avian influenza viruses, building upon ""host-predictor"" machine learning methods that estimate host potential given only a viral genome sequence. We construct a machine learning framework combining individual sub-models of influenza genome segments, each trained on many genomic and proteomic traits (e.g., k-mer composition, codon biases, protein physicochemistry).

To prevent over-fitting to heavily sampled lineages and ensure models generalise to phylogenetically distant viruses, we pre-process training data by considering clusters of shared sequence identity. Curated training sets cover [~]4,000 representative, complete genome sequences of avian influenza from 120 subtypes including 9 containing known zoonotic viruses.

We combine best-performing models into a single ensemble that can distinguish zoonotic capability of sequences held out from training with strong performance (AUROC = 0.95, F1 score = 0.90), including sequences of rarely-sampled subtypes, e.g., H10N8. Interrogating ensemble model decisions also allows us to identify influential genomic motifs most associated with human infection.

These findings suggest specific genomic traits that are key to understanding and monitoring evolution of influenza viruses that circulate within bird populations. Our ensemble model can estimate zoonotic potential for new sequence inputs, offering a means to quickly risk-assess emerging avian influenza strains as soon as a sequence becomes available.","[{""name"":""Seqirus (United Kingdom)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022 ‚Äì 2027 Framework Research Collaboration Agreement Influenza Research Partnership collaboration plan 002;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

VirScan revealed unique viral exposure histories for each individual. At the antibody level, we observed strong protein-level immunodominance, with viral surface proteins consistently recognized across individuals, but striking variability at the epitope level, even within immunodominant proteins. At the functional level, differential protein expression analysis showed that prior infection with HSV-1, HSV-2, or norovirus was associated with elevated production of CCL4, MCP-2, and TNF, respectively, following TLR7/8 stimulation, indicating virus-specific imprints on innate immune responses. Together, these findings suggest that both chronic and acute viral infections are major drivers of immune variation and can leave lasting signatures on innate function. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of broad viral serology with systems-level innate profiling to investigate how lifetime exposures shape human immune variability.

In most organisms, cilia form dense arrays of thousands of filaments that coordinate their motion into persistent, temporally synchronized patterns known as metachronal waves. Despite their ubiquity, the dynamics of these patterns and their role in tuning propulsion remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate how metachronal coordination shapes the navigation of Didinium nasutum, a highly agile unicellular predator with two circumferential ciliary bands. Using high-speed imaging of freely swimming cells, we capture and quantify the dynamics of metachronal wave coordination and track their evolution across different swimming states and transitions. Combining these measurements with a hydrodynamic model, we uncover how dynamic changes in coordination directly regulate propulsion and maneuverability. We show that stable metachronal waves support persistent directed swimming, local inhomogeneities in coordination give rise to curved trajectories, and global wave reversals accommodate rapid evasion-like reorientations. Our findings reveal that transitions between coordination modes allow Didinium to access a diverse swimming repertoire, highlighting dynamic ciliary patterning as a key mechanism to encode complex microscale navigation strategies. More broadly, they provide mechanistic insights into how metachronal coordination shapes fluid flows generated by dense ciliary arrays found in unicellular protists and airway epithelia alike, ultimately influencing swimming and transport in biological systems.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Project Grant 315230_215678;""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UPenn MRSEC DMR- 2309043;""},{""name"":""Charles E.

This protein complex generates a depolarizing sodium leak in various tissues and contributes to respiratory and circadian rhythms, locomotion, and sleep. De novo and inherited variants of NALCN can lead to severe developmental syndromes called  contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay (CLIFAHDD) and  infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 1 (IHPRF1), respectively. Although variants of uncertain significance (VUS) or presumed pathogenic variants have been studied in heterologous expression systems before, there is no generally accepted framework on how to assess or predict variant pathogenicity. We set out use the functional and computational characterization of 19 VUS detected in CLIFAHDD and IHPRF1 patients to establish a robust analysis to classify suspected disease-causing variants. Specifically, we employ a combination of multiple parameters derived from two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology recordings and predicted protein stability and conservation scores. We show that this approach is capable of distinguishing benign common variants from both gain- and loss-of-function (GoF/LoF) variants. Additionally, our work provides mechanistic insight into the molecular mechanism underlying specific variants and provides insight into the unusual propensity of NALCN missense variants to result in GoF phenotypes. We anticipate that this experimental and computational framework will aid assessment of variant pathogenicity of NALCN and other components of the channelosome in the future.","[{""name"":""Carlsberg Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01kpjmx04"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CF16-0504;""},{""name"":""Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05svhj534"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""7025-00097A;""},{""name"":""Lundbeck Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03hz8wd80"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R252-2017-1671; SAP;R272-2017-4528; AS;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

SPNs from the direct and indirect pathways exhibited high orientation selectivity in the absence of behavioral contingencies. SPNs population activity reliably predicted different visual features.

While this bias is thought to reflect a right-hemisphere dominance when allocating spatial attention, the contribution of subcortical structures remains poorly understood. Although lesion and neuroimaging studies in clinical populations have implicated asymmetries in the basal ganglia and thalamus to dysfunction in spatial attention, it remains unclear whether naturally occurring subcortical asymmetries in healthy individuals predict behavioural biases in spatial attention. In this study, we investigated whether volumetric asymmetries in subcortical structures are associated with biases in spatial attention in a non-clinical population. This was achieved by using the landmark task to assess spatial biases, alongside acquiring T1-weighted MRI data from 44 healthy participants. The subcortical regions were segmented using the FIRST algorithm to estimate the volumetric asymmetry of specific regions. We found that variability in pseudoneglect was predicted by the degree of leftward lateralisation of putamen volume, indicating that the putamen contributes to the magnitude of spatial attention biases. This also suggests that the left putamen may support right-hemisphere neocortical dominance through the indirect pathway. These findings bridge anatomical and behavioural measures, highlighting the functional relevance of subcortical asymmetry in shaping attentional processes in the healthy brain.

Although these datasets contain rich information on drug resistance, they are both complex and multivariate, with each isolates susceptibility measured across several antibiotics. Current analytical methods for these datasets overwhelmingly focus on genotypes, while tools to study multivariate resistance phenotypes-the direct targets of selection and clinical intervention-remain severely limited. To address this gap, we develop ""Antimicrobial Resistance Cartography"", a set of methods for interpreting high-dimensional drug resistance in large isolate collections. As a proof-of-concept, we analysed 3,628 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from the Active Bacterial Core (ABC) surveillance program, each with MICs measured for six beta-lactam antibiotics. We demonstrate how this toolkit simplifies visualisation of antibiotic resistance data across multiple drugs, resolves common issues such as missing or censored values, and identifies genetic mutations driving correlated resistance changes across multiple antibiotics. We characterise penicillin-binding protein (PBP) substitutions that increase minimum inhibitory concentration to multiple beta-lactam subclasses, revealing subtle differences in their correlated phenotypic effects, and identifying potential constraints on resistance evolution across genetic backgrounds. AMR cartography therefore provides a versatile framework for quantifying and visualising correlated resistance across antibiotics, enhancing the interpretability of complex susceptibility data for both research and public health.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

During subsequent fMRI, participants predicted multiple steps into the future in both the newly connected sequence and control sequences that remained separate. The hippocampus integrated representations of the connected sequence, such that activity patterns became more similar across trials for the connected sequence vs. the unconnected sequences. These integrated sequence representations in the hippocampus emerged soon after learning, incorporated representations of the initial sequences as well as new activity patterns not previously present in either sequence, and predicted participants ability to update their predictions in behavior.

Median inbreeding coefficient and cumulative runs of homozygosity (ROHs) lengths were increased due to extensive consanguinity, were largest in the groups with Arabian main ancestry components, and were higher than reported for Qatar. Families were identified based on genetic relatedness and classified into 264 families with unrelated parents and 247 families with third- and fourth-degree consanguineous parents. Representative consanguineous pedigrees of families in EGP were outlined. Cumulative ROHs were affected by the main ancestry component and significantly increased in offspring of consanguineous parents, with a pronounced difference between 3rd and 4th-degree relatedness. Investigation of cumulative AFs of variants causing Mendelian diseases highlighted genes related to alpha- and beta-thalassemia (HBB, HBA2) and showed a high burden of variants causing severe recessive diseases, metabolic and retinal disorders, and hearing loss. In summary, EGP represents a landmark effort in characterizing the genetic diversity of the Emirati population, leveraging the largest Middle Eastern cohort reported to date.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758406098685

YprA family helicases are central to widespread defense systems DISARM, Dpd, and Druantia. Here, through comprehensive phylogenetic and structural prediction analysis of the YprA family, we identify several major, previously unrecognized clades, with unique signatures of domain architecture and associations with other genes. Each YprA family clade defines a distinct class of defense systems, which we denote ARMADA (disARM-related Antiviral Defense Array), BRIGADE (Base hypermodification and Restriction Involving Genes encoding ARMADA-like and Dpd-like Effectors), or TALON (TOTE-like and ARMADA-Like Operon with Nuclease). In addition to the YprA-like helicase, ARMADA systems share two more proteins with DISARM. However, ARMADA YprA homologs are most similar to those of Druantia, suggesting ARMADA is a  missing link connecting DISARM and Druantia. We show experimentally that ARMADA protects bacteria against a broad range of phages via a direct, non-abortive mechanism. We also discovered multiple families of satellite phage-like mobile genetic elements that often carry both ARMADA and Druantia Type III systems and show that these can provide synergistic resistance against diverse phages.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

This study examined how episodic memories formed in development are stabilized and whether early-life experiences influence the neural mechanisms involved. Using fMRI and multivariate analyses, we tracked neural reinstatement of newly learned item-location-context associations in youth (N = 49; agemean = 11.68 years). Hippocampus and visual cortex activity during encoding predicted later memory success. Crucially, spontaneous reinstatement in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during post-encoding rest also predicted memory. In a second sample (N = 32, agemean = 12.86 years) with early adversity, differential recruitment of the precuneus and visual cortex during encoding, and angular gyrus during reinstatement, was observed. These findings suggest that hippocampus and mPFC contribute to developmental memory stabilization in ways consistent with mature function, while differences in memory accessibility across developmental experiences arise from broader network adaptations.","[{""name"":""New York State Psychiatric Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04aqjf708"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1F32HD114417;""},{""name"":""Brain & Behavior Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03a63f080"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NARSAD Young Investigator Grant (24739);""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

In a pre-registered fMRI experiment, 12 humans (12 scanner-hours each) performed a visual WM task with varying memory load (0-4 items). We replicated a localized, load-dependent increase in univariate BOLD activity in parietal cortex. However, we also observed both systematic increases and decreases in univariate activity with load across the visual hierarchy. Importantly, multivariate activation patterns encoded WM load regardless of the direction of the univariate effect, arguing against a restricted locus of load signals in parietal cortex. Finally, we observed representational drift in activity patterns encoding memory load across scanning sessions. Our results suggest a distributed code for memory load that may be continually refined over time to support more efficient information storage.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EY025872;MH087214;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2104630;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

We developed highly efficient, in vivo RNA electroporation-based single-cell gene editing to investigate neuronal responses to loss of fast inhibition. Using CRISPR-Cas9 components delivered as RNA, we knocked out GABA-A receptor {beta} subunits in individual layer 2/3 cortical neurons in mouse visual cortex, eliminating fast inhibition. In vivo patch-clamp recordings revealed that cortical neurons adapted to inhibition loss through two sequential mechanisms: a transient reduction of excitatory synaptic input, followed by intrinsic membrane property changes that decreased input resistance. This sequential adaptation program ultimately prevented target neurons from contributing spikes to the cortical network. Our RNA-based single-cell gene editing approach enables investigation of cellular responses independent of network effects, providing new insights into neuronal homeostasis and gene function in individual cells in vivo.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685

The alternative archaeal system comprises Cdv proteins and is thought to bear some resemblance to ESCRT-III-based membrane remodelling in other domains of life, including eukaryotes, especially during abscission. Here we present biochemical, crystallographic and cryo-EM studies of the Sulfolobus Cdv machinery. CdvA, an early non-ESCRT component, adopts a PRC-domain/coiled-coil fold and polymerises into long double-stranded helical filaments, mainly via hydrophobic interfaces. Monomeric CdvB adopts the canonical ESCRT-III fold in both a closed and a distinct ""semi-open"" conformation. Soluble CdvB2 filaments are composed of subunits in the closed state, appearing to transition to the open, active state only when polymerised on membranes. Short N-terminal amphipathic helices in all CdvB paralogues, B, B1 and B2, mediate membrane binding and are required for liposome recruitment in vitro. We provide a molecular overview of archaeal ESCRT-III-based cytokinesis machinery, the definitive demonstration that CdvB proteins are bona fide ESCRT-III homologues and we reveal the molecular basis for membrane engagement. Thus, we illuminate conserved principles of ESCRT-mediated membrane remodelling and extend them to an anciently diverged archaeal lineage.

Significance statementMembrane remodelling by ESCRT-III proteins is a fundamental and conserved process across the tree of life. The archaeal ESCRT-III-based cell division system (Cdv) drives cytokinesis in many archaeal groups, yet the molecular architecture of its components remained unknown, making it difficult to decipher the molecular mechanisms employed for cell division and cytokinesis in these organisms. We present structures of the Cdv machinery in Sulfolobus organisms that have been used previously to study the cell division process. We show that CdvA forms unexpected antiparallel helical filaments, while the ESCRT-III homologues retain the canonical fold we show they share with eukaryotic proteins. We demonstrate that N-terminal helices mediate membrane binding and that membrane contact, rather than polymerisation alone, likely triggers activation of Cdv ESCRT-IIIs.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U105184326;""},{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001aqnf71"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MC_UP_1201/27;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""227876/Z/23/Z;203276/Z/16/Z;222460/Z/21/Z;""},{""name"":""Volkswagen Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03bsmfz84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""94933;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CIBSS ‚Äì EXC-2189 ‚Äì Project ID 390939984;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758406098685
