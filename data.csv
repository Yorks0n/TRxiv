Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1741903695330

While highly processed food like packaged products, processed meat, and sweetened soft drinks have been increasingly associated with unhealthy diet, information on the degree of processing characterizing an item in a store is not straight forward to obtain, limiting the ability of individuals to make informed choices. Here we introduce GroceryDB, a database with over 50,000 food items sold by Walmart, Target, and Wholefoods, unveiling how big data can be harnessed to empower consumers and policymakers with systematic access to the degree of processing of the foods they select, and the potential alternatives in the surrounding food environment. The extensive data gathered on ingredient lists and nutrition facts enables a large-scale analysis of ingredient patterns and degrees of processing, categorized by store, food category, and price range. Our findings reveal that the degree of food processing varies significantly across different food categories and grocery stores. Furthermore, this data allows us to quantify the individual contribution of over 1,000 ingredients to ultra-processing. GroceryDB and the associated http://TrueFood.Tech/ website make this information accessible, guiding consumers toward less processed food choices while assisting policymakers in reforming the food supply.","NA","medrxiv",1741903695330

Clinical testing of iExoKrasG12D in the iEXPLORE (iExoKrasG12D in Pancreatic Cancer) Phase I study employed a classical 3+3 dose escalation design (Phase Ia), followed by an accelerated titration design (Phase Ib) (NCT03608631).

Our prior works show that shortening the S1/S2 loop by deleting either the FCS ({Delta}PRRA) or deleting an upstream sequence ({Delta}QTQTN), ablates spike processing, alters host protease usage, and attenuates infection in vitro and in vivo. With the importance of the loop length established, here we evaluated the impact of disrupting the FCS, but preserving the S1/S2 loop length. Using reverse genetics, we generated a SARS-CoV-2 mutant that disrupts the FCS (PQQAR) but maintains its extended S1/S2 loop. The SARS-CoV-2 PQQAR mutant has reduced replication, decreased spike processing, and attenuated disease in vivo compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2. These data, similar to the FCS deletion mutant, indicate that loss of the furin cleavage site attenuates SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Importantly, we subsequently found that the PQQAR mutant is transmitted in the direct contact hamster model despite lacking an intact FCS. However, competition transmission showed that the mutant was attenuated compared to WT SARS-CoV-2. Together, the data argue that the FCS is required for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis but is not strictly required for viral transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

Here we develop an experimental system for measuring neutralization titers against RSV F using pseudotyped lentiviral particles. This system is easily adaptable to evaluate neutralization of relevant clinical strains. We apply this system to demonstrate that natural evolution of RSV F leads to escape from some monoclonal antibodies, but at most modestly affects neutralization by polyclonal serum antibodies. Overall, our work sheds light on RSV antigenic evolution and describes a tool to measure the ability of antibodies and sera to neutralize contemporary RSV strains.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

However, the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood, with ongoing debate about whether sensory neurons can be directly infected by the virus. In this study, human iPSC-derived sensory neurons were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant, a mutant virus, or viral S1 proteins. Under control conditions, sensory neurons exhibited low expression of ACE2. However, exposure to BA.5 or S1 proteins significantly upregulated ACE2 expression in peripherin-positive sensory neurons. Virological analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons, including olfactory neurons. Moreover, exposure to the live virus or S1 proteins induced TRPV1 upregulation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in axonal destruction. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed that viral exposure enhanced cAMP signaling, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels, which collectively contributed to synaptic and axonal damage. Importantly, treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist demonstrated neuroprotective effects. These findings underscore the need for further research into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TRPV1, as well as its downstream signaling pathways, to develop therapeutic strategies for preventing sensory neuron loss during viral infections.

We identified human-specific epigenetic signatures including cis-regulatory regions and enhancer-promoter interactions and linked them to gene regulatory dynamics. Deep learning models revealed that complex regulatory grammar at cis-regulatory regions, including transcription factor binding sites, local context and higher-order chromatin organization, underlies species and cell type-specific differences. High-resolution Hi-C uncovered unexpected global shifts in 3D genome architecture in chimpanzee and gorilla neural stem cells while topologically associating domains remain remarkably conserved. Notably, species-specific genes interacted with multiple differentially accessible regions, suggesting that synergistic enhancer activation is a key mechanism driving epigenome evolution.

In heterodichogamy, two hermaphroditic morphs exploit distinct temporal reproductive niches by alternating phases of male and female flowering, promoting disassortative mating. This system is widespread within Juglandaceae, and known to be controlled by ancient balanced polymorphisms in walnuts (Juglans) and hickories (Carya). Here we identify distinct inheritance mechanisms controlling heterodichogamy in two separate Juglandaceae genera, the wingnuts (Pterocarya and Cyclocarya). We first document the occurrence of heterodichogamy in Pterocarya and map its genomic basis to haplotypes overlapping a single candidate gene in the FANTASTIC FOUR superfamily (GFAFL). These haplotypes segregate throughout the entire genus and the dominant haplotype controls female-first flowering. We show heterodichogamy in the sister genus Cyclocarya is associated with a distinct pair of ancient haplotypes at the same locus in both diploids and tetraploids, but with a dominant allele controlling male-first flowering. We infer a well-resolved fossil-calibrated phylogeny of Juglandaceae and date the divergence of the Pterocarya and Cyclocarya haplotypes to 51 and 44 million years ago, more recent than the divergence of these genera. In Pterocarya female-first heterozygotes, the dominant haplotype is associated with allele-specific suppression of the recessive copy of GFAFL during early male flower development. In Cyclocarya male-first heterozygotes, the dominant haplotype is associated with allele-specific activation of the recessive copy of GFAFL during male flower development, while the dominant copy itself shows higher expression in female flowers. We propose a model for the evolution of reciprocal sex matching in heterodichogamy through the combination of cis-regulatory divergence and allelic interactions involving  fast and  slow alleles at a single gene regulating flowering time. The non-independent expression of alleles in both systems is reminiscent of trans-sensing phenomena in other systems and suggests a mechanism mediated by DNA homology or an RNA intermediary. Notably, the dominant haplotypes in both genera show parallel architecture with a hemizygous region containing tandem duplicates of the same 1 kb motif downstream of the transcribed region of GFAFL which may be linked with such a mechanism. Our findings shed light on the molecular basis of heterodichogamy and contribute to an emerging view that diverse genetic pathways can be co-opted during its evolution and facilitate turnover in its genetic control.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

Experimental evidence indicates that spike mutations, particularly the early D614G variant, alter the rate of this conformational shift, potentially increasing viral infectivity. To investigate how mutations reshape the conformational landscape, we conducted extensive weighted ensemble simulations of the Ancestral, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 spike strains along the RBD opening pathway. We observe that Ancestral, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 spike RBDs open differently, with Omicron BA.1 following a more direct opening profile until it reaches a ""super-open"" state wherein it begins to ""peel"", suggesting increased S1 flexibility. Via dynamical network analysis, we identified two allosteric communication networks uniting all S1 domains: the established N2R linker and a newly discovered anti-parallel R2N linker. In Delta and Omicron BA.1 variant spikes, RBD opening is facilitated by both linkers, while the Ancestral strain relies predominantly on the N2R linker. In the ancestral spike, the D614-K854 salt bridge impedes allosteric communication through the R2N linker, whereas the loss of this salt bridge in all subsequent VOCs alleviates local frustration and, we believe, accelerates RBD opening. Hydrogen-deuterium mass spectrometry experiments validate these altered dynamics in the D614 region across Ancestral, D614G, and Omicron BA.1 spikes. This study unveils a  hidden allosteric network, connecting the NTD to the RBD via the 614-proximal region, and the D614G mutation reshapes the fitness landscape of these critical viral glycoproteins.

Significance StatementOur work reveals how the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein reshapes its internal communication pathways and speeds up receptor binding domain (RBD) opening, providing mechanistic insight into the evolution and enhanced infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. We also describe differences in opening pathways and relative rates of opening for Delta and Omicron BA.1 spike RBDs relative to the original (Ancestral) coronavirus strain from Wuhan, China.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

It poses the difficult problem of continuous tracking of multiple agents, including both self and others. To understand how this tracking is implemented neurally, we examined responses of hippocampal neurons while humans performed a joystick-controlled continuous prey-pursuit task involving two simultaneously fleeing prey (and, in some cases, a predator) in a virtual open field. We found neural maps encoding the positions of all the agents. All maps were multiplexed in single neurons and were disambiguated by the use of the population coding principle of semi-orthogonal subspaces, which can facilitate cross-agent generalization. Some neurons, more common in the posterior hippocampus, had narrow tuning functions reminiscent of place cells, lower firing rates, and high information per spike; others, which were found in both anterior and posterior hippocampus, had broad tuning functions, higher firing rates, and less information per spike. Semi-orthogonalization was selectively associated with the broadly tuned neurons. These results suggest an answer to the problem of navigational individuation, that is, how mapping codes can distinguish different agents, and establish the neuronavigational foundations of pursuit.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

We performed a variety of metabolic assays in primary tissue and stem cell derived cortical organoids and observed dynamic changes in core metabolic functions, including an unexpected increase in glycolysis during late neurogenesis. By depleting glucose levels in cortical organoids, we increased outer radial glia, astrocytes, and inhibitory neurons. We found the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) was impacted in these experiments and leveraged pharmacological and genetic manipulations to recapitulate these radial glia cell fate changes. These data identify a new role for the PPP in modulating radial glia cell fate specification and generate a resource for future exploration of additional metabolic pathways in human cortical development.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

Here we present the GrimACE, the first fully standardised and automated cage-side monitoring tool for mice, the most widely used animals in research. The GrimACE uses computer vision to provide automated mouse grimace scale (MGS) assessment together with pose estimation in a dark, safe environment. We validated the system by analysing pain after brain surgeries (craniotomies) with head implants under two analgesia regimes. Human-expert and automated MGS scores showed very high correlation (Pearson's r=0.87). Both expert and automated scores revealed that a moderate increase in pain can be detected for up to 48 hours after surgeries, but that both a single dose of meloxicam (5mg/kg s.c.) or 3 doses of buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg) + meloxicam (5mg/kg s.c.) provide adequate and comparable pain management. Simultaneous pose estimation demonstrated that mice receiving buprenorphine + meloxicam showed increased movement 4h after surgery, indicative of hyperactivity, a well-known side-effect of opioid treatment. Significant weight loss was also detected in the buprenorphine + meloxicam treatment group compared to the meloxicam-only group. Additionally, detailed BehaviorFlow analysis and automated MGS scoring of control animals suggests that habituation to the GrimACE system is unnecessary, and that measurements can be repeated multiple times, ensuring standardised post-operative recovery monitoring.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

Human neocortex expansion during evolution has been attributed to an increase in the proliferative capacity of neural progenitor cells during development, particularly basal radial glia (bRG). Despite their evolutionary relevance, the genomic changes driving human-specific bRG biology remain uncharacterized. We used comparative chromatin and transcriptional profiling of neural progenitor cells isolated from gorilla, chimpanzee and human cerebral organoids to identify cis-regulatory elements that have gained activity in humans. Focusing specifically on bRG, we discovered that morphoregulatory enhancer activity and gene expression signatures distinguish human bRG from other great apes. Functional analysis of the morphoregulatory genes FAM107A and CNGA3 in human organoids revealed that these genes are required for the morphological complexity of human bRG. Taken together, our interspecies comparison of basal radial glia suggests that human-specific morphoregulatory signatures characterize neocortex evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

These communities are shaped by root exudates including plant specialized metabolites. Benzoxazinoids are such secreted compounds of maize. Individual microbes differ in their ability to tolerate and metabolize antimicrobial benzoxazinoids. To investigate how these traits combine in a community, we designed two synthetic communities of maize root bacteria that share six common strains and differ in their ability to metabolize benzoxazinoids based on the seventh strain. We exposed both communities to the benzoxazinoid MBOA (6-methoxybenzoxazolin-2(3H)-one) and found that the metabolizing community did not degrade MBOA to its aminophenoxazinone, as observed for individual strains, but as a community they formed the corresponding acetamide. MBOA shaped differential compositions of both communities and increased the fraction of MBOA-tolerant strains. The benzoxazinoid metabolizing community showed a higher tolerance to MBOA and was able to utilize MBOA as their sole carbon source for growth. Hence, bacterial interaction results in alternative benzoxazinoid metabolization and increases community performance in presence of these antimicrobial compounds. Future work is needed to uncover the genetics of this metabolic interaction and ecological consequences for the bacterial community and the host plant.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

Studies on rodents have confirmed this reduced FL is driven by a loss of sarcomeres aligned in series (serial sarcomere number; SSN) along a muscle. However, studies on rodents have focused primarily on rat plantar flexor SSN at two aging timepoints, leaving an incomplete view of age-related changes in SSN. Hence, this study investigated SSN as a contributor to the age-related loss of muscle mass in five hindlimb muscles across four aging timepoints in rats.

MethodsThe soleus, medial gastrocnemius (MG), plantaris, tibialis anterior (TA), and vastus lateralis (VL) were obtained from 5 young (8 months), 5 middle-aged (20 months), 5 old (32 months), and 5 very old (36 months) male F344BN rats. After fixation of muscles in formalin and digestion in nitric acid, fascicles were teased out end-to-end to measure FL. SSN was determined by dividing FL by sarcomere length measured via laser diffraction. Muscle wet weight, anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSA), and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) were also determined for insight on age-related losses of whole-muscle mass and in-parallel muscle morphology.

ResultsAge-related SSN loss was apparent after middle age for all muscles, with the plantaris showing the smallest (8%) and the VL the greatest (21%) loss. The MG and VL appeared to plateau in their SSN loss by 32 months, while the soleus and TA underwent continued loss from 32 to 36 months. In all muscles, SSN loss evidently contributed in part to the loss of muscle mass, alongside losses of contractile tissue in parallel (indicated by ACSA and PCSA).

ConclusionAs SSN is closely tied to biomechanical function, these findings present SSN as a distinct target for improving muscle performance in older adults.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

Here, we introduce a blot-free vitrification method that uses free-standing surfactant-stabilised foam films to address some of these issues. The method achieves uniform ice thicknesses, enables thickness control of the foam film prior to vitrification, and for some specimens enhances orientation distribution efficiency. Furthermore, it reduces particle adsorption to carbon foil on the specimen support. The method simplifies cryo-EM specimen preparation, offering improved control over ice thickness and particle orientation, to help streamline and accelerate structure determination.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

Converging evidence from neuroimaging studies and genome-wide association study (GWAS) suggests the involvement of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum dysfunction in the pathophysiology of AN. However, identifying the causal role of circuit-specific genes in the development of AN-like phenotype remains challenging and requires the combination of novel molecular tools and preclinical models. The activity-based anorexia (ABA) rat model recapitulates many aspects of the behavioural phenotypes of AN in humans and we have previously demonstrated that suppressing neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) circuit prevented pathological weight loss in ABA rats. Here, we used a novel viral-based translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) technique to identify transcriptional changes within this neural pathway associated with susceptibility to ABA in female rats. We reveal 1424 differentially expressed genes between Susceptible and Resistant rats, highlighting important transcriptional changes associated with ABA within this pathway. The changes observed were independent of current calorie deficit and associated with metabolic, mitochondrial and neural functions. Further, we show that genes upregulated in Resistant rats were involved in mitochondrial function, while downregulated genes were associated with cytoskeletal, postsynaptic and axonal functions, supporting the hypothesis that hyperexcitability of cortico-striatal circuit function is a critical mediator of pathological weight loss in ABA. These findings provide novel insights into circuit-specific gene expression patterns that may contribute to susceptibility to developing AN in humans and highlight potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

This study utilized a novel mouse model with dermal fibroblast specific expression of TLR4 on a TLR4-null background, which allows us to understand the sufficiency of skin fibroblast activation in pain development. Here we demonstrate that dermal fibroblast activation induces both acute inflammatory pain and hyperalgesic priming in both male and female mice.

Calcium imaging is such a key method which, however, records neuronal activity only indirectly and is therefore difficult to interpret. These difficulties arise primarily from the kinetics, nonlinearity, and sensitivity of the calcium indicator, but also depend on the methods for calcium signal analysis. Here, we evaluate the ability of the recently developed calcium indicator GCaMP8 to reveal neuronal spiking, and we investigate how existing spike inference methods (CASCADE, OASIS, MLSpike) should be adapted for optimal performance. We demonstrate, both for principal cells and interneurons, that algorithms require fine-tuning to obtain optimal results with GCaMP8 data. Specifically, supervised algorithms adapted for GCaMP8 result in more linear and therefore more accurate recovery of complex spiking events. In addition, our analysis of cortical ground truth recordings shows that GCaMP8s and GCaMP8m - but not GCaMP6, GCaMP7f or GCaMP8f - are able to reliably detect isolated action potentials for realistic noise levels. Finally, we demonstrate that, due to their fast rise times, GCaMP8 indicators support shorter closed-loop latencies for real-time detection of neuronal activity.

Their fast calculation from allele frequencies allows for rapid downstream admixture graph inference. One frequently overlooked assumption of the f4-test is a constant substitution rate. This assumption is typically questionable when comparing distantly-related lineages. Using simulations, we find that rate variation across lineages decreases the accuracy of the f4-test to detect the presence of reticulations in large data sets or with high average mutation rate. But when f-statistics are combined to infer an admixture graph, rate variation across lineages has a small effect on accuracy. Network inference was accurate on a simple network with 1 reticulation only, but extremely inaccurate to infer a complex network with 4 reticulations, even from large data sets and without rate variation. Yet in both cases, the network's major tree was inferred reliably. Rate variation significantly increased the distance between the true and closest estimated network, the score gap between the true and best-scoring network, and the rate of incorrectly rejecting 1 reticulation as adequate, under our simple network. We propose that identifiability, or lack thereof, is underlying the contrasting results between our simple and complex networks. Our findings suggest that the major tree is one feature that might be identifiable from f-statistics. In practice, we recommend evaluating a large set of top-scoring networks inferred from f-statistics, and even so, using caution in assuming that the true network is part of this set when inferred networks are complex. The extent of rate variation should be assessed in the system under study, especially at deeper time scales, in systems with rapid molecular evolution or with fast-evolving loci.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

Our approach leads to converged and reproducible free energy landscapes as shown by independent simulations and identifies key water-mediated interactions that ease structural rearrangements crucial for the activation of ADRB1.

Here, using GSK-3 knock-down mice (GSK-3KD), we show that GSK-3 is the central regulator of CD4-CD8 cooperation, specifically in enhancing the expression of granzymes necessary for CD8+ CTL killing. GSK-3KD induced metabolic reprogramming toward glycolysis in T-cells and, when combined with PD-1 blockade, overcame tumor checkpoint resistance characterized by reduced Treg TILs and increased effector-memory CD8+ TILs. GSK-3KD with anti-PD-1 therapy induced unprecedented expression of seven out of nine granzymes in CD8+ TILs through enhanced CD4+ T-cell help. These findings identify GSK-3 as a key regulator of CD4+ T-cell help in generating highly cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells, presenting a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

The spatial distribution of rewards, or value landscape, modulated activity in the hippocampus and default network vPFC subregions, but not in ventrolateral prefrontal control subregions or medial orbitofrontal limbic subregions.

Akin to MYC, we hypothesized that transcriptional dysregulation caused by BRD4::NUTM1 would lead to the generation of cancer specific antigens that could be therapeutically actionable.

Proper experimental design and statistical methods are required to mitigate systematic technical factors due to differences in batches (""batch effects""), as data variation due to these non-biological factors can mask actual biological differences. We propose using anticlustering as an automated method to assign samples to balanced batches. Anticlustering effectively negates differences in (numeric and/or categorical) covariates among batches, and implements user-defined restrictions on the number of batches, the number of samples per batch, and whether to assign certain samples to the same batch (""must-link constraints""). A simulation study shows that anticlustering is better at achieving balance among batches than previous approaches. An application from the UCSF-Stanford Endometriosis Center for Discovery, Innovation, Training and Community Engagement (""ENACT"", https://enactcenter.org/) is presented as a real-life example. In the application, multiple samples provided by an individual had to be processed on the same batch, so that comparisons among different samples of the same patient were not diluted by batch effects. The novel Two Phase Must Link (2PML) anticlustering algorithm realized the must-link restrictions while simultaneously obtaining balance among batches regarding disease stage, menstrual cycle phase, case versus control sample, and clinical site.

Combining Nirmatrelvir with the GRP78-antagonizing drug candidate HA15 strongly inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, to a far greater extent than either drug alone, as observed by diminished cytopathic effect, levels of detectable virus RNA, TCID50 titers, accumulation of the non-structural protein 3 (NSP3), as well as Spike and N proteins. The original SARS-CoV-2 strain as well as an Omicron variant were similarly susceptible towards the drug combination. Other GRP78 inhibitors or siRNAs targeting GRP78 also fortified the antiviral effect of Nirmatrelvir. In a hamster model of COVID-19, the combination of Nirmatrelvir with HA15 alleviated pneumonia-induced pulmonary atelectasis more effectively than the single drugs.

Using Xenopus egg extracts, we show that a replication fork encountering an SSB on either the leading- or lagging-strand template produces a single-ended double-strand break (seDSB). These broken ends are efficiently resolved by homologous recombination to yield D-loops and erroneous end-to-end fusions. Surprisingly, DNA synthesis downstream of an seDSB is highly inefficient. In contrast, when two forks converge at an SSB, they generate a double-ended DSB (deDSB) that efficiently completes DNA synthesis through double-strand break repair that is not dependent on homologous recombination. Leading, but not lagging, seDSBs can undergo extensive nucleolytic degradation that disassembles the divergent fork. These  secondary collapse events efficiently resolve seDSBs but without completion of DNA synthesis. Moreover, PARP inhibition can enhance fork collapse at unmodified SSBs but not at abasic site SSBs, contrary to expectations. Our findings distinguish end resolution from replication completion and demonstrate flexibility in how PARP inhibition affects fork collapse.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

Here, we explored how lipoprotein particles containing different ApoE isoforms affect neuronal health in vitro and in intact rodent hippocampi. We demonstrate that ApoE2 and ApoE3Ch particles protect neurons from ferroptosis by preferentially extracting peroxidated unsaturated lipids through the neuronal ABCA7 transporter. ApoE4 particles, on the other hand, exacerbate the effects of these toxic lipids leading to endolysosomal dysfunction.

We use MPATH to temporally order hydroxymethylation throughout mitotic inheritance, revealing that CpGs within cis-regulatory elements undergo transitions between methylation states at sub-cell-cycle timescales.

Pupil-linked arousal fluctuates second-by-second, closely correlating with dynamics of hypocretin/orexin (H/O) neurons, whose malfunctions are linked to multiple pathologies. It is currently thought that H/O neurons activate hunger-causing agouti-related peptide (AGRP) neurons, thus creating concurrent arousal and hunger. Here, we directly measure pupil-linked arousal dynamics and concurrent AGRP neuron activity and find that, instead, pupil dilations correlate with reductions in AGRP neuron activity. Direct H/O neuron stimulation reproduced this inhibitory effect, while H/O neuron ablation attenuated it. Furthermore, in a mouse model of human type 1 (i.e. O/H deficient) narcolepsy, which involves unexplained overeating, we detected abnormal AGRP neuron hyperactivation during specific brain states, including the symptomatic shut-downs of arousal (cataplexy). Finally, we show that intact H/O neurons are required for normal food value perception by AGRP neurons, and for eating and AGRP neuron suppression by unexpected non-food stimuli.

The physiological function of -synuclein and the detrimental effects of the pathological variants of -synuclein have been widely debated, but recent evidence has suggested an emerging consensus on a critical role for -synuclein in regulating synaptic function. However, a controversial role for -synuclein in nuclear function in both normal and pathogenic states has been proposed, and the degree to which -synuclein localizes within the nucleus and subsequent impact on the nucleus are poorly understood. To begin to address this controversy, we employed synucleinopathy murine and cell culture models, as well as postmortem human Lewy Body Dementia tissue to elucidate the extent to which pathological -synuclein localizes within the nuclear compartments, and the downstream consequences of this localization. We observed pathological aggregation of -synuclein within the nucleus in both murine models and human postmortem Lewy Body Dementia cortex via quantitative super resolution microscopy. In both mouse and human brain tissue the presence of -synuclein in the nucleus correlated with abnormal morphology of nuclei. This pathological accumulation of -synuclein in the nucleus was not observed in control mice, human tissue without pathology, or control cells. We subsequently examined the mechanistic consequences of pathological accumulation of -synuclein in the nucleus. Synucleinopathy models displayed increased levels of the DNA damage marker 53BP1. Furthermore, cells with pathological -synuclein exhibited elevated markers of nuclear envelope damage and abnormal expression of nuclear envelope repair markers. Our cell culture data also suggests altered RNA localization in response to pathological -synuclein accumulation within the nucleus. Lastly, we show that nuclear Lewy-like pathology leads to increased sensitivity to nuclear targeted toxins.

While LC symptoms vary widely, neuropathy is one of the most prevalent symptoms and drastically affects quality of life. However, the underlying pathophysiology of LC neuropathy remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the prevalence and potential mechanisms of LC neuropathy in the largest LC neuropathy cohort to date.

MethodsWe conducted an observational study of 977 adults with LC at Dell Medical School. Participants underwent clinical assessments, skin punch biopsy, and comprehensive metabolic, endocrine and immunological profiling. A subset of patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment.

FindingsNeuropathic symptoms were reported by 55% (534/977) participants, with skin biopsy confirming small fiber neuropathy in 56.5% (48/85) cases, affecting both epidermal and autonomic nerve fibers. Common risk factors for neuropathy, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, did not fully explain neuropathic symptoms. While general immunological markers (lymphocyte, T cell, and B cell count and CRP) were unremarkable, unexpectedly, we detected anti-ganglioside antibodies (AGAs) in 25% of patients with LC neuropathy, a comparable rate to other AGA-associated neuropathies. Longitudinal testing revealed persistent AGA positivity, and multiple elevated AGAs in a subset of patients. In a pilot treatment cohort of eight patients, IVIG treatment resulted in improvement of patient reported neuropathic symptoms.

InterpretationOur findings reveal a high prevalence of small fiber neuropathy in LC, with evidence suggesting an autoimmune mechanism involving AGAs in one in four LC neuropathy patients. The therapeutic response to IVIG further supports an autoimmune pathophysiology, suggesting potential benefits of immunomodulation in LC neuropathy patients.","NA","medrxiv",1741903695330

To go much beyond this number, smaller and simpler genetic systems are needed to avoid significant technical challenges. Chloroplast genomes offer multiple advantages for codon compression and reassignment. Here we report a recoding scheme for the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast genome, in which two stop codons and one or more of the codons for arginine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine and serine, all of which have two cognate tRNAs, are absent, compressing the genetic code to 51 codons. Firstly, several recoding strategies were tested on the essential rpoA gene, encoding a subunit of the chloroplast RNA polymerase. A defined compression scheme, which relied on swapping the target codons with the permitted frequent codons, could replace the native protein coding sequence without affecting chloroplast protein expression levels or the strain fitness. The same strategy was successfully used for codon compression of ycf1, encoding a subunit of the chloroplast translocon, psaA and psbA, intron-containing highly expressed genes encoding reaction centres subunits of both photosystems, and an 8.5 kb operon encoding essential and non-essential genes. Finally, we tested degeneracy of the 51-codon genetic code by exploring the combinatorial design for the large subunit of RuBisCO, relying on restoration of photosynthesis in an rbcL mutant strain. More than 70 functional sequences with diverse codon adaptation indices were recovered. In all codon-compressed genes there was no observable penalty on photosynthetic growth.

Significance StatementWe demonstrate the use of a chloroplast genome as a synthetic biology platform to test modifications of the universal genetic code. Elimination of 13 of the 64 possible triplet codes (codons) was possible for several essential and/or highly expressed genes without affecting chloroplast function. The technology is mature, paving the way for codon compression of the entire genome and thus enabling further radical rearrangement or expansion of the genetic code.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

Here we use Streptomyces formicae and the formicamycin biosynthetic pathway as a model to understand the complex regulation of specialised metabolism. We analysed all three pathway-specific regulators and found that biosynthesis is subject to negative feedback and redox control via two MarR-family proteins while activation of the pathway is dependent on a cytoplasmic two-component system. Like many Streptomyces antibiotics, formicamycins are only produced in solid culture and biosynthesis is switched off in aerated liquid cultures. Here, we demonstrate that a redox-sensitive repressor named ForJ senses oxygen via a single cysteine residue that is required to repress formicamycin biosynthesis in liquid cultures.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

To successfully navigate between breeding and wintering quarters, they, in addition to other natural orientation cues, rely on their ability to sense the Earths magnetic field. For this reason, migratory birds have become key model species for studying the sensory mechanisms underlying magnetic field-guided navigation, as evidenced by the identification of several brain regions believed to be involved in processing magnetic field information. However, there is as yet no readily accessible, high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) brain atlas to serve as a common reference within and across studies. Here we provide the neuroscience research community with the first freely available, digital, high-resolution (25 {micro}m), 3D bird brain atlas. It is based on light microscopy images from ten Eurasian blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla), a night-migratory songbird widely used model species in magnetoreception and navigation research. We outline the individual steps for the creation of a brain atlas, from whole-brain imaging using serial-section, two-photon tomography, to the creation of an average template at an isotropic 25-{micro}m voxel size, and finally to brain area segmentation and annotation. In this first version of the atlas, we have mapped a total of 24 brain areas, including 6 principal compartments, 13 conspicuous anatomical subdivisions common to all bird species and 5 functionally defined areas of the visual and trigeminal sensory systems involved in processing magnetic field information. This atlas is accessible via the standardised BrainGlobe Atlas API, making it compatible with a growing suite of computational neuroanatomy tools provided by the BrainGlobe Initiative. This integration enables precise alignment of future experimental data to a common coordinate space, facilitating collaboration, data visualization and sharing. Furthermore, this resource enables the accurate localization and comparison of implanted devices, injection sites, and/or cell populations across individual brains, both within and across studies.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

ObjectiveThis retrospective cohort study compares the overall spending, rates of return visits, laboratory tests, and imaging procedures within 30 days for Medicare fee-for-service patients who underwent in-person and telehealth evaluations between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022.

DesignA large-scale retrospective cohort study using propensity score matching

SettingPatients with no prior visits and 30-day episodes of care initiated by telehealth or in-person visits from July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022.

ParticipantsThis study included 100% of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who are aged >65 years while excluding those with Medicare Advantage coverage and those without continuous Medicare Parts A and B.

Exposure(s)Comparison of index visits initiated by telehealth versus in-person visits.

Primary outcomeAdjusted 30-day total spending.

Secondary outcomes30-day rates of return visits, laboratory tests, and imaging.

ResultsThe study included 30,079,958 participants with 36,709,528 and 429,891,125 episodes initiated by telehealth and in-person visits, respectively. The mean age was 76 for telehealth and 75 years for in-person. Telehealth-initiated visits were associated with lower 30-day spending ($260 vs. $342; net: -$82), though return visit rates were higher for telehealth (16.1% vs. 14.1%). Both lab test rates (7.8% vs. 24.2%) and imaging rates (3.5% vs 7.8%) were lower for telehealth-initiated care episodes compared to in-person-initiated care episodes.

Conclusions and RelevanceTelehealth-initiated episodes of care were associated with lower 30-day Medicare spending and reduced utilization of labs and imaging. These findings suggest that telehealth, when used as a substitute for office visits, may reduce overall Medicare spending.","NA","medrxiv",1741903695330

Specialized villus lymphatic capillaries, lacteals, undergo constant VEGF-C-dependent renewal to maintain their function in a hyperosmolar, inflammatory microenvironment exposed to dietary by-products. The mechanisms of lacteal adaptation remain incompletely understood. We integrated new and published single-cell RNA-sequencing data to profile murine small-intestinal lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and identified three distinct subsets. Lacteal LECs display a transcriptional signature resembling Ptx3 immune-interacting LECs characterized by high expression of Aqp1, encoding the aquaporin-1 water channel. LEC-specific deletion of Aqp1 reduced lacteal length, impaired lipid uptake, and limited weight gain on a high-fat diet, underscoring the importance of water homeostasis in lacteal maintenance. AQP1 also promoted VEGF-C-dependent LEC migration under osmotic stress and, uniquely, was upregulated during inflammatory remodelling in secondary lymphedema and lymphatic malformations, but not during embryonic lymphangiogenesis. These findings link lacteal regeneration to inflammatory lymphatic remodelling and highlight tissue osmolarity as a key biophysical factor in postnatal lymphangiogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

While prokaryotic TFs combine 1D and 3D diffusion to efficiently locate their binding sites, the target search of eukaryotic TFs within the chromatinized genome is poorly characterized. Here we combine in vivo and in vitro single-molecule imaging to dissect the role of DBD-flanking regions (DFRs) of the mammalian Sox2 and Sox17 TFs in searching for their binding sites. We demonstrate that the DFRSox2 dramatically enhances the search efficiency of Sox2 as compared to the negatively-charged DFRSox17. An enhanced search on naked DNA is primarily mediated by an increase in target recognition rate during 1D sliding. In contrast, target site recognition within nucleosomal DNA is mainly enhanced by increased nonspecific interactions with nucleosomes, facilitating binding to closed chromatin and reinforcing pioneering activity. These findings provide critical insights into the biophysical mechanisms governing TF target search on the chromatinized genome.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

In these conditions, fibrotic tissues are characterized by the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts. However, the role of CD8+ T cells in driving myofibroblast activity remains unexplored. Our aim was to investigate this interaction between CD8+ T cells and skin myofibroblasts and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms.

MethodsPrimary skin-derived myofibroblasts were co-cultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or sorted T cells in a 3D collagen type I hydrogel. To model autoimmunity, allogeneic mismatching was applied. T cell activation and cytokine expression were assessed using flow cytometry and Luminex. Myofibroblast activation was analysed through immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), while activation-induced contraction was measured macroscopically. Intracellular signalling pathway activation in myofibroblasts was evaluated using luciferase reporter cell lines.

ResultsCo-culture of myofibroblasts with PBMCs strongly induced hydrogel contraction and expression of activation-related markers such as podoplanin, fibroblast activation protein, pSTAT3 and IL-6 in myofibroblasts. CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were also activated by co-culture as identified by increased CD25 and CD69 expression and elevated IL-2 and IFN-{gamma} production. Upon co-culture with either sorted CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, CD8+ T cells more strongly induced myofibroblast contraction and activation than CD4+ T cells. This was not associated with cytotoxicity but with increased IL-6 production by CD8+ T cells compared to CD4+ T cells and STAT3/TGF{beta}-induced signaling in myofibroblasts. Use of either the JAK/STAT3-inhibitor tofacitinib or the TGF{beta} receptor inhibitor SB-505124 blocked the activated myofibroblast phenotype, and combined use of both inhibitors had an additive effect on myofibroblast activation and contraction.

ConclusionsCD8+ T cells drive primary skin derived myofibroblast contraction and activation not via cytotoxicity-related program but via cytokine release. This sheds light on novel mechanisms of immune cell mediated tissue fibrosis. Furthermore, our results suggest that combining JAK/STAT inhibition with an anti-fibrotic agent that blocks matrix synthesis might be promising in mitigating immune cell mediated tissue fibrosis in connective tissue rheumatic disorders and has added value over blocking these pathways individually.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

We propose that affinity-enhancing SHMs are selectively enriched in public antibody clonotypes, surpassing the background frequency seen in antibodies carrying the same V genes, but with different epitope specificities. Employing a human IGHV4-59/IGKV3-20 public antibody as a model, we compare SHM signatures in antibodies also using these V genes, but recognizing other epitopes. Critically, this comparison identified clonotype-enriched mutations in the light chain. Our analyses also show that these SHMs, in combination, enhance binding to a previously uncharacterized viral epitope, with antibody responses to it increasing after multiple vaccinations. Our findings offer a framework for identifying affinity-enhancing SHMs in public antibodies based on convergence and clonotype-enrichment and can help guide vaccine design aimed to elicit public antibodies.

Antibody discovery requires substantial experimental effort, such as immunization campaigns or in vitro library screening. Predicting antibody-antigen binding a priori remains challenging. However, recent machine learning methods raise the possibility of in silico antibody discovery, bypassing or reducing initial experimental bottlenecks. Here, we report a virtual screen using AlphaFold-Multimer (AF-M) that prospectively identified nanobody binders to MRGPRX2, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and therapeutic target for the treatment of pseudoallergic inflammation and itch. Using previously reported nanobody-GPCR structures, we identified a set of AF-M outputs that effectively discriminate between interacting and non-interacting nanobody-GPCR pairs. We used these outputs to perform a prospective in silico screen, identified nanobodies that bind MRGPRX2 with high affinity, and confirmed activity in signaling and functional cellular assays. Our results provide a proof of concept for fully computational antibody discovery pipelines that can circumvent laboratory experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

However, such compounds typically rely on accessory proteins to function, such as E3 ligases in the case of targeted degradation, which may restrict their target and tissue scope or lead to resistance. Here we alleviate the need for accessory proteins with a novel pharmacological modality to knock-down protein function. Our strategy exploits protein symmetry as a selective vulnerability, and is widely applicable owing to the ubiquitous nature of homomeric proteins in cellular systems. We target homomeric proteins with PINCHs (Polymerization Inducing Chimeras) - bifunctional molecules composed of two linked ligands that act as bridges between homomers and trigger their supramolecular assembly into insoluble polymers. We design PINCHs that achieve efficient polymerization of three homomeric targets. In cells, we observed that a PINCH targeting Keap1 exhibited a longer duration of action compared to its monomeric inhibitor, and a PINCH targeting BCL6 displayed selective and improved B cell toxicity compared to its monomeric parent. Our results highlight PINCHs as a novel and general strategy to modulate and knock out protein function.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330

In human adults, visual performance declines with eccentricity and varies around polar angle for many visual dimensions and tasks: Performance is superior along the horizontal than the vertical meridian (horizontal-vertical anisotropy, HVA), and along the lower than the upper vertical meridian (vertical meridian asymmetry, VMA)(Carrasco et al., 2001). However, it remains unknown whether visual adaptation differs around polar angle. In this study, we investigated adaptation effects at the fovea and perifovea across the four cardinal locations, for horizontal and vertical adaptor and target orientations, with stimulus size adjusted as per a cortical magnification factor (Rovamo & Virsu, 1979). We measured contrast thresholds at each location separately for adaptation and non-adaptation conditions. Results confirmed the expected HVA and VMA effects in non-adapted conditions and showed they are stronger for horizontal than vertical orientations. They also revealed that, for both orientations, adaptation effects are stronger along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, which in turn is stronger than at the fovea. Furthermore, for both orientations, individuals adaptation effects at the perifoveal locations positively correlated with their cortical surface area of V1. The association of a stronger adaptation effect with larger V1 surface area suggests a more pronounced conservation of bioenergetic resources along the horizontal than the vertical meridian. Visual adaptation alleviates the HVA in contrast sensitivity, promoting a more homogeneous perception around the visual field.","NA","biorxiv",1741903695330
