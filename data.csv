We sampled 579 pets from 281 households with one or more laboratory-confirmed person with COVID-19 in central Texas from June 2020 to May 2021. Nineteen out of 396 (4.8%) dogs and 21 out of 157 (13.4%) cats were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. Additionally, 95/382 (25%) dogs and 52/146 (36%) cats harbored SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Twenty-six companion animals of ten other species were negative. Overall, 164 (29%) pets were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by molecular and/or serological tests; a total of 110 (39%) out of 281 households had at least one animal with active or past SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cats were more likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and had higher endpoint antibody titers than dogs. Through viral isolation from a subset of respiratory swabs, we documented 6 different lineages in dogs and cats, including the B.1.1 lineage in a cat one month prior to the first known human case in the country. We observed animal and human-pet interaction factors associated with higher risk of infection for dogs and cats, such as days after COVID-19 diagnosis and sharing food. Frequency of clinical signs of disease reported by owners of pets with active infections did not differ from uninfected ones, suggesting that not all reported signs are attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Characterizing animal infections using active SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in pets at risk of infection may aid in One Health pandemic prevention, response, and management.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

Due to its relatively weak binding affinity, the probe exhibits minimal cytotoxicity and labels actin filaments without significantly altering actin dynamics. Furthermore, SiR-XActin is suitable for time-resolved, live-cell super-resolution STED microscopy. Exchanging the SiR fluorophore in SiR-XActin for other fluorophores yields probes in different colors. All these properties make SiR-XActin and its analogs powerful tools for studying actin dynamics using live-cell fluorescence microscopy.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

However, recent machine learning (ML) approaches to estimating recombination have used pooled sequencing data, which does not sample individual genotypes and cannot be used to calculate disequilibria beyond the length of a single sequence read. Motivated by these results, this study examines the ""black box"" of such ML methods to understand what signals are being used to infer recombination rates. We find that it is indeed possible to estimate recombination solely using the allele frequency spectrum, and we provide a genealogical interpretation of these results. We further show that even a simplified representation of the allele frequency spectrum can be used to estimate recombination. We demonstrate the accuracy of such inferences using both simulations and data from humans. These results offer a new way to understand the effects of recombination on patterns of sequence data, as well as providing an example of how the internal workings of ML methods can give insight into biological processes.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

Translation inhibition through tRNA cleavage or modification inhibits phage propagation, thereby protecting the bacterial population. To counteract this, some viruses encode their own tRNA molecules, allowing infection to take place. The AriB effector of the PARIS defence system is a Toprim nuclease previously shown to target the E. coli tRNALys(UUU), but not a tRNALys(UUU) variant encoded by bacteriophage T5. We demonstrate here that the T5-tRNALys(UUU) is required but not sufficient to bypass PARIS immunity. Combining tRNA-sequencing, genetics, phage infection and in vitro biochemical data, we reveal that the E. coli tRNAThr(UGU), is another prime target of AriB and tRNAAsn(GUU) represents a secondary, yet biologically relevant, target of the PARIS effector. Activated AriB protein cleaves these targets in vitro, and the cleavage reaction is not dependent on the presence of specific tRNA modifications. We show that the overexpression of phage T5 tRNALys(UUU), tRNAThr(UGU) and tRNAAsn(GUU) variants is sufficient to inhibit PARIS anti-viral defence. Finally, we propose a model for tRNA recognition by the AriB dimer and provide molecular details of its nuclease activity and specificity.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

These studies have yielded remarkable results for understanding nucleosome transcription by Pol II with elongation factors but may fail to represent transcription in native conditions. To investigate Pol II transcription within metazoan cells, we developed an approach to isolate the native transcription complexes from Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Utilizing one-step FLAG-tag affinity purification and mild chromatin treatment with Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase), we preserved the native transcription complex for cryo-EM and proteomics studies. In silico purification through the cryo-EM classifications determined structures of multiple forms of native transcription complex, nucleosome and other macromolecules. Remarkably, we determined the structures of metazoan Rpb4/Rpb7 stalk-less elongation complex as well as hexameric nucleosome lacking an H2A/H2B dimer, revealing that diverse elongation complexes and nucleosomes are involved in active transcription in vivo. Nucleosome is positioned only downstream of Pol II in the nucleosome elongation complex, underscoring it as a major energy barrier and a time-consuming step during Pol II progression through nucleosomal DNA. Proteomics identified co-purified factors responsible for initiation and elongation stages of transcription, as well as RNA modification factors. This study lays the groundwork for structural study of native transcription in eukaryotes, with future work focused on studies of transient and minor populations of transcription complexes.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

Human centromeres are defined primarily by a unique chromatin domain featuring the histone H3 variant, Centromere Protein A (CENP-A), that marks a single active centromere locus per chromosome. CENP-A chromatin typically occupies a small subregion of low DNA methylation within multi-megabase arrays of hypermethylated alpha-satellite repeats and constitutive pericentric heterochromatin. However, the mechanisms defining and maintaining precise centromere position and domain size, and the role of the underlying alpha satellite DNA sequence, are poorly characterised. Using an experimentally-induced neocentromere in RPE1 cells, we discovered that the SUV39H1 and H2 methyltransferases tri-methylate H3K9 at neocentromere boundaries to maintain CENP-A domain size independent of DNA methylation or satellite sequences. Furthermore, we found that the CENP-A domain at canonical alpha-satellite-based centromeres is characterized by local depletion of H3K9me3-mediated heterochromatin, coinciding with the DNA methylation dip region. We identified the SETDB1 methyltransferase as key to maintaining H3K9me3 within flanking active higher order alpha satellite arrays while SUV39s and SUZ12 contribute to globally heterochromatinize both alpha satellites and neighbouring repeats. Loss of this heterochromatin boundary results in the progressive expansion of the primary CENP-A domain, erosion of DNA methylation, and the nucleation of new centromeres across alpha satellite sequences. Our study identifies the functional specialization of different H3K9 methyltransferases across centromeric and pericentric domains, crucial for maintaining centromere domain size and number.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

Here we describe a general deep learning-based design approach for solubilizing native membrane proteins while preserving their sequence, fold, and function using genetically encoded de novo protein WRAPs (Water-soluble RFdiffused Amphipathic Proteins) that surround the lipid-interacting hydrophobic surfaces, rendering them stable and water-soluble without the need for detergents. We design WRAPs for both beta-barrel outer membrane and helical multi-pass transmembrane proteins, and show that the solubilized proteins retain the binding and enzymatic functions of the native targets with enhanced stability. Syphilis vaccine development has been hindered by difficulties in characterizing and producing the outer membrane protein antigens; we generated soluble versions of four Treponema pallidum outer membrane beta barrels which are potential syphilis vaccine antigens. A 4.0 [A] cryo-EM map of WRAPed TP0698 is closely consistent with the design model. WRAPs should be broadly useful for facilitating biochemical and structural characterization of integral membrane proteins, enabling therapeutic discovery by screening against purified soluble targets, and generating antigenically intact immunogens for vaccine development.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

We demonstrate that endowing CAR T cells with ectopic interleukin-9 (IL-9) signaling by co-expressing an IL-9 receptor, rewires CAR T cell fate under antigen stress to enhance anti-tumor efficacy. In preclinical solid tumor models, IL-9-signaling CAR T cells exhibit increased expansion, persistence, and tumor infiltration, resulting in superior tumor control at significantly lower doses than conventional products. Trajectory and RNA velocity analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data reveal that IL-9 signaling alters CAR T cell differentiation under antigen stress away from dysfunction, favoring a multipotent transition toward CD8+ cell memory and effector states, and promoting a CD4+ cell proliferative state. Interrogation of transcription factor pathways indicates that IL-9-mediated activation of STAT1 and STAT4 drives the superior phenotype of IL-9-signaling CAR T cells, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for targeting solid cancers.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

Models of protein complexes provide important insights into interaction mechanisms, but their interpretation can be difficult if they lack fine structural detail, which is often the case in experimental and predicted models.

ResultsHere I show that AlphaFold3 often fails to predict protein complexes that are either weak, or dependent on the presence of a cofactor that is not included in a prediction. To address this problem, I developed gapTrick, an AlphaFold2-based approach that uses multimeric templates to improve prediction reliability. The tool uses AlphaFold2 neural network models trained on single-chain proteins, which reduces training-set bias and allows for an extensive validation using a large benchmark set of protein complexes. I show that gapTrick improves predictions of the weak and incomplete complexes based on low-accuracy templates, such as separate protein chains rigid-body fitted into cryo-EM reconstruction of a complex. I also show that it identifies with very high precision residue-residue interactions that are critical for complex formation. The approach can aid in the interpretation of challenging experimental structures and the computational identification of protein-protein interactions.

Availability and implementationThe gapTrick source code is available at https://github.com/gchojnowski/gapTrick and requires only a standard AlphaFold2 installation to run. The repository also provides a Colab notebook that can be used to run gapTrick without installing it on the user's computer.

Methylation at cytosines in DNA (5mC) is actively regulated for proper control of gene expression and chromatin architecture. Numerous genes display active DNA demethylation across retinal development; a process that requires oxidation of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and is controlled by the ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET) enzymes. Using an allelic series of conditional TET enzyme mutants, we determine that DNA demethylation is required upstream of NRL and NR2E3 expression for the establishment of rod-photoreceptor fate. Using histological, behavioral, transcriptomic, and base-pair resolution DNA methylation analyses, we establish that inhibition of active DNA demethylation results in global changes in gene expression and methylation patterns that prevent photoreceptor precursors from adopting a rod-photoreceptor fate, instead producing a retina in which all photoreceptors specify as cones. Our results establish the TET enzymes and DNA demethylation as critical regulators of retinal development and cell fate specification, elucidating a novel mechanism required for the specification of rod-photoreceptors.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

Convergent evidence suggests that neurodevelopment proceeds in a hierarchical manner, characterized by heterogeneous maturation patterns across brain regions and networks. However, the maturation of the intrinsic spatiotemporal propagations of brain activity remains largely unexplored. This study aims to bridge this gap by delineating spatiotemporal propagations from childhood to early adulthood. By leveraging a recently developed approach that captures time-lag dynamic propagations, we characterized intrinsic dynamic propagations along three axes: sensory-association (S-A),  task-positive to default networks (TP-D), and somatomotor-visual (SM-V) networks, which progress towards adult-like brain dynamics from childhood to early adulthood. Importantly, we demonstrated that as participants mature, there is a prolonged occurrence of the S-A and TP-D propagation states, indicating that they spend more time in these states. Conversely, the prevalence of SM-V propagation states declines during development. Notably, top-down propagations along the S-A axis exhibited an age-dependent increase in occurrence, serving as a superior predictor of cognitive scores compared to bottom-up S-A propagation. These findings were replicated across two independent cohorts (N = 677 in total), emphasizing the robustness and generalizability of these findings. Our results provide new insights into the emergence of adult-like functional dynamics during youth and their role in supporting cognition.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

Place cells in CA1 of the hippocampus are crucial for spatial navigation and memories1 but show gradual changes in their preferred firing location over time when exposed to the same environment2-9. This drift occurs despite the fact that the animal maintains the ability to navigate and to perform spatial tasks, suggesting a complex relationship between neural activity and behaviour. Here, we show that while the spatial tuning functions of individual CA1 neurons drift over time, stable space coding prevails at the population level: Representational drift is not random but can be described as a translation and rotation in population state space, which preserves the internal geometry of population activity over time. Compensating for the coordinated translation and rotation allows for drift correction and a recovery of spatial tuning on future days. Moreover, the preserved internal geometry stabilises downstream readout under noisy conditions. We propose that the conserved population geometry might serve as a mechanism by which downstream reader networks achieve effective drift correction and, thus, ameliorate the readout of stable information.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

Over the past decades, single-cell and clonal analyses have revealed substantial functional and molecular heterogeneity within this compartment, challenging the notion that self-renewal is inherently tied to balanced, multi-lineage blood production. However, a cohesive model that explains the relationships among these diverse HSC states remains elusive. Here, we combined single-cell transplantations of over 1,000 highly purified murine long-term HSCs with in-depth phenotyping of their clonal progeny to achieve a detailed, time-resolved understanding of heterogeneous reconstitution outcomes. We identified reconstitution kinetics as an overall unifying metric of HSC functional potency, with the most potent HSCs displaying the greatest delay in hematopoietic reconstitution. Importantly, a progressive acceleration in reconstitution kinetics was also associated with a gradual shift in mature cell production from platelet and erythro-myeloid bias to balanced, and eventually lymphoid bias. Serial single-cell transplantations of HSCs revealed a unidirectional acceleration in reconstitution kinetics accompanied by a gradual decline in functional potency of daughter HSCs, aligning diverse phenotypes along a linear hierarchical trajectory. Mathematical modeling, together with experimental modulation of lineage-biased blood production, demonstrated that apparent lineage biases actually arise from cell-extrinsic feedback regulation and clonal competition between slow- and fast-engrafting clones to occupy the limited compartment sizes of mature lineages. Our study reconciles multiple layers of HSC heterogeneity into a unifying framework, prompting a reevaluation of the meaning of lineage biases in both normal and diseased hematopoiesis, with broad implications for other regenerating tissues during development, homeostasis, and repair.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

VPS29 is a central conductor of this network through its assembly into Retromer, Retriever and Commander endosomal sorting complexes, and its role in regulating RAB GTPase activity. Two VPS29 isoforms have been described, VPS29A and VPS29B, that differ solely in their amino-terminal sequences. Here we identify a third VPS29 isoform, which we term VPS29C, that harbours an extended amino-terminal sequence compared to VPS29A and VPS29B. Through a combination of AlphaFold predictive modelling, in vitro complex reconstitution, mass spectrometry and molecular cell biology, we find that the amino-terminal VPS29C extension constitutes an autoinhibitory sequence that limits access to a hydrophobic groove necessary for effector protein recruitment to Retromer, and association with Retriever and Commander. VPS29C is therefore unique in its ability to uncouple Retromer-dependent cargo sorting from the broader roles of VPS29A and VPS29B in regulating the endosomal-lysosomal network through accessory protein recruitment. Our identification and characterisation of VPS29C points to additional complexity in the differential subunit assembly of Retromer, an important consideration given the increasing interest in Retromer as a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe endosomal-lysosomal network is essential for normal cellular function with network defects being associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Two heterotrimeric complexes, Retromer and Retriever, control transmembrane protein recycling through the network. Of these, reduced Retromer expression is observed in Alzheimers disease and Retromer mutations lead to familial Parkinsons disease. Here, we identify and characterise a new isoform of VPS29, a subunit shared between Retromer and Retriever. We reveal how this isoform, VPS29C, adopts an auto-inhibitory conformation to limit its association into Retriever and restrict the binding of VPS29C-containing Retromer to accessory proteins vital for regulating network function. By revealing added complexity in Retromer assembly and function, we provide new insight into Retromers potential as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

Mutations in Commander are causative for Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome (RSS), a multiorgan developmental disease associated with a core triad of cerebellar-cardiac-craniofacial malformation. Here, using unbiased proteomics and computational modelling, we identify leucine rich melanocyte differentiation associated (LRMDA) as a novel Commander binding protein. Using recombinant protein reconstitution, we show that LRMDA simultaneously associates with Commander and active RAB32, and, by revealing that LRMDA and SNX17 share a common mechanism of Commander association, establish the mutually exclusive nature of RAB32-LRMDA-Commander and SNX17-Commander assemblies. From functional analysis in human melanocytes, we establish an essential role for RAB32-LRMDA-Commander in melanosome biogenesis and pigmentation and reveal a distinct functional role for SNX17-Commander in this organelle biogenesis pathway. We reveal how LRMDA mutations, causative for oculocutaneous albinism type 7 (OCA7), a hypopigmentation disorder accompanied by poor visual acuity, uncouple RAB32 and Commander binding thereby establishing the mechanistic basis of this disease. Our discovery and characterisation of this alternative Commander assembly establishes an unrecognised plasticity of Commander function within a highly complex organelle biogenesis pathway. This extends Commander function beyond the confines of SNX17-mediated cell surface recycling into RAB32-family mediated biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles and, potentially, other RAB32 regulated pathways including host-pathogen defence mechanisms.

Endothelial cells control vasodilation through the bioavailability of eNOS-produced nitric oxide (NO), and the generation of endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization (EDH). Here, we demonstrate that Klebsiella pneumoniae, one of the most prevalent blood stream infection pathogens, inhibits agonist-induced vasodilation by blunting the NO-dependent pathway and attenuating the EDH pathway. The type VI secretion system (T6SS) effector VgrG4 licences the kinase PKC{beta} in an NLRX1-controlled mitochondria reactive oxygen species (mtROS)-dependent manner to phosphorylate the eNOS inhibitory site Thr495, effectively dampening eNOS activity. The capsule polysaccharide, on the other hand, limits the phosphorylation of the eNOS activation site Ser1177 by inducing the phosphatase PP2Ac upon activation of an EGF receptor-dependent pathway. VgrG4-induced mtROS attenuates the EDH pathway. Overall, this work reveals a new anti-host activity of the T6SS and illustrates how pathogens can control vascular biology by targeting eNOS post translational modifications.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

Recently, the development of alternative methods, such as CUT&Tag, have provided researchers with alternative strategies that eliminate the need for chromatin purification, and allow for in situ investigation of histone modifications and chromatin bound factors. Mindful of technical differences, we set out to investigate whether distinct chromatin modifications were equally compatible with these different chromatin interrogation techniques. We found that ChIP-Seq and CUT&Tag performed similarly for modifications known to reside at gene regulatory regions, such as promoters and enhancers, but major differences were observed when we assessed enrichment over heterochromatin-associated loci. Unlike ChIP-Seq, CUT&Tag detects robust levels of H3K9me3 at a substantial number of repetitive elements, with especially high sensitivity over evolutionarily young retrotransposons. IAPEz-int elements for example, exhibited underrepresentation in mouse ChIP-Seq datasets but strong enrichment using CUT&Tag. Additionally, we identified several euchromatin-associated proteins that co-purify with repetitive loci and are similarly depleted when applying ChIP-based methods. This study reveals that our current knowledge of chromatin states across the heterochromatin portions of the mammalian genome is extensively incomplete, largely due to limitations of ChIP-Seq. We also demonstrate that newer in situ chromatin fragmentation-based techniques, such as CUT&Tag and CUT&RUN, are more suitable for studying chromatin modifications over repetitive elements and retrotransposons.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

Many of these animals regenerate the correct tissues and structures with remarkable fidelity according to the original polarity of the body, reflecting positional information present in the remaining tissue. Understanding the cellular and molecular basis of this positional information is a central question in regeneration biology. In planarians and acoels, muscle cells have been shown to carry such positional information, but where this information originates and whether this function is conserved in other highly regenerative animals, is not well understood. Here we use the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis to address the role of the nervous system in whole-body regeneration. We generated a transgenic line for conditional ablation of neurons and first showed that Nematostella can repeatedly regenerate its nervous system. Bisection experiments following nervous system ablation showed that all head fragments regenerate a second head instead of a foot, whereas foot fragments correctly regenerate the missing head. We further found that regenerating head fragments of nervous system-ablated animals increase the expression of Wnt signaling genes that in wildtype animals are only upregulated in regenerating foot fragments. These molecular changes and the initiation of ectopic head regeneration precede the re-appearance of neurons, suggesting that the nervous system does not directly control whether a head or foot will be regenerated. Instead, we propose a model in which the nervous system provides positional information to the tissue of the body column, and that this information allows foot regeneration by suppressing a default program for head regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

Here we update these thresholds by determining sequence identity of the 16S rRNA gene for nearly 18,000 type strains. This represents 86.5% of all strains validly published, and it involved making more than 161 million pairwise sequence alignments. In 90% of all cases, sequences from the same species shared a minimum of 97.2 to 100% identity.

We propose these values serve as thresholds for classifying new prokaryotic taxa. A major change from previous guidelines is recognizing that these boundaries overlap. This overlap has already been observed for relative evolutionary divergence, a metric correlated with 16S rRNA gene identity.

The pathophysiologic mechanisms of this complex disease are poorly understood. Beyond the described symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, myalgias, among others, Long COVID can affect the patients ability to work and function in society compared to their baseline. Frailty is defined as the decline of physiologic reserve that leads to increased vulnerability to stressors and poor health outcomes. Our study aimed to examine the characteristics of frailty seen in patients with Long COVID compared to the frailty seen in aging patients with multimorbidity. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study conducted in the Miami Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). The data used to calculate the Fried phenotype through the Johns Hopkins frailty calculator was collected from two separate clinics, a Long COVID clinic and a Geriatric Frailty clinic. We obtained the VA Frailty Index from VA CDW (Corporate Data Warehouse). Results We included 106 patients from the Long COVID clinic and 97 from the frailty clinic. Patients from the Long COVID clinic were significantly younger than those from the frailty clinic (60{+/-}12.6 vs.. 79.8{+/-}5.8, p<0.01). In the standard frailty group, weakness and slowness were the predominant features present in both the frail and pre-frail groups, with increasing exhaustion and lower activity in the frail group. Patients with frailty in the Long COVID group experienced exhaustion and low activity at a higher rate than those in the Geriatric frailty clinic. Conclusions Long COVID may predispose patients to develop a subtype of frailty (""post-viral frailty"") that presents with a higher frequency of exhaustion and low activity. This frailty appears phenotypically different from the frailty encountered in geriatric patients with multimorbidity, which presents more often with slowness and weakness as the initial drivers.","NA","medrxiv",1738879707582

Phenological associations between deciduous trees, phytophagous insects and their consumers (passerine birds) have become one of the model systems for understanding this process. However, most existing research reports population-level associations rather than examining the smaller spatial scales at which these trophic interactions occur. Furthermore, a variety of methods have been used to measure phenology, particularly on producers and primary consumers, with little formal comparison. To investigate how different methods of measuring producer and primary consumer phenology influence our understanding of these biological relationships at the appropriate scale, we quantified phenological metrics for individual host trees and the phytophagous insects that depend on them in a deciduous woodland during spring 2023. We sampled 170 trees from six deciduous species in Wytham Woods, UK, deriving nine metrics of phenology from five distinct field methods: multispectral drone imaging (NDVI), hemispherical canopy photography, and bud-scoring observations to track tree phenology, as well as water traps and frass traps to monitor insect herbivore phenology. We assessed the reliability of these methods within both trophic levels and across tree species. We further evaluated the extent to which tree phenology metrics best correlated with herbivore phenology, at the level of individual trees and links to variation in subsequent herbivory rates across a subsample of 72 oak (Quercus robur) trees. Our results illustrate how methodological choices can affect our ability to study the timing of trophic interactions and reveal fine-scale spatiotemporal variation in phenology across both trophic levels. We discuss the implications of these results for considering how the scale-dependence of trophic interactions may stabilise populations and shape broader-scale responses to environmental change.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

In this study, we examined 285 healthy participants compare their structural connectomes at the whole-brain level and determine the networks responsible for the three different functional language lateralisation groups (typical, atypical and strongly atypical). Probabilistic tractography generated whole-brain tractograms, and white matter fibres were filtered according to anatomical Boolean guidelines. Connectivity matrices with nodes corresponding to supramodal sentence areas in the language atlas and edges weighted by fractional anisotropy (FA) were generated to compare the groups using graph theory and network-based statistic (NBS) approaches. We demonstrated that both atypical (bilateral) and strongly atypical (right-lateralised) lateralisation are characterised by heightened interhemispheric temporal connectivity. Post-hoc analyses showed that strongly atypical individuals exhibited increased temporo-frontal connectivity, while atypical individuals had enhanced temporal and frontal connectivity but lacked temporo-frontal connections. These connectivity patterns diverge from traditional models of hemispheric dominance, suggesting a reliance on integrated bilateral networks in atypically lateralised individuals. This reflects distinct neural mechanisms underlying atypical language organisation, departing from developmental trajectory of typical lateralisation and offering insights into cognitive flexibility and clinical applications.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

The methodology utilizes molecular docking simulations to predict interactions based on structural compatibility and binding affinity estimations. This approach highlights proteins, such as sodium/myo-inositol cotransporters, which exhibit theoretical high affinity for puberulic acid, suggesting possible competitive inhibition or mimetic interactions that could disrupt osmoregulation. It is important to clarify that these simulations provide a hypothetical framework for understanding potential interactions. The high docking scores do not directly translate to biological effects but serve as a basis for further experimental validation. This cautious interpretation acknowledges the inherent limitations of predictive modeling while maintaining confidence in the robustness of the computational process. Moreover, the exploratory nature of this study is supported by the fact that binding affinity predictions are not influenced by protein amino acid length or the predictive accuracy (pLDDT scores) provided by AlphaFold2. This independence from structural prediction metrics suggests that the docking results offer a reliable exploration of potential interactions across a wide array of proteins, making this approach a valuable asset in the fields of drug discovery and toxicological research. The ability to comprehensively identify candidate proteins with potential affinity to chemical compounds enhances the predictive capacity of toxicological assessments and supports the strategic development of safer pharmaceutical agents.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

The aim of the reCOVer trial was to investigate safety, tolerability and clinical effects of BC007 on fatigue, its severity and quality of life in PCS patients.

MethodsreCOVer is a prospective, exploratory, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover phase IIa clinical trial with 1350 mg BC007 at the University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany. Eligible participants were 18-80 years with GPCR-fAAb, whose PCS symptoms persisted [&ge;]3 months after PCR-confirmed COVID-19, with fatigue as the major symptom (Bell score [&le;]60) and at least three of eight defined PCS symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) according to a crossover design to either receive BC007 (sequence A) or placebo (sequence B) at day 0 and day 48 with a follow-up of 28 days, respectively. A crossover design was chosen to increase patient adherence. Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in comparison between sequence A and B from d0 to d28 and d0 to d70 were the primary and co-primary endpoint, respectively.

FindingsBetween 31.10.2023 and 12.06.2024, 30 PCS patients were randomised and analysed. The trial has been concluded. Summarising all AE rates, no statistically significant differences between sequence A und sequence B were observed within day 28 and day 70. One report of a serious adverse event, not related to treatment, was recorded. As a secondary endpoint, BC007 showed a significant improvement on self-reported fatigue and its severity, as well as quality of life.

InterpretationAs BC007 was well tolerated and showed a significant improvement of fatigue and quality of life, it might offer a therapeutic option for an autoimmune subgroup of PCS patients.

Together with sequence design and structure predictor-based filtering, it forms the backbone of the computational protein design pipeline. However, current protein structure generators face important limitations for large proteins and require retraining for protein design tasks unseen during model training. To address the first issue, we introduce salad, a family of sparse all-atom denoising models for protein backbone generation. Our models are notably faster than the state-of-the-art while matching or improving designability and diversity, and generate designable structures for protein lengths up to 1,000 amino acids. To address the second issue, we combine salad with structure-editing, a strategy for expanding the capability of protein denoising models to unseen tasks. We apply our approach to a variety of protein design tasks, from motif-scaffolding to multi-state protein design, demonstrating the flexibility of salad and structure-editing.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

Voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.8, a pivotal driver of pain signaling, is a clinically validated target for the development of novel, non-addictive pain therapeutics. Small molecule inhibitors against NaV1.8 have shown promise in acute pain indications, but large clinical effect sizes have not yet been demonstrated and efficacy in chronic pain indications are lacking.

An alternative strategy to target NaV1.8 channels for analgesia is to reduce the number of channels that are present on nociceptor membranes. We generated a therapeutic heterobifunctional protein, named UbiquiNaV, that contains a NaV1.8-selective binding module and the catalytic subunit of the NEDD4 E3 Ubiquitin ligase. We show that UbiquiNav significantly reduces channel expression in the plasma membrane and reduces NaV1.8 currents in rodent sensory neurons. We demonstrate that UbiquiNaV is selective for NaV1.8 over other NaV isoforms and other components of the sensory neuronal electrogenisome. We then show that UbiquiNaV normalizes the distribution of NaV1.8 protein to distal axons, and that UbiquiNaV normalizes the neuronal hyperexcitability in in vitro models of inflammatory and chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. Our results serve as a blueprint for the design of therapeutics that leverage the selective ubiquitination of NaV1.8 channels for analgesia.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

Although the S-layers role as a mechanical support for the membrane might be expected to hinder cell division, we show that in rapidly dividing Sulfolobus acidocaldarius cells, the S-layer protein SlaA self-assembles into flexible lattice that helps flattens the cytokinetic furrow to accelerate ESCRT-III dependent cell division - a role that is especially important under conditions of mechanical stress. Taken together, these results generated using mutational analysis, live and fixed cellular imaging, along with electron cryomicroscopy, define the rules governing S-layer self-assembly and show how the mechanical properties of flexible lattice coats can enhance membrane functions to both physically support a cell and help to drive ESCRT-III dependent cell division.

Significance statementThe bounding membrane of a cell must be protected from environmental insults. In many bacteria and archaea that lack a cell wall, this is achieved by an enveloping S-layer. By virtue of its rigid, planar structure, the S-layer is also expected to act as a barrier to the cell shape changes required for cytokinesis. In this study of the S-layer lattice in the archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius however, we demonstrate a role for this self-assembling mechanical support in re-shaping the cytokinetic furrow as an aid to ESCRT-III-mediated division. In showing how mechanically active and passive structures can work together to give rise to mechanically stable cells that can divide, this reconciles what seems like a trade-off between resilience and flexibility.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

A recent functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) study at 7T demonstrated for the first time layer-specific responses in the human dlPFC during working memory. Superficial layers were more active during the delay period when working memory items needed to be manipulated compared to mere maintenance. In contrast, deeper layers were more active during the motor response to a probe compared to non-action. Like many current layer fMRI studies, this study relied on several manual and semi-manual processing steps, including the selection of regions of interest. To test the replicability of these findings, we conducted a pre-registered replication of this study in 21 subjects using a fully automated and reproducible analysis pipeline. Our results do not show the same layer-specific effects. Although we observed higher activity in the superficial layers in response to working memory manipulation during the delay period, we did not find any evidence for stronger deep layer involvement during motor response in the probe period. We argue that our results are biologically plausible in light of previous research as well as methodological considerations inherent in layer fMRI acquisition and analysis. Consequently, we conclude that the evidence regarding the functional role of different layers within the human dlPFC during working memory remains inconclusive. A focus on replicability, reproducibility, and a better understanding of the influence of methodological choices will help layer fMRI become a more routine tool in cognitive neuroscience.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

The more generalized, SECIS-independent incorporation of selenocysteine is of interest because of the high nucleophilicity of selenium and the greater durability of diselenide bonds. It is likely that during the course of evolution selenocysteine insertion originally arose without the presence of a SECIS element, relying only on SelB. Herein we undertake experiments to evolve an ancestral version of SelB that is SECIS-independent and show that not only can this protein (SelB-v2) generally incorporate selenocysteine across from stop codons, but also that the new, orthogonal translation factor can be repurposed to other amino acids, such as serine.

Yet, therapeutics targeting mutant forms of chromatin-modifying enzymes have yielded only modest clinical utility, underscoring the difficulty of targeting the epigenomic underpinnings of aberrant gene regulatory networks. Here, we sought to identify novel epigenetic vulnerabilities in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Through phenotypic screens and biochemical analysis, we demonstrated that inhibition of the H3K9 demethylases KDM4A and KDM4C elicits potent, subtype-agnostic cytotoxicity by antagonizing transcriptional networks associated with B-cell identity and epigenetically rewiring heterochromatin. KDM4 demethylases associated with the KRAB zinc finger ZNF587, and their enzymatic inhibition led to DNA replication stress and DNA damage-induced cGAS-STING activation. Broad surveys of transcriptional data from patients also revealed KDM4 family dysregulation in several other cancer types. To explore this potential therapeutic avenue, we performed high-throughput small molecule screens with H3K9me3 nucleosome substrates and identified novel KDM4 demethylase inhibitors. AI-guided protein-ligand binding predictions suggested diverse modes of action for various small molecule hits. Our findings underscore the relevance of targeting fundamental transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms for anti-cancer therapy.

Since most of the neural matrix is composed of sugars, development of genetically encoded tags has been limited. Therefore, although several staining protocols exist for ECM in fixed tissue, there are no reliable matrix labels for live imaging. Here we report a viral-mediated fluorescent probe that binds to HA and labels the mouse brain ECM. The vector encodes the HA binding domain from neurocan fused to GFP and an externalization tag (AAV-Ncan-GFP), enabling transduced cells to secrete the fluorescent hyalectan into the extracellular space, thereby labeling HA. We demonstrate stable probe expression in organotypic brain slices, as well as in vivo in the mouse cortex, where it labels both perineuronal nets and interstitial matrix. We validate HA labeling through colocalization with HABP and sensitivity to hyaluronidase, and confirm the probe extracellular localization by shadow imaging. As a proof of concept, we combine AAV-Ncan-GFP with dendritic spine imaging ex vivo and calcium transient imaging in vivo, providing a real-time map of local ECM alongside neural function. The probe enables time-lapse imaging of ECM dynamics in live mice, facilitating longitudinal studies across a wide range of timescales, from minutes to days.

Using a combination of microscopy, proteomic analysis, and validation with mutant strains, we identified vitellogenins as the key molecular components of the protein buildup in the pseudocoelom. Vitellogenins shuttle nutrients from intestine to embryos and are homologous to human apolipoprotein B, the causal driver of cardiovascular disease. We then showed that CR and knockdown of vitellogenins both extend lifespan by >60%, but their combination has no additional effect on lifespan, suggesting that CR extends the lifespan of C. elegans in part by inhibiting vitellogenesis.

Here, we introduce AIR-SPACE, an integrative approach that combines high-resolution spatial transcriptomics with paired, high-fidelity long-read sequencing of T and B cell receptors. This method enables the simultaneous analysis of cellular transcriptomes and adaptive immune receptor (AIR) repertoires within their native spatial context. We applied AIR-SPACE to mouse popliteal lymph nodes at five distinct time points after Vaccinia virus footpad infection and constructed a comprehensive map of the developing adaptive immune response. Our analysis revealed heterogeneous activation niches, characterized by Interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) production, during the early stages of infection. At later stages, we delineated sub-anatomical structures within the germinal center (GC) and observed evidence that antibody-producing plasma cells differentiate and exit the GC through the dark zone. Furthermore, by combining clonotype data with spatial lineage tracing, we demonstrate that B cell clones are shared among multiple GCs within the same lymph node, reinforcing the concept of a dynamic, interconnected network of GCs. Overall, our study demonstrates how AIR-SPACE can be used to gain insight into the spatial dynamics of infection responses within lymphoid organs.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

To correlate AZ maturation with synaptic output, quantal imaging was performed at serially imaged time-stamped Drosophila synapses. Evoked release strength correlated strongly with AZ age and accumulation of late AZ scaffolds, while immature sites lacking VDCC accumulation supported spontaneous release. To examine how neuronal activity regulates AZ maturation and protein accumulation, the effects of disruptions to SV fusion or action potential generation were analyzed. Decreasing neuronal activity reduced AZ seeding and caused hyperaccumulation of presynaptic material at existing AZs. Although enlarged AZs are also observed in rab3 mutants, activity reduction acted through an independent mechanism that required postsynaptic glutamate receptor-dependent signaling. Together, these data indicate AZ maturation state sets distinct presynaptic release modes and output strength, with neuronal activity shaping both AZ number and size across development.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

Optimized for high-performance computing (HPC) environments, it takes advantage of job-scheduler submissions, parallelised processing, and tailored resource allocation for each analysis step. Tested on synthetic and real datasets, GeNePi accurately identifies genomic variants, with performances comparable to that of state-of-art tools.

However, while myriad studies have investigated relationships between MGEs and variation in fitness among microbial and eukaryotic hosts, few studies have incorporated this variation into the context of MGE evolution and ecology. Combining HiC-resolved metagenomics with the model honey bee worker gut microbiome, we show that the worker gut contains a dense, nested MGE community that exhibits a wide degree of host range variation among microbial hosts. Using measures of gene similarity and syntenty, we show that plasmids likely mediate gene flow between individual honey bee colonies, though these plasmids exhibit broad host range variation within their individual microbiomes. We further show that phage-microbe networks exhibit high variation among individual metagenomes, and that phages show broad host range with respect to both the number and phylogenetic distance of their hosts. Finally, we provide evidence that measures of nucleotide variation positively correlate with host range in bee-associated phages, and that functional targets of diversifying selection are partitioning differently between broad or narrow host range phages. Our work underscores the variability of MGE x microbial interactions within host-associated microbial communities and highlights the genomic variation associated with MGE host range diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

Studies on host immune responses to infection have mostly targeted mechanisms of resistance, and consequently, these are now well-described in both vertebrates and invertebrates. By comparison, the mechanistic basis of disease tolerance is less well understood. This is in part because both processes interact and can be difficult to separate under an infection scenario. Using the highly tractable insect model Drosophila melanogaster exposed to its natural entomopathogen, Pseudomonas entomophila, we aimed to tease apart mechanisms of disease tolerance from those of resistance. To this aim, we reasoned that oral exposure to heat-killed entomopathogenic bacteria should require disease tolerance without relying on resistance. Using this method, we observe that oral exposure to heat-killed P. entomophila causes mortality and reduced fecundity in D. melanogaster. We confirm that this reduction in fitness-related traits depends on the duration of the exposure, is sexually dimorphic, and is dependent on the virulence of the bacterium. We also found the microbiota to play a role, with its presence exacerbating the deleterious effect on host survival. This experimental framework, which may be extended to other systems, can be instrumental towards an understanding of the molecular, genetic, and physiological basis of disease tolerance and its interactions with resistance mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

While acute COVID-19 has been extensively studied, the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying long COVID remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate these mechanisms by examining the presence of the viral nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) genes, their mRNA expression, associated immunoglobulins (IgG), and immune regulation via IDO-2 activity in blood of individuals suspected of long COVID. Here we show that a unique pattern of test results contributes to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of long COVID, ultimately leading to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this condition. This study focuses on four key objectives: detecting viral or vaccin induced genetic material, quantifying mRNA expression of the N and S genes, profiling immunoglobulin levels, and measuring IDO-2 activity. These objectives aim to differentiate long COVID from other post-infectious conditions and provide insights into prolonged symptoms. The study population comprised 72 participants, 31 of whom were suspected of having long COVID based on defined symptomatology. Viral genetic material was detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, Immunoglobulin levels varied, with symptomatic males exhibiting lower anti-Spike IgG levels than females, suggesting possible gender differences in immune response. Logistic regression models revealed that mRNA spike data alone in this small group was insufficient to predict symptoms presence, but the inclusion of immunoglobulins and inflammatory markers significantly improved predictive accuracy.

Overall, this study highlights the complexity of long COVID and suggests that a multi-variable approach, combining mRNA and genomic spike data with inflammatory markers and demographic factors, provides a basis for effective prediction of symptoms, helping refine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for long COVID","NA","medrxiv",1738879707582

PGSs are often thought of as capturing the direct genetic effect of ones genotype on their phenotype. However, because PGSs are constructed from population-level associations, they are influenced by factors other than direct genetic effects, including stratification, assortative mating, and dynastic effects (""SAD effects""). Our interpretation and application of PGSs may hinge on the relative impact of SAD effects, since they may often be environmentally or culturally mediated. We developed a method that estimates the proportion of variance in a PGS (in a given sample) that is driven by direct effects, SAD effects, and their covariance. We leverage a comparison of a PGS of interest based on a standard GWAS with a PGS based on a sibling GWAS--which is largely immune to SAD effects--to quantify the relative contribution of each type of effect to variance in the PGS of interest. Our method, Partitioning Genetic Scores Using Siblings (PGSUS, pron. ""Pegasus""), breaks down variance components further by axes of genetic ancestry, allowing for a nuanced interpretation of SAD effects. In particular, PGSUS can detect stratification along major axes of ancestry as well as SAD variance that is ""isotropic"" with respect to axes of ancestry. Applying PGSUS, we found evidence of stratification in PGSs constructed using large meta-analyses of height and educational attainment as well as in a range of PGSs constructed using the UK Biobank. In some instances, a given PGS appears to be stratified along a major axis of ancestry in one prediction sample but not in another (for example, in comparisons of prediction in samples from different countries, or in ancient DNA vs. contemporary samples). Finally, we show that different approaches for adjustment for population structure in GWASs have distinct advantages with respect to mitigation of ancestry-axis-specific and isotropic SAD variance in PGS. Our study illustrates how family-based designs can be combined with standard population-based designs to guide the interpretation and application of genomic predictors.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

Due to the limited availability of material from obligate PPNs, we used Caenorhabditis elegans, a free-living nematode, as a MAMP source. C. elegans extracts activated MAMP-triggered immune responses in Arabidopsis Col-0. Through chromatography-based purification, we identified a secreted trehalase and pinpointed a conserved peptide region essential for its MAMP activity. A corresponding peptide from root-knot nematode trehalase enabled the identification of lectin receptor kinases LecRK-V.5 and LecRK-V.6 as key components in immune induction. Notably, this peptide region is conserved across insect and fungal pathogens, with LecRK-Vs required for immune responses to these peptides, highlighting the role of LecRK-V-mediated mechanism for broad-spectrum pathogen detection via trehalase-derived peptides.

Here, we show that Arabidopsis plants lacking metacaspase 1 (AtMC1) display autoimmunity dependent on immune signalling components downstream of NLR and PRR activation. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive AtMC1 in an atmc1 background triggers severe autoimmunity partially dependent on the same immune signalling components. Overexpression of the E3 ligase SNIPER1, a master regulator of NLR homeostasis, fully reverts the AtMC1-dependent autoimmunity phenotype, inferring that a broad defect in NLR turnover may underlie the severe phenotype observed. Catalytically inactive AtMC1 localizes to punctate structures that are degraded through autophagy. Altogether and considering previous evidence on the proteostatic functions of AtMC1, we speculate that Wt AtMC1 may either directly or indirectly control NLR protein levels, thereby preventing autoimmunity.","NA","biorxiv",1738879707582

In this study, we examined immunological profiles of people living with ME/CFS by flow cytometry, focusing on cytotoxic cells, to determine whether people with mild/moderate (n= 43) or severe ME/CFS (n=53) expressed different immunological markers. We found that people with mild/moderate ME/CFS had increased expression of cytotoxic effector molecules alongside enhanced proportions of early-immunosenescence cells, determined by the CD28-CD57- phenotype, indicative of persistent viral infection. In contrast, people with severe ME/CFS had higher proportions of activated circulating lymphocytes, determined by CD69+ and CD38+ expression, and expressed more pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN{gamma}, TNF and IL-17, following stimulation in vitro, indicative of prolonged non-specific inflammation. These changes were consistent across different cell types including CD8+ T cells, mucosal associated invariant T cells and Natural Killer cells, indicating generalised altered cytotoxic responses across the innate and adaptive immune system.

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1738879707582
