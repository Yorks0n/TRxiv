Here, we use MENSA, Media Enriched with Newly Synthesized Antibodies, secreted exclusively from circulating human plasmablasts, to provide an immune snapshot that defines the underlying viral triggers. We provide proof-of-concept testing that the MENSA technology can capture the new host immune response to accurately diagnose acute primary and breakthrough infections when known SARS2 virus or proteins are present. It is also positive after vaccination when spike proteins elicit an acute immune response. Applying the same principles for long-COVID patients, MENSA is positive for SARS2 in 40% of PASC vs none of the COVID recovered (CR) patients without any sequelae demonstrating ongoing SARS2 viral inflammation only in PASC. Additionally, in PASC patients, MENSAs are also positive for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in 37%, Human Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in 23%, and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) in 15% compared to 17%, 4%, and 4% in CR controls respectively. Combined, a total of 60% of PASC patients have a positive MENSA for SARS2, EBV, CMV, and/or HSV2. MENSA offers a unique antibody snapshot to reveal the underlying viral drivers in long-COVID thus demonstrating the persistence of SARS2 and reactivation of viral herpes in 60% of PASC patients.","NA","medrxiv",1720562898946

SARS-CoV-2 internalization occurs via S-protein-mediated cell binding followed either by direct fusion with the plasma membrane or endocytosis and subsequent fusion with the endosomal membrane. Despite the crucial role of virus internalization, the precise kinetics of the processes involved remains elusive. We developed a pipeline, which combines live-cell microscopy and advanced image analysis, for measuring the rates of multiple internalization-associated molecular events of single SARS-CoV-2-virus-like particles (VLPs), including endosome ingression, pH change, and nucleocapsid release. Our live-cell imaging experiments demonstrate that only a few minutes after binding to the plasma membrane, VLPs ingress into Rab5-negative endosomes via Dynamin-dependent scission. Less than two minutes later, the pH of VLPs drops below 5 followed by an increase in VLP speed, yet these two events are not interrelated. Nucleocapsid release from the VLPs occurs with similar kinetics to the pH drop, suggesting that VLP fusion occurs during endosome acidification. Neither Omicron mutations nor abrogation of the S protein polybasic cleavage site altered the rate of VLP internalization events, indicating that they do not affect these processes. Finally, we observe that VLP internalization occurs two to three times faster in VeroE6 than in A549 cells, which may contribute to the greater susceptibility of the former cell line to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, our precise measurements of the kinetics of VLP internalization-associated processes shed light on their contribution to the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cells. Time-lapse videos of the studied internalization events can be accessed in the dedicated COVIDynamics database.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

MethodsA total of 7361 asymptomatic community-dwelling people enrolled in the Test Us at Home parent study between October 2021 and February 2022. Participants self-collected anterior nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing every 24-48 hours for 10-14 days, regardless of symptom or infection status. Participants who had no history of COVID-19 at enrollment and who were subsequently found to have [&ge;]1 positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test during the parent study were recontacted in August 2023 and asked whether they had experienced long COVID, defined as the development of new symptoms lasting 3 months or longer following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants cycle threshold values were converted into viral loads, and slopes of viral clearance were modeled using post-nadir viral loads. Using a log binomial model with the modeled slopes as the exposure, we calculated the relative risk of subsequently developing long COVID with 1-2 symptoms, 3-4 symptoms, or 5+ symptoms, adjusting for age, number of symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 variant. Adjusted relative risk (aRR) of individual long COVID symptoms based on viral clearance was also calculated.

Results172 participants were eligible for analyses, and 59 (34.3%) reported experiencing long COVID. The risk of long COVID with 3-4 symptoms and 5+ symptoms increased by 2.44 times (aRR: 2.44; 95% CI: 0.88-6.82) and 4.97 times (aRR: 4.97; 95% CI: 1.90-13.0) per viral load slope-unit increase, respectively. Participants who developed long COVID had significantly longer times from peak viral load to viral clearance during acute disease than those who never developed long COVID (8.65 [95% CI: 8.28-9.01] vs. 10.0 [95% CI: 9.25-10.8]). The slope of viral clearance was significantly positively associated with long COVID symptoms of fatigue (aRR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.22-6.69), brain fog (aRR: 4.94; 95% CI: 2.21-11.0), shortness of breath (aRR: 5.05; 95% CI: 1.24-20.6), and gastrointestinal symptoms (aRR: 5.46; 95% CI: 1.54-19.3).

DiscussionWe observed that longer time from peak viral load to viral RNA clearance during acute COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of developing long COVID. Further, slower clearance rates were associated with greater number of symptoms of long COVID. These findings suggest that early viral-host dynamics are mechanistically important in the subsequent development of long COVID.","NA","medrxiv",1720562898947

However, our understanding of how the pre-cancer microenvironment contributes to early tumorigenesis remains limited. Here, we show that newly emerging tumours at their most incipient stages shape their microenvironment in a critical process that determines their survival. Analysis of nascent squamous tumours in the upper gastrointestinal tract of the mouse reveals that the stress response of early tumour cells instructs the underlying mesenchyme to form a supportive pre-cancer niche, which dictates the long-term outcome of epithelial lesions. Stimulated fibroblasts beneath emerging tumours activate a wound healing response that triggers a dramatic remodelling of the underlying extracellular matrix, resulting in the formation of a fibronectin-rich stromal scaffold that promotes tumour growth. Functional heterotypic 3D culture assays and in vivo grafting experiments, combining carcinogen-free healthy epithelium and tumour-derived stroma, demonstrate that the pre-cancerous niche alone is sufficient to confer tumour properties to healthy epithelial cells. We propose a model where both mutations and the stromal response to genetic stress defines the likelihood of early tumours to survive and progress towards more advanced disease stages.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

Since the start of the pandemic, eight monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were granted emergency use authorization. High mutation rate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to the emergence of highly transmissible variants efficiently evading vaccine-induced immunity. This highlights the importance of identifying broadly neutralizing antibodies with therapeutic potential. In this study, we used a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to identify a subset that bound and neutralized a broad spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Intranasal delivery of XR10, the most promising murine mAb, protected hamsters against infection by Alpha and Delta variants. We next humanized XR10 mAb using a combination of CDR-grafting and Vernier zones preservation approaches (CRVZ) to create a panel of humanized antibody variants. We ranked the variants based on their spike binding ability and virus neutralization. Of these, XR10v48 demonstrated the best ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants. XR10v48 was protective in hamsters when given as a single 50 ug/kg intranasal dose at the time of viral challenge. XR10v48 features 34 key amino acid residues retained from the murine progenitor. Our work introduces a potent humanized antibody that demonstrates neutralizing activity in vivo at a low dose.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

Conversely, marine photosynthetic diversity is dominated by plastids gained by subsequent endosymbioses of photosynthetic eukaryotes, so-called complex plastids. The plastids of major eukaryotic lineages including cryptophytes, haptophytes, stramenopiles, dinoflagellates and apicomplexans, were originally all posited to derive from a single secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga. Subsequent phylogenetic resolution of eukaryotes indicated that separate events of plastid acquisition must have occurred to account for this distribution of plastids. The number of such events, however, and the donor organisms for the new plastid endosymbioses are still not resolved. A perceived bottleneck of endosymbiotic plastid gain is the development of protein targeting from the hosts into new plastids, and this supposition has often driven hypotheses towards minimising the number of plastid-gain events to explain plastid distribution in eukaryotes. But how plastid protein-targeting is established for new endosymbionts is often unclear, which makes it difficult to assess the likelihood of plastid transfers between lineages. Here we show that Kareniaceae dinoflagellates, that possess complex plastids known to be derived from haptophytes, acquired all the necessary protein import machinery from these haptophytes. Furthermore, cryo-electron tomography revealed that no additional membranes were added to the Kareniaceae complex plastid during serial endosymbiosis, suggesting that the haptophyte-derived import processes were sufficient. Our analyses suggests that complex red plastids are preadapted for horizontal transmission, potentially explaining their widespread distribution in aquatic algal diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

However, a significant and yet unexplained branch length variation of Y chromosome lineages has been observed, notably amongst those that are highly diverged from the human reference Y chromosome. Understanding the origin of this variation, which has previously been attributed to changes in generation time, mutation rate, or efficacy of selection, is important for accurately reconstructing human evolutionary and demographic history.

Here, we analyze Y chromosomes from present-day and ancient modern humans, as well as Neandertals, and show that branch length variation amongst human Y chromosomes cannot solely be explained by differences in demographic or biological processes. Instead, reference bias results in mutations being missed on Y chromosomes that are highly diverged from the reference used for alignment. We show that masking fast-evolving, highly divergent regions of the human Y chromosome mitigates the effect of this bias and enables more accurate determination of branch lengths in the Y chromosome phylogeny. Finally, we show that this approach allows us to estimate the age of ancient samples from Y chromosome sequence data and provide updated TMRCA estimates using the portion of the Y chromosome where the effect of reference bias is minimised.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

This study aimed to determine the potential quantities of infectious HPAIV in raw milk in affected states where herds were confirmed positive by USDA for HPAIV (and therefore were not representative of the entire population), and to confirm that the commonly used continuous flow pasteurization using the FDA approved 72{degrees}C (161{degrees}F) for 15 s conditions for high temperature short time (HTST) processing, will inactivate the virus. Double-blinded raw milk samples from bulk storage tanks from farms (n=275) were collected in four affected states. Samples were screened for influenza A using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qrRT-PCR) of which 158 (57.5%) were positive and were subsequently quantified in embryonating chicken eggs. Thirty-nine qrRT-PCR positive samples (24.8%) were positive for infectious virus with a mean titer of 3.5 log10 50% egg infectious doses (EID50) per mL. To closely simulate commercial milk pasteurization processing systems, a pilot-scale continuous flow pasteurizer was used to evaluate HPAIV inactivation in artificially contaminated raw milk using the most common legal conditions in the US: 72{degrees}C (161{degrees}F) for 15s. Among all replicates at two flow rates (n=5 at 0.5L/min; n=4 at 1L/min), no viable virus was detected. A mean reduction of [&ge;]5.8 {+/-} 0.2 log10 EID50/mL occurred during the heating phase where the milk is brought to 72.5{degrees}C before the holding tube. Estimates from heat-transfer analysis support that standard U.S. continuous flow HTST pasteurization parameters will inactivate >12 log10 EID50/mL of HPAIV, which is ~9 log10 EID50/mL greater than the mean quantity of infectious virus detected in raw milk from bulk storage tank samples. These findings demonstrate that the milk supply is safe.","NA","medrxiv",1720562898947

This is tested in Pfizer clinical trial data and compared with standard clustering methods (n = 726).

ResultsGeometrical gene expression signature analysis demonstrated high utility to detect sub-groups with enhanced treatment response. In the Pfizer trial, gene expression signatures were able to detect three subgroups of responders (p = 0.012), containing 52.9% of patients and accounting for nearly all the observed treatment effect. Standard techniques following a similar methodology were able to partition a single subgroup containing 21.3% of patients.

ConclusionsGene expression based geometrical signatures yielded vastly superior performance over standard clustering techniques, as demonstrated in Pfizers Phase III clinical trial data. These can be used to determine subgroups of enhanced treatment response in oncology clinical trials, and might lead to personalized treatment recommendations in the future.","NA","medrxiv",1720562898947

These protrusions are organized by different actin nucleation promoting factors. For example, N-WASP controls finger-like filopodia, whereas the WAVE complex controls sheet-like lamellipodia. These different membrane morphologies likely reflect different patterns of nucleator self-organization. N-WASP phase separation has been successfully studied through biochemical reconstitutions, but how the WAVE complex self-organizes to instruct lamellipodia is unknown. Because WAVE complex self-organization has proven refractory to cell-free studies, we leverage in vivo biochemical approaches to investigate WAVE complex organization within its native cellular context. With single molecule tracking and molecular counting, we show that the WAVE complex forms highly regular multilayered linear arrays at the plasma membrane that are reminiscent of a microtubule-like organization. Similar to the organization of microtubule protofilaments in a curved array, membrane curvature is both necessary and sufficient for formation of these WAVE complex linear arrays, though actin polymerization is not. This dependency on negative membrane curvature could explain both the templating of lamellipodia and their emergent behaviors, including barrier avoidance. Our data uncover the key biophysical properties of mesoscale WAVE complex patterning and highlight an integral relationship between NPF self-organization and cell morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

Here, we leverage the tools of natural language processing to probe the nature of arousal in a data-driven, comprehensive manner. We show that arousal comes in seven varieties: cognitive, emotional, physiological, sexual, related to stress disorders, to sleep, or to sleep disorders. Meta-analyses of the brain imaging literature further reveal that all varieties of arousal, except arousal in sleep disorders for lack of data, converge onto a domain-general cortical arousal network composed of the pre-supplementary motor area and the left and right dorsal anterior insula. More precisely, we found that dysgranular insular area 7, the region with highest convergence across varieties of arousal, also shows activation specific to arousal. Our results show that arousal corresponds to a construct at least partially shared across different domains of neuroscience.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

Through integration with scRNA-seq, we identify proteins that are important for stem cell quiescence, which were not indicated by their mRNA transcripts, and demonstrate functional expression covariance during differentiation that is only detectable on protein level.

One of the best-understood systems for division site selection is the Min system in Escherichia coli. In E. coli, the Min system displays remarkable pole-to-pole oscillation, creating a time-averaged minimum at the cell`s geometric center, which marks the future division site. Interestingly, the Gram-positive model species Bacillus subtilis also encodes homologous proteins: the cell division inhibitor MinC and the Walker-ATPase MinD. However, B. subtilis lacks the activating protein MinE, which is essential for Min dynamics in E. coli. We have shown before that the B. subtilis Min system is highly dynamic and quickly relocalizes to active sites of division. This raised questions about how Min protein dynamics are regulated on a molecular level in B. subtilis. Here, we show with a combination of in vitro experiments and in vivo single-molecule imaging that the ATPase activity of B. subtilis MinD is activated solely by membrane binding. Additionally, both monomeric and dimeric MinD bind to the membrane, and binding of ATP to MinD is a prerequisite for fast membrane detachment. Single-molecule localization microscopy data confirm membrane binding of monomeric MinD variants. However, only wild type MinD enriches at cell poles and sites of ongoing division, likely due to interaction with MinJ. Monomeric MinD variants and locked dimers remain distributed along the membrane and lack the characteristic pattern formation. Single-molecule tracking data further support that MinD has a freely diffusive population, which is increased in the monomeric variants and a membrane binding defective mutant. Thus, MinD dynamics in B. subtilis do not require any unknown protein component and can be fully explained by MinD`s binding and unbinding kinetics with the membrane. The generation of MinD patterns relies on the short-lived temporal residence of MinD dimers at the membrane.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

A recent federal ban prevents SSPs from using federal funding to procure safer smoking supplies. There is a lack of research on safer smoking supply distribution and harm reduction outcomes. Therefore, we assessed the relationship between distribution of safer smoking supplies by SSPs and levels of participant engagement and naloxone distribution.

MethodsWe used data from the 2023 National Survey of Syringe Services Programs (NSSSP) (N=429), which measured services delivered in 2022. SSPs reported whether they distributed safer smoking pipes (yes/no). We examined the relationship between safer smoking pipe distribution and two outcomes: the number of participant encounters and naloxone doses distributed.

ResultsThere were 187 SSPs (43.6%) that distributed pipes for smoking to participants. Compared to SSPs that did not distribute pipes, those that distributed pipes reported more participant encounters (aRR=1.49, 95% CI: 1.09-2.02) and naloxone dose distribution (aRR=1.21, 95% CI: 0.89-1.65), though this latter finding was not statistically significant.

ConclusionsFindings showed SSPs distributing safer smoking pipes had more participant engagement and naloxone distribution. To maximize their full individual and population-level health benefits, SSPs should be supported technically, legally, and financially to implement safer smoking supply distribution for their participants.

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3, which convergently acquired S protein substitutions such as S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Furthermore, JN.1 subvariants such as LB.1 and KP.2.3, which convergently acquired S:S31del in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. Here we investigated the virological properties of KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

When applied to unicellular eukaryotes such as Plasmodium parasites, scRNA-seq provides a single-cell resolution particularly valuable to study complex infections which are often comprised of mixed life stages and clones. Until now, the application of scRNA-seq has been mainly limited to in vitro and animal malaria models, despite known transcriptional differences as compared to circulating parasite populations. This is primarily due to the challenges of working with Plasmodium natural infections in endemic settings. We validated sample preparation methods and a novel single-cell RNA sequencing technology for the first time in P. knowlesi parasites which can be effectively implemented to analyze natural infections in low-resource settings. We recovered 22,345 P. knowlesi single-cell transcriptomes containing all asexual blood stages from 6 in vitro culture samples, with conditions mimicking natural infections, and generated the most extensive P. knowlesi single-cell dataset to date. All 6 samples produced reproducible circular UMAP projections with consistent cluster localization and high gene expression correlation, regardless of the sample preparation methods used. Biomarker expression and life stage annotation using the Malaria Cell Atlas P. knowlesi reference dataset further confirmed these results. In conclusion, the combination of adaptable sample preparation methods with novel preservation and scRNA-seq technology has the potential to fundamentally transform the study of natural infections. This approach unlocks the use of scRNA-seq in field studies which will lead to new insights into Plasmodium parasite biology.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

While the factors responsible for this ""lipid divide"" remain unclear, this has important implications for understanding the evolutionary history of eukaryotes, which likely originated from within the Archaea and therefore changed membrane composition from isoprenoid-based to fatty acid-based lipids. Here, using 13C labelling studies, we demonstrate that the archaeal model organisms Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and Haloferax volcanii are capable of de novo fatty acid synthesis. Biochemical characterization and in vitro pathway reconstitution identify the key enzymes of a newly proposed fatty acid synthesis pathway in S. acidocaldarius and show that ketothiolase, ketoacyl-CoA reductase, and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase form a stable assembly mediated by a DUF35 domain protein, which represents the first characterization of an archaeal fatty acid synthase complex. The final step is catalysed by an NADPH-dependent enoyl-CoA reductase. Deletion of the enoyl-CoA reductase demonstrate that this pathway operates in vivo in S. acidocaldarius. The presented results including phylogenetic analysis reveal that the potential to synthesize fatty acids is widespread across archaeal lineages.

Here, we investigated the performance of MINFLUX imaging for different synaptic targets and fluorescent labels in tissue sections of the mouse brain. Single fluorophores were localized with a precision of < 5 nm at up to 80 m sample depth. MINFLUX imaging in two color channels allowed to probe PSD95 localization relative to the spine head morphology, while also visualizing presynaptic VGlut clustering and AMPA receptor clustering at the post-synapse. Our two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) two-color MINFLUX results in tissue, with < 10 nm 3D fluorophore localization, open up new avenues to investigate protein distributions on the single-synapse level in fixed and living brain slices.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

C. difficile YabG processes cortex destined proteins preproSleC into proSleC and CspBA to CspB and CspA. YabG also affects synthesis of spore coat/exosporium proteins CotA and CdeM. In prior work that identified CspA as the co-germinant receptor, mutations in yabG were found which altered the co-germinants required to initiate spore germination. To understand how these mutations in the yabG locus contribute to C. difficile spore germination, we introduced these mutations into an isogenic background. Spores derived from C. difficile yabGC207A (catalytically inactive), C. difficile yabGA46D, C. difficile yabGG37E, and C. difficile yabGP153L strains germinated in response to TA alone. Recombinantly expressed and purified preproSleC incubated with E. coli lysate expressing wild type YabG resulted in the removal of the pre sequence from preproSleC. Interestingly, only YabGA46D showed any activity towards purified preproSleC. Mutation of the YabG processing site in preproSleC (R119A) led to YabG shifting its processing to R115 or R112. Finally, changes in yabG expression under the mutant promoters were analyzed using a SNAP-tag and revealed expression differences at early and late stages of sporulation. Overall, our results support and expand upon the hypothesis that YabG is important for germination and spore assembly and, upon mutation of the processing site, can shift where it cleaves substrates.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

TRPML1 can be allosterically regulated by various ligands including natural lipids and small synthetic molecules and the channel undergoes a global movement propagated from ligand-induced local conformational changes upon activation. In this study, we identified a functionally critical residue, Tyr404, at the C-terminus of the S4 helix, whose mutations to tryptophan and alanine yield gain- and loss-of-function channels, respectively. These allosteric mutations mimic the ligand activation or inhibition of the TRPML1 channel without interfering with ligand binding and both mutant channels are susceptible to agonist or antagonist modulation, making them better targets for screening potent TRPML1 activators and inhibitors. We also determined the high-resolution structure of TRPML1 in complex with the PI(4,5)P2 inhibitor, revealing the structural basis underlying this lipid inhibition. In addition, an endogenous phospholipid likely from sphingomyelin is identified in the PI(4,5)P2-bound TRPML1 structure at the same hotspot for agonists and antagonists, providing a plausible structural explanation for the inhibitory effect of sphingomyelin on agonist activation.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

Rewiring catabolism is essential for harnessing industrial biotechnology but remains a substantial metabolic engineering challenge due to its high genetic stability and tight regulation acquired through evolution. In this study, by combining metabolic modeling, rational engineering, and adaptive laboratory evolution, we fundamentally redesigned bacterial catabolism. We created a new-to-nature shikimate pathway-dependent catabolism (SDC) in Pseudomonas putida by reprogramming the shikimate pathway as the primary catabolic route. SDC supports growth by supplying the glycerol catabolic end-product pyruvate, enabling superior production of shikimate pathway-derived molecules. Through SDC, aromatics production reached over 89% of the pathway's maximum theoretical yield, setting a new benchmark for their microbial synthesis. Our study successfully repurposed an anabolic pathway for catabolism, exemplifying the high metabolic plasticity of microbes and providing a bacterial chassis for the efficient production of high-added value compounds.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

However, there is currently no accurate way to risk-stratify patients with LGD, leading to both over- and under-treatment of cancer risk. Here we show that the burden of somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) within resected LGD lesions strongly predicts future cancer development. We performed a retrospective multi-centre validated case-control study of n=122 patients (40 progressors, 82 non-progressors, 270 LGD regions). Low coverage whole genome sequencing revealed CNA burden was significantly higher in progressors than non-progressors (p=2x10-6 in discovery cohort) and was a very significant predictor of CRC risk in univariate analysis (odds ratio = 36; p=9x10-7), outperforming existing clinical risk factors such as lesion size, shape and focality. Optimal risk prediction was achieved with a multivariate model combining CNA burden with the known clinical risk factor of incomplete LGD resection. The measurement of CNAs in LGD lesions is a robust, low-cost and rapidly translatable predictor of CRC risk in IBD that can be used to direct management and so prevent CRC in high-risk individuals whilst sparing those at low-risk from unnecessary intervention.","NA","medrxiv",1720562898947

With a single sequencing reaction, we were able to simultaneously identify and map most of the known modification types in rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA. Subsequently, a multifaceted approach integrating different algorithms for data analysis, deletion mutants, mass spectrometry, qPCR, and in vitro methylation was implemented to evaluate the presence of m5C and m6A in E. coli. Known m5C and m6A sites in rRNA were confirmed, but these modifications could not be localized in the mRNA. Nevertheless, based on the sequencing data, modifications were found to be enriched in the coding regions of genes associated with general metabolism and RNA processing.

Due to the limited spatiotemporal precision of established methods for molecular tracking, current knowledge of dynein stepping is essentially limited to slowed-down measurements in vitro. Here, we use MINFLUX fluorophore localization to directly track CRISPR/Cas9-tagged endogenous dynein with nanometer/millisecond precision in living primary neurons. We show that endogenous dynein primarily takes 8 nm steps, including frequent sideways steps but few backward steps. Strikingly, the majority of direction reversals between retrograde and anterograde movement occurred on the time scale of single steps (16 ms), suggesting a rapid regulatory reversal mechanism. Tug-of-war-like behavior during pauses or reversals was unexpectedly rare. By analyzing the dwell time between steps, we concluded that a single rate-limiting process underlies the dynein stepping mechanism whereby dynein consumes one adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) per step. Our study underscores the power of MINFLUX localization to elucidate the spatiotemporal changes underlying protein function in living cells.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

Mitochondrial activity is modulated by the processes of mitochondrial fission and fusion, which are required to properly balance respiratory and metabolic functions, transfer material between mitochondria, and remove defective mitochondria. Mitochondrial fission occurs at sites of contact between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, and is dependent on the formation of actin filaments that drive mitochondrial constriction and the recruitment and activation of the dynamin-related GTPase fission protein DRP1. The requirement for mitochondria- and ER-associated actin filaments in mitochondrial fission remains unclear, and the role of actin in mitochondrial fusion remains entirely unexplored. Here we show that preventing the formation of actin filaments on either mitochondria or the ER disrupts both mitochondrial fission and fusion. We show that fusion but not fission is dependent on Arp2/3, whereas both fission and fusion are dependent on INF2 formin-dependent actin polymerization. We also show that mitochondria-associated actin marks fusion sites prior to the dynamin family GTPase fusion protein MFN2. Together, our work introduces a novel method for perturbing organelle-associated actin filaments, and demonstrates a previously unknown role for actin in mitochondrial fusion.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

Here, we focus on B vitamin exchange in coastal marine bacterial communities that degrade particulate organic matter and find that natural seawater communities are vitamin limited. While almost a third of bacterial isolates from these communities are B vitamin auxotrophs, the pioneering degraders that first arrive on particles are vitamin producers that likely support auxotrophs through cross-feeding. However, combining experiments and a resource-explicit model, we show that auxotroph growth is often not restored by coculture with vitamin producers, but rather requires lysis and subsequent vitamin recycling. Our results highlight the importance of vitamin auxotrophies and lysis-mediated cross-feeding as important factors controlling microbial community assembly and succession on marine particles.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

In order to determine which view better describes human decision-making, we developed a novel, foraging-inspired sequential decision-making model and used it to ask whether humans compare to threshold (""Forage"") or compare alternatives (""Reinforcement-Learn"" [RL]). We found that the foraging model was a better fit for participant behavior, better predicted the participants' tendency to repeat choices, and predicted the existence of held-out participants with a pattern of choice that was almost impossible under RL. Together, these results suggest that humans use foraging computations, rather than RL, even in classic reinforcement learning tasks.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

Metastatic progression is characterised by extensive remodelling of the extracellular matrix, primarily mediated by secreted matrix metalloproteinases, including members of the 'a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motif' (ADAMTS) family. In particular, ADAMTS5 has been reported to be upregulated in ovarian malignant tumours compared to borderline and benign lesions, suggesting it might play a role in metastatic progression. Furthermore, it has been suggested that Rab25, a small GTPase of the Ras family, might upregulate ADAMTS5 expression in ovarian cancer cells. Here we demonstrated that Rab25 promotes ADAMTS5 expression, through the activation of the NF-{kappa}B signalling pathway. Furthermore, ADAMTS5 was necessary and sufficient to stimulate ovarian cancer cell migration through complex fibroblast-secreted matrices, while ADAMTS5 inhibition prevented ovarian cancer spheroid invasion in 3D systems. Finally, in ovarian cancer patients high ADAMTS5 expression correlated with poor prognosis. Altogether, these data identify ADAMTS5 as a novel regulator of ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion, suggesting it might represent a novel therapeutic target to prevent ovarian metastasis.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

Here we use quantitative live cell imaging combined with computational inference to determine how changes in global protein synthesis rates alter protein decay rates. We identified two modes of adaptation hinging on differential responses of the cell cycle to changes in protein synthesis rates. A passive adaptation of protein degradation and dilution rates operates in cells tightly coupling proliferation rate to protein synthesis rates, allowing to partially buffer changes in proteome concentrations with increased loss of short-lived proteins. In contrast, the proliferation rate of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) is hyposensitive to moderate changes in protein synthesis. mESCs uncouple protein degradation and dilution rates and robustly maintain their protein levels. Our work illuminates the complex interplay between protein synthesis, degradation, and cell division to regulate proteome homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

Here we characterise the growth of the isolate Nitrobacter strain NHB1 as a function of pH and nitrite (NO2-) concentration, and its influence on the activity of acidophilic soil ammonia-oxidising archaea (AOA). NHB1 is acidotolerant and grows optimally at pH 6.0 (range 5.0 - 7.5) at initial NO2- concentrations of 500 M. However, the optimum decreases to pH 5.0 at lower initial NO2- concentrations typically found in soil, with detectable growth down to pH 3.5. NHB1 has a comparatively high affinity for NO2- with an apparent-half-saturation constant (54 M) one order of magnitude lower than its closest relative, the neutrophilic strain Nitrobacter hamburgensis X14. In co-culture, NHB1 enhances the growth of acidophilic AOA. Specifically, Nitrosotalea devaniterrae Nd1 and Nitrosotalea sinensis Nd2 are sensitive to NO2--derived compounds and only oxidise ~200-300 M ammonia (NH3) in batch cultures. However, in co-culture with NHB1, pH ranges were lowered by ~0.5 pH units and both strains could oxidise up to 3 mM NH3, only limited by buffering capacity. NHB1 possesses a cyanase facilitating reciprocal cross-feeding via generating cyanate-derived NH3 and utilising AOA-derived NO2-. Removal of NO2- is likely crucial for the growth of nitrifiers in acidic soils and this study highlights the importance of considering substrate and metabolic product concentrations when characterising physiology. Genome analysis reveals NHB1 is distinct from validated species and the name ""Nitrobacter laanbroekii"" is proposed.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

Computer vision tools for automated monitoring have the potential to revolutionize insect study and conservation. The advancement of light traps with camera-based monitoring systems for insects necessitates effective and flexible pipelines for analysing recorded images. In this paper, we present a flexible and fast processing pipeline designed to analyse these recordings by detecting, tracking and classifying nocturnal insects at the taxonomic ranks of order, suborder as well as the resolution of individual moth species. The pipeline consists of four adaptable steps. The first step detect insects in the camera trap images. An order and suborder classifier with anomaly detection is proposed to filter dark, blurry or partly visible insects that will be uncertain to classify correctly. A simple track-by-detection algorithm is proposed to track the classified insects by incorporating feature embeddings, distance and area cost. We evaluated the computational speed and power performance of different edge computing devices (Raspberry Pis and NVIDIA Jetson Nano) and compared various time-lapse strategies with tracking. The minimum difference was found for 2-minute time-lapse intervals compared to tracking with 0.5 frames per second, however, for insects with fewer than one detection per night, the Pearson correlation decreases. Shifting from tracking to time-lapse monitoring would reduce the amount of recorded images and be able to perform edge processing of images in real-time on a camera trap with Raspberry Pi. The Jetson Nano is the most energy-efficient solution, capable of real-time tracking at nearly 0.5 fps. Our processing pipeline was applied to more than 3.4 million images recorded at 0.5 frames per second from 12 light camera traps during one full season located in diverse habitats, including bogs, heaths and forests.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

Pakistan with its sociocultural and ethnic diversity, has the fifth largest population in the world. There was no prior high-quality nationally representative data on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and their socio-demographic correlates for Pakistan. To fill this gap in the planning of mental health services, the Pakistan Psychiatric Society conducted the National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (NPMS) of Pakistan, in the years 2019-2022. Aim: To estimate the prevalence and socio-demographic correlates of psychiatric morbidity in a representative sample of Pakistan. Methods: The cross-sectional NPMS collected data from the four provinces of Pakistan. After selection through a three-stage, stratified, random cluster sampling technique we interviewed 17,773 adults above the age of 18. We used the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI Version 7.0.2) to evaluate psychiatric morbidity. Current and lifetime precise and weighted prevalence is reported according to ICD-10 (International Classification of Disease-10th version). We used multivariate logistic regression to investigate the association between the risk of psychiatric illness and sociodemographic variables. National Bio-ethic Committee of Pakistan granted approval of survey. Results: The lifetime and current weighted prevalence of all psychiatric disorder is 37.91% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) =37.22-38.59) and 32.28% (95% CI=31.62-32.94) respectively. The weighted prevalence of common psychiatric disorders in Pakistan included Mood Disorders (F30-F39; 19.62%), Neurotic and Stress-related Disorders (F40 F48; 24.81%), Psychotic Disorders (F20-F29; 4.52%) and Mental and Behavioural Problems due to Psychoactive Substance use (F10-F19; 0.85%). The psychiatric disorders had an association with age, female gender, urban living, lower income and being divorced. Among participants, 6.17% acknowledged suicidality in the past month, while 1.05% acknowledged a lifetime suicide attempt. Conclusion: The NPMS is the first nationally representative study of psychiatric morbidities in Pakistan. The data from this survey can be utilized for designing and implementing mental health services and support programmes in the country.","NA","medrxiv",1720562898947

Therefore, sophisticated instrumentation is needed to perform in-situ sequencing or sequential fluorescence insitu hybridization imaging, restricting the widespread adoption of spatial RNA imaging methods among biological research communities. Here, we present  Profiling of RNA In-situ through Single-round of iMaging (PRISM), which leverages the spectral intensity levels to expand the coding capacity. With a radius vector coding strategy to ensure the orthogonality of codewords, PRISM can reach up to 64-plex RNA imaging in a single imaging shot with conventional microscopes. As a panel-based spatial transcriptomic imaging approach, the entire experimental process can be completed within one day. We verified PRISMs versatility on various tissues, such as mouse brains, mouse embryos, and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples, generating more than 5.7 million annotated cells. We performed quasi-3D spatial landscapes to track major cell types in different organs during embryonic development from E12.5 to E14.5. We also revealed the critical role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) on immune infiltration and immune response heterogeneity within and between tumor microenvironments. We extended PRISM to 100-{micro}m thick mouse brain slices to generate accurate 3D cell atlas and subcellular RNA localization landscapes.

To address this, we developed Plasmid2MC, a cell-free method using {Phi}C31 recombination to efficiently excise the bacterial backbone from conventionally prepared plasmids, while mcDNA purification steps digest all DNA impurities and reduce endotoxin levels.

The increasing development of antibiotic resistance in this organism is a global health concern. The A. baumannii clinical isolate AB307-0294 produces a type VI secretion system (T6SS) that delivers three antibacterial cargo effector proteins (Tse15, Tde16 and Tae17) that give this strain a competitive advantage against other bacteria in polymicrobial environments. These effectors are delivered via specific non-covalent interactions with the T6SS needle tip proteins VgrG15, VgrG16 and VgrG17, respectively. Here we determine the molecular function of the Tae17 effector protein and define the regions of Tae17 and VgrG17 essential for its delivery. Specifically, we show that Tae17 is a multidomain, bifunctional peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme. Tae17 has both lytic transglycosylase activity, which targets the peptidoglycan sugar backbone, and amidase activity, which targets the sugar-peptide bonds. Moreover, we show that the transglycosylase activity was more important for killing Escherichia coli. Using deletion constructs and bacterial two-hybrid analyses, we identify that amino acids 1051-1085 of the VgrG17 needle tip protein and amino acids 1-162 of the Tae17 effector protein are necessary for the Tae17:VgrG17 interaction. Furthermore, we identify the VgrG17 amino acids G1069 and W1075 as crucial for the delivery of Tae17; the first time such specific delivery determinants of T6SS cargo effectors have been defined. This study provides molecular insight into how the T6SS allows A. baumannii strains to gain dominance in polymicrobial communities and thus improve their chances of survival and transmission.

IMPORTANCEWe have shown that the Acinetobacter baumannii T6SS effector Tae17 is a modular, bifunctional, peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme that has both lytic transglycosylase and amidase activity. Both activities contribute to the ability to degrade peptidoglycan, but the glycosyltransferase activity was more important for the interbacterial killing of Escherichia coli. We have defined the specific regions of Tae17 and its cognate delivery protein VgrG17 that are necessary for the non-covalent interactions and, for the first time, identified specific amino acids essential for delivery. This work contributes to our molecular understanding of bacterial competition strategies in polymicrobial environments and may provide a window to the design of new therapeutic approaches for combating infection by A. baumannii.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947
"Dichotomy between extracellular signatures of active dendritic chemical synapses and gap junctions","10.1101/2024.07.04.602060","biorxiv",4.05,4.05,4.05,4.05,4.05,"Sirmaur, R.; Narayanan, R.","Rishikesh Narayanan","Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore","2024-07-08","1","new results","cc_no","neuroscience","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/07/08/2024.07.04.602060.source.xml","Background and motivation: Local field potentials (LFPs) are compound signals comprising synaptic currents and several transmembrane currents from active structures, which represent the dynamic flow of information across the brain. Although LFP analyses have remained largely limited to chemical synaptic inputs, neurons and other cell types also receive gap junctional inputs that play essential roles in neuronal and network physiology. Gap junctional inputs have been historically excluded from LFP analyses because, unlike synaptic receptors, these inputs are not mediated by transmembrane currents that involve the extracellular space. However, the voltage response to gap junctional inputs onto active compartments triggers several transmembrane currents across the neuron. Therefore, two fundamental questions required for enhanced accuracy of LFP interpretations are: (i) Do gap junctional inputs onto active compartments contribute to LFPs? (ii) Are there differences in extracellular signatures associated with gap junctional vs. chemical synaptic inputs onto active compartments? Methodology: We built morphologically realistic conductance-based neuronal models and placed a 3D array of extracellular electrodes spanning the somato-dendritic stretch. We employed different types of inputs: (i) synchronous; (ii) random; and (iii) rhythmic (1-128 Hz). We computed LFPs at all electrodes and analyzed the spatiotemporal profiles of intra- and extra-cellular voltages for several model configurations, involving different input types, with active vs. passive dendrites, with gap junctions vs. chemical synapses, and in the presence vs. absence of different ion channels. Results: We demonstrate a striking reversal in the polarity of extracellular potentials associated with synchronous inputs through chemical synapses vs. gap junctions onto active dendrites. Whereas synchronous inputs through chemical synapses yielded a negative deflection in proximal electrodes, those onto gap junctions manifested a positive deflection. Importantly, we observed extracellular dipoles only when inputs arrived through chemical synapses, but not with gap junctions. Remarkably, the slow hyperpolarization-activation cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which typically conduct inward currents, mediated outward currents triggered by the fast voltage transition caused by synchronous inputs. With random inputs, extracellular potentials in proximal electrodes were largely negative with chemical synapses but were biphasic with gap junctional inputs. Finally, with rhythmic inputs arriving through gap junctions, we found strong suppression of LFP power at higher frequencies. There were frequency-dependent differences in the spike phase associated with the LFP, depending on whether inputs arrived through gap junctions or chemical synapses. LFP differences across all input types were mediated by the relative dominance of synaptic currents vs. voltage-driven transmembrane currents with chemical synapses vs. gap junctions, respectively. Implications: Our analyses unveil a prominent role for gap junctional connections in shaping the spatiotemporal and spectral profiles of extracellular potentials, with critical implications for polarities and spatial spread of LFPs. The stark dichotomies in extracellular signatures associated with gap junctional vs. chemical synaptic inputs imply that conclusions could be erroneous if cells were incorrectly assumed to be exclusively receiving chemical synaptic inputs.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

Nanotiming solely demands the labelling of asynchronously growing cells with an innocuous dose of BrdU during one doubling time followed by BrdU quantification along nanopore reads. We demonstrate in yeast S. cerevisiae that Nanotiming precisely reproduces RT profiles generated by reference methods in wild-type and mutant cells inactivated for known RT determinants, for one-tenth of the cost. Nanotiming is simple, accurate, inexpensive, amenable to large-scale analyses, and is capable of unveiling RT at individual telomeres, revealing that Rif1 iconic telomere regulator directly delays the replication only of telomeres with specific subtelomeric elements.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

However, how the diversity of centromeres evolved, ranging from localized centromeres in monocentric species to complex chromosome-wide distributed centromere regions in holocentric species, remains elusive. Our cellular and genomic analyses in Timema stick insects reveal that within cell variation of the major centromere protein CenH3 recapitulates the variation typically observed across species. While CenH3-containing nucleosomes are distributed in a monocentric fashion on autosomes and bind tandem repeat sequences specific to individual or small groups of chromosomes, they exhibit a holocentric-like distribution on the sex chromosome and bind to more complex intergenic regions. Despite this contrasting distribution, all chromosomes, including the sex chromosome, attach to spindle microtubules at a single location, marking the first instance of a functionally monocentric species with holocentric-like attributes. Together, our findings highlight the potential for gradual transitions towards holocentricity or CenH3-independent centromere determination, and help to understand the rapid centromere sequence divergence between species.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

Spatially, all flicker frequencies evoked responses in V1 corresponding to retinotopic stimulus location, but some evoked additional peaks. These flicker-induced cortical patterns displayed standing wave characteristics and matched linear wave equation solutions in an area restricted to the visual cortex.

Texture, however, remains a surprisingly unexplored aspect, despite providing key information about the state of the food through properties such as hardness, liquidity, and granularity. Food perception is achieved by specialised sensory neurons, which themselves are defined by the receptor genes they express. While it was assumed that sensory neurons respond to one or few closely-related stimuli, more recent findings challenge this notion and support evidence that certain sensory neurons are more broadly tuned. In the Drosophila taste system, gustatory neurons respond to cues of opposing hedonic valence or to olfactory cues. Here, we identified that larvae ingest and navigate towards specific food substrate hardnesses, and probed the role of gustatory organs in this behaviour. By developing a genetic tool targeting specifically gustatory organs, we show that these organs are major contributors for evaluation of food texture and ingestion decision-making. We find that ablation of gustatory organs not only results in loss of chemosensation, but also navigation and ingestion preference to varied substrate textures. Furthermore, we show that certain neurons in the primary taste organ exhibit varied and concurrent physiological responses to mechanical and multimodal stimulation. We show that individual neurons house independent mechanisms for multiple sensory modalities, challenging assumptions about capabilities of sensory neurons. We propose that further investigations, across the animal kingdom, may reveal higher sensory complexity than currently anticipated.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

However, the neural mechanisms underlying these processes are still debated. We showed that forming relations between arbitrary action-outcome associations involved building a cognitive map. Using a novel immersive virtual reality paradigm, participants learned 2D abstract motor action-outcome associations and later compared action combinations while their brain activity was monitored with fMRI. We observed a hexadirectional modulation of the activity in entorhinal cortex while participants compared different action plans. Furthermore, hippocampal activity scaled with the 2D similarity between outcomes of these action plans. Conversely, the supplementary motor area (SMA) represented individual actions, showing a stronger response to overlapping action plans. Crucially, the connectivity between hippocampus and SMA was modulated by the similarity between the action plans, suggesting their complementary roles in action evaluation. These findings provide evidence for the role of cognitive maps in action selection, challenging classical models of memory taxonomy and its neural bases.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

They form superhelical structures around which DNA is wrapped. Recent studies have shown that some archaea and bacteria contain alternative histones that exhibit different DNA binding properties, in addition to highly divergent sequences. However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

Predictive processing theories posit that psychedelics work by loosening priors or high-level beliefs, including ingrained biases that have become pathological, leading to shifts in bottom-up vs top-down information processing that reconfigure perception, cognition, and mood. Because 5-HT2A receptors, the primary target of psychedelics, are enriched in visual cortices, we investigated whether psychedelics alter visual processing in a manner consistent with predictive processing theories. People who recently (<3 weeks) used 5-HT2A-agonist psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) exhibited slowed response latencies and increased cortical involvement in generating saccades to targets in predictable locations, along with a generalization of sensory prediction errors (i.e., deviance detection) during passive visual processing. Individuals who recently used a 5-HT1A- selective psychedelic (5-MeO-DMT) displayed similar changes in saccade production, but unaltered deviance detection, suggesting circuit-specific effects. Mice administered DOI (5- HT2A-agonist) exhibited altered deviance detection within primary visual cortex (V1), along with weakened top-down feedback to V1 from higher cortical area ACa. These results concord with the hypothesis that psychedelics shift the balance from top-down to bottom-up in sensory cortical circuits - an effect that persists beyond the acute exposure period.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

We observed history-dependent spike back-propagation in distal dendrites, driven by locally generated Na+ spikes (dSpikes). Dendritic depolarization created a transient window for dSpike propagation, opened by A-type KV channel inactivation, and closed by slow NaV inactivation. Collisions of dSpikes with synaptic inputs triggered calcium channel and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent plateau potentials, with accompanying complex spikes at the soma.

Clade I MPXV is prevalent in Central Africa and characterized by severe disease and high mortality, while Clade II is confined to West Africa and associated with milder illness. A Clade IIb MPXV emerged in Nigeria in 2017, with protracted human-to-human transmission a forerunner of the global Clade II B.1 lineage outbreak in 2022. In October 2023, a large mpox outbreak emerged in the Kamituga mining region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), of which we conducted an outbreak investigation.

MethodsSurveillance data and hospital records were collected between October 2023 and January 2024. Blood samples and skin/oropharyngeal swabs were obtained for molecular diagnosis at the National Institute of Biomedical Research, Kinshasa. MPXV genomes were sequenced and analyzed using Illumina NextSeq 2000 and bioinformatic tools.

ResultsThe Kamituga mpox outbreak spread rapidly, with 241 suspected cases reported within 5 months of the first reported case. Of 108 confirmed cases, 29% were sex workers, highlighting sexual contact as a key mode of infection. Genomic analysis revealed a distinct MPXV Clade Ib lineage, divergent from previously sequenced Clade I strains in DRC. Predominance of APOBEC3-type mutations and estimated time of emergence around mid-September 2023 suggest recent human-to-human transmission.

ConclusionsUrgent measures, including reinforced, expanded surveillance, contact tracing, case management support, and targeted vaccination are needed to contain this new pandemic-potential Clade Ib outbreak.","10.1038/s41591-024-03130-3","medrxiv",1720562898947

Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans.

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

There is a dire need to explore and invent new and effective therapeutic modalities for T2D.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

In conclusion, our results suggest that consumption of combined CBD and probiotics could be used as a natural, practical, affordable, and safe alternative and complementary therapeutic modality to treat T2D.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses.

Given the recent detection of HPAI H5N1 in dairy cattle and H5N1 RNA detections in pasteurized retail milk in the United States, we established the Pan-Canadian Milk (PCM) Network. Through our network of collaborators from across Canada, retail milk is being procured longitudinally and sent to a central laboratory for testing for the presence of influenza A virus RNA. To date (20 June 2024), we have tested 84 retail milk samples from all ten Canadian provinces (NL, NS, PEI, NB, QC, ON, MB, SK, AB, and BC) and all have tested negative for influenza A virus RNA. Testing is ongoing and these results will be updated on rolling basis as additional data becomes available. Despite no known HPAI infections of dairy cattle in Canada to date, H5N1 poses a significant threat to the health of both humans and other animals. Routine surveillance of retail milk on a national scale will allow for monitoring of infected dairy cattle on an ongoing basis in a cost-effective, standardized, scalable and easily accessible manner. Our network and testing will act as an early detection system to help inform containment and mitigation activities if positive samples are identified.","NA","medrxiv",1720562898947

The striped variety has attracted particular attention for its intricate and unpredictable patterns. A good understanding of the mechanism that drives the striped pattern formation of the broken tulips has been missing since the 17th century. It is known since 1928 that these patterned tulips suffer from a viral infection by the tulip breaking virus. Here, we present a mathematical model to understand how a virus infection of the petals can lead to stripes, thereby solving a 350 year old mystery. The model, which describes the viral inhibition of pigment expression (anthocyanins) and their interaction with viral reproduction, incorporates a pattern formation mechanism identified as an activator-substrate mechanism, similar to the well-known Turing instability, working together with a Wolperts positional information mechanism. The model is solved on a growing tulip petal shaped domain, whereby we introduce a new method to describe the tulip petal growth explicitly. This work contributes to the theory of pattern formation of reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains applied to the fields of virology and botany.","NA","biorxiv",1720562898947

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1720562898947

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.
