As IP occurs only in recall immune responses, we investigated the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of unvaccinated individual to determine whether their immune response aligned with the primary or recall immune response patterns. Analysis of the Ig isotype response trajectories to the Mpro, NP, and S structural proteins and the S RBD in this group of 191 patients and 44 controls revealed a pattern of recall response in 94.2 % of cases. The levels of antibodies correlated positively with the severity of the condition rather than a milder course. High-resolution flow cytometry of fresh PBMNCs showed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cell subsets, and cTfh, suggesting a recall response. The transcriptomic profile demonstrated that this group was directly comparable to other contemporary cohorts. Overall, these findings support the idea that the response to SARS-CoV-2 is, in most cases, a recall response, likely due to B and T memory cells to CCCV, and therefore susceptible to immune imprinting and antibody-dependent enhancement.","NA","medrxiv",1731103694554

Asymmetrical Fc mutations (ATVcisLALA) allowed the molecule to selectively retain effector function only when bound to A{beta} while mitigating TfR-related hematology liabilities. Mice treated with ATVcisLALA:A{beta} exhibited broad brain parenchymal antibody distribution; in contrast, anti-A{beta} IgG was highly enriched at arterial perivascular spaces where vascular A{beta} localizes and likely plays a role in induction of ARIA.

COVID-19 vaccines that are more closely matched to circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages elicit more potent and relevant immune responses that translate to improved real-world vaccine effectiveness. The rise in prevalence of the Omicron JN.1 lineage, and subsequent derivative sublineages such as KP.2 and KP.3, coincided with reduced neutralizing activity and effectiveness of Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted vaccines. Here, we characterized the biophysical and immunologic attributes of BNT162b2 JN.1- and KP.2-adapted mRNA vaccine-encoded spike (S) protein immunogens. Biophysical interrogations of S revealed the structural consequences of hallmark amino acid substitutions and a potential molecular mechanism of immune escape employed by JN.1 and KP.2. The vaccine candidates were evaluated for their immunogenicity when administered as fourth or fifth doses in BNT162b2-experienced mice or as a primary series in naive mice. In both vaccine-experienced and naive settings, JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccines conferred improved neutralizing responses over the BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 vaccine against a broad panel of emerging JN.1 sublineages, including the predominant KP.3.1.1 and emerging XEC lineages. Antigenic mapping of neutralizing responses indicated greater antigenic overlap of JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccine responses with currently circulating sublineages compared to an XBB.1.5-adapted vaccine. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were generally conserved across all three vaccines. Together, the data support the selection of JN.1- or KP.2-adapted vaccines for the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine formula.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694554

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US. It remains unclear, however, how medical and societal changes during this period affected national chronic pain prevalence, a key dimension of population health.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic and explore reasons driving the trends

MethodsWe use data from the 2019, 2021, and 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a multi-wave cross-sectional survey. Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian US population age 18 and older (n=88,469). Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; some models include additional 19 covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of COVID and long COVID. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP also increased from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019, to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023, after a decline to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021. The 2023 increases occurred in all examined body sites except for dental pain. COVID and long COVID had a modest role in the population-wide pain increases, the causes of which remain unclear.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before the pandemic but surged dramatically since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1731103694554

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694554

A key factor in their success is the ability to filter out erroneous k-mers by removing those with low abundance. However, the vast number of distinct k-mers makes k-mer counting a significant resource bottleneck. Early tools addressed this issue by storing k-mers on disk. To mitigate the excessive redundancy caused by overlapping k-mers, super-k-mers were introduced, significantly decreasing memory usage. Nevertheless, consecutive super-k-mers still overlap by k - 1 bases, leading to some degree of inefficiency. In this work, we introduce hyper-k-mers, a novel approach that further reduces redundancy. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we propose hyper-k-mers, a new representation of k-mers that asymptotically decreases duplication compared to super-k-mers. Second, we present a theoretical analysis comparing the space efficiency of super-k-mers, syncmers, and hyper-k-mers. Our approach offers significant advantages by reducing the asymptotic lower bound from 6 bits per nucleotide for super-k-mers to 4 bits per kmer. Third, we present KFC, a k-mer counting algorithm that leverages hyper-k-mers. KFC offers significant practical advantages, including an order of magnitude improvement in memory usage compared to state-of-the-art tools. Notably, our experiments show that KFC is the only tool whose resource usage does not scale linearly with the size of k and is the fastest option for large k-mer sizes. Our tool KFC is open-source under AGPL3 and available at https://github.com/lrobidou/KFC along with the experiments scripts at https://github.com/imartayan/KFC_experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694554

Related taxa tend to also live in similar ecological niches - this trend is termed Niche conservatism. Both concepts are widely used to understand crucial aspects of evolution and speciation and are well-established in animals and plants. The extension of these concepts to microorganisms is however challenging and thus far only assumed. Here, we hypothesize that two closely related microbial species, if indeed similar in both their morphology and their ecological niche, should be found in samples with similar community compositions. We propose ""community conservatism"" to refer to this, and leverage a database with millions of samples and hundreds of thousands of pairs of microbial taxa to assess their relatedness and the similarity of the communities they occupy. Our findings reveal that community conservatism can be observed globally in all environments and phyla tested, to varying extents. Ecologically specialized taxa show a stronger community conservatism signal than generalists, and the signal can be discerned over nearly all taxonomic ranks. Analyzing community conservatism shows promise to advance our understanding of evolution, speciation, and the mechanisms governing community assembly in microorganisms. Furthermore, we propose it can be used to reintegrate ecological parameters into Operational Taxonomic Unit delimitation.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694554

Mechanistically, we directly show that strand invasion and subsequent HR defects upon BRCA2 loss primarily arises from the unrestricted removal of RAD51 from DSB sites by FIGNL1, rather than from defective RAD51 loading. Furthermore, we identify that the MMS22L-TONSL complex interacts with FIGNL1 and is critical for HR in BRCA2/FIGNL1 double-deficient cells. These findings identify a pathway for tightly regulating RAD51 activity to promote efficient HR, offering insights into mechanisms of chemoresistance in BRCA2-deficient tumors.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

However, it remains unclear how well traits explain variation in the outcomes of current and novel competition, as well as the underlying processes determining coexistence or competitive exclusion, under changing climate. Here, we conducted a field experiment in which pairs of high and low-elevation species interacted in three sites across an elevation gradient in the Swiss Alps. For each species pair, we quantified the population-level outcomes of competition (invasion growth rates), relative fitness differences and niche overlap and related these to 15 functional traits that were measured in each site. Most traits were significantly associated with invasion growth rates at the low elevation, where species had greater relative fitness differences, but these associations were much weaker towards higher elevations. This appears to be because traits, particularly those associated with light competition, captured species relative fitness differences at lower elevations, but not at the high elevation site. Greater relative fitness differences towards lower elevations suggest that climate warming may increase the likelihood of competitive exclusion of species that are poor competitors for light. In addition, novel competitors tended to show greater niche overlap than current competitors, leading to stronger overall competitive effects. But in general, trait differences predicted competitive outcomes of novel and current competitors similarly well, suggesting that traits can be used to predict interactions between species that do not yet interact. Our study reinforces the importance of considering changing interactions for predicting species responses to climate change and provides experimental evidence supporting the usefulness of functional trait differences in forecasting the impacts of future plant interactions under changing climate.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

We approached organization by profiling the activity and spatial location of >23,000 neurons recorded in awake mice. Regularly firing neurons were over-represented in most PFC subregions, yet a fine-grained activity map of the PFC did not align with cytoarchitecturally defined subregions. Instead, we observed a robust relationship between spontaneous activity patterns and intra-PFC hierarchy, suggesting internal organization principles transcending cytoarchitecture. Single neuron responses to sounds did not reflect intra-PFC hierarchy but were linked to spontaneous firing rate, indicating that responsiveness increases with excitability and is decoupled from the PFC's intrinsic operational structure. Our data-driven approach provides a scalable roadmap to explore functional organizations in diverse brain regions and species, opening avenues to link activity, structure, and function in the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

The dim state has a low signal-to-noise ratio, which is problematic when precise, quantitative measurements are needed. During the engineering of a red-shifted variant of an mTurquoise-based calcium sensor, we serendipitously generated a green-emitting sensor that shows high brightness in both the calcium-bound and -unbound state, while still showing a calcium dependent lifetime change of >1 nanosecond. This sensor, named G-Ca-FLITS, is comparable in brightness to the bright state of GCaMP3 and jGCaMP7c in mammalian cells. The calcium induced loss in fluorescence intensity is only around 30% and therefore we observe little variation in the SNR when calcium levels change. G-Ca-FLITS shows negligible sensitivity to pH in the physiological range, like its turquoise parent. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), we measured the calcium concentration with G-Ca-FLITS in various organelles and observed in HeLa cells transient and spatially heterogeneous calcium elevations in mitochondria.

We introduce graphREML, a precise and powerful likelihood-based heritability partition and enrichment analysis method. graphREML operates on GWAS summary statistics and linkage disequilibrium graphical models (LDGMs), whose sparsity makes likelihood calculations tractable. We validate our method using extensive simulations and in analyses of a wide range of real traits. On average across traits, graphREML produces enrichment estimates that are concordant with S-LDSC, indicating that both methods are unbiased; however, graphREML identifies 2.5 times more significant trait-annotation enrichments, demonstrating greater power compared to the moment-based S-LDSC approach. graphREML can also more flexibly model the relationship between the annotations of a SNP and its heritability, producing well-calibrated estimates of per-SNP heritability.","NA","medrxiv",1731103694555

Prioritizing analysis of multicopy genes that could signal importance for Borg lifestyles, we uncovered highly represented de-ubiquitination-like Zn-metalloproteases that may counter host targeting of Borg proteins for proteolysis. Also prevalent are clusters of multicopy genes for production of diverse glycoconjugates that could contribute to decoration of the host cell surface, or of putative capsid proteins that we predict multimerize into hexagonal arrays. Features including megabase-scale linear genomes with inverted terminal repeats, genomic repertoires for energy metabolism, central carbon compound transformations and translation, and pervasive direct repeat regions are shared with giant viruses of eukaryotes, although analyses suggest that these parallels arose via convergent evolution. If Borgs are giant archaeal viruses they would fill the gap in the tri(um)virate of giant viruses of all three domains of life.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

However, our tools for deeply profiling how proteins co-occupy individual fibers, especially at the single-cell level, remain limited. We present Deaminase-Assisted single-molecule chromatin Fiber sequencing (DAF-seq), which leverages a non-specific double-stranded DNA deaminase toxin A (SsDddA) to efficiently stencil protein occupancy along DNA molecules via selective deamination of accessible cytidines, which are preserved via C-to-T transitions upon DNA amplification. We demonstrate that DAF-seq enables ~200,000-fold enrichment of target loci for single-molecule footprinting at near single-nucleotide resolution, enabling the precise delineation of the regulatory logic guiding neighboring proteins to cooperatively occupy chromatin fibers. Furthermore, DAF-seq enables the synchronous identification of single-molecule chromatin and genetic architectures - resolving the functional impact of rare somatic variants, as well as transitional chromatin states guiding haplotype-selective promoter actuation. Finally, we demonstrate that single-cell DAF-seq enables the accurate reconstruction of the diploid genome and epigenome from a single cell, revealing that a cell's accessible regulatory landscape can diverge by as much as 63% while still retaining the cell's identity. Overall, DAF-seq enables the comprehensive characterization of protein occupancy and chromatin accessibility across entire chromosomes with single-nucleotide, single-molecule, single-haplotype, and single-cell precision.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

However, data on the type of antibiotics prescribed for such infections is only available for children <5 years in the UK. Understanding the contribution of RSV to antibiotic prescribing would facilitate predicting the impact of RSV preventative measures on antibiotic use and resistance.

ObjectivesTo estimate the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions in English general practice attributable to RSV by age and antibiotic class.

MethodsGeneralised additive models examined associations between weekly counts of general practice antibiotic prescriptions and laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections from 2015 to 2018, adjusting for temperature, practice holidays and remaining seasonal confounders. We used general practice records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and microbiology tests for RSV, influenza, rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza, human Metapneumovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae from Englands Second Generation Surveillance System.

ResultsAn estimated 2.1% of antibiotics were attributable to RSV, equating to an average of 640,000 prescriptions annually. Of these, adults [&ge;]75 years contributed to the greatest volume, with an annual average of 149,078 (95% credible interval: 93,733-206,045). Infants 6-23 months had the highest average annual rate at 6,580 prescriptions per 100,000 individuals (95% credible interval: 4,522-8,651). Most RSV-attributable antibiotic prescriptions were penicillins, macrolides or tetracyclines. Adults [&ge;]65 years had a wider range of antibiotic classes associated with RSV compared to younger age groups.

ConclusionsInterventions to reduce the burden of RSV, particularly in older adults, could complement current strategies to reduce antibiotic use in England.","NA","medrxiv",1731103694555

Here we assess the ability of protein language models (PLMs), routinely applied to protein folding, to be retrained for PPI prediction. Existing PPI prediction models that exploit PLMs use a pre-trained PLM feature set, ignoring that the proteins are physically interacting. Our novel method, PLM-interact, goes beyond a single protein, jointly encoding protein pairs to learn their relationships, analogous to the next-sentence prediction task from natural language processing. This approach provides a significant improvement in performance: Trained on human-human PPIs, PLM-interact predicts mouse, fly, worm, E. coli and yeast PPIs, achieving between 16-28% improvements in AUPR compared with state-of-the-art PPI models. Additionally, it can detect changes that disrupt or cause PPIs and be applied to virus-host PPI prediction. Our work demonstrates that large language models can be extended to learn the intricate relationships among biomolecules from sequences alone.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

In mammals, DNA methylation is a biomarker for biological age, which may predict age more accurately than date of birth. However, limitations in mammalian models make it difficult to identify mechanisms underpinning age-related DNA methylation changes. Here, we show that the short-lived model plant Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits a loss of epigenetic integrity during aging, causing heterochromatin DNA methylation decay and the expression of transposable elements. We show that the rate of epigenetic aging can be manipulated by extending or curtailing lifespan, and that shoot apical meristems are protected from this aging process. We demonstrate that a program of transcriptional repression suppresses DNA methylation maintenance pathways during aging, and that mutants of this mechanism display a complete absence of epigenetic decay. This presents a new paradigm in which a gene regulatory program sets the rate of epigenomic information loss during aging.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

These disparities are reported among migrants and black and ethnic minorities in Europe and North America. Lived experience perspectives from marginalised and multiple disadvantaged people are neglected in research yet may offer vital and novel insights into preventive opportunities to reduce coercive care

MethodsWe conducted a participatory photovoice research process to assemble the life- experiences of people within two years of receiving CAT. We purposively sampled to maximise diversity by age, ethnicity, and different  sections of the Mental Health Act (England & Wales, 1983, 2007) from 8 health systems in England. The images, captions, and reflective narratives were deepened over 3 workshops before thematic analysis.

OutcomesForty-eight ethnically diverse people with lived experience of CAT contributed over 500 images and 30 hours of transcribed narratives. Participants lives showed significant complexity in terms of multimorbidity, adverse childhood experiences, and carer roles. The findings suggest insufficient co-ordination to prevent CAT despite early help-seeking, not being taken seriously when seeking help, hostility and dismissive responses from professionals; unnecessary police involvement which was distressing, stigmatising, and risked criminalisation. Participants wanted more advocacy given their vulnerability and inability to process information in crisis, as well as therapeutic and creative activities in inpatient environments. Participants recommended more family and carer involvement, and more appropriate, frequent and personalised information about care options, appeals processes, levels of restriction, and seclusion. A major concern was the lack of highly skilled staff, trauma-informed care, and therapies into the community.

InterpretationWe showed epistemic injustice in care processes and recommend better standards for essential skills, prevention, trauma informed care and therapies. Criminalising and coercive responses must also be reduced.

Little is known about JCV pathogenesis, and no host factors required for cellular infection have been identified. Recently, we identified low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (Lrp1) as a host entry factor for two other bunyaviruses Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Oropouche virus (OROV). Here, we assessed the role of Lrp1 in mediating JCV cellular infection of neurons. Both neuronal and non-neuronal immortalized cell lines deficient for Lrp1 displayed reduction in infection with JCV, and early stages of infection such as binding and internalization were impacted by lack of Lrp1. In primary rat neurons, Lrp1 was highly expressed, and the neurons were highly permissive for JCV infection. Treatment of primary neurons with recombinant receptor-associated protein (RAP), a high affinity ligand for Lrp1, resulted in reduced infectivity with JCV. In addition, pretreatment of cells with RVFV Gn inhibited JCV infection, suggesting that the two viruses may share overlapping binding sites. These results provide compelling evidence that Lrp1 is an important cellular factor for efficient infection by JCV, and thus multiple bunyaviruses with varying clinical manifestations and tissue tropism are facilitated by the host cell Lrp1. Reliance of multiple bunyaviruses on Lrp1 makes it a promising target for pan-bunyaviral antivirals and therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Recently, protein phase separation has been observed at cellular membranes, suggesting it may play a role in the assembly of protein complexes. Inspired by these findings, we observed that protein condensates on one side of a planar suspended membrane spontaneously colocalized with those on the opposite side. How might this phenomenon contribute to the assembly of stable transmembrane complexes? To address this question, we examined the diffusion and growth of protein condensates on both sides of membranes. Our results reveal that transmembrane coupling of protein condensates on opposite sides of the membrane slows down condensate diffusion while accelerating condensate growth. How can the rate of condensate growth increase simultaneously with a decrease in the rate of condensate diffusion? We provide insights into these seemingly contradictory observations by distinguishing between diffusion-limited and coupling-driven growth processes. While transmembrane coupling slows down diffusion, it also locally concentrates condensates within a confined area. This confinement increases the probability of condensate coalescence and thereby enhances the overall rate of growth for coupled condensates, substantially surpassing the growth rate for uncoupled condensates. These findings suggest that transmembrane coupling could play a role in the assembly of diverse membrane-bound structures by promoting the localization and growth of protein complexes on both membrane surfaces. This phenomenon could help to explain the efficient assembly of transmembrane structures in diverse cellular contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

We discovered that murine astrovirus, an enteric RNA virus, persists indefinitely when mice remain unperturbed but is cleared rapidly after cage change. Besides eliminating the external viral reservoir, cage change also induced a transcriptional defense response in the intestinal epithelium. We further identified that displacing infected animals initially caused a temporary period of immune suppression through the stress hormone corticosterone, which was followed by an immune rebound characterized by an increase in CD8 T cells responsible for the epithelial antiviral responses. Our findings show how viral persistence can be disrupted by preventing re-exposure and activating immunity upon stress recovery, indicating that external factors can be manipulated to shorten the duration of a viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

The noncovalent complex of ribozyme fragments initiates low level aminoacylation of one of the fragments, which after loop-closing ligation generates a highly active covalently-linked chimeric ribozyme. The generation of this ribozyme is increasingly efficient over time due to the autocatalytic assembly cycle that sustains the ribozyme over indefinite cycles of serial dilution.

For brevity, we use the term GLP-1 RA to refer to both GLP-1 RA and dual GLP-1 RA/GIP medications.

ObjectiveTo describe recent trends in prescribing and dispensing of GLP-1-based medications in the US.

MethodsUsing a subset of real-world electronic health record (EHR) data from Truveta, a growing collective of health systems that provide more than 18% of all daily clinical care in the US, we identified people who were prescribed a GLP-1-based medication between January 01, 2018 and June 30, 2024. We describe prescribing volumes and patient characteristics over time, by medication, and by FDA-labeled use. Among the subset of patients for whom post-prescription dispensing data is available, we describe the proportion and characteristics of patients who were and were not dispensed a GLP-1 RA following their prescription.

Results1,162,662 patients were prescribed a GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and June 2024, with 4,815,135 total prescriptions during this period. Among first-time prescriptions for which use could be established, ADMs accounted for 83.0% and AOMs accounted for 17.0%. The most common first-time medication was semaglutide (n = 644,272).

Failure of this process, in compromised mitochondria, leads to kinase activation at the surface, and ultimately mitophagy. Analysis of PINK1-import within intact cells reveals an alternative pathway into the matrix. Structural modelling predicts that the trans-membrane-domain (TMD) of PINK1 forms either an alpha-helix or alpha/beta-hybrid at the interface between Tim17, of the TIM23-core-complex, and, respectively, either Romo1 or PARL. These mutually exclusive interactions both encapsulate a hydrated protein-channel. The alpha-helical-TMD form adopts a pose suggestive of translocation through the Romo1/Tim17-channel, while the alpha/beta-hybrid-TMD is retracted into the PARL active-site for cleavage, presumably after import through the adjacent rhomboid/Tim17-channel. We propose structural plasticity of the PINK1-TMD underlies alternative destinies for full-length matrix-import or cleavage/retro-translocation. The results reveal new insights of the role of PINK1 in mitochondrial function, quality-control and early-onset Parkinsons disease.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

It is found in amphibians, reptiles, and birds, as well as monotreme and marsupial mammals but is absent in fish and eutherian mammals. To explore the potential evolutionary origins of the double cone, we analyzed single-cell and -nucleus transcriptomic atlases of photoreceptors from six vertebrate species: zebrafish, chicken, lizard, opossum, ground squirrel, and human. Computational analyses separated the principal and accessory members in chicken and lizard, identifying molecular signatures distinguishing either member from single cones and rods in the same species. Comparative transcriptomic analyses suggest that both the principal and accessory originated from ancestral red cones. Furthermore, the gene expression variation among cone subtypes mirrors their spectral order (red [-&gt;] green [-&gt;] blue [-&gt;] UV), suggesting a constraint in their order of emergence during evolution. Finally, we find that rods are equally dissimilar to all cone types, suggesting that they emerged before the spectral diversification of cones.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

RICE constructs separate PRSs: for common variants, it integrates methods using ensemble learning; for rare variants, it uses gene-level testing with functional annotations and penalized regression. We evaluated RICE using simulated datasets and sequencing data from UK Biobank and All of Us, involving up to 740 million genetic variants from 361,939 individuals across diverse ancestries and 11 complex traits.

Abscisic acid (ABA) signalling has long been recognized as a key positive regulator of this process, coordinating the expression of genes that drive the acquisition of vital seed quality traits (SQTs) crucial for survival, resilience, and storage. However, the precise molecular regulation of many SQTs remains elusive. To address this gap, we conducted an extensive transcriptome analysis of seed maturation in Arabidopsis thaliana, focusing on Col-0 wild-type and ten mutant lines affecting ABA biosynthesis, signaling, and catabolism from 12 days after pollination up to the dry seed stage. Our study employed Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and module-trait correlation to uncover specific gene groups linked to the regulation of multiple SQTs. We identified Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) genes uniquely associated with desiccation tolerance and three DREB AND EAR MOTIF PROTEIN (DEAR) transcription factors involved in seed longevity regulation. The value of our dataset lies not only in its depth and detail, but also in its integration into SeedMatExplorer, a web tool specifically designed to advance seed maturation research. SeedMatExplorer serves as a unique resource, enabling researchers to explore, visualize, and generate new hypotheses about gene expression regulation during seed maturation and the intricate control of SQTs. This physiological and transcriptomic atlas offers unprecedented insights into the complex, coordinated gene expression that drives SQT acquisition in Arabidopsis seeds, making it an invaluable asset for the scientific community.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Using dilution-regrowth assays, we identified 39 compounds that either kill non-growing UPEC or delay its regrowth post-treatment. The hits include fluoroquinolones, macrolides, rifamycins, biguanide disinfectants, a pleuromutilin, and anti-cancer agents. 29 of the hits have not previously been recognized as active against non-growing bacteria. The hits were further tested against non-growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Ten compounds -- solithromycin, rifabutin, mitomycin C, and seven fluoroquinolones -- have strong bactericidal activity against non-growing P. aeruginosa, killing >4 log10 of bacteria at 2.5 {micro}M. Solithromycin, valnemulin, evofosfamide, and satraplatin are unique in their ability to selectively target non-growing bacteria, exhibiting poor efficacy against growing bacteria. Finally, 31 hit compounds inhibit the growth of intracellular Shigella flexneri in a human enterocyte infection model, indicating their ability to permeate the cytoplasm of host cells. The identified compounds hold potential for treating persistent infections, warranting further comparative studies with current standard-of-care antibiotics.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

However, the factors that regulate M conformation and roles for each state are unknown. Here, we discover a direct M-sphingolipid interaction that controls M conformational dynamics and virus assembly. We show M binds Golgi-enriched anionic lipids including ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P). Molecular dynamics simulations show C1P interaction promotes a long to short transition and energetically stabilizes Mshort. Cryo-EM structures show C1P specifically binds Mshort at a conserved site bridging transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. Disrupting Mshort-C1P interaction alters M subcellular localization, reduces interaction with Spike and E, and impairs subsequent virus-like particle cell entry. Together, these results show endogenous signaling lipids regulate M structure and support a model in which Mshort is stabilized in the early endomembrane system to organize other structural proteins prior to viral budding.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Restoration efforts and effective treatment of SCTLD requires an in-depth understanding of its pathogenesis in the coral holobiont as well as mechanisms of disease resistance. Here, we present a supervised machine learning framework to describe SCTLD progression in a major reef-building coral, Montastraea cavernosa, and its dominant algal endosymbiont, Cladocopium goreaui. Utilizing support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) in conjunction with differential expression analysis, we identify a subset of biologically relevant genes that exhibit the highest classification performance across three types of coral tissues collected from a natural reef environment: apparently healthy tissue on an apparently healthy colony, apparently healthy tissue on a SCTLD-affected colony, and lesion tissue on a SCTLD-affected colony. By analyzing gene expression signatures associated with these tissue health states in both the coral host and its algal endosymbiont (family Symbiodiniaceae), we describe key processes involved in SCTLD resistance and disease progression within the coral holobiont. Our findings further support evidence that SCTLD causes dysbiosis between the coral host and its Symbiodinaiceae and additionally describes the metabolic and immune shifts that occur as the holobiont transitions from a healthy to a diseased state. This supervised machine learning framework offers a novel approach to accurately assess the health states of endangered coral species and brings us closer to developing effective solutions for disease monitoring and intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Rats, like humans, show individual differences in their tendency to engage in and maintain control over coping behaviours. While most rats exposed to a schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) procedure develop a controlled coping response, namely polydipsic drinking, some engage in excessive, compulsive drinking, or hyperdipsia. The development of hyperdipsia, to which highly impulsive rats are particularly vulnerable, depends on noradrenergic mechanisms, as it is prevented by the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, atomoxetine. However, whether noradrenergic mechanisms also underlie the maintenance of hyperdipsia, or if other traits confer vulnerability to its development, are unknown. In two longitudinal studies in male Sprague Dawley rats, we investigated whether well-established hyperdipsia is influenced by atomoxetine and if its development is predicted by the ICSD-relevant sign-tracking trait. Sign-tracking predicted faster acquisition of adjunctive drinking but not the transition to hyperdipsia, while goal-tracking protected against the latter. Surprisingly, chronic atomoxetine exacerbated well-established hyperdipsia; post-mortem qPCR assays revealed that this was associated with increased cFos and Zif268 mRNA, markers of cellular activity and plasticity, across the dorsal striatum. Atomoxetine also altered the hyperdipsia-specific transcriptomic landscape of the nucleus accumbens shell and the pattern of cFos and Zif268 expression in the amygdalo-striatal system. These results provide new insights into the biobehavioural basis of compulsive behaviours, revealing a differential noradrenergic control of the development and the expression of compulsive coping.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Here, we test four DNA extraction methods with the aim of identifying an efficient procedure to extract high-quality DNA from fecal material of canine, sheep, equine, bovine, and pig collected on dry blood spot cards, with the goal of generating good quality shotgun metagenomics datasets. Further, the suitability of Illumina shotgun metagenomic sequencing at 20million PE read depth was assessed on its ability to successfully characterize the taxonomic and functional aspects of the resulting fecal microbiome. Methods: DNA was extracted from pig feces and mock communities collected on blood spot cards using four DNA extraction methods; two different protocols of the QIAsymphony(R) PowerFecal(R) Pro DNA Kit, the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep Kit, and the MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit. Possible extraction bias was controlled by amplicon sequencing of mock communities. Fecal samples from canine, sheep, equine, bovine, and pig were thereafter subjected to the best performing DNA extraction method and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to determine sequencing efforts for functional and taxonomic analysis. Results: The four DNA extraction methods demonstrated similar community composition in the sequenced bacterial mock community. The QIAsymphony(R) PowerFecal(R) Pro DNA Kit was identified as the DNA extraction method of choice, and the resulting DNA was subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing with 20million PE reads. We found that higher number of reads increased the richness of observed genera between 100,000 and 5 million reads, after which higher sequencing effort did not increase the richness of the metagenomes. As for functional analysis, the number of low abundance functions in the metagenomes of the animals feces increased with sequencing depth above 20 million PE reads. Conclusion: Our experiments identified several methods suitable for extracting DNA from feces collected on blood spot cards. The Qiagen's Blood and Tissue kit on the QiaSymphony platform fulfilled the criteria of high yield, quality, and unbiased DNA, while maintaining high throughput for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. A sequencing depth of 20 million PE reads proved adequate for taxonomic estimations and identifying common functional pathways.

However, the neural mechanisms that support these flexible temporal construals remain unclear. To investigate this, we asked participants to learn a fictional religious ritual of 15 events. During fMRI scanning, they were guided to consider the event series from either an internal or external perspective in different tasks. Behavioral results confirmed the success of our manipulation, showing the expected symbolic distance effect in the internal-perspective task and the reverse effect in the external-perspective task. We found that the activation level in the posterior partial cortex correlated positively with sequential distance in the external-perspective task but negatively in the internal-perspective task. In contrast, the activation level in the anterior hippocampus positively correlated with sequential distance regardless of the observer's perspectives. These results suggest that the hippocampus stores the memory of the event sequences allocentrically in a perspective-agnostic manner. Conversely, the posterior parietal cortex retrieves event sequences egocentrically from the optimal perspective for the current task context. Such complementary allocentric and egocentric representations support both the stability of memory storage and the flexibility of time construals.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Exploring genetic-phenotypic correlations across the globe enhances the generalizability of research findings, contributing to a more inclusive and universal understanding of disease. This study leveraged biobank-scale data to conduct the largest multi-ancestry whole-genome sequencing characterization of AD/ADRDs. We aimed to build a valuable catalog of potential disease-causing, genetic risk and resilience variants impacting the etiology of these conditions. We thoroughly characterized genetic variants from key genes associated with AD/ADRDs across 11 genetic ancestries, utilizing data from All of Us, UK Biobank, 100,000 Genomes Project, Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, and the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in Parkinson's Disease, including a total of 25,001 cases and 93,542 controls. We prioritized 116 variants possibly linked to disease, including 18 known pathogenic and 98 novel variants. We detected previously described disease-causing variants among controls, leading us to question their pathogenicity. Notably, we showed a higher frequency of APOE {varepsilon}4/{varepsilon}4 carriers among individuals of African and African Admixed ancestry compared to other ancestries, confirming ancestry-driven modulation of APOE-associated AD/ADRDs. A thorough assessment of APOE revealed a disease-modifying effect conferred by the TOMM40:rs11556505, APOE:rs449647, 19q13.31:rs10423769, NOCT:rs13116075, CASS4:rs6024870, and LRRC37A:rs2732703 variants among APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers across different ancestries.

This study presents an innovative vaccine design using bioinformatics to identify epitopes that activate helper T cells (HTLs) via the human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA-II) complex. Starting with 50,040 vaccine candidates, 14 epitopes with the highest HLA-II affinity were selected based on antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, stability, and homology. These epitopes were integrated into a multi-epitope vaccine with spacers and adjuvants to enhance the immune response. A 3D model was developed, confirming structural stability and optimal epitope exposure through molecular dynamics simulations. The results indicate that the vaccine can induce robust immune responses, suggesting its potential effectiveness against the Mpox virus. Additionally, population coverage analysis supports its promise as a significant tool for controlling Mpox epidemics and advancing global public health initiatives.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) presents a statistical framework that embraces causal relationships among brain regions and their responses to experimental manipulations, such as stimulation. In this study, we perform Bayesian inference on a neurobiologically plausible generative model that simulates event-related potentials observed in magneto/encephalography data. This translates into probabilistic inference of latent and observed states of a system driven by input stimuli, described by a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and potentially correlated parameters. We provide a guideline for reliable inference in the presence of multimodality, which arises from parameter degeneracy, ultimately enhancing the predictive accuracy of neural dynamics. Solutions include optimizing the hyperparameters, leveraging initialization with prior information, and employing weighted stacking based on predictive accuracy. Moreover, we implement the inference and conduct comprehensive model comparison in several probabilistic programming languages to streamline the process and benchmark their efficiency. Our investigation shows that model inversion in DCM extends beyond variational approximation frameworks, demonstrating the effectiveness of gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of posterior estimation using a self-tuning variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and the automatic Laplace approximation, effectively addressing parameter degeneracy challenges. This technical endeavor holds the potential to advance the inversion of state-space ODE models, and contribute to neuroscience research and applications in neuroimaging through automatic DCM.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Notably, the data also provide evidence that the outbreak resulted from a single zoonotic transmission event with limited human-to-human transmission, rather than multiple independent zoonotic transmission events. The Rwandan MVD outbreak prompted a thorough investigation that included contact tracing, clinical assessment, travel history, sequencing, and serology testing, to trace the virus's origin.

CT-guided localised intestinal irradiation, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry revealed RT-induced chemokine-dependent recruitment of immune cells. Deletion of C-C chemokine receptor (Ccr)1, Ccr2, Ccr3 and Ccr5, blocked recruitment and worsened radiation induced toxicities. Furthermore, CCR2-deficient mice showed exacerbated weight loss and intestinal permeability, while the transfer of Ly6C+ monocytes alleviated symptoms. Mechanistically, IL-17 cytokine production by group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), a critical factor in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, was reduced in irradiated CCR2-/-, however the transfer of Ly6C+ monocytes resulted in increased IL-17 levels. These findings demonstrate the critical importance of CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment in mitigating RT-induced toxicities.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

However, why some bacteria carry weapons while others do not remains poorly understood. Here we explore this question using the bacteriocins of E. coli as a model system, which are both well studied and have large well-annotated genomic resources. While bacteriocins are found widely across E. coli strains, we find that carriage is particularly associated with pathogenic extra-intestinal (ExPEC) strains, including many clinically-important pandemic strains. These pathogenic strains commonly carry large plasmids that encode the bacteriocins but also virulence factors, including siderophores, and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Across all E. coli strains, we find many orphan immunity proteins, which protect against bacteriocins and suggest that bacterial warfare is important in nature. We also present evidence that bacteriocin toxins readily move between strains via plasmid transfer and even between plasmids via transposons. Finally, we show that several E. coli bacteriocins are widely shared with the pathogen Salmonella enterica, further cementing the link to virulence. Our work suggests that the bacteriocins of E. coli are important antibacterial weapons for dangerous antimicrobial-resistant strains.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Their expansion shapes genome variability and evolution by impacting gene expression and rearrangement rates. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are beneficial plant symbionts with large, TE-rich genomes, and recent findings showed these elements vary significantly in abundance, evolution, and regulation among model AMF strains. Here, we aimed to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of TE function and evolution in AMF by investigating assembled genomes from representatives of all known families. We uncovered multiple, family-specific bursts of insertions in different species, indicating variable past and ongoing TE activity contributing to the diversification of AMF lineages. We also found that TEs are preferentially located within and around candidate effectors/secreted proteins, as well as in proximity to promoters. Altogether, these findings support the role of TEs in promoting the diversity in proteins involved in molecular dialogues with hosts and, more generally, in driving gene regulation. The mechanisms of TEs evolution we observed in these prominent plant symbionts bear striking similarities to those of many filamentous plant pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Traditionally, studies have focused on the role of contemporary ecology--such as pollinator or mate availability--in driving spatial patterns in reproductive assurance within species, however, historical processes such as post-glacial range expansion may be an understudied alternative explanation for geographic variation in mating system. This is because during the process of geographic range expansion into novel habitat, selection should favour individuals that possess traits promoting reproductive assurance (i.e., autonomous selfing or clonal reproduction). Here, we used Northern pink monkeyflower--Erythranthe (Mimulus lewisii--a hermaphroditic, self-compatible, perennial, alpine plant, as a focal species to investigate the historical signatures of geographic range expansion by combining phylogeographic analyses with a greenhouse survey of range-wide reproductive assurance. First, we detected significant geographic variation among populations in two components of reproductive assurance: self-fertilization and clonal propagation. Next, using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, we identified three distinct genetic clusters structured by longitude and estimated geographic coordinates of the most likely origins of range expansion within each cluster. We found that both measures of reproductive assurance significantly increased on average with distance from the inferred biogeographic origin, which is consistent with the hypothesis that reproductive assurance undergoes adaptive evolution during range expansion. This study supports hypotheses underlying Baker's Law and contributes to our understanding of spatial variation in reproductive assurance, which is linked to variation in evolutionary potential, adaptability, and the long-term persistence of populations across large spatial scales.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

These predictions are related to dispersal limitation at the leading edge driving colonization dynamics, a scenario common in post-glacial range expansion at the continental scale ([~]20,000 years ago). However, post-glacial range expansion can also occur on contemporary time scales, such as alpine glacier recession following the end of The Little Ice Age ([~]150 years ago) and our understanding of dispersal limitation structuring these instances of rapid range expansion are relatively understudied. Here, we test whether there is evidence supporting the role of dispersal limitation during range expansion following alpine glacier retreat using the native alpine plant Erythranthe (Mimulus) lewisii by examining patterns of neutral genetic diversity (single nucleotide polymorphisms) across the history of glacier recession (i.e., glacier chronosequence) across two glacier forelands in Garibaldi Provincial Park, BC. We find weak support for the prediction of increasing clines in genetic differentiation towards the range edge, and no support for decreasing clines in genetic diversity, suggesting dispersal limitation is not characterizing colonization during range expansion, with the implication that the accumulation of expansion load at the range edge is likely not applicable on these spatiotemporal scales. Together, our results suggest that loss of genetic diversity for range-shifting species in the alpine is likely not a key contributing factor to any decreased fitness over time.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Thus, there is a need to develop additional innovative strategies to combat malaria. Viruses that infect non-Plasmodium spp. disease-causing protozoa have been shown to affect pathogen life cycle and disease outcomes. However, only one virus (Matryoshka RNA virus 1) has been identified in Plasmodium, and none have been identified in zoonotic Plasmodium species. The rapid expansion of the known RNA virosphere using structure- and artificial intelligence-based methods suggests that this dearth is due to the divergent nature of RNA viruses that infect protozoa. We leveraged these newly uncovered data sets to explore the virome of human-infecting Plasmodium species collected in Sabah, east (Borneo) Malaysia. We identified a highly divergent RNA virus in two human-infecting P. knowlesi isolates that is related to the unclassified group  ormycoviruses. By characterising fifteen additional ormycoviruses identified in the transcriptomes of arthropods we show that this group of viruses exhibits a complex ecology at the arthropod-mammal interface. Through the application of artificial intelligence methods, we then demonstrate that the ormycoviruses are part of a diverse and unclassified viral taxon. This is the first observation of an RNA virus in a zoonotic Plasmodium species. By linking small-scale experimental data to large-scale virus discovery advances, we characterise the diversity and genomic architecture of an unclassified viral taxon.

These phenotypes were reproducible, heritable (h2 = [4 - 18%]), and significantly associated with cardiometabolic traits and outcomes, including atrial fibrillation (P = 8.5 x 10-29) and myocardial infarction (P = 3.7 x 10-12). By using latent space manipulation techniques, we directly interpreted and visualised what specific latent phenotypes were capturing in a given MRI. To establish the genetic basis of such traits, we performed a genome-wide association study, identifying 89 significant common variants (P < 2.3 x 10-9) across 42 loci, including seven novel loci. Extensive multi-trait colocalisation analyses (PP.H4 > 0.8) linked these variants to various cardiac traits and diseases, revealing a shared genetic architecture spanning phenotypic scales.

However, the underlying mechanisms and disease relevance are not fully understood. We have recently identified RH1115 as a small molecule modulator of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway that regulates lysosome positioning in neurons. This allowed us to manipulate neuronal lysosome distribution including in axons and interrogate its contribution to both optimal neuronal functioning and to disease pathology. We demonstrate that the small molecule not only rescues aberrant buildup of both axonal autophagic and lysosomal intermediates but also reduces secreted A{beta}42 levels in human iPSC-derived neurons lacking the lysosomal adaptor, JIP3. We thus demonstrate that restoring efficient axonal lysosome transport has an anti-amyloidogenic effect in human neurons and is a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimers disease. Furthermore, we show that the small molecule enhances neuronal lysosome degradation, requires the lysosomal adaptor JIP4 to rescue the axonal lysosome pathology in the JIP3 KO neurons and increases levels of the JIP4-interacting lysosomal membrane protein, TMEM55B. Lastly, treatment with the small molecule led to a striking rescue of locomotor defects in JIP3 KO zebrafish larvae. Thus, we have identified a small molecule which can be impactful in neurodegenerative diseases that have a lysosomal pathology and have determined its molecular targets in modulating axonal lysosome abundance.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Holding isometric muscle actions (HIMA) are largely unknown, although practitioners prescribe them in rehabilitation and performance contexts. The lack of knowledge and consensus in research on the distinction between two isometric types and limited scientific backing makes appropriate use in clinical and performance contexts difficult. Objective: To gather research directly comparing PIMA and HIMA, and to summarize and synthesize findings. We also aimed to identify potential practical applications for both tasks. Lastly, we highlight existing gaps in the literature and propose directions for future research. Methods: CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles comparing PIMA and HIMA in humans. Risk-of-bias and study quality were assessed via established assessments for quasi-experimental studies and funnel plots, respectively. Findings were synthesized where possible, with meta-analyses and meta-regressions performed on time-to-task-failure (TTF), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), heart rate (HR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Results: Fifty-four studies (publication year = 2012.9 {+/-} 6.9; 1995-2024) were identified (N=856 participants; ~29.5 {+/-} 10.1 years). Thirty-five included performance parameters (e.g., TTF), 45 examined neurological outputs (e.g., electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography), and 14 explored cardiovascular or metabolic (e.g., glucose uptake, oxygenation) variables. Meta-analysis of 23 studies revealed consistently longer TTF for PIMA vs HIMA at the same absolute intensity (n = 407; g = -0.74, p < 0.001), except for two studies examining axial muscles (g = 1.78-3.59, p < 0.001). Meta-analyses of 6-11 studies detected no absolute differences in HR, MAP, or RPE (n = 136-194; g = -0.11 to 0.18, p = 0.07-0.96), except for RPE at 50% of TTF being greater during PIMA (n = 164; g = -0.31, p = 0.01). PIMA mostly showed higher force fluctuations, discharge rates, D1-inhibition and peak torque, while HIMA indicated higher heteronymous facilitation, EMG burst rates, interspike interval variation, muscular glucose uptake, and faster increases in force/position fluctuations, EMG amplitude, RPE, HR, and MAP. Findings on muscle activation were mixed. HIMAs showed fewer neurological alterations during experimental joint pain. Conclusions: Evidence suggests distinguishing two types of isometric muscle action indicating more complex control strategies for HIMA than PIMA. Findings revealed similarities to anisometric actions, suggesting that the control strategies of HIMA and PIMA resemble the ones for muscle lengthening and shortening, respectively. HIMAs could provide a time-efficient approach for inducing musculoskeletal, neural, and cardiovascular adaptations in rehabilitation. PIMA may be beneficial for prolonged activation and agonist neuromuscular adaptations. Methods varied widely across studies, making additional meta-analyses impossible. More consistent methodology and data reporting are recommended. Randomized controlled trials are required to confirm the use of PIMA vs HIMA in clinical or performance contexts. The knowledge of both isometric types should be implemented in research and education. Registration: The original protocol was prospectively registered at the National Institute of Health Research PROSPERO (CRD42024530386).","NA","medrxiv",1731103694555

Microtubule growth, shortening and transitions between them are linked to GTP hydrolysis. Recent evidence suggests that flexible tubulin protofilaments at microtubule ends adopt a variety of shapes, complicating structural analysis using conventional techniques. Therefore, the link between GTP hydrolysis, protofilament structure and microtubule polymerization state is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the conformational dynamics of microtubule ends using coarse-grained modeling supported by atomistic simulations and cryo-electron tomography. We show that individual bent protofilaments organize in clusters, transient precursors to a straight microtubule lattice, with GTP-bound ends showing elevated and more persistent cluster formation. Differences in the mechanical properties of GTP- and GDP-protofilaments result in differences in intra-cluster tension, determining both clustering propensity and protofilament length. We propose that conformational selection at microtubule ends favors long-lived clusters of short GTP-protofilaments that are more prone to form a straight microtubule lattice and accommodate new tubulin dimers. Conversely, microtubule ends trapped in states with unevenly long and stiff GDP-protofilaments are more prone to shortening. We conclude that protofilament clustering is a key phenomenon that links the hydrolysis state of single tubulins to the polymerization state of the entire microtubule.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Inspired by previous work on an association between genetic evidence and clinical success, we used retrospective analysis of known drug target genes to identify potential predictors of target clinical success from scRNA-seq data. We investigated whether successful drug targets are associated with cell type specific expression in a disease-relevant tissue (cell type specificity), and with cell type specific over-expression in disease patients compared to healthy controls (disease cell specificity). Analysing scRNA-seq data across diseases and tissues, we found that both cell type and disease cell specificity are features enriched in targets entering clinical development, and that cell type specificity in the disease-relevant tissue is robustly predictive of target progression from Phase I to II. While scRNA-seq analysis identifies a larger and complementary target space to that of direct genetic evidence, its association with specificity and drug approval appears less clear. We discuss how further expansion and harmonization of single-cell datasets, more sophisticated integration of this data in target discovery, and improved methods for tracking clinical trial outcomes could enhance our ability to leverage scRNA-seq insights in drug development in future.","NA","medrxiv",1731103694555

In plants, such regulation is critical for flower formation, which involves the progressive differentiation of stem cell populations within floral meristems followed by rapid sequential development of floral organs. Across plant taxa, these transitions are orchestrated by the F-box transcriptional co-factor gene UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO). The conserved and pleiotropic functions of UFO offer a useful framework for investigating how evolutionary processes have shaped the intricate cis-regulation of key developmental genes. By pinpointing a conserved promoter sequence in an accessible chromatin region of the tomato ortholog of UFO, we engineered in vivo a series of cis-regulatory alleles that caused both loss- and gain-of-function floral defects. These mutant phenotypes were linked to disruptions in predicted transcription factor binding sites for known transcriptional activators and repressors. Allelic combinations revealed dosage-dependent interactions between opposing alleles, influencing the penetrance and expressivity of gain-of-function phenotypes. These phenotypic differences support that robustness in tomato flower development requires precise temporal control of UFO expression dosage. Bridging our analysis to Arabidopsis, we found that although homologous sequences to the tomato regulatory region are dispersed within the UFO promoter, they maintain similar control over floral development. However, phenotypes from disrupting these sequences differ due to the differing expression patterns of UFO. Our study underscores the complex cis-regulatory control of dynamic developmental genes and demonstrates that critical short stretches of regulatory sequences that recruit both activating and repressing machinery are conserved to maintain developmental robustness.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Most of Sac1 was degraded in ~1 h, paralleled by increased PI(4)P and decreased cholesterol in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) during the following hour, and superseded by Golgi fragmentation, impaired glycosylation, and selective degradation of TGN proteins by ~4 h. The TGN disintegration resulted from its acute deacidification caused by disassembly of the Golgi V-ATPase. Mechanistically, Sac1 mediated TGN membrane composition maintained an assembly promoting conformation of the V0a2 subunit. Key phenotypes of acute Sac1 degradation were recapitulated in human differentiated trophoblasts, causing processing defects of chorionic gonadotropin, in line with loss-of-function intolerance of the human SACML1 gene. Collectively, our findings reveal that the assembly of the Golgi V-ATPase is controlled by the TGN membrane via Sac1 fuelled lipid exchange.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

The genomic revolution has enabled a rapid expansion of our knowledge of genomes in many living organisms, and most of that knowledge is classified and readily available in the databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The genomesizeR tool leverages the wealth of taxonomic and genomic information present in NCBI databases to infer the genome size of Archeae, Bacteria, or Eukaryote organisms identified at any taxonomic level. This R package uses statistical modelling on data from the most up-to-date NCBI databases and provides three statistical methods for genome size prediction of a given taxon, or group of taxa. A straightforward  weighted mean method identifies the closest taxa with available genome size information in the taxonomic tree, and averages their genome sizes using weights based on taxonomic distance. A frequentist random effect model uses nested genus and family information to output genome size estimates. Finally a third option provides predictions from a distributional Bayesian multilevel model which uses taxonomic information from genus all the way to superkingdom, therefore providing estimates and uncertainty bounds even for under-represented taxa.

All three methods use:

O_LIA list of queries; a query being a taxon or a list of several taxa. The package was designed to make it easy to use with data coming from environmental DNA experiments, but works with any table of taxa.

While traditional approaches using genetic screens in model organisms have uncovered some fundamental processes underlying these traits, model organisms do not possess the variation required to understand the evolution of traits with complex genetic architectures. In contrast, the advent of genomics at tree-of-life scales enables us to study the genetic interactions underlying these processes by leveraging millions of years of evolutionary trial-and-error. Here, we use the rich species diversity of the genus Myotis - one of the longest-living clades of mammals - to study the evolution of longevity-associated traits and infectious disease using functional evolutionary genomics. We generated reference genome assemblies and cell lines for 8 closely-related ([~]11 MYA) species of Myotis rich in phenotypic and life history diversity. Using genome-wide screens of positive selection, analysis of structural variation and copy number variation, and functional experiments in primary cell lines, we identify new patterns of adaptation in longevity, cancer resistance, and viral interactions both within Myotis and across bats. We find that the rapid evolution of lifespan in Myotis has some of the most significant variations in cancer risk across mammals, and demonstrate a unique DNA damage response in the long-lived M. lucifugus using primary cell culture models. Furthermore, we find evidence of abundant adaptation in response to DNA viruses, but not RNA viruses, in Myotis and other bats. This is in contrast to these patterns of adaptation in humans, which might contribute to the importance of bats as a reservoir of zoonotic viruses. Together, our results demonstrate the utility of leveraging natural variation to understand the genomics of traits with implications for human health and suggest important pleiotropic relationships between infectious disease tolerance and cancer resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Animal studies have yielded rich insight into mechanisms for visual perception, but the neural mechanisms for visual imagery remain poorly understood. Here, we first determined that [~]80% of visually responsive single neurons in human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) used a distributed axis code to represent objects. We then used that code to reconstruct objects and generate maximally effective synthetic stimuli. Finally, we recorded responses from the same neural population while subjects imagined specific objects and found that [~]40% of axis-tuned VTC neurons recapitulated the visual code. Our findings reveal that visual imagery is supported by reactivation of the same neurons involved in perception, providing single neuron evidence for existence of a generative model in human VTC.

One Sentence SummarySingle neurons in human temporal cortex use feature axes to encode objects, and imagery reactivates this code.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Translational PerspectiveHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a significant and growing global health concern lacking disease-modifying therapeutic options, reflecting inadequate preclinical models of the disease. Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we created the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, demonstrated phenotypic disease characteristics of elevated stiffness and slowed kinetics, showed transcriptomic consistency with HFpEF patient data, identified SERCA2a as a key downregulated gene, performed dosing titration of SERCA2a gene therapy, and showed improvement of cardiac kinetics post-treatment. The findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF.","NA","biorxiv",1731103694555
