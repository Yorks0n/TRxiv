Heart rate variability (HRV) can evaluate autonomic function and monitor overexertion, potentially helping to mitigate PEM. This study aimed to use continuous multi-day HRV recordings to monitor overexertion and study autonomic function in Long COVID. Method: Heart rate and HRV were continuously measured in 127 patients with long COVID (43+/-11 years, 32% male) and 21 healthy controls (42+/-13 years, 48% male), and daily life activities tracked in a logbook. Participants underwent a (sub)maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test to determine heart rate at the first ventilatory threshold (VT1) to study HRV responses to exercise at different intensities. Results: HRV was lower in patients with long COVID compared to healthy controls during various daily activities and sleep (p<0.027). HRV remained lower for 24 hours after exercise below, at or above VT1 in patients, but not in healthy controls (p=0.010). Nighttime HRV decreased with intense exercise and longer durations in patients with long COVID (p=0.018), indicative of exercise-induced diurnal disturbances of the autonomic nervous system in long COVID. Conclusion: Heart rate variability, assessed by wearables, confirms autonomic dysfunction in patients with long COVID. The delayed recovery of the sympathovagal balance after exercise close and above to VT1 suggests that VT1 can be practically interpreted as a PEM threshold. Application: These results confirm the applicability of wearables to assess autonomic function and manage overexertion in long COVID patients.","NA","medrxiv",1742508508303

Here, we investigate fern-pathogen interactions by characterizing novel pathosystems and analysing the diversity of fern immune receptors. A collection of fern species was inoculated with a diverse set of microbes, and disease symptoms were assessed. We further leveraged published genome mining tools to analyse the diversity of RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASES, RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEINS (RLKs/RLPs) and NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING AND LEUCINE-RICH REPEATS (NLRs), along with key immune signalling components, in ferns. Our results reveal that ferns exhibit a range of responses to pathogens, including non-host resistance and specific resistance mechanisms. Among ten ferns tested, Pteris vittata displays the broadest spectrum of pathogen compatibility. Genome mining indicates that ferns encode a diverse repertoire of putative immune receptors, antimicrobial peptides and mediators of systemic acquired resistance. Ferns possess numerous RLKs/RLPs, resembling those required for cell-surface immunity in angiosperms. They also encode diverse NLRs, including a previously undescribed class with a disordered N-terminal domain, termed disN-NLR. These findings provide insights into disease resistance evolution and open promising perspectives for crop protection strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

Here, we identify fundamental patterns of white matter maturation by examining developmental variation along major, long-range cortico-cortical tracts in youth ages 5-23 years using diffusion MRI from three large-scale, cross-sectional datasets (total N = 2,710). Across datasets, we delineate two replicable axes of human white matter development. First, we find a deep-to-superficial axis, in which superficial tract regions near the cortical surface exhibit greater age-related change than deep tract regions. Second, we demonstrate that the development of superficial tract regions aligns with the cortical hierarchy defined by the sensorimotor-association axis, with tract ends adjacent to sensorimotor cortices maturing earlier than those adjacent to association cortices. These results reveal developmental variation along tracts that conventional tract-average analyses have previously obscured, challenging the implicit assumption that white matter tracts mature uniformly along their length. Such developmental variation along tracts may have functional implications, including mitigating ephaptic coupling in densely packed deep tract regions and tuning neural synchrony through hierarchical development in superficial tract regions - ultimately refining neural transmission in youth.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

We analysed haplotype sharing among 858,635 modern individuals from Denmark and Britain to infer migration history from the Middle Ages to the modern day. We estimated the genetic relationship among 370,259 Danes using Danish healthcare registries and validated those with retrievable pedigree relationships from a national family registry. We also compared their IBD sharing with 488,376 British individuals from the UK Biobank. Our analysis revealed the fine-grained population genetic history of Denmark and identified distinct coastal and island communities with a history of genetic isolation and bottlenecks. We observed a significant population decline in Jutland compared to Zealand during the late medieval period to the start of early modern period, accompanied by migration from Jutland to Zealand, corresponding to historical evidence. We identified two major IBD sharing patterns between Denmark and Great Britain: early coast-to-coast connections between South Jutland and eastern England, likely driven by Viking settlements, continuous trade and people movements across the North Sea from the Middle Ages through early modern times, and later city-to-city connections such as those between London and Kobenhavn likely influenced by urbanisation and Industrial Revolution. Further comparisons using other North Sea countries showed both shared and unique histories of genetic exchange with Denmark and Britain. Our study provides novel genetic evidence of migration across the North Sea from the Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution. It highlights the power of nationwide biobanks in reconstructing fine-scale historical population movements among closely related populations.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

Here, we find that excessive activation of replication origins depletes chromatin-bound PCNA and lagging strand components, thereby limiting additional PCNA loading at new origins when checkpoint control is disrupted. PAF15 (PCNA-associated factor 15) emerges as a dosage-sensitive regulator of PCNA, delineating the dynamic range of global genome duplication and defining distinct roles for PCNA on the leading and lagging strands. Through its high-affinity PIP motif and interaction within the DNA encircling channel of PCNA, PAF15 stabilizes PCNA exclusively on the lagging strand, optimizing and rate-limiting lagging strand processing. On the other hand, misregulation of PAF15--whether by overexpression or mislocalization to the leading strand--impairs replication fork progression and leads to cell death. These defects are mitigated by TIMELESS and CLASPIN, which restrain PAF15-PCNA interactions beyond the lagging strand. E2F4-mediated repression orchestrates PAF15 expression in normal and cancer cells, maintaining its optimal dosage for lagging strand-specific interactions with PCNA. Thus, the S-phase checkpoint functions in concert to restrict origin activation when lagging strand PAF15-PCNA assembly is exhausted, linking a previously concealed strand-specific rate limitation to overall replication dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

Loss-of-function mutations in the autophagy regulators ATG2, ATG5, or ATG7 induce a premature, cell-autonomous cell death program. This cell death is activated via a gene regulatory network downstream of the NAC transcription factors ANAC046 and ANAC087.

By degrading damaged or unwanted components, autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis. While the organismal phenotypes of autophagy deficient plants under stress are well characterized, the contribution of cell type specific autophagy responses to whole plant homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, we show that root hair forming cells (trichoblasts) of Arabidopsis thaliana exhibit higher autophagic flux than adjacent nonhair cells (atrichoblasts). This differential autophagy is genetically linked to cell fate determination during early development. Mutants disrupting trichoblast or atrichoblast identity lose the autophagy distinction between these cell types. Functional analyses reveal that elevated autophagy in trichoblasts is essential for sodium ion sequestration in vacuoles, a key mechanism for salt stress tolerance. Disrupting autophagy specifically in trichoblasts impairs sodium accumulation and reduces plant survival under salt stress. Conversely, cell type specific complementation restores both sodium sequestration and stress tolerance. Our findings uncover a cell type specific autophagy program in root hairs and demonstrate how developmental cues shape autophagy to enhance stress resilience. This work establishes a direct link between cell identity, autophagy, and environmental adaptation in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

Despite the critical role of IFN induction in host defense, numerous studies have established that most cells fail to produce IFNs in response to viral stimuli. The specific factors that govern cellular heterogeneity in IFN induction potential during infection are not understood. To identify specific host factors that license some cells but not others to mount an IFN response to viral infection, we developed an approach for analyzing temporal scRNA-seq data of influenza A virus (IAV)-infected cells. This approach identified the expression of several interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) within pre-infection cells as correlates of IFN induction potential of those cells, post-infection. Validation experiments confirmed that intrinsic expression of the ISG OASL is essential for robust IFNL induction during IAV infection. Altogether, our findings reveal an important role for IFN-independent, intrinsic expression of ISGs in promoting IFN induction and provide new insights into the mechanisms that regulate cell-to-cell heterogeneity in innate immune activation.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

To improve the efficiency of this process and accelerate the development of new mAbs, we characterized and isolated antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) from the spleen of immunized mice before cell fusion. This approach resulted in a high yield of hybridoma generation by increasing the probability of successive pairing between the most suitable cell fusion partners. Specifically, we developed an optimized workflow combining Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) with antibody secretion assays, using a panel of five cell-surface markers (CD3, TACI, CD138, MHC-II, and B220) that allowed us to identify a particular ASC subset with key characteristics. Such ASCs exhibited a plasmablast phenotype with high MHC-II expression and secreted high levels of Ag-specific antibodies in immunized mice. These features were also found in hybridomas, suggesting a preferential fusion of myeloma cells with this ASCs subset. Finally, the targeted electrofusion of TACI-high and CD138-high sorted ASCs led to a 100% fusion yield compared to a non-targeted approach. In particular, over 60% of these generated hybridomas secreted Ag-specific mAbs. Collectively, these results pave the way for a highly efficient method to produce new mAbs by cell fusion, which could facilitate hybridoma generation and expand therapeutic applications of mAbs.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

Heightened synaptic and structural plasticity of immature abDGCs is thought to govern their distinct contributions to circuit and network mechanisms of hippocampal-dependent memory operations. Protracted maturation or neoteny of abDGCs in higher mammals is hypothesized to offset decline in adult hippocampal neurogenesis by expanding the capacity for circuit and network plasticity underlying different memory operations. Here, we provide evidence for this hypothesis by genetically modelling the effective impact of neoteny of abDGCs on circuitry, network properties and social cognition in mice. We show that selective synchronous expansion of a single cohort of 4 weeks old immature, but not 8 weeks old mature abDGCs, increases functional recruitment of fast spiking parvalbumin expressing inhibitory interneurons (PV INs) in CA3/CA2, number of PV IN-CA3/CA2 synapses, and GABAergic inhibition of CA3/CA2. This transient increase in feed-forward inhibition in DG-CA2 decreased social memory interference and enhanced social memory consolidation. In vivo local field potential recordings revealed that the expansion of a single cohort of 4-week-old abDGCs increased baseline power, amplitude, and duration, as well as sensitivity to social investigation-dependent rate changes of sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) in CA1 and CA2, a neural substrate for memory consolidation. Inhibitory neuron-targeted chemogenetic manipulations implicate CA3/CA2 INs, including PV INs, as necessary and sufficient for social memory consolidation following neotenic expansion of the abDGC population and in wild-type mice, respectively. These studies suggest that neoteny of abDGCs may represent an evolutionary adaptation to support cognition by reconfiguring PV IN-CA3/CA2 circuitry and emergent network properties underlying memory consolidation.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

A lack of standardized, large-scale experimental data has hindered obtaining a more predictive understanding of these motions. After curating >100 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) relaxation datasets, we realized an observable for s-ms motion was hiding in plain sight. Millisecond motions can cause NMR signals to broaden beyond detection, leaving some residues not assigned in the chemical shift datasets of ~10,000 proteins deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB). We made the bold assumption that residues missing assignments are exchange-broadened due to s-ms motions, and trained various deep learning models to predict missing assignments as markers for such dynamics. Strikingly, these models also predict s-ms motion directly measured in NMR relaxation experiments. The best of these models, which we named Dyna-1, leverages an intermediate layer of the multimodal language model ESM-3. Notably, dynamics directly linked to biological function--including enzyme catalysis and ligand binding--are particularly well predicted by Dyna-1, which parallels our findings that residues with s-ms motions are highly conserved. We anticipate the datasets and models presented here will be transformative in unlocking the common language of dynamics and function.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

Instead, these elements encode a short transmembrane protein, sORF2, with structural features reminiscent of viral cell-cell fusogens. Through genetics, imaging, and electron microscopy, we show that sORF2 localizes to invasive somatic protrusions, enabling the direct transfer of retrotransposon capsids into the oocyte.

Some prior evidence for neural processing of perceived musical beat (periodic pulse) may be confounded by stimulus-driven neural activity. However, one study used frequency tagging, which measures electrical brain activity at frequencies present in a stimulus, to show increased brain activity at imagery-related frequencies when listeners imagined a metrical pattern while listening to an isochronous auditory stimulus (Nozaradan et al., 2011) in a manner that controlled for stimulus factors. It is unclear though whether this represents repeatable evidence for conscious perception of beat and whether the effect is influenced by relevant music experience, such as music and dance training. This registered report details the results of 13 independent conceptual replications of Nozaradan et al. (2011), all using the same vetted protocol. Listeners performed the same imagery tasks as in Nozaradan et al. (2011), with the addition of a behavioral task on each trial to measure conscious perception. Meta-analyses examined the effect of imagery condition, revealing smaller raw effect sizes (Binary: 0.03 {micro}V, Ternary: 0.03 {micro}V) than in the original study (Binary: 0.12 {micro}V, Ternary: 0.20 {micro}V) with no moderating effects of music or dance training. The difference in estimated effects sizes (this study: n = 152, p2 =.03 - .04; 2011 study: n = 8, p2 =.62 - .76) suggests that large sample sizes may be required to reliably observe these effects, which challenges the use of frequency tagging as a method to study (neural correlates of) beat perception. Furthermore, a binary logistic regression on individual trials revealed that only neural activity at the stimulus frequency predicted performance on the imagery-related task; contrary to our hypothesis, the neural activity at the imagery-related frequency was not a significant predictor. We discuss possible explanations for discrepancies between these findings and the original study and implications of the extensions provided by this registered report.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

This study included 63,555 cases, 17,700 proxy cases with a family history of Parkinson's disease, and 1,746,386 controls, making it the largest investigation of Parkinson's disease genetic risk to date. Methods Meta-analyses were performed using standard fixed and random effect models for the European sub-populations, the case-control studies, and the population biobanks separately. Finally, all of the European ancestries for all study types as well as proxy cases were combined in our final cross-European meta-analysis. We estimated heritable risk across ancestry groups, investigated tissue and cell-type enrichment, and prioritized risk genes using public data to facilitate functional follow-up efforts. Results The final combined cross-European meta-analysis identified 134 risk loci (59 novel), with a total of 157 independent signals, significantly expanding our understanding of Parkinson's disease risk. Multi-omic data integration revealed that expression of the nominated risk genes are highly enriched in brain tissues, particularly in neuronal and astrocyte cell types. Additionally, we prioritized 33 high-confidence genes across these 134 loci for future follow-up studies. Conclusions By integrating diverse European populations and leveraging harmonized data from the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program (GP2), we reveal new insight into the genetic architecture of Parkinson's disease. We identified a total of 134 risk loci, expanding the number of known loci associated with PD by approximately 24%. We also provided an initial layer of biological context to these results through follow-up analyses in an effort to facilitate follow-up studies and precision medicine efforts with the goal of advancing Parkinson's disease research.","NA","medrxiv",1742508508303

This unregulated response to self is fuelled by heightened metabolic programmes, which offers a promising new direction to uncover novel treatment strategies. {beta}hydrolase domain-containing protein 11 (ABHD11) is a mitochondrial hydrolase that maintains the catalytic function of ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH), and its expression in CD4+ T cells has been linked to remission status in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the importance of ABHD11 in regulating T cell metabolism and function - and thus, the downstream implication for autoimmunity - is yet to be explored. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of ABHD11 dampens cytokine production by human and mouse T cells. Mechanistically, the anti-inflammatory effects of ABHD11 inhibition are attributed to increased 24,25-epoxycholesterol (24,25-EC) biosynthesis and subsequent liver X receptor (LXR) activation, which arise from a compromised TCA cycle. The impaired cytokine profile established by ABHD11 inhibition is extended to two patient cohorts of autoimmunity. Importantly, using a murine model of accelerated type 1 diabetes (T1D), we show that targeting ABHD11 suppresses cytokine production in antigen-specific T cells and delays the onset of diabetes in vivo. Collectively, our work provides pre-clinical evidence that ABHD11 is an encouraging drug target in T cell-mediated autoimmunity.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

Many condensates have internal subdomains with distinct compositional identities. A major challenge lies in dissecting the multicomponent logic that relates biomolecular features to emergent condensate organization. Nuclear paraspeckles are paradigmatic examples of multi-domain condensates, comprising core and shell layers with distinct compositions that are scaffolded by the lncRNA NEAT1, which spans both layers. A prevailing model of paraspeckle assembly proposes that core proteins bind directly and specifically to core-associated NEAT1 domains. Combining informatics and biochemistry, we unexpectedly find that the essential core proteins FUS and NONO bind and condense preferentially with shell-associated NEAT1 domains. The shell protein TDP-43 exhibits similar NEAT1 domain preferences on its own but forms surfactant-like shell layers around core protein-driven condensates when both are present. Together, experiments and physics-based simulations suggest that competitive RNA binding and immiscibility between core and shell proteins orders paraspeckle layers. More generally, we propose that sub-condensate organization can spontaneously arise from a balance of collaborative and competitive protein binding to the same domains of a lncRNA.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

Disrupting core PRC1 components in ISCs induces the formation of small cell clusters devoid of intestinal markers, a novel phenotype linked to premature mortality under stress. Notably, transient PRC1 loss is sufficient for cluster formation. These clusters overproliferate and exhibit immortality in serial transplantations, leading to their designation as tumor-initiating intestinal cells (TIICs).

Here, we show that multiple Bacteroidales species efficiently metabolize exogenous DNA, with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron converting it into the deaminated nucleobases uracil and xanthine. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we identify ddbABCDEF, a six-gene locus encoding secreted nucleases and an outer membrane transporter, essential for exogenous DNA metabolism in B. thetaiotaomicron. Colonization of gnotobiotic mice with ddbABCDEF mutants reveals that this pathway significantly alters nucleobase pools in the gut. Comparative genomics demonstrate that ddbABCDEF is evolutionarily related to a natural transformation system present in Bacteroidota and has diversified into four distinct subtypes, each linked to unique DNA-processing activities in closely related gut Bacteroidales strains. These findings thus establish DNA as a metabolic substrate in the gut microbiome and reveal a distinctive pathway for nucleobase production with implications for host-microbe interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

MethodsWe used nationwide data from Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, using 28- and 180-days risk periods following BNT162b2 vaccination or a positive test for SARS-Cov-2 infection. Individuals aged 5-19 years during the study period (1st January 2021-31st December 2022) were included. We used a common data model, using individual level data linked from nation-wide registers and a shared analysis script to harmonize data and analysis. Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) comparing outcome rates in risk windows to unvaccinated or uninfected follow-up rates. This was supplemented with self-controlled case series analyses. Results from different countries were analyzed jointly in a meta-analysis.

ResultsWe observed no clear association between BNT162b2 vaccination and new-onset AH, GBS or T1D. Neither did we observe any clear association with recurrent hospital visits following BNT162b2 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection. An association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and GBS was observed in both the 28-day and 180-day risk window (relative risk (RR) 15.10, 95% CI, 1.11-205.94, and RR 3.85, 1.33-11.14, respectively).

ConclusionsBNT162b2 vaccination was not associated with new-onset or recurrent hospital visits of these diseases in children and adolescents. Sars-CoV-2 infection was associated with new-onset GBS. Estimates were however uncertain due to the small number of cases.","NA","medrxiv",1742508508303

The structure of such pedigrees is challenging to visualise. Being directed acyclic graphs, pedigrees can be represented as matrices. Common choices are the numerator relationship matrix, A, and the adjacency matrix, T. With these matrices, the structure of pedigrees can then, in principle, be visualised via principal component analysis (PCA). However, the naive PCA of matrices for large pedigrees is challenging due to computational and memory constraints. Results We present the open-access R package randPedPCA for rapid pedigree PCA using sparse matrices and randomised linear algebra. Our rapid pedigree PCA builds on the fact that matrix-vector multiplications with the numerator relationship matrix can be carried out implicitly using the extremely sparse inverse Cholesky factor of the numerator relationship matrix. We demonstrate the utility of randPedPCA using several simulated datasets of pedigrees and SNPs. We then demonstrate the performance of randPedPCA by analysing the pedigree of the UK Labrador Retriever breeding population of almost 1.5 million individuals. Conclusions The structure of pedigrees can be efficiently and rapidly visualised using scatterplots of principal component scores. For large pedigrees, this is considerably faster than rendering plots of a pedigree graph.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

They hold promise in identifying individuals at increased risk for diseases, allowing earlier screening and interventions. Genotyping arrays, commonly used for PGS computation, are affordable and computationally efficient, while whole-genome sequencing (WGS) offers a comprehensive view of genetic variation. Using the same set of individuals, we compared PGS derived from arrays and WGS across multiple traits to evaluate differences in predictive performance, portability across populations, and computational efficiency. We computed PGS for 10 traits across the spectrum of heritability and polygenicity in the three largest genetic ancestry groups in All of Us (European, African American, Admixed American), trained on the multi-ancestry meta-analyses from the Pan-UK Biobank. Using the clumping and thresholding (C+T) method, we found that WGS-based PGS outperformed array-based PRS for highly polygenic traits but showed differentially reduced accuracy for sparse traits in certain populations. This may be attributable to the lower allele frequency observed in clumped variants from WGS compared to arrays. Using the LD-informed PRS-CS method, we observed overall improved prediction performance compared to C+T, with WGS outperforming arrays across most non-cancer traits. In conclusion, while PGS computed using WGS generally provide superior predictive power with PRS-CS, the advantage over arrays is context-dependent, varying by trait, population, and the PGS method. This study provides insights into the complexities and potential advantages of using different genotype discovery approach for polygenic predictions in diverse populations.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

This property of bacterial populations vastly increases genomic diversity within phylogenetically narrow groups. Members of the genus Variovorax have extensive heterogeneity in genome architecture, including sequenced isolates containing plasmids, megaplasmids, and chromids. Many of the Variovorax genomes in the NCBI database were generated using only short-read data and were assembled to the permanent draft stage. We acquired a set of these isolates and used the MinION long-read sequencing device to generate additional data to allow hybrid assemblies of these genomes. Here we present the finished assemblies of 15 Variovorax isolates from diverse ecosystems that were previously only available as permanent drafts. When added to the previously published Variovorax assemblies for EPS, CSUSB, and VAI-C and those published by other groups, we found significant diversity in genome architecture. We found that there are plasmids, megaplasmids, and chromids that are distinguishable using Guanine-Cytosine (G+C content) content as a signal. We identified a plasmid integration event in NFACC27 and identify potential evolutionary relationships in the second replicons based on ParB homology as well as ANI. The evidence suggests that Variovorax is like its sister taxon Burkholderia, highly capable of acquiring and maintaining stable secondary replicons. The plasticity of these architectures and the mechanisms for maintenance remain a topic for future research.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

The assembly and disassembly of these structures are intricately regulated to maintain cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of these structures has been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Identifying molecules that can disassemble these toxic assemblies is a promising approach to abrogate the associated disease phenotypes augmented by these condensates but is still poorly explored. In this study, we have identified a role for low-complexity peptide rich in arginine and glycine as a disassembly factor for mutant FUS and TDP43 condensates. Deletion of RGG-motif-containing yeast protein Sbp1 reduces the disassembly of FUS and TDP43 condensates and increases toxicity. Consistent with that, the expression of Sbp1 in human cells reduced the cytoplasmic condensates of FUS and TDP43 mutants (FUS-P525L and TDP43 lacking nuclear localization signal-{Delta}NLS) and increased nuclear localization of the FUS-P525L in an RGG-motif dependent manner. In accordance with the yeast data, we observed that the viability of cells expressing FUS-P525L improved upon the expression of Sbp1. In-cell sedimentation assay revealed that purified Sbp1 could partition FUS-P525L, but not the TDP43-{Delta}NLS mutant, from enriched insoluble condensates to soluble fraction. In-vitro sedimentation assay using a two-component purified system confirmed that partitioning of FUS, but not TDP43, increased to the soluble fraction in an RGG-motif-dependent manner. Finally, incubating the cells expressing FUS-P525L and TDP43-{Delta}NLS mutant with RGG-peptide resulted in a reduction of condensate size within the cells, suggesting the sufficiency of RGG peptides. Overall, our results identify a role of RGG-peptide in disassembling mutant FUS and TDP43 condensates implicated in ALS, projecting their possible therapeutic role in treating ALS.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is characterized by pneumococci invading blood (bacteremia), lungs (pneumonia), or brain and cerebrospinal fluid (meningitis). Meningitis remains an important global health concern because half of the survivors experience long-term neurological damage. The antibiotics commonly used to treat pneumococcal infections are {beta}-lactams and macrolides, however, S. pneumoniae is nowadays often resistant to one or several antibiotics, therefore novel antimicrobials are needed. Here, we found that the bacteriophage-derived Cpl-1 endolysin showed consistent antibacterial activity against {beta}-lactam- and macrolide-resistant pneumococcal clinical strains grown in human blood and human cerebrospinal fluid. Exploiting synergistic and additive mechanisms, supplementation of cpl-1 to either penicillin or erythromycin rescued human neuronal cells from the cytotoxicity of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal infections. Finally, systemic administration of cpl-1 supplemented to penicillin in mice infected with penicillin-resistant pneumococci successfully reduced bacteremia, and, thanks to the efficient penetration across the blood-brain barrier, abolished bacterial load in the brain, resulting in increased (89%) survival accompanied by an asymptomatic course of infection. These findings strongly indicate that cpl-1 can restore antibiotic sensitivity against {beta}-lactam- and macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae, representing a fundamental adjunct therapy to standard-of-care antibiotics against multidrug-resistant IPD.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

Performance was worse for unexpected long delays than for unexpected short delays, suggesting that WM may be tuned to expire in a delay-dependent manner.

Here, we investigate the gliding motility of Craspedostauros australis, a raphid pennate diatom that moves rapidly across submerged surfaces using an intracellular actomyosin motility complex and adhesive mucilage strand secretion. Using high-precision single-cell tracking, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and interference reflection microscopy (IRM), we reveal how diatoms achieve diverse path curvatures by dynamically modulating the location of raphe-substrate contact and switching between one- and two-raphe contact gliding. Our results show that local curvature variations along the raphes dictate trajectory shapes, with one-raphe contact gliding producing highly curved paths, while two-raphe contact gliding results in paths of lower curvature. IRM imaging further confirms that transitions between these gliding modes underlie abrupt changes in path curvature and cell reorientation. This dynamic-raphe-switching mechanism is conserved across cell sizes and correctly predicts the increased path curvatures observed in smaller cells according to their more pronounced local raphe curvature. By quantitatively linking raphe geometry, cell-substrate attachment dynamics and motility patterns, our study provides insights into a novel motility mechanism that allows diatoms to adapt their movement to complex environments.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

To address this, we recorded RE activity in humans (BOLD fMRI) and rats (fiber photometry) during Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction. In both rats and humans, we found that conditioned stimulus (CS)-evoked activity in RE reflects the associative value of the CS. In rats, we additionally found that spontaneous neural activity in RE tracks defensive freezing and shows anticipatory increases in calcium activity that precede the termination of freezing behavior. Single-unit recordings in rats confirmed that individual RE neurons index both the associative value of the CS and defensive behavior transitions. Moreover, distinct neuronal ensembles in the RE encode fear versus extinction memories. These findings suggest a conserved role of the RE across species in modulating defensive states and emotional memory processes, providing a foundation for future translational re-search on fear-related disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

Here, we establish a large genome panel to dissect the genetic architecture of emerging resistance in the major wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. The European diversity panel spans 15 sampling years and 27 countries for a total of 1394 sequenced and phenotyped strains. Using two complementary assays to quantify resistance levels of each strain, we captured fine-grained shifts in DMI resistance over space and time. We conducted genome-wide association studies based on a comprehensive set of genotyping approaches for six DMIs. We mapped a total of 21,220 genetic variants and 158 genes linked to resistance. The substantial scope in genetic mechanisms underpinning DMI resistance significantly expands our mechanistic understanding how continent-wide resistance arises in fungal pathogens over time.

Here, we present a comprehensive proteomic analysis of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), the HGSOC precursor lesion, covering more than 10,000 proteins from ultralow input archival tissue. We discovered that STICs and concurrent invasive carcinomas were indistinguishable at the global proteome level, revealing a similar level of phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity. Using cell-type resolved tissue proteomics, we revealed strong cell-of-origin signatures preserved in STICs and invasive tumors and identified early dysregulated pathways of therapeutic relevance. These include proliferation and DNA damage repair signatures, as well as onco-metabolic changes, such as increased cholesterol biosynthesis. Finally, we uncovered substantial remodeling of the co-evolving tumor microenvironment, affecting approximately one-third of the stromal proteome, and derived a common signature associated with progressive immunosuppression and ECM restructuring.

Such communities play pivotal roles in countless ecosystems from environmental to human health. Perturbations of these community structures have been implicated in disease processes such as Crohns disease and cancer. Disturbances to existing ecosystems often occur over time, making it essential to have robust methods for detecting longitudinal alterations in microbial interactions as they develop. Existing methods for identifying temporal microbial community alterations have focused on abundance alterations in individual taxa, rather than relationships between the taxa, known as microbial interactions. Identifying these interactions overtime provides a fuller understanding of how the microbial ecosystem changes as a whole. To fill this gap, we have developed a pipeline that handles the complicated nature of repeated compositional count data, LIMON, Longitudinal Individual Microbial Omics Networks. This novel statistical approach addresses key challenges of modeling temporal and microbial data including overdispersion, zero inflated count data, compositionality, repeated measure design sample covariates over time, and identification of individualized or sample specific networks. This approach allows users to denoise covariate effects from their data, return networks per time point, identify interaction changes between each time point, and return individual networks and network characteristics per sample per time point. In doing so, LIMON provides a platform to identify the relationship between network interactions and sample features of interest over time. Here we show LIMON, in simulation studies, can accurately remove covariate effects, render sample specific networks, and better recover underlying network edges from covariate confounded data. Analysis of a longitudinal infant microbiome and diet dataset illustrates LIMONs novel utility to identify key microbial interactions related to diet type across time.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

This cross-protection has the potential to alter the transmission dynamics and likelihood of emergence of novel zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential. Here, we investigate how changes in population immunity after the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the likelihood of emergence of a novel sarbecovirus, termed SARS-CoV-X. We show that sera from patients with different COVID-19 immunological histories possess cross-neutralising antibodies against the spike (S) protein of multiple zoonotic sarbecoviruses. Mathematical simulations using these viruses show a significant reduction in their likelihood of emergence in populations with current levels of SARS-CoV-2 natural and vaccine-derived immunity, with the outcome determined by the extent of cross-protection and the R0 of the novel virus. We also show that preventative vaccination programs against SARS-CoV-X using currently available COVID-19 vaccines can help resist emergence even in the presence of co-circulating SARS-CoV-2. However, it was possible for a theoretical vaccine with very high specificity to SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., one which elicits very low cross-protection against SARS-CoV-X) to increase the likelihood of SARS-CoV-X emergence, due to its effects on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and, by extension, the levels of naturally-derived cross-protection in the human population. Overall, our findings show that SARS-CoV-2 circulation and COVID-19 vaccination have generated widespread population immunity against antigenically related sarbecoviruses, and this new immunological barrier is likely to be a strong determinant of the ability of novel sarbecoviruses to emerge in humans.

In this 7T-fMRI study we compared three methods of improving sensitivity in these areas: parallel transmit, which uses multiple transmit elements, controlled independently, to homogenise the flip angle experienced by the tissue; multi-echo, which entails collection of multiple volumes at different echo times following a single radiofrequency pulse; and multiband, in which multiple slices are acquired simultaneously. We found that parallel transmit and multi-echo increased the magnitude of the BOLD signal change, but only multi-echo increased BOLD magnitude in areas prone to susceptibility artefacts. Multiband and denoising of multi-echo data with independent components analysis (ICA) both improved precision of GLM fit. Exploratory results suggested that multi-echo and ICA denoising can both benefit multivariate analyses. In conclusion, a multi-echo, multiband sequence improved fMRI quality in areas prone to susceptibility artefacts while maintaining sensitivity across the whole brain. We recommend this approach for studies investigating the functional roles of ventral temporal and orbitofrontal regions with 7T fMRI.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

Here, we focus on predicting the structural flexibility of the functionally important antibody and T-cell receptor CDR3 loops. We extracted a dataset of CDR3 like loop motifs from the PDB to create ALL-conformations, a dataset containing 1.2 million structures and more than 100,000 unique sequences. Using this dataset, we develop ITsFlexible a method classifying CDR3 flexibility, which outperforms all alternative approaches on our crystal structure datasets and successfully generalises to MD simulations.

However, preparing inputs for the locally installed software is not always straightforward, and the results of local runs are not always presented in an ideally accessible fashion. Furthermore, it is not yet clear whether the latest tools perform equivalently for all types of target.

ResultsABCFold facilitates the use of AlphaFold 3, Boltz-1, and Chai-1 with a standardised input to predict atomic structures, with Boltz-1 and Chai-1 being installed on runtime (if required). MSAs can be generated internally using either the JackHMMER MSA search within AlphaFold 3, or with the MMseqs2 API. Alternatively, users can provide their own custom MSAs. This therefore allows AlphaFold 3 to be installed and run without downloading the large databases needed for JackHMMER. There are also straightforward options to use templates, including custom templates. Results from all packages are treated in a unified fashion, enabling easy comparison of results from different methods. A variety of visualisation options are available which include information on steric clashes.

However, glycosylated molecules showed resistance to treatment with RNase A/T1 but were sensitive to proteinase K digestion under denaturing conditions. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based proteomics, we detect various proteins that co-purify with small but not large RNA preparations isolated from human or murine cells, including the glycosylated membrane protein LAMP1.

The N2B27 basal medium in which mouse gastruloids are cultured can either be home-made (HM-N2B27) with materials of known origin, or commercially sourced (NDiff227), where the exact formulation is unknown. In this study we examined whether these formulations resulted in significant differences in gastruloid development. Our results reveal that while both media enable the standard gastruloid elongation, HM-N2B27 results in gastruloids that start the elongation process earlier, have higher number of cells and an increased anterior domain. RNAseq analysis showed significant differences in cell fate specification, with HM-N2B27 gastruloids exhibiting higher expression of spinal cord-related genes, while NDiff227 favours mesodermal differentiation. Furthermore, differential gene enrichment analysis suggests that changes in key signalling pathways underline the differences between HM-N2B27 and NDiff227 gastruloids. These findings highlight the importance of basal media composition for gastruloid development, underscoring the need for careful media selection during in vitro engineering of stem cell-based embryo models.

While LC symptoms vary widely, neuropathy is one of the most prevalent symptoms and drastically affects patients quality of life. However, the underlying pathophysiology of LC neuropathy remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the prevalence and potential mechanisms of LC neuropathy in the largest LC neuropathy cohort to date.

MethodsWe conducted an observational study of 977 adults with LC at Dell Medical School. Participants underwent clinical assessments, skin punch biopsy, and comprehensive metabolic, endocrine and immunological profiling. A subset of patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

FindingsNeuropathic symptoms were reported by 55% (534/977) participants, with skin biopsy confirming small fiber neuropathy in 56.5% (48/85) cases, affecting both epidermal and autonomic nerve fibers. Common risk factors for neuropathy, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, did not fully explain neuropathic symptoms. While general immunological markers (lymphocyte, T cell, and B cell count and C reactive protein were unremarkable, unexpectedly, we detected anti-ganglioside antibodies (AGAs) in 25% of patients with LC neuropathy, a comparable rate to other AGA-associated neuropathies. Longitudinal testing revealed persistent AGA positivity, and multiple elevated AGAs in a subset of patients. In a pilot treatment cohort of eight patients, IVIG treatment resulted in improvement of patient reported neuropathic symptoms.

InterpretationOur findings reveal a high prevalence of small fiber neuropathy in LC, with evidence suggesting an autoimmune mechanism involving AGAs in one in four LC neuropathy patients. The therapeutic response to IVIG further supports an autoimmune pathophysiology, suggesting potential benefits of immunomodulation in LC neuropathy patients.","NA","medrxiv",1742508508303

Astrocytes, the primary homeostatic cells of the central nervous system (CNS), exhibit species-specific characteristics, with human astrocytes specifically displaying unique structural and functional features. It is thus essential to investigate human-specific astrocytic responses to neuropathology using human-relevant models. Varicose projection (VP) astrocytes, traditionally considered specific to humans and apes, were suggested to reflect pathological burden, albeit direct evidence linking them to neurological diseases has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that VP astrocytes are present in mice and tigers (Panthera tigris) and we provide evidence from four distinct human-based models that VP astrocytes are not a distinct physiological astrocyte subtype but rather a novel class of reactive astrocytes associated with neuropathology. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astrocytes, mixed neural cultures, and cortical organoids, we showed that VP astrocytes are induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) or LPS. Notably, cytokine withdrawal reverses the VP phenotype of astrocytes, indicating that it is a transient, inflammation-dependent state. We characterized the distinctive components of varicosities, including markers for extracellular vesicles, mitochondria, Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum components, suggesting roles in cellular stress responses and metabolic dysregulation. We further validated the pathological relevance of VP astrocytes by documenting their significant enrichment in postmortem brain samples from patients with several neurodegenerative diseases including as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, as well as in surgical resections from patients with epilepsy due to hippocampal sclerosis or brain tumors, including previously unreported subcortical regions such as basal ganglia. Additionally, we identified a higher number of VP astrocytes also in mouse astrocytes upon treatment with pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that the formation of VP astrocytes is an evolutionarily conserved astrocytic response to neuroinflammation. Our findings point to VP astrocytes as a novel reactive astrocyte subtype closely linked to neuropathology, highlighting their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in neurological diseases. This study lays the groundwork for future investigations into the mechanisms driving VP astrocyte formation and their broader implications in neuropathology.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

To understand the broader implications of IFN-driven immune responses, we analyzed whole-blood transcriptomics, plasma proteomics, metabolomics, and immune cell profiling in COVID-19 patients and uninfected controls. Patients were stratified into low (LIS), moderate (MIS), and high (HIS) ISG expression clusters, independent of acute disease severity. HIS patients exhibited elevated inflammatory mediators (S100A8/A9, Neopterin) and altered metabolic profiles, yet immune activation patterns varied. Plasma from HIS cases induced differential activation in healthy neutrophils and monocytes, with severe HIS plasma showing reduced activation, suggesting the presence of suppressive soluble factors. Metabolomic analysis revealed widespread lipid metabolism dysregulation, including reductions in phospholipids, sphingolipids, and plasmalogens, which correlated with impaired immune activation. Branched-chain lipids and tryptophan metabolism products correlated strongly with monocyte and neutrophil activation, linking metabolic shifts to immune regulation. Despite IFN autoantibody detection in a subset of patients, no direct association with ISG expression was observed. These findings suggest that IFN-driven immune-metabolic dysregulation may persist beyond acute infection, contributing to post-viral inflammation, immune dysfunction, and susceptibility to long COVID or autoimmune-like sequelae. The interplay between IFN signaling, mitochondrial function, and lipid metabolism highlights novel therapeutic targets for immune modulation in viral infections and chronic inflammatory conditions. Understanding these immune signatures may inform precision medicine approaches in post-viral syndromes and immunometabolic disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

MRN senses DSBs through a tight clamp-like sensing state with closed coiled-coil domains, but auto-inhibited MRE11 nuclease. NBS1 wraps around the MRE11 dimer, with NBS1s ATM recruitment motif sequestered by binding to the regulatory RAD50 S site, necessitating an allosteric switch for ATM activation.

While COVID-19 exacerbated the decline in routine vaccination through disruption of healthcare services and the diversion of resources, factors including vaccine hesitancy, socioeconomic disparities and vaccine policy also contribute to changes in vaccination behavior. Understanding the factors that influence vaccination choice is necessary to develop effective public health policy.

MethodsWe collect county-level MMR vaccination rates for kindergarten children from 2017 - 2024 for 2,266 U.S. counties, evaluate coverage patterns and trends before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and implement multivariable weighted logistic regression models to identify factors associated with low and declining MMR vaccination rates in U.S. counties.

FindingsWe reveal a nationwide decline in MMR rates following the COVID-19 pandemic, with declines observed in 1,688 of the counties evaluated. We find state-level non-medical exemption (NME) policies to be strongly associated with low and declining MMR rates. We identify a positive association in vaccination rates across vaccine types. We find higher MMR rates are positively associated with Republican-aligned counties and declines in MMR rates to be positively associated with COVID-19 death rates.

InterpretationThe significant association between NMEs and low and declining MMR rates suggest these state level policies are harmful and reduce vaccination coverage. The positive associations among vaccine types suggest spillover effects in vaccine seeking behavior. The association between MMR rates and Republican-aligned counties contrast COVID-19 vaccination patterns, highlighting the complex nature of political polarization on vaccine-related behavior, while the association between MMR declines and COVID-19 death rate reveals an additional burden posed by the pandemic.

In this study, we developed an aptamer (Apt343) that targets IF3N with the goal of elucidating its contribution to translation initiation. Rapid kinetics assays revealed that Apt343 reduces the rate of IF3 association with the 30S ribosomal subunit by 13-fold, while inducing a pronounced rearrangement of both IF3 domains on the 30S. These changes compromise IF2-, mRNA-, and fMet-tRNAfMet-dependent movements of IF3, delaying 30S initiation complex (30S IC) formation by up to two orders of magnitude. Cryo-EM analysis suggests that Apt343 may sterically clash with fMet-tRNAfMet, thereby perturbing the canonical pathway by which the initiator tRNA is accommodated after IF2-dependent recruitment and prior to start codon decoding. However, once the 30S IC is formed, blocking IF3N does not prevent 50S subunit joining or 70S IC assembly. Collectively, these findings support a role for IF3N in enhancing an efficient path for fMet-tRNAfMet accommodation towards the 30S IC and promoting IF3C displacement to unlock 50S recruitment. Moreover, this aptamer-based strategy offers a valuable tool for dissecting domain-specific activities of multidomain factors within complex environments such as the initiating ribosome.

However, the ability of these ring-shaped DNA motors to navigate large DNA-bound obstacles, such as DNA/RNA polymerases and ribosomes in prokaryotes, has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a bacterial SMC Wadjet complex can efficiently bypass obstacles larger than the SMC coiled coil lumen if they are linked to the extruded DNA by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This process is mediated by the selective entrapment of the ssDNA linker within the SMC hinge channel, which acts as an obligate gate, permitting ssDNA passage while excluding double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). By threading the linker through the hinge gate as dsDNA is translocated through the SMC motor, the obstacle can follow a trajectory distinct from its associated dsDNA, remaining outside the SMC ring. This mechanism enables continuous dsDNA entrapment while successfully bypassing obstacles. We show that hinges of diverse SMC complexes including eukaryotic condensin and Smc5/6 also selectively accommodate ssDNA, suggesting that hinge bypass is a conserved feature across SMC proteins. We demonstrate that while the hinge domain is essential for obstacle bypass, it is dispensable for loop extrusion, showing that these functions are independent, provided by separate SMC modules. These findings uncover the long-sought function of the SMC hinge toroid and provide the first mechanistic explanation for how DNA-entrapping SMC complexes can extrude loops on chromosomal DNA densely populated with obstacles. Integrating hinge bypass into the DNA loop extrusion model, we propose that the hinge may also facilitate the passage of RNA and peptide, enabling bypass of transcription-associated ribonucleoprotein complexes and other SMC complexes.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

The universally conserved F1Fo-ATP synthase regenerates ATP from ADP and Pi by harnessing a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient (pmf). Bacteria have evolved a wide diversity of pmf-forming proteins to make ATP using light, organic, and inorganic energy sources. Recently, we proposed that many bacteria survive using atmospheric trace gases to produce ATP when limited for other energy sources. However, there is no direct proof that atmospheric energy sources are sufficient to generate pmf or drive ATP synthesis. Here, we show that the membrane-associated hydrogen:quinone oxidoreductase Huc from Mycobacterium smegmatis enables ATP synthesis from air. Purified Huc couples H2 oxidation to the reduction of various ubiquinone and menaquinone analogues. We designed and optimised a minimal respiratory chain in which Huc is reconstituted into liposomes with a pmf-generating terminal oxidase and the ATP-generating F1Fo-ATP synthase. Our experiments show that passive hydrogen exchange from air to solution is sufficient for the electron transfer and pmf generation required to accumulate ATP. Finally, by combining continuous culture bioenergetics measurements with theoretical calculations, we show this process is sufficient for mycobacteria to sustain pmf and ATP synthesis (two ATP molecules per H2 oxidised) for maintenance energy requirements during nutrient starvation. These findings prove that atmospheric energy sources are dependable  lifeline substrates that enable continuous energy conservation during nutrient starvation. In addition, this work provides a new tool for ATP production in synthetic applications, which unlike other approaches is traceless without by-product accumulation.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

TIR domains encoded by plants and prokaryotes function as enzymes to produce diverse small molecule immune signals. Plant genomes can encode hundreds of TIR-domain containing proteins - many of which confer important agricultural disease resistance as TIR-NLR (nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat) immune receptors. Despite their importance, how natural variation influences TIR enzymatic output and immunity-associated cell death is largely unexplored. We assayed a complete collection of the TIR domains of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 (the ""AtTIRome"") to explore variation in TIR metabolite production and cell death signaling. Roughly half of the AtTIRome triggered cell death in transient assays. Artificial TIR proteins designed based on consensus sequences of the AtTIRomes cell death phenotypic classes revealed polymorphisms controlling variation in TIR cell death elicitation and metabolite production. Structure-function analyses of artificial TIRs revealed that natural variation in the ""BB-loop"", a flexible region overlying the catalytic pocket, determines differences in function across Arabidopsis TIR-containing proteins. We further demonstrate that artificial TIRs are functional on an NLR chassis and that BB-loop variation can tune the activity of a natural TIR-NLR protein. These findings shed light on the diversity of TIR outputs and reveal methods to design and engineer TIR-based immune receptors.

Significance StatementTIR (Toll/interleukin-1 receptors) domain proteins perform immune signaling across the Tree of Life. TIR domains are enzymes that can process NAD+ to generate diverse small molecule signals. In order to better understand TIR-based signaling, we leveraged Arabidopsis natural variation across [~]150 TIR proteins to inform the design of artificial TIRs, define features that control output, and tune the output of a natural TIR immune receptor. The engineering of plant immune pathways will enable the optimization of disease resistance to safeguard yields.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303

Here, we present high-resolution spatial transcriptomics of 40 postmortem brain samples from patients with Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and severe COVID-19. Analyzing over 1.5 million spatially resolved cells across dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex revealed disease-specific transcriptional signatures with pronounced layer- and region-specificity. In Parkinson's disease, we identified stressed neurons creating distinctive microenvironmental gradients where metabolic and protein degradation pathways are elevated near stress epicenters, while regenerative processes increase with distance. COVID-19 brains displayed extensive peripheral immune cell infiltration, particularly in the subcortical white matter, accompanied by compromised blood-brain barrier and coordinated neuroinflammatory responses from microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells. Integration of miRNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics uncovered layer-specific regulatory patterns, including neuroinflammation-associated miR-155. This atlas provides unprecedented insights into disease pathology and highlights the critical importance of spatial molecular context in understanding brain disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1742508508303
