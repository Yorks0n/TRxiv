This study compared leading commercial blood tests for amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.

MethodsPlasma samples from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were assayed with AD blood tests from C2N Diagnostics, Fujirebio Diagnostics, ALZPath, Janssen, Roche Diagnostics, and Quanterix. Outcomes measures were amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, cortical thickness, and dementia severity. Logistic regression models assessed the classification accuracies of individual or combined plasma biomarkers for binarized outcomes, and Spearman correlations evaluated continuous relationships between individual plasma biomarkers and continuous outcomes.

ResultsMeasures of plasma p-tau217, either individually or in combination with other plasma biomarkers, had the strongest relationships with all AD outcomes.

DiscussionThis study identified the plasma biomarker analytes and assays that most accurately classified amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1722809325288

However, such methods are limited by the quantity and diversity of structures used for training, which represent a small, biased fraction of protein space. Here, we describe proseLM, a method for protein sequence design based on adaptation of protein language models to incorporate structural and functional context. We show that proseLM benefits from the scaling trends of underlying language models, and that the addition of non-protein context -- nucleic acids, ligands, and ions -- improves recovery of native residues during design by 4-5% across model scales. These improvements are most pronounced for residues that directly interface with non-protein context, which are faithfully recovered at rates >70% by the most capable proseLM models. We experimentally validated proseLM by optimizing the editing efficiency of genome editors in human cells, achieving a 50% increase in base editing activity, and by redesigning therapeutic antibodies, resulting in a PD-1 binder with 2.2 nM affinity.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness.

Despite extensive data from consortia like ENCODE, understanding the dynamics of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in gene expression remains challenging. Deep learning is a powerful tool for learning gene expression and epigenomic signals from DNA sequences, exhibiting superior performance compared to conventional machine learning approaches. However, even the most advanced deep learning-based methods may fall short in capturing the regulatory effects of distal elements such as enhancers, limiting their predictive accuracy. In addition, these methods may require significant resources to train or to adapt to newly generated data. To address these challenges, we present EPInformer, a scalable deep-learning framework for predicting gene expression by integrating promoter-enhancer interactions with their sequences, epigenomic signals, and chromatin contacts. Our model outperforms existing gene expression prediction models in rigorous cross-chromosome validation, accurately recapitulates enhancer-gene interactions validated by CRISPR perturbation experiments, and identifies crucial transcription factor motifs within regulatory sequences.

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1722809325288

However, current deep learning-based DNPD approaches are often limited by their focus on specific or narrowly defined protein designs, restricting broader exploration and the discovery of diverse, functional proteins. To address this issue, we introduce Pinal, a probabilistic sampling method that generates protein sequences using rich natural language as guidance. Unlike end-to-end text-to-sequence generation approaches, we employ a two-stage generative process. Initially, we generate structures based on given language instructions, followed by designing sequences conditioned on both the structure and the language. This approach facilitates searching within the smaller structure space rather than the vast sequence space. Experiments demonstrate that Pinal outperforms existing models, including the concurrent work ESM3, and can generalize to novel protein structures outside the training distribution when provided with appropriate instructions. This work aims to aid the biological community by advancing the design of novel proteins, and our code will be made publicly available soon.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

TDP-43 is an intrinsically disordered multidomain protein that consists of an N-terminal domain (NTD1-102), two tandem RNA recognition motifs (RRM1102-177 and RRM2191-260), and an intrinsically disordered glycine-rich C-terminal261-414 domain. We previously identified a chemical probe which led to allosteric alterations between the RRM and NTD of TDP-43. We attributed these changes to potential interdomain interactions between the NTD and RRM segments. In this work, we compared the 2D [1H,15N] HSQC-NMR resonances of two constructs, TDP-43102-260 (RRM domain alone) against TDP-431-260 (NTD linked to RRM) and observed clustered shifts in the RNA binding sites of both RRM domains. To investigate why these shifts appeared in the RRM domains, in the absence of RNA, we hypothesized that the NTD domain could be stacking on the RRM domains. Thus, we modeled NTD-RRM interactions using protein-protein docking along with de novo sequence-to-structure predictions of TDP-431-260 that propose NTD stacking onto the RRM domains. Using Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG)-relaxation dispersion NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrated evidence of an interaction between NTD1-102 and RRMs102-260. Finally, we investigated the impact of NTD on RNA binding using 2D 15N-HSQC-NMR and microscale thermophoresis (MST) by titration of a short UG-rich RNA sequence and observed significant changes in RNA binding between TDP-43102-260 and TDP-431-260, further suggesting the NTD plays a role in TDP-43 RNA interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

Beyond well-studied plants and cyanobacteria, many bacteria use Rubisco for chemolithoautotrophy in extreme environments on Earth. Here, we characterized the diversity of chemolithoautotrophic Rubiscos in subzero environments. First, we surveyed subzero environments and found that the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle was the most prevalent chemolithoautotrophic pathway. Second, we uncovered potential for chemolithoautotrophy in metagenomes from two distinct subzero, hypersaline Arctic environments: 40-kyr relic marine brines encased within permafrost (cryopeg brines) and first-year sea ice. Again, the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle was the dominant chemolithoautotrophic pathway in both environments, though with different Rubisco forms. From cryopeg brine, we reconstructed four metagenome-assembled genomes with the potential for chemolithoautotrophy, of which the sulfur-oxidizing genus Thiomicrorhabdus was most abundant. A broader survey of Thiomicrorhabdus genomes from diverse environments identified a core complement of three Rubisco forms (II, IAc, IAq) with distinct patterns of gain and loss. We developed a model framework and compared these different Rubisco forms across [CO2], [O2], and temperature. We found that form II outcompetes form I at low O2, but cold temperatures minimize this advantage. However, further inspection of form II from cold environments uncovered signals of thermal adaptation of key amino acids which resulted in a more exposed active site. These modifications suggest that these form II Rubisco proteins may have unique kinetics or thermal stability. This work can help address the limits of autotrophic functionality in extreme environments on Earth and other planetary bodies.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

We demonstrate that a single tree can host approximately a trillion microbes in its aboveground internal tissues, with microbial communities partitioned between heartwood and sapwood, each maintaining a distinct microbiome with minimal similarity to other plant tissues or nearby ecosystem components. Notably, the heartwood microbiome emerges as a unique ecological niche, distinguished in part by endemic archaea and anaerobic bacteria that drive consequential biogeochemical processes. Our research supports the emerging idea of a plant as a ""holobiont""3,4--a single ecological unit comprising host and associated microorganisms--and parallels human microbiome research in its implications for host health, disease, and functionality5. By mapping the structure, composition, and potential sources and functions of the tree internal microbiome, our findings pave the way for novel insights into tree physiology and forest ecology, and establish a new frontier in environmental microbiology.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

Model: We propose bootstrap evaluation of association matrices (BEAM), which integrates multiple omics profiles with multiple clinical endpoints. BEAM associates a set omic features with clinical endpoints via regression models and then uses bootstrap resampling to determine statistical significance of the set. Unlike existing methods, BEAM uniquely accommodates an arbitrary number of omic profiles and endpoints. Results: In simulations, BEAM performed similarly to the theoretically best simple test and outperformed other integrated analysis methods. In an example pediatric leukemia application, BEAM identified several genes with biological relevance established by a CRISPR assay that had been missed by univariate screens and other integrated analysis methods. Thus, BEAM is a powerful, flexible, and robust tool to identify genes for further laboratory and/or clinical research evaluation.

Here we used optogenetic stimulation in rats as an independent neurobiological technique for activating cortical hedonic hotspots to identify hedonic functions and map boundaries. We report that channelrhodopsin stimulations within rostral orbitofrontal and caudal insula hotspots doubled the number of hedonic liking reactions elicited by sucrose taste.

Using bioinformatic methods, we have defined a VHPO subfamily that regioselectively brominates alkyl quinolone (AQ) quorum sensing molecules. In vitro AQ halogenation activity was demonstrated from phylogenetically distinct bacteria lacking established AQ biosynthetic pathways and sourced from diverse environments. AQ-VHPOs show high sequence and biochemical similarities with negligible genomic synteny or biosynthetic gene cluster co-localization. Exposure of VHPO-containing microbes to synthetic AQs or established bacterial producers identifies the chemical and spatial response to subvert their bacteriostatic effects.

To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Warm White Light-Emitting Diode (LED), Cool White LED, Blue LED, and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic Puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation, and husbandry programs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic Puffin strandings remains to be the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine if aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

To investigate the basis for species-specific developmental tempo we performed a comprehensive comparative analysis of protein dynamics in mouse and human neural progenitors (NPs). Through a combination of targeted protein labelling, quantitative mass spectrometry, and functional genomics, we demonstrate that protein degradation is a key driver of tempo differences between mouse and human NPs. We observe a systematic 1.5-fold increase in protein half-lives in human NPs compared to mouse, independent of cellular compartment or protein function. This difference persists in post-mitotic neurons, indicating active degradation as the primary mechanism. Proteasomal activity is also ~1.5-fold higher in mouse NPs, consistent with upregulation of proteasome-associated proteins. Importantly, increasing the rate of proteolytic degradation of a key transcriptional repressor in neural progenitors accelerates the expression of its target gene. Despite differences in degradation rates, protein synthesis rates are similar between species, resulting in higher protein content in human NPs. Our findings highlight the central role of protein degradation in controlling developmental tempo and provide insight into the molecular basis of evolutionary changes in developmental timing across species.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

Here, we utilized subcellular-resolution imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (IST) in a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses wild-type human -synuclein (-syn-tg) to evaluate patterns of selective neuronal vulnerability to -synuclein pathology. By performing post-IST immunofluorescence for -synuclein phosphorylated at Ser129 (pSyn), we identified cell types in the cortex and hippocampus that were vulnerable or resistant to developing pSyn pathology. Next, we investigated the transcriptional underpinnings of the observed selective vulnerability using a set of custom probes to detect genes involved in -synuclein processing and toxicity. We identified expression of the kinase:substrate pair Plk2, which phosphorylates -synuclein at Ser129, and human SNCA (hSNCA), as underlying the selective vulnerability to pSyn pathology. Finally, we performed differential gene expression analysis, comparing non-transgenic cells to pSyn- and pSyn+ -syn- tg cells to reveal gene expression changes downstream of hSNCA overexpression and pSyn pathology, which included pSyn-dependent alterations in mitochondrial and endolysosomal genes. This study provides a comprehensive use case of IST, yielding new biological insights into the formation of -synuclein pathology and its downstream effects in a PD/DLB mouse model.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

Current methods for inferring neural communication track patterns of sustained co-activation over time, making them unsuitable to detect discrete instances of signal transmission. Here, we propose Event-marked Windowed Communication (EWC), a new analytical framework to infer functional interactions arising from discrete signalling events between neural elements, in otherwise continuous time series data. In contrast to conventional measures of functional connectivity, our method utilises an event-based subsampling of neural time series, which allows it to capture the statistical analogue of activity propagation. We test EWC on simulations of neural dynamics and show that it is capable of retrieving ground truth motifs of directional signalling, over a range of model configurations. Critically, we demonstrate that EWCs subsampling approach affords profound reductions in computation times, compared to established network inference methods such as transfer entropy. Lastly, we showcase the utility of EWC to infer whole-brain functional networks from MEG recordings. Networks computed using EWC and transfer entropy were highly correlated (median r=0.821 across subjects), but EWC inference was approximately 6.5 times faster per epoch. In summary, our work presents a new method to infer signalling from time series of neural activity at low computational costs. Our framework is flexible and can be applied to activity time series captured by diverse functional neuroimaging modalities, opening up new avenues for the study of neural communication.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

Additionally, our results suggest that cancer patients experience higher viral loads (however, with no direct relation with severity), likely because of decreased initial neutrophil counts (i.e., neutropenia), a frequent toxic side effect of anti-cancer therapy. Furthermore, severe cancer and immunosuppressed virtual patients suffered a high degree of tissue damage associated with elevated neutrophils. Lastly, parameter values associated with monocyte recruitment by infected cells were found to be elevated in severe cancer and immunosuppressed patients with respect to the COVID-19 reference group. Together, our study highlights that dysfunction in type I interferon and CD8+ T cells are key drivers of immune dysregulation in COVID-19, particularly in cancer patients and immunosuppressed individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

Exploitation of this largely unexplored molecular space requires identification and functional characterisation of genes that act at the phage-host interface. To date, this is restricted to few model phage-host systems that are amenable to genetic manipulation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a non-genetic mRNA targeting approach using exogenous delivery of programmable antisense oligomers (ASOs) to silence genes of both DNA and RNA phages. A systematic knockdown screen of core and accessory genes of the nucleus-forming jumbo phage {Phi}KZ, coupled to RNA-sequencing and microscopy analyses, reveals previously unrecognised proteins that are essential for phage replication and that, upon silencing, elicit distinct phenotypes at the level of the phage and host response. One of these factors is a {Phi}KZ-encoded nuclease that acts at a major decision point during infection, linking the formation of the protective phage nucleus to phage genome amplification. The non-genetic ASO-based gene silencing used here promises to be a versatile tool for molecular discovery in phage biology, will help elucidate defence and anti-defence mechanisms in non-model phage-host pairs, and offers potential for optimising phage therapy and biotechnological procedures.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

Their identification is critical to study the transcriptional regulation of genes controlling key traits that govern plant growth and development. They are also crucial components for the delineation of gene regulatory networks, which represent regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes. In maize, CREs have been profiled using different computational and experimental methods, but the extent to which these methods complement each other in identifying functional CREs is unclear. Here, we report the data-driven integration of different maize CRE profiling methods to optimize the capture of experimentally-confirmed TF binding sites, resulting in maps of integrated CREs (iCREs) showing increased levels of completeness and precision. We combined the iCREs with a wide diversity of gene expression data under drought conditions to perform motif enrichment and infer drought-specific GRNs. Mining these organ-specific GRNs revealed previously characterized and novel candidate regulators of maize drought response. Furthermore, by studying the transposable elements (TEs) overlapping with iCREs, we identified few TE superfamilies displaying typical epigenetic features of regulatory DNA that are potentially involved in wiring specific TF-target gene regulatory interactions. Overall, our study showcases the integration of different omics data sources to generate a high-quality collection of CREs, together with their applicability to better characterize gene regulation in the complex maize genome.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1722809325288

However, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. A better understanding of the role of aging in liver and other cancers can facilitate approaches for risk assessment, early detection and prevention. We hypothesize that age-driven changes render aged liver more sensitive to oncogenic stress and hence tumorigenesis. To investigate how the liver changes with age, we documented the immune profile, transcriptome and epigenome of healthy livers from both young and aged mice, revealing pronounced alterations with aging. Notably, in aged hepatocytes, we identified heightened interferon (IFN) signaling, as well as simultaneous tumor suppressor and oncogene signaling at both bulk and single cell level, suggestive of an aged liver that is poised for neoplasia. To challenge this seemingly poised state, we employed adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of a c-Myc oncogene in young and aged mouse liver hepatocytes in vivo. Analysis of aged hepatocytes expressing c-Myc revealed further elevated expression of IFN Stimulated Genes (ISGs). This ISG upregulation was evident in multiple models of oncogenic stress and transformation in older mice and also observed in aged humans with Metabolic dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH). We determined that Stat1 is both necessary and sufficient for the age specific elevated ISG expression in old wild type mice. Remarkably, inhibiting Jak/Stat signaling alongside ectopic c-Myc expression led to high-grade hepatocyte dysplasia and tumor formation, selectively in aged mice. Together, these results suggest that an aged liver is in a state of ''precarious balance'', due to concurrent activation of oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways, but protected against neoplastic progression by IFN-signaling. Age-dependent activation of IFN signaling has been observed in many tissues and recent studies have demonstrated its detrimental consequences on aging, raising the question as to why IFN signaling is activated during aging. We propose that aged tissues are intrinsically at higher risk of cancer and age-dependent activation of IFN-signaling is an adaptive process to protect from tumorigenesis, but one that also has maladaptive consequences.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

Here we assessed the saponin/MPLA nanoparticle (SMNP) adjuvant with an HIV envelope (Env) trimer, evaluating the safety and impact of multiple variables including adjuvant dose (16-fold dose range), immunization route, and adjuvant composition on the establishment of Env-specific memory T and B cell responses (TMem and BMem) and long-lived plasma cells in non-human primates.

These viral interactions could be blocked and the whole viruses could be eliminated by suitable HSPG-mimetics providing multivalent binding to viral protein receptors. Here, large sulfoglyco-dendron HSPG-mimetics of different topologies, structures, and sizes were designed to this purpose. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were used to examine the ability of these broad-spectrum antivirals to block multi-protein HSPG-receptors in HIV, SARS-CoV-2, HPV, and dengue viruses. To characterize the inhibitory potential of these mimetics, their binding to individual and multiple protein receptors was examined. In particular, vectorial distributions of binding energies between the mimetics and viral protein receptors were introduced and calculated along the simulated trajectories. Space-dependent residual analysis of the mimetic-receptor binding was also performed. This analysis revealed detail nature of binding between these antivirals and viral protein receptors, and provided evidence that large inhibitors with multivalent binding might act like a molecular glue initiating the self-assembly of protein receptors in enveloped viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

However, the neurophysiological basis of these cognitive enhancements has remained relatively unclear. Previous studies have widely examined EEG during mindfulness practice - or made comparisons with long-term meditators and controls - but have failed to capture how EEG dynamics in subsequent cognitive testing scenarios might be altered as a function of mindfulness-based interventions. The current study therefore aimed to assess a variety of EEG dynamics (oscillatory, aperiodic, and event-related) during engagement in a dynamic and complex cognitive task, following a mindfulness-based cognitive training regime. Participants (n = 40, age range = 18 - 38) attended the lab on two separate occasions (pre- and post- a web-based one-week mindfulness intervention), where EEG was recorded during engagement in the Target Motion Analyst (TMA) task. Previous analysis of the same participants demonstrated that greater adherence to the mindfulness-based cognitive training was associated with improved performance on the TMA task (Dziego, Bornkessel-Schlesewsky, Schlesewsky et al., 2024). Here, we capitalise on these previous findings to assess whether adherence is paralleled by measurable differences in on-task EEG dynamics. Linear mixed-effects modelling demonstrated that, while main effects were observed across session, adherence to cognitive training was not directly associated with alpha power, theta power or 1/f parameters. Challenges also arose when computing event-related potentials (ERPs), illustrating the difficulties of using this technique in more complex testing environments. While these results are challenging to place within the context of previous EEG studies on meditation and cognitive performance, our findings highlight the complexities in understanding the cognitive benefits of mindfulness-based training interventions through EEG dynamics observed during subsequent cognitive testing.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

Observational data has been primarily used to validate experimental results or to find patterns that inspire experiments - not for causal inference. As ecology tackles progressively larger problems, we are moving beyond the scales at which randomized controlled experiments are feasible. Using observational data for causal inference raises the problem of confounding variables, those affecting both a causal variable and response of interest. Unmeasured confounders lead to statistical bias, creating spurious correlations and masking true causal relationships. To combat this Omitted Variable Bias, other disciplines have developed rigorous approaches for causal inference from observational data addressing the problems of confounders. We show how Ecologists can harness some of these methods: identifying confounders via causal diagrams, using nested sampling designs, and statistical designs that address omitted variable bias for causal inference. Using a motivating example of warming effects on intertidal snails, we show how current methods in Ecology (e.g., mixed models) produce incorrect inferences, and how methods presented here outperform them, reducing bias and increasing statistical power. Our goal is to enable the widespread use of observational data as tool for causal inference for the next generation of Ecological studies.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

The ionizable lipid component within LNPs is critical to the efficient delivery of mRNA. Ionizable lipids can also trigger innate immune activation, which is beneficial for vaccine efficacy but may contribute to adverse inflammatory reactions. Engineering ionizable lipids for rapid biodegradation is a promising, yet underexplored, strategy to dampen inflammation. Here, we report the rational design and optimization of biodegradable ionizable lipids for intramuscular mRNA vaccines in mice. We show that in vivo biodegradability is enhanced by controlling lipid hydrolysis kinetics and that protein output is maximized by tuning the LNP apparent pKa. In an influenza vaccine model, the lead lipid ({delta}O3) generates equivalent neutralizing antibodies and stronger antigen-specific T cell responses compared to a benchmark lipid (SM-102) used in approved mRNA vaccines. Furthermore, by comparing ionizable lipid analogs with similar potency but opposing biodegradation kinetics, we find that faster lipid clearance from tissues coincides with a lower inflammatory response while preserving strong vaccine immunogenicity. These findings demonstrate that fast-degrading ionizable lipids can balance the efficacy and tolerability of mRNA vaccines, with implications for addressing side effects and patient acceptance of new vaccine applications.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

Achieving these three goals requires the reassignment of multiple of the 64 codons nature uses to encode proteins. However, synonymous codon replacement--recoding--is frequently lethal, and how recoding impacts fitness remains poorly explored. Here, we explore these effects using whole-genome synthesis, multiplexed directed evolution, and genome-transcriptome-translatome-proteome co-profiling on multiple recoded genomes. Using this information, we assemble a synthetic Escherichia coli genome in seven sections using only 57 codons to encode proteins. By discovering the rules responsible for the lethality of synonymous recoding and developing a data-driven multi-omics-based genome construction workflow that troubleshoots synthetic genomes, we overcome the lethal effects of 62,007 synonymous codon swaps and 11,108 additional genomic edits. We show that synonymous recoding induces transcriptional noise including new antisense RNAs, leading to drastic transcriptome and proteome perturbation. As the elimination of select codons from an organisms genetic code results in the widespread appearance of cryptic promoters, we show that synonymous codon choice may naturally evolve to minimize transcriptional noise. Our work provides the first genome-scale description of how synonymous codon changes influence organismal fitness and paves the way for the construction of functional genomes that provide genetic firewalls from natural ecosystems and safely produce biopolymers, drugs, and enzymes with an expanded chemistry.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

One of the most striking and well-known phenomena bearing on this question is inattentional blindness (IB; Neisser & Becklen, 1975; Mack & Rock, 1998; Most et al., 2001, 2005). In IB, naive observers fail to report clearly visible stimuli when their attention is otherwise engaged--famously even missing a gorilla parading before their eyes (Simons & Chabris, 1999). This phenomenon and the research programs it has motivated carry tremendous theoretical significance, both as crucial evidence that awareness requires attention (Cohen et al., 2012; Prinz, 2012; Noah & Mangun, 2020) and as a key tool in seeking the neural correlates of consciousness (Rees et al., 1999; Pitts et al., 2014; Hutchinson, 2019). However, these and other implications critically rest on a notoriously biased measure: asking participants whether they noticed anything unusual (and interpreting negative answers as reflecting a complete lack of visual awareness). Here, in the largest ever set of IB studies, we show that inattentionally blind participants can successfully report the location, color and shape of the stimuli they deny noticing. This residual visual sensitivity shows that perceptual information remains accessible in IB. We further show that subjective reports in IB are conservative, by introducing absent trials where no IB stimulus is presented; this approach allows us to show for the first time that observers are systematically biased to report not noticing in IB--essentially  playing it safe in reporting their sensitivity. This pair of results is consistent with an alternative hypothesis about IB, namely that subjects retain awareness of stimuli they fail to report. Overall, these data provide the strongest evidence to date of significant residual visual sensitivity in IB, and even cast doubt on claims that awareness requires attention.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

Here, we predicted the core interactions organizing the ULK complex using AlphaFold, which proposed that the intrinsically disordered region of ATG13 binds to the base of the two UBL domains in the FIP200 dimer using two phenylalanines and to the tandem MIT domain of ULK1, allowing for the 1:1:2 stoichiometry of the ULK1-ATG13-FIP200 complex.

Here, we characterize the trajectory by which the gut microbiome recovers its taxonomic and functional profile after antibiotic treatment in mice on regular chow (RC) and WD, and find that only mice on RC undergo a rapid successional process of recovery. Metabolic modeling indicates that RC diet promotes the development of syntrophic cross- feeding interactions, while on WD, a dominant taxon monopolizes readily available resources without releasing syntrophic byproducts. Intervention experiments reveal that an appropriate dietary resource environment is both necessary and sufficient for rapid and robust microbiome recovery, whereas microbial transplant is neither. Furthermore, prolonged post-antibiotic dysbiosis in mice on WD renders them susceptible to infection by the intestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Our data challenge widespread enthusiasm for fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) as a strategy to address dysbiosis and demonstrate that specific dietary interventions are, at minimum, an essential prerequisite for effective FMT, and may afford a safer, more natural, and less invasive alternative to FMT.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

However, analyses often still use definitions based on adult functional networks. We aim to assess how this might lead to the misidentification of functional networks and explore potential consequences and solutions.

Our findings suggest that even though adult networks provide only a marginally better than-chance description of the infant FC organization, misidentification was largely driven by specific areas. By restricting functional networks to areas showing adult-like network clustering, we observed consistent within-network FC both within and across scans and throughout development. Additionally, these areas were spatially closer to locations with low variability in network identity among adults. Our analysis aids in understanding the potential consequences of using adult networks ""as is"" and provides guidance for future research on selecting and utilizing functional network models based on the research question and scenario.

RSV encodes messenger RNAs (mRNAs) mimicking 5'-cap structures of host mRNAs and thus inhibition of cap-dependent translation initiation would likely also reduce viral translation. We confirmed that RSV limits widespread translation initiation inhibition and unexpectedly found that the fraction of ribosomes within polysomes increases during infection, indicating higher ribosome loading on mRNAs during infection. We found that AU-rich host transcripts that are less efficiently translated under normal conditions become more efficient at recruiting ribosomes, similar to RSV transcripts. Viral transcripts are transcribed in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, where the viral AU-rich binding protein M2-1 has been shown to bind viral transcripts and shuttle them into the cytoplasm. We further demonstrated that M2-1 is found on polysomes, and that M2-1 might deliver host AU-rich transcripts for translation.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

In this study, we investigate various methods for differential expression analysis on single-cell data, conduct extensive benchmarking and give recommendations for method choice. The tested methods include DESeq2, MAST, DREAM, scVI, the Permutation Test and distinct. We additionally adapt Hierarchical Bootstrapping to differential expression analysis on single-cell data and include it in our benchmark. We found that differential expression analysis methods designed specifically for single-cell data do not offer performance advantages over conventional pseudobulk methods such as DESeq2 when applied to individual data sets. In addition, they mostly require significantly longer run times. For atlas-level analysis, permutation-based methods excel in performance but show poor runtime, suggesting to use DREAM as a compromise between quality and runtime.

Beyond medications well established to alter BG, such as beta-blockers, there are likely many medications with undiscovered effects on BG variability. Identification of these medications and the strength and timing of these relationships has potential to improve glycemic management and patient safety. Materials and Methods: EHR data from 103,871 inpatient encounters over 8 years within a large, urban health system was used to extract over 500 medications, laboratory measurements, and clinical predictors of BG. Feature selection was performed using an optimized Lasso model with repeated 5-fold cross-validation on the 80% training set, followed by a linear mixed regression model to evaluate statistical significance. Significant medication predictors were then evaluated for novelty against a comprehensive adverse drug event database. Results: We found 29 statistically significant features associated with BG; 24 were medications including 10 medications not previously documented to alter BG. The remaining five factors were Black/African American race, history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, prior BG (mean and last) and creatinine. Discussion: The unexpected medications, including several agents involved in gastrointestinal motility, found to affect BG were supported by available studies. This study may bring to light medications to use with caution in individuals with hyper- or hypoglycemia. Further investigation of these potential candidates is needed to enhance clinical utility of these findings. Conclusion: This study uniquely identifies medications involved in gastrointestinal transit to be predictors of BG that may not well established and recognized in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1722809325288

Given the critical role of gut health in chicken performance and welfare, there is a pressing need to identify effective gut health intervention (GHI) strategies to ensure optimal outcomes in poultry farming. In this study, across three broiler production cycles, we compared the metagenomes and performance of broilers provided with ionophores as control against birds subjected to five different GHI combinations involving vaccination, probiotics, prebiotics, essential oils, and reduction of ionophore use. Using a binning strategy, 84 ([&ge;]75% completeness, [&le;] 5% contamination) metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 118 caecal samples were recovered and annotated for their metabolic potential. The majority of these (n = 52, 61%) had a differential response across all cohorts and are associated with the performance parameter - European Poultry Efficiency Factor (EPEF). The control group exhibited the highest EPEF, followed closely by the cohort where probiotics are used in conjunction with vaccination. The use of Probiotics B, a commercial Bacillus strain-based formulation, was determined to contribute to the superior performance of birds. GHI supplementation generally affected abundance of microbial enzymes relating to carbohydrate and protein digestion, and metabolic pathways relating to energy, nucleotide synthesis, short-chain fatty acid synthesis, and drug-transport systems. These shifts are hypothesised to differentiate performance among groups and cycles, highlighting the beneficial role of several bacteria including Rikenella microfusus and UBA7160 species. All GHIs are shown to be effective methods for gut microbial modulation, with varying influences on MAG diversity, composition and microbial functions. These metagenomic insights greatly enhance our understanding of microbiota-related metabolic pathways, enabling us to devise strategies against enteric pathogens related to poultry products and presenting new opportunities to improve overall poultry performance and health.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

We previously reported that the conditional inactivation of the Mllt11 gene in the mouse superficial cortex resulted in reduced connectivity of the corpus callosum and white fiber tracts, resulting in reduced cortical thickness. However, the behavioral consequences of Mllt11 loss are unknown. Callosal abnormalities are thought to be present in 3-5% of all neurodevelopmental disorders and reduced corpus callosum volume correlates with core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in humans. Cortical thickness dysregulation is likewise shared among various neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD. We therefore investigated the behavioral consequences of conditional knockout of Mllt11 in upper cortical layer 2/3 projection neurons using transgenic Cux2iresCre mice. Utilizing tasks designed to reflect core ASD symptoms, we examined the behaviors of both male and female conditional knockout animals. These tests included olfaction habituation/dishabituation, three-chambered social approach, marble burying, and nestlet shredding. We found sex-dependent disruptions in social preference, and nestlet shredding in animals lacking Mllt11, with the female mice presenting with more disruptions than the males. Understanding the behavioral phenotype associated with genes of interest specifically in the context of sex differences is crucial to individualized treatment for neurodevelopmental disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

However, disruption of domain structure often results in mild gene dysregulation and thus predicting the impact of boundary rearrangements on animal development remains challenging. Here, we tested whether structural perturbation of a chromatin domain with multiple developmental regulators can result in more acute gene dysregulation and severe developmental phenotypes. We targeted clusters of CTCF motifs in a domain of the mouse genome containing three FGF ligand genes - Fgf3, Fgf4, and Fgf15 - that regulate several developmental processes. Deletion of the 23.9kb cluster that defines the centromeric boundary of this domain resulted in ectopic interactions of the FGF genes with enhancers located across the deleted boundary that are active in the developing brain. This caused strong induction of FGF expression and perinatal lethality with encephalocele and orofacial cleft phenotypes. Heterozygous boundary deletion was sufficient to cause these fully penetrant phenotypes, and strikingly, loss of a single CTCF motif within the cluster also recapitulated ectopic FGF expression and caused encephalocele. However, such phenotypic sensitivity to perturbation of domain structure did not extend to all CTCF clusters of this domain, nor to all developmental processes controlled by these three FGF genes - for example, the ability to undergo lineage specification in the blastocyst and pre-implantation development were not affected. By tracing the impact of different chromosomal rearrangements throughout mouse development, we start to uncover the determinants of phenotypic robustness and sensitivity to perturbation of chromatin boundaries. Our data show how small sequence variants at certain domain boundaries can have a surprisingly outsized effect and must be considered as potential sources of gene dysregulation during development and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325288

Recently, the potential of blocking CD30-dependent NF-kB intracellular signaling has gained attention for treating inflammatory disorders. Development of antibody-based CD30 antagonists would broaden therapeutic strategies. A challenge in developing antagonistic antibodies is that the bivalent form of natural antibody format inevitably cross-links trace amounts of CD30 molecules, leading to signal transduction. In this study, we developed a series of biparatopic antibodies with each pair of antibody variable domains (Fvs) binding to distinct epitopes on CD30, and evaluated their biological activities and binding modes. Initially, we precisely identified epitope sites of the nine antibodies precisely by assessing binding to multiple orthologous CD30 proteins and mutants. We then produced 36 biparatopic antibodies covering all possible combinations of the nine Fvs, and analyzed their biological activities. Among these, we identified both potent agonists and antagonists. Notably, a significant proportion of the biparatopic antibodies displayed reduced agonistic activities, including 1:1-binding antagonists derived from a Fv of a strong agonist previously developed for lymphoma therapy, AC10. The mechanism of signaling activity induction is discussed using epitope information, which leads to the strategies of the development of biparatopic antibodies.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325289

Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325289

We investigated rare variation through whole exome sequencing gene burden tests, quantified genetic architectures through Gaussian mixture modelling, analysed the causal role of body mass index (BMI) through Mendelian randomization, and performed genome-wide interaction analyses with sex.

ResultsWe discovered 14,837 loci (497 unique), with shared and distinct effects on cardiometabolic traits, with high replication rates across populations. The loci explained over 70% of genetic variance for fatty acids. Findings from common and rare variant gene tests converged on lipid homeostasis pathways. There was strong evidence for causal effects of BMI on cholesterol and amino acid levels. We discovered 31 loci interacting with sex, which mapped to genes involved in cholesterol processing, and to cardiometabolic conditions with sex differences in prevalence.

Most mammals are susceptible to progressive age-related hearing loss; however, the evolution of biosonar, which requires the ability to hear low-intensity echoes from outgoing sonar signals, may have selected against the development of hearing deficits in echolocating bats. Although many echolocating bats exhibit exceptional longevity and rely on acoustic behaviors for survival to old age, relatively little is known about the aging bat auditory system. In this study, we used DNA methylation to estimate the ages of wild-caught big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and measured hearing sensitivity in young and aging bats using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). We found no evidence for hearing deficits in aging bats, demonstrated by comparable thresholds and similar ABR wave and DPOAE amplitudes across age groups. We additionally found no significant histological evidence for cochlear aging, with similar hair cell counts, afferent, and efferent innervation patterns in young and aging bats. Here we demonstrate that big brown bats show minimal evidence for age-related loss of peripheral hearing sensitivity and therefore represent informative models for investigating mechanisms that may preserve hearing function over a long lifetime.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325289

While regeneration-specific genes conserved in highly regenerative organisms may confer regenerative abilities and long-term maintenance of tissue homeostasis, it remains unclear whether introducing these regenerative genes into low regenerative animals can improve their regeneration and aging processes.

ResultsHere we ectopically express high regenerative species-specific JmjC domain-encoding genes (HRJDs) in Drosophila, a widely used low regenerative model organism. Surprisingly, HRJD expression impedes tissue regeneration in the developing wing disc but extends organismal lifespan when expressed in the intestinal stem cell lineages of the adult midgut under non-regenerative conditions. Notably, HRJDs enhance the proliferative activity of intestinal stem cells while maintaining their differentiation fidelity, ameliorating age-related decline in gut barrier functions.

ConclusionsThese findings together suggest that the introduction of highly regenerative species-specific genes can improve stem cell functions and promote a healthy lifespan when expressed in aging animals.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325289

Despite their significance in understanding the history of life on Earth, any interpretation of the nature of these microfossils has been a point of contention among researchers. Decades of back-and-forth arguments led to the consensus that reconstructing the lifecycles of Archaean Eon organisms is the only way of understanding the nature of these microfossils. Here, we transformed a Gram-positive bacterium into a primitive lipid vesicle-like state and studied it under environmental conditions prevalent on early Earth. Using this approach, we successfully reconstructed morphologies and life cycles of Archaean microfossils. In addition to reproducing microfossil morphologies, we conducted experiments that spanned years to understand the process of cell degradation and how Archaean cells could have undergone encrustation minerals (in this case, salt), leading to their preservation as fossilized organic carbon in the rock record. These degradation products strongly resemble fossiliferous features from Archaean rock formations. Our observations suggest that microfossils aged between 3.8 to 2.5Ga most likely were liposome-like protocells that have evolved physiological pathways of energy conservation but not the mechanisms to regulate their morphology. Based on these observations, we propose that morphology is not a reliable indicator of taxonomy in these microfossils.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325289

In bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, MinD proteins are crucial for the correct placement of the Z-ring at mid-cell during cell division. However, previous studies have shown that none of the 4 MinD homologs present in the archaeon Haloferax volcanii have a role in cell division, suggesting that these proteins regulate different cellular processes in haloarchaea. Here, we show that while deletion of MinD2 in H. volcanii ({Delta}minD2) does not affect cell growth or division, it impacts cell shape and motility by mispositioning the chemotaxis arrays and archaellum motors. Finally, we explore the links between MinD2 and MinD4, which has been previously shown to modulate the localization of chemosensory arrays and archaella in H. volcanii, finding that the two MinD homologues have synergistic effects in regulating the positioning of the motility machinery.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

The effects of stop-loss mutations can have multiple consequences that are, however, hard to predict. Stop-loss in ITM2B/BRI2 results in C-terminal extension of the encoded protein and, upon furin cleavage, in the production of two 34 amino acid long peptides, ADan and ABri, that accumulate as amyloids in the brains of patients affected by familial Danish and British Dementia. To systematically explore the consequences of Bri2 C-terminal extension, here, we measure amyloid formation for 676 ADan substitutions and identify the region that forms the putative amyloid core of ADan fibrils, located between positions 20 and 26, where stop-loss occurs. Moreover, we measure amyloid formation for ~18,000 random C-terminal extensions of Bri2 and find that ~32% of these sequences can nucleate amyloids. We find that the amino acid composition of these nucleating sequences varies with peptide length and that short extensions of 2 specific amino acids (Aliphatics, Aromatics and Cysteines) are sufficient to generate novel amyloid cores. Overall, our results show that the C-terminus of Bri2 contains an incomplete amyloid motif that can turn amyloidogenic upon extension. C-terminal extension with de novo formation of amyloid motifs may thus be a widespread pathogenic mechanism resulting from stop-loss, highlighting the importance of determining the impact of these mutations for other sequences across the genome.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325289

Here, we collected radiotherapy phenotype and expression data from 32 TCGA cancer datasets and performed overall survival analysis for 32 cancer types. Additionally, we conducted a signalling pathway enrichment analysis to identify key pathways involved in radiotherapy resistance and sensitivity. Our findings show that radiotherapy improves survival outcomes in certain cancer types, such as GBM, while worsening outcomes in others, such as LGG. Next, we focused on exploring the differences in radiotherapy outcomes between GBM and LGG, focusing on the molecular mechanisms contributing to these variations. The differential regulation of pathways related to programmed cell death, DNA repair, telomere maintenance, chromosome condensation, antiviral responses, and interferon signaling between GBM and LGG patients may elucidate the underlying reasons for these observed differences. These insights underscore the importance of personalized treatment approaches and the need for further research to improve radiotherapy outcomes in cancer patients.","NA","medrxiv",1722809325289

We examined the effect of combining antibiotics on within-patient resistance development across various bacterial pathogens and antibiotics.

We searched CENTRAL, EMBASE and PubMed for (quasi)-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published from database inception to November 24th, 2022. Trials comparing antibiotic treatments with different numbers of antibiotics were included. A patient was considered to have acquired resistance if, at the follow-up culture, a resistant bacterium (as defined by the study authors) was detected that had not been present in the baseline culture. We combined results using a random effects model and performed meta-regression and stratified analyses. The trials risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool.

42 trials were eligible and 29, including 5054 patients, were qualified for statistical analysis. In most trials, resistance development was not the primary outcome and studies lacked power. The combined odds ratio (OR) for the acquisition of resistance comparing the group with the higher number of antibiotics with the comparison group was 1.23 (95% CI 0.68-2.25), with substantial between-study heterogeneity (I2 =77%). We identified tentative evidence for potential beneficial or detrimental effects of antibiotic combination therapy for specific pathogens or medical conditions.

The evidence for combining a higher number of antibiotics compared to fewer from RCTs is scarce and overall, is compatible with both benefit or harm. Trials powered to detect differences in resistance development or well-designed observational studies are required to clarify the impact of combination therapy on resistance.","NA","medrxiv",1722809325289

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1722809325289

This review examines trends in SCD among pilots from a global perspective, analyzing evidence from 2011 to 2023, with a focus on its growing impact as a global crisis and recent findings pointing to a potential rise in incidence, particularly after 2019.

ObjectivesTo analyze the prevalence, risk factors, and prevention strategies for SCD in pilots, particularly post-COVID-19.

MethodsThe PRISMA guidelines for systematic meta-analysis was used, a search of peer-reviewed literature for international aviation databases, and pilot associations was conducted to identify relevant data. The analysis focused on trends in SCD prevalence, risk factors, prevention strategies, and recent findings, including the potential impact of COVID-19, the role of vaccination, and important biomarkers to screen for predisposition. Eligibility criteria included studies reporting SCD incidence, risk factors, or prevention strategies in pilots. Data were extracted, and meta-analyses conducted.

ResultsRecent studies suggest a potential increase in SCD incidence among pilots following the COVID-19 pandemic. Cardiovascular complications, increased stress, disruptions in healthcare, and changes in lifestyle may contribute to this potential rise. Identified risk factors include age, male gender, and cardiovascular comorbidities.

Biomarkers such as troponin, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) have been identified as potential indicators of increased SCD risk in pilots. Preventive measures include regular cardiovascular assessments and lifestyle modifications.

ConclusionSCD remains a significant and rising threat to pilots, posing a global crisis that requires immediate attention. Through a comprehensive approach that includes risk assessment, preventive measures, emergency response, and preventive protocols, the aviation industry can mitigate this risk and safeguard the lives of pilots and passengers.

This review also suggests standardized examination protocol for pilots includes regular cardiovascular risk assessment, biomarker screening, monitoring of COVID-19 and vaccination status, lifestyle modifications, and a standardized reporting system. The adoption of a standardized protocol by aviation regulatory bodies and airlines worldwide is crucial to address the growing threat of SCD among pilots and ensure the highest standards of aviation safety.","NA","medrxiv",1722809325289

This shortcoming increases the rate of false positives and false negatives, giving rise to a potentially misleading scientific record. To address this shortcoming, many researchers now use point-and-click software to run sample size calculations.

ObjectiveWe aimed to (1) estimate how many published articles report using the G*Power sample size calculation software; (2) assess whether these calculations are reproducible and (3) error-free; and (4) assess how often these calculations use G*Powers default option for mixed-design ANOVAs--which can be misleading and output sample sizes that are too small for a researchers intended purpose.

MethodWe randomly sampled open access articles from PubMed Central published between 2017 and 2022 and used a coding form to manually assess 95 sample size calculations for reproducibility and errors.

ResultsWe estimate that more than 48,000 articles published between 2017 and 2022 and indexed in PubMed Central or PubMed report using G*Power (i.e., 0.65% [95% CI: 0.62% - 0.67%] of articles). We could reproduce 2% (2/95) of the sample size calculations without making any assumptions, and likely reproduce another 28% (27/95) after making assumptions. Many calculations were not reported transparently enough to assess whether an error was present (75%; 71/95) or whether the sample size calculation was for a statistical test that appeared in the results section of the publication (48%; 46/95). Few articles that performed a calculation for a mixed-design ANOVA unambiguously selected the non-default option (8%; 3/36).

ConclusionPublished sample size calculations that use G*Power are not transparently reported and may not be well-informed. Given the popularity of software packages like G*Power, they present an intervention point to increase the prevalence of informative sample size calculations.","NA","medrxiv",1722809325289

The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria.
