However, their chromatin organization has remained enigmatic until now. In this study, we present the first structures of Asgard chromatin assemblies formed by the Hodarchaeal histone HHoB. Our high-resolution cryo-EM structures reveal that this Asgard histone assembles into compact ""closed"" and into extended ""open"" hypernucleosomes. Thus the closed hypernucleosome conformation is conserved across archaeal lineages, while the open conformation resembles a eukaryotic H3-H4 octasome and likely represents an Asgard-specific innovation. Moreover, we show that Mg2+ ions influence Asgard chromatin conformation, suggesting a regulatory role. Overall, our study provides the first structure-based model of Asgard chromatin organization, expanding our understanding of chromatin architecture in evolutionary context.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

In the zero-shot setting, variant impact is estimated by comparing the likelihoods of sequences, under the assumption that likelihood serves as a proxy for fitness. However, this assumption often breaks down in practice: sequence likelihood reflects not only evolutionary fitness constraints, but also phylogenetic structure and sampling biases, especially as model capacity increases. We introduce Likelihood-Fitness Bridging (LFB), a simple and general strategy that improves variant effect prediction by averaging model scores across sequences subject to similar selective pressures. Assuming an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of evolution, LFB can be viewed as a way to marginalize the effects of genetic drift, although its benefits appear to extend more broadly. LFB applies to existing protein and genomic language models without requiring retraining, and incurs only modest computational overhead. Evaluated on large-scale deep mutational scans and clinical benchmarks, LFB consistently improves predictive performance across model families and sizes. Notably, it reverses the performance plateau observed in larger protein language models, making the largest models the most accurate when combined with LFB. These results suggest that accounting for phylogenetic and sampling biases is essential to realizing the full potential of large sequence models in variant effect prediction.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

We aimed to identify and validate parsimonious transcriptomic signatures that accurately predict fatal outcomes within 48 hours of hospitalization.

MethodsWe studied 894 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 across 20 US hospitals and enrolled in the prospective Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and nasal swabs collected within 48 hours of admission. Host gene expression was assessed by RNA sequencing, nasal SARS-CoV-2 viral load was measured by RT-qPCR, and mortality was assessed at 28 days. We first defined transcriptional signatures and biological features of fatal COVID-19, which we compared against mortality signatures from an independent cohort of patients with non-COVID-19 sepsis (n=122). Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression in 70% of the COVID-19 cohort, we trained parsimonious prognostic classifiers incorporating host gene expression, age, and viral load. The performance of single and three-gene classifiers was then determined in the remaining 30% of the cohort and subsequently externally validated in an independent, contemporary COVID-19 cohort (n=137) with vaccinated patients.

ResultsFatal COVID-19 was characterized by 4189 differentially expressed genes in the peripheral blood, representing marked upregulation of neutrophil degranulation, erythrocyte gas exchange, and heme biosynthesis pathways, juxtaposed against downregulation of adaptive immune pathways. Only 7.6% of mortality-associated genes overlapped between COVID-19 and sepsis due to other causes. A COVID-specific three-gene peripheral blood classifier (CD83, ATP1B2, DAAM2) combined with age and SARS-CoV-2 viral load achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88 (95% CI 0.82-0.94). A three-gene nasal classifier (SLC5A5, CD200R1, FCER1A), in comparison, yielded an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.64-0.83). Notably the expression of OLAH alone, a gene recently implicated in severe viral infection pathogenesis, yielded an AUC of 0.86 (0.79-0.93). Both peripheral blood classifiers demonstrated comparable performance in vaccinated patients from an independent external validation cohort (AUCs 0.74- 0.80).

ConclusionsA three-gene peripheral blood signature, as well as OLAH alone, accurately predict COVID-19 mortality early in hospitalization, including in vaccinated patients. These parsimonious blood- and nasal-based classifiers merit further study as accessible prognostic tools to guide triage, resource allocation, and early therapeutic interventions in COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1748383781562

Whole-genome sequencing is now requested for describing novel prokaryotic species and designating their type strains, which serve as representative and well-characterized strains of the species. Indeed, the number of sequenced prokaryotic genomes has been rapidly increasing. However, a considerable number of isolated strains, particularly ''fastidious'' type strains such as strict anaerobes and slow growers, remain without genome sequence information. Here we report the whole-genome sequencing of 290 bacterial and 61 archaeal strains, including fastidious type strains, obtained from Japan Collection of Microorganisms (JCM) using a combination of short- and long-read sequencing technologies. The dataset includes 284 type strain genomes and 235 complete genomes. Notably, in the dataset, genomes of over 200 strains, including over 150 type strains, had not been made publicly available. Comparative genomic analysis suggests that some strains need to be assigned to novel taxa or reclassified. Functional gene survey indicates that some strains possess previously unrecognized potential for carbon fixation or bioactive secondary metabolite production. Our dataset will contribute to more accurate taxonomic classification, fill gaps in the phylogeny of prokaryotes, and provide insights into their physiology and ecology.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Diagnoses are rendered by microscopical examination of two-dimensional sections. Good clinical practice requires that samples be retained for decades, thus giving rise to enormous archives of healthy and diseased human tissues. Tissue-clearing technologies and whole-mount microscopy would enable 3D analyses, but whole FFPE tissue blocks are often unsuitable for clearing due to their size, their extensive covalent cross-linking, and their embedding in solid wax. Here, we present archival DISCO (aDISCO), a versatile and robust clearing method for whole-mount archival FFPE human tissue blocks. aDISCO enabled complete clearing and consistent antibody staining of samples stored for at least 15 years. We show that aDISCO can be applied to human brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, skin, muscle, heart, kidney, liver, spleen, colon, and lung, and is compatible with a wide range of commonly used antibodies. We applied aDISCO to the 3D study of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a neurodevelopmental disease associated with epilepsy. We performed deep-learning-based-segmentation and object detection to identify both focal and global neuronal density variations in FCD and to precisely quantify the disruption of cortical layering, features that are likely to be overlooked by conventional histology. When combined with selective-plane illumination microscopy, aDISCO delivers natively digital data suitable for deep-learning-based processing, thus enabling the detection of subtle and sparse pathologies in large archival human tissue specimens.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

A recent discovery of a multi-subunit insertase in eukaryotes has raised the question about the architecture of the putative bacterial ortholog SecYEG-YidC and its functional mechanism. Here, we combine cryogenic electron microscopy with cell-free protein synthesis in nanodiscs to visualize biogenesis of the polytopic membrane protein NuoK, the subunit K of NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, that requires both SecYEG and YidC for insertion. We demonstrate that YidC is recruited to the back of the translocon at the late stage of the substrate insertion, in resemblance to the eukaryotic system, and in vivo experiments indicate that the complex assembly is vital for the cells. The nascent chain does not utilize the lateral gate of SecYEG, but enters the lipid membrane at the SecYE-YidC interface, with YidC being the primary insertase. SecYEG-YidC complex promotes folding of the nascent helices at the interface prior their insertion, so the examined cellular pathway follows the fundamental thermodynamic principles of membrane protein folding. Our data provide the first detailed insight on the elusive insertase machinery in the physiologically relevant environment, highlight the importance of the nascent chain for its assembly, and prove the evolutionary conservation of the gate-independent insertion route.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

The absence of visual mental imagery, called aphantasia, has recently been recognized to occur in about 1% of the general population but the cause is uncertain. By studying rare cases of acquired aphantasia we can identify regions that when injured cause loss of visual mental imagery.

MethodsWe analyzed aphantasia lesions, identified from case reports by systematic review, and previously studied control lesions causing other neuropsychiatric symptoms (n=887). The network of brain regions connected to each lesion location was computed using resting-state functional connectivity from healthy subjects (n=1000). First, we tested the connectivity of aphantasia lesions and controls to the fusiform imagery node, a region in the ventral visual pathway which is active during visual mental imagery tasks. Then, we performed a data-driven analysis assessing whole brain lesion connectivity that was sensitive (100% overlap) and specific (family-wise error p<0.05) for aphantasia. Finally, we compared our aphantasia lesion network to activations previously associated with visual mental imagery tasks.

ResultsWe identified 12 cases of lesion-induced aphantasia which occurred in multiple different brain regions. However, 100% of these lesion locations were functionally connected to a region in the left fusiform gyrus, recently termed the fusiform imagery node. Connectivity to this region was both sensitive (100% overlap) and specific (family-wise error p<0.05) for aphantasia. The aphantasia lesion network aligned with functional connections previously associated with visual mental imagery tasks.

Conclusions and RelevanceLesions causing aphantasia are located in many different brain regions but are all functionally connected to a specific location in the left fusiform gyrus. These findings support the hypothesis that the fusiform imagery node is a key brain region involved in visual mental imagery and offers clinical insight into which locations of brain injury are likely to cause aphantasia.","NA","medrxiv",1748383781562

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

Trypanosoma brucei expresses a single Variant-Surface-Glycoprotein (VSG) from a large genetic repertoire, which they periodically switch throughout an infection. Co-transcribed with the active-VSG within a specialised nuclear body are expression-site-associated-genes (ESAGs), involved in important host-parasite interactions, including protecting the parasite from human serum lytic effects, modulating the hosts innate immune response and uptake of essential nutrients. Despite expression within the same polycistron, there is a significant differential expression between ESAGs and VSGs (>140-fold), however, the regulatory mechanism has remained elusive for decades. Here, using a combination of genetic tools, super resolution microscopy, proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, we identified three novel proteins, which are recruited in a hierarchical manner, forming discreet sub-nuclear condensates that are developmentally regulated and negatively regulate ESAG transcripts. Among them, Expression-Site-Body-specific-protein-2 (ESB2) contains a nuclease domain that shares structural similarity to the endonuclease domain found in SMG6, a critical component of nonsense mediated decay in mammals. Mutation of key residues required for the nuclease activity impaired ESB2 localisation and function.

However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying eIF2As function remains poorly understood. Here, we exploit a TurboID-based proximity labeling combined with mass spectrometry to systematically map the interactome of eIF2A during homeostasis and stress. Combining polysome gradients with TurboID, we zoom into the interactions of eIF2A with the 40S small ribosomal subunit and map the eIF2A binding site close to the mRNA entry channel. We identify a network of interactors that link eIF2A to ribosome-associated quality control, including its strong interaction with G3BP1-USP10 complexes as well as RPS2 and RPS3. In the absence of eIF2A, RPS2 and RPS3 ubiquitination is diminished specifically upon ribosome stalling. 40S-specific footprinting in eIF2A knockout cells shows minimal changes in 5UTR occupancy, consistent with a limited role for eIF2A in translation initiation. Using dynamic SILAC mass spectrometry, we characterize the novel function of eIF2A in ribosome-associated quality control and show that eIF2A antagonizes USP10-dependent rescue of 40S ribosomes, resulting in altered turnover of 40S subunits upon cellular stress. Collectively, our study identifies a previously unknown link between eIF2A and ribosome-associated quality control, implies that eIF2A promotes translation fidelity by tuning 40S ribosome rescue under stress and warrants further investigations into the role of ribosome-associated quality control in tumorigenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we characterized N structures of Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1), the type species of the Bornaviridae, which causes fatal human encephalitis. N forms complexes in both RNA-free and RNA-bound states, revealing conserved features throughout the order, as well as BoDV-1-specific stoichiometry, thereby offering insights into viral evolution. We redefine assembly principles governing N-RNA complexes with the discovery of a previously unrecognized, RNA-independent mechanism involving domain-swapping and truncated subunits. Mutational analyses identified residues essential for nucleocapsid formation and RNA synthesis. Cryo-EM of mutant complexes captured RNA-free assemblies, suggesting that initial N oligomerization precedes RNA binding. These findings explain several unknowns in N-RNA complex structure and suggest an alternative to canonical RNA-driven assembly models, offering a new conceptual framework for nucleocapsid formation.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Epistasis shapes this evolution, as an antigenic mutation that is deleterious in one genetic background may become tolerated in another. However, the extent to which epistasis can alleviate pleiotropic conflicts between immune escape and protein function/stability is unclear. Here, we measure how all amino acid mutations in the HA of a recent human H3N2 influenza strain affect its cell entry function, acid stability, and neutralization by human serum antibodies. We find that epistasis has enabled emergence of antigenic mutations that were detrimental to HAs cell entry function in earlier strains. However, epistasis appears insufficient to overcome the pleiotropic costs of antigenic mutations that impair HAs stability, explaining why some mutations that strongly escape human antibodies never fix in nature. Our results refine our understanding of the mutational constraints that shape influenza evolution: epistasis can enable antigenic change, but pleiotropic effects can restrict its trajectory.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1748383781562

Whole-cortex functional gradients, which organize regions along axes of functional similarity, are positioned here as a framework for understanding such alterations. Across two independent cohorts (BioFINDER-2, N=973; ADNI, N=129), we demonstrate that hyper- and hypoconnectivity in both healthy aging and biomarker-confirmed AD progression coexist systematically, forming consistent spatial patterns that align with two distinct axes of brain organization. Using a combination of longitudinal and non-linear analyses, we show that the early (but not late) stages of AD pathology accumulation is associated with functional alteration along the sensory-association axis, a pattern that vanishes in later stages of AD. However, functional alteration along the sensory-association axis is associated with worse cognition throughout the AD spectrum, and even in older adults without AD pathology, suggesting that these FC patterns may reflect a general neural response to cognitive strain. Independently of AD, older age was associated with alterations instead along the executive-nonexecutive axis, a finding that was consistent throughout the adult lifespan. These findings highlight the fundamental role of intrinsic functional organization in shaping how the brain responds to aging and to AD, helping to resolve previously reported discrepancies.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

This raises the hitherto untested possibility that heterogeneity of the untransformed tumor stroma can actively fuel malignant progression. As biological heterogeneity is inherently difficult to define and control, we here chose a highly reductionist bottom-up approach and let tumor cells invade into micro-engineered environments harboring obstacles with precision-controlled geometry. We find that not only the presence of obstacles, but more surprisingly their spatial disorder, causes a drastic shift from a collective to a single-cell mode of invasion. Combining live-imaging and perturbation experiments with minimal biophysical modeling, we demonstrate that cellular detachments result both from local geometrical constraints and a global temporal integration of the heterogeneity experienced during the invasion process. We show that different types of microenvironments map onto different universality classes of invasion dynamics, which can quantitatively explain our findings. We thus identify generic physical principles for how the mode of cancer cell invasion depends on environmental heterogeneity, with implications to understand tumor evolution in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Despite this, little is known regarding the global epidemiology of IMP carbapenemases. Methods: We comprehensively identified blaIMP genes in all publicly available bacterial genomes, then systematically analysed the distribution of variants across species, lineages, plasmids and mobile elements, examining patterns over time, across geographic regions and by source. Structural analysis of IMP variants was performed. Findings: 4,556 blaIMP-containing genomes were identified from 1996-2023, including 52 blaIMP variants across 93 bacterial species. Key variants (blaIMP-1, blaIMP-4, blaIMP-7, blaIMP-8 and blaIMP-13) achieved global endemicity, while blaIMP-26 and blaIMP-27 were regionally endemic in Southeast Asia and North America, respectively. blaIMP dissemination was driven by horizontal gene transfer, facilitating inter-species spread. Proliferation of multidrug-resistant Enterobacter hormaechei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae lineages led to local outbreaks. Dereplication removed 3,175/4,556 (69.9%) genomes, indicating that most blaIMP-containing genomes were highly related. blaIMP variants were associated with mobile genetic element combinations including class 1 integrons and insertion sequences (99.7%), aiding mobilisation into [&ge;]52 plasmid clusters, predominantly IncHI2A, IncN, IncL/M and IncC. Genomes of environmental and animal origin accounted for 10.0% and 1.1% of the dataset, respectively. Evidence of cross-source transmission was limited, with most spillover occurring between genomes of human and environmental origin. Structural analysis revealed a conserved carbapenemase structure (mean lDDT 0.977), with convergent missense mutations at seven catalytically relevant sites. Interpretation: Global analysis enabled us to historically reconstruct the emergence and variant-specific epidemiologies of blaIMP carbapenemase genes. Intersecting mobile elements enabled blaIMP genes to spread across multiple plasmids and bacterial genera, facilitating global and multi-source spread within a One Health framework. Additionally, convergent evolutionary patterns indicate that IMP variants may continue evolving, potentially evading novel beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.

We demonstrate that -mycolic acids adopt extended conformations to stabilize bilayers, with a phase transition near 338 K that underscores their thermal resilience. Lipids in the outer leaflet such as PDIM and PAT induce membrane heterogeneity, migrating to the interleaflet space and reducing lipid order. The simulated mycobacterial outer membrane has ordered inner leaflets and disordered outer leaflets, which contrasts with the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. These findings reveal that PDIM- and PAT-driven lipid redistribution, reduced lipid order, and asymmetric fluidity gradients enable Mtb's outer membrane to resist host-derived stresses and limit antibiotic penetration, thereby promoting bacterial survival.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Atg2, a lipid transfer protein (LTP), collaborates with the phosphoinositide-binding protein Atg18 in this process. However, it remains largely unknown how the Atg2-Atg18 complex achieves bulk lipid transport and how much it contributes to autophagosome biogenesis. Here, by combining in silico, in vitro, and in vivo approaches, we explored the possibility that Atg2 mediates a bridge-type lipid transfer mechanism. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on the AlphaFold-predicted structure of the Atg2-Atg18 complex indicate that the hydrophobic cavity of Atg2 accommodates ~25 phospholipids in a water-excluding arrangement, aligning them side-by-side while maintaining bilayer-like fluidity. During simulations, Atg2 continuously bridged two membranes via its two termini and transferred a cavity-resident phospholipid to a membrane, contingent on Atg18-phosphoinositide interactions. Importantly, narrowing the cavity on the way disrupted side-by-side lipid alignment in silico, impaired bridge-type lipid transfer in vitro, and inhibited autophagosomal membrane expansion in vivo.

We previously developed Mumemto, which computes maximal unique matches (multi-MUMs) across pangenomes using compressed indexing. In this work, we extend Mumemto by introducing two new partitioning and merging strategies. Both strategies enable highly parallel, memory efficient, and updateable computation of multi-MUMs. One of the strategies, called string-based merging, is also capable of conducting the merges in a way that follows the shape of a phylogenetic tree, naturally yielding the multi-MUM for the tree's internal nodes as well as the root. With these strategies, Mumemto now scales to 474 human haplotypes, the only multi-MUM method able to do so. It also introduces a time-memory tradeoff that allows Mumemto to be tailored to more scenarios, including in resource-limited settings.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

This is especially the case for enzymes involved in glycosylation that, when mutated in human patients, are causing the disease congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). To resemble the patient conditions, it would be ideal to acutely modulate the proteins in question to directly interfere with protein levels of such essential enzymes. These methods offer to establish pathogenic enzyme levels resembling net enzyme activity reported from patients suffering from CDG, with Phosphomannomutase 2 - CDG (PMM2-CDG) as the most common form.

We established an auxin-inducible acute protein knockdown system for the use in the teleost fish medaka (Oryzias latipes) by combining an improved degron (AID2) technology with a mAID-nanobody targeting endogenously GFP-tagged Pmm2 protein. We generated a fishline expressing a functional Pmm2-GFP fusion protein, by single copy integration of GFP into the pmm2 locus. Upon induction, the degron system efficiently reduced Pmm2-GFP levels and enzyme activity, recapitulating the activity level of the hypomorphic mutations associated with PMM2-CDG in patients. This broadly applicable approach enables the investigation of CDG disease mechanisms during early embryonic development through reduction of protein abundance mimicking hypomorphic mutations and thus substantially expands the range of the genetic toolbox.

Summary StatementThe combination of TIR1F74G and mAID-GFP-nanobody enables efficient acute knockdown of endogenously GFP-tagged proteins in medaka. This approach successfully reduced Pmm2 enzyme activity to pathological levels as seen in PMM2-CDG patients.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

PcsB contains a cysteine, hishdine-dependent amidohydrolase/pephdase (CHAP) domain responsible for PG hydrolysis, as well as a coiled-coil domain required for interaction with FtsEX (1,4). ATP hydrolysis of FtsE in the cytoplasm drives conformational changes in FtsX in the cytoplasmic membrane, which ultimately regulates the PG hydrolase on the outside of the cell (5). In this work we show using in vitro and in vivo approaches, that the CHAP domain of PcsB predominately functions as an iso-D-Glutaminyl-Lysyl D,L-endopeptidase, with particular substrate specificity for Lys-containing, amidated PG, cleaving between the second and third amino acids of the peptidoglycan stem peptide. The catalytic activity of PcsB is regulated and activated by conformation changes of the coiled-coil region of PcsB and in part by a short helical region immediately adjacent to the CHAP domain to guard against PcsB hydrolytic activation outside of its cell division specific functional requirement. This work supports a model for the overall biological activity of the FtsEX-PcsB complex, in which ATP hydrolysis by FtsE in the cytoplasm, drives conformational changes in FtsX and PcsB resulting in the liberation of the hydrolytic CHAP domain of PcsB from its regulatory helix to allow PG stem peptide cleavage that splits the septal disk and marks a region of the peptidoglycan sacculus for subsequent cell division remodelling.

Significance StatementBacterial cell division requires coordinated assembly of specific proteins acting on the cell envelope to induce division. The cell division complex FtsEX is recruited early in divisome assembly and controls extracellular hydrolase function, which modifies the peptidoglycan layer. We demonstrate in Streptococcus pneumoniae, where these proteins are essential, connections between ATP hydrolysis in cytosolic FtsE, mechanotransduction through FtsX in the membrane, activation of PcsB in the intracellular space and molecular details of the chemical modification of the peptidoglycan layer. Here we present a model whereby the FtsEX-PcsB complex is assembled early in order to produce a hydrolase-modified form of peptidoglycan during septal splitting, marking the site of later division events; thus providing a rationale for its biological and temporal function.

Although recent studies have explored the relationship between gut microbiota and female life history, the link between gut microbiota and male life history remains understudied. In this study, we explored the role of gut microbiota in shaping male life history traits by correlating variation in life history traits across genetically homogeneous isolines with their naturally occurring gut microbiota. Using 22 isolines from the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), we measured lifespan, early/late-life reproduction, and early/late-life physiological performance. We characterized the gut microbiota composition in young (5 days old) and old (26 days old) flies using 16S rDNA sequencing. We observed significant variation in male life history traits across isolines, as well as age-related changes in gut microbiota composition. Using machine learning, we showed that gut microbiota composition could predict the age of the organisms with high accuracy. Associations between gut microbiota and life history traits were notable, particularly involving the Acetobacter genus. In early life, the abundance of Acetobacter ascendens was associated with functional aging, while Acetobacter indonesiensis was linked to reproductive senescence. In late life, higher abundances of A. ascendens and Acetobacter pasteurianus were negatively associated with lifespan. These findings highlight the potential role of gut microbiota, especially the Acetobacter genus, in male fitness and aging.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Here, we present StringTie3, a major update to the widely used StringTie assembler, specifically designed for total RNA-seq. This new version introduces two key innovations: (1) a nascent mode that models co-transcriptional splicing to separate nascent from mature transcripts, and (2) a refined long-read module that distinguishes genuine polyadenylation sites from poly(A)-priming artifacts. Across short-, long-, and hybrid-read datasets, StringTie3 substantially reduces assembly errors and outperforms existing tools, boosting precision by up to 20% in short-read total RNA-seq and improving sensitivity and precision by as much as 37% and 75%, respectively, in long-read assemblies. In Argonaute knockout experiments, nascent-mode analysis shows that single knockouts predominantly alter nascent transcripts while leaving mature RNA largely unchanged, whereas double or triple knockouts disrupt both fractions. Applying this approach to breast cancer samples shows that, although nascent and mature RNA levels often correlate, certain extracellular matrix and tumor suppressor genes deviate from this pattern, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation. By accurately reconstructing transcriptomes and distinguishing nascent from mature RNA, StringTie3 reveals hidden layers of RNA regulation and provides a powerful framework for investigating transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes in total RNA-seq data.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Here, we show that activating the entire population of reward-encoding DANs in Drosophila drives innate aversion in multiple behavioral assays, including feeding, locomotion, and spatial preference, even as these neurons confer a positive value onto associated cues to drive future learned attraction. Activating subsets of DANs reveals that the effects on innate and learned behaviors are dissociable. Based on known circuitry, it is likely that innate aversion and learned attraction elicited by DANs arise from distinct effects - direct activation versus synaptic plasticity - on the same target neurons. These results reveal distinct roles for reward-encoding DANs in guiding immediate and future behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Using ego-centric network data and DNA methylation-based biological aging clocks from a state representative probability sample in Indiana, we examine how negative social ties are associated with accelerated biological aging and a broad range of adverse physical and mental health outcomes. First, we find that difficult social ties are surprisingly common: on average, one in four network members is described as difficult, and nearly 60% of individuals report having at least one difficult tie. Regression analyses show that having more negative ties is associated with accelerated biological aging, with the most pronounced associations observed among individuals whose networks comprise more than 50% difficult ties. Finally, having negative ties is also associated with multiple adverse health outcomes beyond epigenetic aging, including poorer self-rated health, higher levels of depression and anxiety, elevated inflammation, greater multimorbidity, and unfavorable anthropometric indicators such as increased waist-to-hip ratio and BMI. These findings together highlight the critical role of negative social ties in biological aging as chronic stressors and the need for interventions that reduce the impact of negative social stressors within close social networks to promote healthier aging trajectories.","NA","medrxiv",1748383781562

To this end, we developed a scalable protocol for generating gastruloids that are monoclonal, i.e. derived from a single mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC). Single cell transcriptional profiling of monoclonal gastruloids revealed extensive inter-individual heterogeneity, with some hardly progressing, others resembling conventional gastruloids but biased towards mesodermal or neural lineages, and yet others bearing cell types rare or absent from conventional polyclonal gastruloids. To investigate this further, we leveraged DNA Typewriter2 to record the cell lineage relationships among the mESCs from which monoclonal gastruloids originate. Early in the expansion of ""founder"" mESCsprior to induction of the resulting aggregates to form gastruloidswe observe clear examples of fate bias or fate restriction, i.e. sister clades that exhibit markedly different cell type compositions. In a separate experiment with DNA Typewriter, we reconstructed a monophyletic ""tree of trees"", composed of [~]50,000 cells derived from [~]100 gastruloids, all descended from a single ""founder of founders"" stem cell. From these data, we find that founder mESCs that are more closely related are more likely to give rise to monoclonal gastruloids with similar cell type compositions. Our results suggest that fluctuations in the intrinsic states of mESCs are heritable, and shape their descendants fates across many cell divisions. Our study also showcases how DNA Typewriter can be used to reconstruct high-resolution, monophyletic cell lineage trees in stem cell models of early development.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK) MIK2 is an exceptionally versatile receptor involved in the perception of the vast family of Brassicales-specific endogenous SCOOP peptides as well as potential MAMPs derived from Fusarium and related fungi. Although only plant species belonging to the order of Brassicales encode genes for SCOOP peptides and show SCOOP-responsiveness, the Fusarium-derived elicitor fraction also induces PTI responses in plants from other lineages. In this study, we demonstrate that Fusarium elicitor-responsiveness and proteins belonging to the MIK2-clade are widely conserved among seed plants. We identified a MIK2-clade protein from tomato, which shares properties of AtMIK2 in the perception of the Fusarium elicitor but not of SCOOP peptides.

While such divergence has long been suspected to contribute to hybrid male sterility, leading to reproductive isolation and thus speciation, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we identify a molecular basis linking Y chromosome divergence to reproductive isolation in Drosophila. We show that male hybrids between D. simulans and D. mauritiana fail to properly express key Y-linked fertility genes. These genes contain unusually large introns, exceeding megabases and show substantial sequence divergence between species. In the hybrids, these gigantic introns are misprocessed, resulting in widespread splicing defects, including aberrant ""back-splicing"" events that join later exons to earlier ones. Our findings suggest that sequence divergence within introns can disrupt essential gene expression through defective splicing, providing a mechanistic link between rapid Y chromosome evolution and hybrid sterility. This work highlights the underappreciated role of intronic divergence in speciation.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Identifying group II introns in genome sequences has previously been challenging because of their lack of primary sequence similarity. Advances in RNA structure-based homology searches using covariance models has provided the ability to identify the conserved secondary structures of group II introns.

Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), a core component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, not only functions as an m6A writer but also promotes tumorigenesis through m6A-independent mechanisms. Here, we show that METTL3 is mislocalized to the cytoplasm in breast cancer tumors from patients, contributing to the oncogenic phenotype. Cytoplasmic METTL3 interacts with EXOC7, a key exocytosis regulator. Additionally, METTL3 regulates m6A-dependent alternative splicing of EXOC7, promoting the expression of a more aggressive isoform. Silencing METTL3 impairs vesicle trafficking and the breast cancer secretome, effects that do not rely on its enzymatic activity but instead involve METTL3-mediated stabilization of EXOC7. Furthermore, METTL3 knockdown, but not inhibition of its catalytic function, impairs invadopodia formation, collagen matrix invasion, and focal adhesion morphology. Our findings uncover non-catalytic roles of METTL3 in regulating exocytosis and cancer secretome.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

In inflamed joints, lining macrophages regulate both early inflammatory cell influx and resolution. Despite these critical functions, it is currently unknown at what stage during development the synovial macrophage lining is established, and which signals drive this process. Here, we use a combination of genetic models and in vivo perturbations, single cell transcriptomics and imaging to delineate the process of lining formation in mice. We find that the synovial lining is immature at birth and becomes established within the first 3 weeks of life. In this window, the lining is gradually populated with macrophages that originate from fetal sources, proliferate and acquire the lining-specific transcriptional identity. In contrast, monocytes contribute only minimally to the developing lining, and their input remains limited in healthy adulthood. We identify CSF1 and TGF{beta} as key signals in this process, which also involves mechanosensing through PIEZO1. Our study thus identifies the early postnatal window as a critical period for lining macrophage development, with potential lifelong impact on joint health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Allostatic overload occurs when environmental challenges surpass an individuals ability to cope. The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected pregnant women to an unprecedented amount of stress and uncertainty, and this situation has been linked to higher rates of mental health disorders, especially during lockdowns and the early stages of the pandemic. Contributing factors potentially include gender-based violence, gender inequality, multidimensional poverty, barriers to healthcare, isolation, and social restrictions, among others. Perinatal mental health disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and stress, have lasting health effects on both mothers and their children and could be significant risk factors for allostatic overload. Maternal mood and anxiety disorders during pregnancy have been linked to cardiovascular diseases, particularly ischemic heart disease, years after childbirth. Additionally, there is evidence showing the cardiovascular impacts of COVID-19, including an increased expression of thrombosis biomarkers in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

AimTo evaluate the impact of allostatic overload during pregnancy, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, on mothers cardiovascular health, childrens neurodevelopment, and the mother-child relationship.

Study designWe propose a historical cohort study focused on mothers who were pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021). We will retrospectively assess exposure to allostatic overload during the perinatal period by triangulating both quantitative and qualitative data. The outcomes for mother-child dyads will be evaluated prospectively.

MethodsWe propose to study 32 exposed and 64 control subjects to reject the null hypothesis that the relative risk equals 1. This sample size was estimated to detect a significantly higher relative risk of ischemic heart disease. The primary outcomes will be: 1) Manifestation or higher risk of ischemic heart disease in the mothers. 2) Neurodevelopmental disorders in children. 3) Alterations in the mother and child relationship. To assess exposure to allostatic overload, we will conduct a clinimetric survey and narrative interviews to explore life experiences and identify significant stressors during the perinatal period. The potential association between allostatic overload and health later in life will be analysed using multivariable epidemiological analyses and machine learning techniques.

Expected resultsWe anticipate a higher prevalence of allostatic overload in women who experienced pregnancy during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the later period. It is proposed that these women may face an increased risk of hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and ischemic heart disease due to allostatic overload. Additionally, we expect to observe changes in plasma biomarkers related to cardiovascular health and a higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in their children. Furthermore, increased parental stress associated with allostatic overload during pregnancy may lead to a poorer mother-child relationship.","NA","medrxiv",1748383781562

While the molecular and cellular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been extensively studied experimentally, much of our understanding of how plasticity is organized across populations of neurons during task learning comes from training artificial neural networks (ANNs) using computational methods. However, the architectures of modern ANNs and the algorithms used to train them are not compatible with fundamental principles of neuroscience, leaving a gap in understanding how the brain coordinates learning across multiple layers of neural circuitry. Here we leverage recent experimental evidence to test an emergent theory that biological learning depends on specialization of distinct neuronal cell types and compartmentalized signaling within neuronal dendrites. We demonstrate that multilayer ANNs comprised of separate recurrently connected excitatory and inhibitory cell types, and neuronal units with separate soma and dendrite compartments, can be trained to accurately classify images using a fully biology-compatible deep learning algorithm called dendritic target propagation. By adhering to strict biological constraints, this model is able to provide unique insight into the biological mechanisms of learning and to make experimentally testable predictions regarding the roles of specific neuronal cell types in coordinating learning across different brain regions.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Using NAP1KO cell lines, we discovered that NAP1 exerts a dual effect on TBK1 activity. Initially, NAP1 binds TBK1 and increases its activity, which enhances the activation of the IFN pathway. Then, phosphorylation of NAP1 by TBK1 induces the formation of NAP1 condensates. These condensates concentrate TBK1 and PP2A, a phosphatase known to dephosphorylate and consequently deactivate TBK1, thus limiting IFN induction. Additionally, in patients with lupus or interferonopathies, we identified NAP1 variants, unable to form condensates upon cell exposure to danger signals, which can only activate TBK1 without limiting its activity. This study reveals an original mode of regulating a signaling pathway by formation of condensates and provides a molecular explanation for certain interferonopathies.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Placebo analgesia can be induced through verbal suggestion, classical conditioning, or their combination, though the role of conditioned neural responses above and beyond effects of verbal instructions remains unclear. We conducted a systematic meta-analysis of individual participant data from 16 within-participant placebo neuroimaging studies (n = 409), employing univariate and multivariate analyses to identify shared and distinct mechanisms of placebo analgesia induced by suggestions alone versus suggestions combined with conditioning. Both techniques increased activity during pain in the dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortices and decreased activation in the insula, putamen, and primary sensory areas. Adding conditioning enhanced engagement of regions associated with context representation and pain modulation (e.g., dorsolateral/dorsomedial prefrontal cortices) and decreases in nociceptive regions (e.g., primary sensory and insular areas). Conditioning also strengthened the association between analgesia and nociceptive activity, as reflected in the Neurologic Pain Signature. Combining conditioning with instructions yielded greater analgesia, mediated by increased ventromedial prefrontal and dorsal caudate activity, alongside decreased sensory-nociceptive and cerebellar activity. These findings suggest the two strategies rely on partially distinct mechanisms, which could be combined to optimize placebo analgesias clinical application.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

The integrity of PRC2-mediated gene silencing depends critically on the ability of PRC2 to establish and propagate H3K27me3 beyond initial recruitment sites. The oncoproteins EZHIP and histone H3 K27M specifically inhibit this propagation by blocking the allosterically activated state of PRC2, leading to global disruption of H3K27me3 patterns and developmental abnormalities. To uncover chromatin-related pathways intersecting with PRC2 repression, we developed a Drosophila melanogaster model with tissue-specific expression of EZHIP and H3 K27M. A targeted RNAi screen of conserved chromatin regulators identified genetic modifiers that when knocked down either enhanced or suppressed developmental phenotypes driven by these PRC2 inhibitors. Strong suppressors, including the Trithorax-group proteins Ash1 and Trx, the PR-DUB complex member Asx, and the nucleoporin Nup153, restored normal development despite persistent depletion of global H3K27me3.

Despite their importance, the mechanistic underpinnings of DNA conformational dynamics that facilitate PTF-nucleosomal interactions remain elusive. To address this, we present the first large-scale, systematic investigation dissecting the role of DNA flexibility in defining transcription factor (TF) binding specificity in-vitro and in-vivo within nucleosomal DNA. Integration of high-throughput datasets with empirically derived DNA flexibility descriptors obtained DNA flexibility-augmented statistical regression models that highlight the relative contribution and mechanistic relevance of bending, torsional, and stretching flexibilities in predicting the nucleosomal DNA binding affinities of 194 TFs. Our findings also suggested that ""DNA flexibility gradient"" along nucleosomal substrate might be a key element to PTF-mediated nucleosome destabilization. Integrative modeling of DNA flexibility with in-vivo genomic occupancy, and chromatin accessibility data reveals that established PTFs, GATA3 and the pluripotency factors(OCT4, SOX2, and KLF), likely exploits the differential DNA flexibility signatures observed in the pioneered sites to remodel the closed chromatin. Finally, by proposing a robust computational framework, we demonstrate that sequence-encoded DNA structural descriptors are key determinants for accurately identifying functional PTF binding sites across diverse cellular contexts. In summary, our study highlights DNA conformational flexibility as a critical and previously underappreciated regulatory layer in eukaryotic gene regulation mediated by the PTFs--advancing our understanding of the interplay between DNA structural dynamics, chromatin organization, and transcriptional control.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the nature and extent of the deficits across brain areas and interneuron subtypes. Objective: The primary objective was to determine the extent of changes in parvalbumin, somatostatin, calbindin, and calretinin interneurons across brain regions and cortical layers in schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. The secondary objective was to examine differences in neuronal density and neuronal mRNA expression of GABAergic interneurons. Data Sources: A comprehensive search was conducted from Fall 2024 to Spring 2025, including terms related to schizophrenia, interneurons, immunohistochemistry and mRNA. Only post-mortem human studies containing neuroanatomical data of parvalbumin, somatostatin, calbindin, and calretinin interneurons were considered. Study Selection: We selected immunohistochemistry and mRNA studies that examined parvalbumin, somatostatin, calbindin, and calretinin interneuron density or expression in schizophrenia patients. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were extracted following PRISMA guidelines and were pooled with a random-effects model. A t-score statistic was applied to obtain distributions of effects. A two-sample t-test and Cohen's effect size was used to compare across areas, layers, cell types and methods. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Primary measurements/outcome were laminar interneuron density (assessed by immunohistochemistry) and gene expression (assessed by mRNA). Results: Data from 28 immunohistochemistry studies (362 control participants, 335 individuals with schizophrenia) revealed that the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were most consistently characterized by alterations in GABAergic interneurons; parvalbumin and somatostatin interneuron density was reduced in the hippocampus, while data from 18 mRNA studies (524 control participants, 519 individuals with schizophrenia) indicated reduced parvalbumin and somatostatin expression in prefrontal cortex. Layer-specific analysis demonstrated that parvalbumin interneurons were most affected in the superficial layers of prefrontal cortex, while somatostatin interneurons exhibited the strongest deficits in layers 2 and 5. Conclusions and Relevance: Our results show that GABAergic interneurons in the PFC and hippocampus are particularly affected. Parvalbumin and somatostatin showed the largest deficits, involving superficial layers and layer 5. We also identified significant reductions in parvalbumin and calretinin interneuron density in subcortical areas. Together, these data have important implications for the pathophysiology and computational models of circuit deficits in the disorder.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Here, we utilize optical tweezers to show that a multivalent protein DNA co-condensate containing the nuclear envelope protein LEM2 and the DNA-binding protein BAF shield DNA beyond its melting point at 65 pN. Under load, their collective assembly induces an unconventional DNA stiffening effect that provides mechanical reinforcement, dependent on the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of LEM2. Within cells, these components form an elastic surface hydrogel at the nuclear periphery, visible as a continuous surface by cryo-electron tomography. Disruption of this surface hydrogel increases DNA damage and micronuclei formation during nuclear deformation. Together, this work expands the functional repertoire of condensates, revealing a load-responsive nuclear surface hydrogel at the mesoscale that mitigates mechanical stress.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Using mathematical modeling, we elucidate that the bistability arising from the self-enhancing homing process of antigen-presenting dendritic cells plays a key role in the time-of-day-dependent adaptive immune response. Modeling analyses of circadian-controlled immune responses to three vaccine types demonstrate that vaccine-specific differences in time-of-day-dependent immunity originate from distinctions in the circadian-regulated activation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells. This divergence is amplified by bistability in the dendritic cell homing process, resulting in long-term distinctions in adaptive immunity across vaccine types. The model results reveal a dynamic mechanism by which adaptive immune responses maintain circadian variations over extended time periods, suggesting that the timing of vaccine administration within the day is a promising strategy for effective disease prevention.

Author SummaryInfection with the same pathogen in the morning or afternoon, or receiving the same vaccine at different times of the day, often leads to significantly different consequences in terms of infection severity or vaccine efficacy. This phenomenon is known as the time-of-day-dependent immune response. Although it is relatively common, the underlying dynamic mechanisms remain mostly unclear. In this paper, we employ mathematical modeling to investigate in detail the dynamics of adaptive immune responses following vaccination. We reveal that the kinetic origin of the time-of-day-dependent immune response lies in the positive feedback process during the homing of antigen-presenting cells, particularly dendritic cells. The bistability induced by self-activation, under the regulation of the circadian clock, plays a decisive role in generating this diurnal time dependency. The discovery of this mechanism suggests that time-of-day-specific vaccination is an effective strategy to optimize vaccine efficacy.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

The occurrence of mycorrhizae is now well established in c. 85% of extant plants, yet the geological record of these associations is sparse. Fossil evidence from early Paleozoic terrestrial environments provides rare insights into these ancient symbioses, but imaging micro-scale fossil fungi in surrounding plant tissues is challenging. We employed brightfield microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and Raman spectroscopy to investigate a newly identified endomycorrhizal fungus within a 407-million-year-old plant from the Windyfield Chert. An exquisite preservation and our advanced imaging approach enabled the description of the fungal structures to unprecedented detail. The fungus, Rugosomyces lavoisieriae gen. nov., & sp. nov., exhibits structural features resembling modern Glomeromycotina arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Combining CLSM with FLIM provides extra information by separating features based upon fluorescence lifetime. Raman spectroscopy indicates that fungal arbuscules and plant water-conducting cells have undergone geological alterations, resulting in a similar chemical composition. These findings enhance our understanding of ancient plant-fungal symbioses and demonstrate the potential of advanced imaging techniques in paleobotanical research.

Significance statementMost living plants form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, but how this ancient evolutionary relationship developed is poorly understood. Exceptional fossil materials preserve direct evidence of endomycorrhizae, but imaging micro-scale fossil fungi inside plant cells is challenging. Here we use confocal microscopy combined with fluorescence lifetime imaging and Raman spectroscopy to study a new endomycorrhizal fungus inside a 400-million-year-old plant. We document structures resembling modern Glomeromycotina. We show that the residual organic matter of the fungus and the plant cell walls has a very short fluorescence lifetime, which provides a new means of imaging these fossils. Raman spectroscopy indicates that both arbuscules and water-conducting cells were geologically altered by their diagenetic history and that they now have a similar chemical composition.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

However, many studies on the genetic relationship between cannabis use and psychosis have lacked data on both phenotypes within the same individuals, creating challenges due to unmeasured confounding. We aimed to address this by using multi-modal data from the All of Us Research Program, which contains genetic data as well as information on schizophrenia diagnosis and cannabis use.

MethodsWe tested the association between cannabis use disorder (CUD) and schizophrenia polygenic scores (PGS) and schizophrenia and heavy cannabis use. We tested models where both CUD and schizophrenia PGS were included as joint predictors of heavy cannabis use and schizophrenia case status. We defined three sets of cases based on comorbidities: relaxed (assessing for only the primary condition), strict (excluding for both conditions), and dual-comorbidity (including both conditions).

ResultsCUD and schizophrenia polygenic liability were independently associated with heavy cannabis use; the schizophrenia PGS effect was very modest. In contrast, both schizophrenia and CUD PGS were independently associated with schizophrenia, with independent significant effects of CUD PGS. Polygenic liability to CUD was associated with schizophrenia in individuals without a documented history of cannabis use, suggesting widespread pleiotropy.

ConclusionsThese findings underscore the need for comprehensive models that integrate genetic risk factors for heavy cannabis use to advance our understanding of schizophrenia aetiology.","NA","medrxiv",1748383781562

The promoter activates Antp expression specifically in satyrid eyespot center cells, sensitizes these cells to environmental temperatures, and plays a critical role in regulating satyrid eyespot size plasticity. Our study demonstrates that a taxon-specific cis-regulatory innovation in an ancestral developmental gene fueled the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity across a clade of animals.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Upon activation, conventional dendritic cells (DCs) undergo changes in their transcriptome, phenotype, and function, depending on the tissue microenvironment. The role of DC activation during human chronic inflammation has yet to be explored. To address this, we aimed to investigate activated DCs across a range of chronically inflamed human tissues, with a focus on cervical lymph nodes (LNs). We performed scRNAseq and flow cytometry on healthy, acutely, chronically inflamed, and cancer-associated human cervical (LNs) and identified a novel inflammation-associated DC (iaDC) cell state, found only within chronically inflamed LNs. iaDCs were defined by a unique cytokine expression profile (CXCL9, CXCL10, IL1B) and could be phenotypically distinguished from other activated DCs by their elevated expression of CD1C, CD206, CD319, and CD274. Functionally, we found that IFN{gamma} signaling induces DC2s to enter the iaDC cell state and that this process can be abrogated by inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling. Using spatial transcriptomics, we observed LN iaDC residing within a specific chronic inflammatory niche, which was enriched for inflammatory monocytes, NK cells, and effector memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Extrapolating our findings to other chronic inflammation-associated diseases, we similarly observed the emergence of iaDCs within the intestines of treatment-resistant Crohns Disease patients, synovial membranes and lymph nodes of rheumatoid arthritis patients and lungs of sarcoidosis patients. Similarly to the lymph node, iaDCs were found to reside in conserved chronic inflammation-associated spatial niches within the small intestine of affected individuals and displayed equivalent transcriptional characteristics and surrounding cellular neighborhoods. Collectively, these data highlight a previously unexplored role of iaDCs in human chronic inflammatory diseases and propose a conserved spatially restricted iaDC-populated chronic inflammatory niche associated with resistance to therapy. These findings highlight novel avenues to shape inflammatory trajectories by targeting iaDCs and their spatial niches, for example, by inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Conjugative plasmids play a crucial role in ARG spread across hosts within their host range, yet the genetic and functional determinants shaping plasmid host range remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically analyzed the gene content of conjugative/mobilizable plasmids from public databases and found that two distinct survival strategies were enriched in different host-range groups: a ""stealth"" strategy, which minimizes host fitness costs by employing a global regulator h-ns, was particularly enriched in broad-host-range plasmids, whereas an ""aggressive"" strategy, which protects plasmids by actively inhibiting host response including SOS response by encoding the SOS inhibitor psiB, was more common in narrow-host-range plasmids. Plasmids employing either strategy constituted the majority of all conjugative plasmids analyzed, and accumulated significantly more ARGs than plasmids with neither strategy. Our data further suggested that stealth plasmids facilitate the acquisition of emerging ARGs, while aggressive plasmids amplify the copy number of established ARGs. This ""stealth-first"" model successfully recapitulated historical ARG dissemination patterns. These findings provide critical insights into the relationship between plasmid survival strategies and host range, advancing our understanding of the global patterns underlying plasmid-mediated ARG transmission.

While the E:226V mutation, which has been associated with Aedes albopictus transmission efficiency, was absent in all 2025 CHIKV viral sequences, they carried the E1:K211E and E2: V264A mutations, which result in enhanced viral fitness within the Aedes aegpti mosquito.

Further, the drivers of such changes are uncertain, and quantitative models of the respective contribution of different African regions are lacking. Here we provide a complete reconstruction of the meta-population dynamics over the last 200,000 years by quantitatively integrating an environmental niche model based on archaeological sites within a spatially explicit population genetic framework. The inferred metapopulation dynamics not only fully explains the divergence among all available contemporary and ancient genomes of African hunter-gatherers, which were used to calibrate the model, but also accurately predicts the patterns of craniometric diversification across the continent from the Middle Pleistocene to the present.

Embryoid bodies (EBs) are self-organizing multicellular structures that recapitulate aspects of early mammalian embryogenesis. We set out to perform a CRISPR screen perturbing all transcription factors (TFs) in murine EBs. Specifically, a library of TF-targeting guide RNAs (gRNAs) was used to generate mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) bearing single TF knockouts. Aggregates of these mESCs were induced to form mouse EBs, such that each resulting EB was 'mosaic' with respect to the TF perturbations represented among its constituent cells. Upon performing single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on cells derived from mosaic EBs, we found many TF perturbations exhibiting large and seemingly significant effects on the likelihood that individual cells would adopt certain fates, suggesting roles for these TFs in lineage specification. However, to our surprise, these results were not reproducible across biological replicates. Upon further investigation, we discovered cellular bottlenecks during EB differentiation that dramatically reduce clonal complexity, curtailing statistical power and confounding interpretation of mosaic screens. Towards addressing this challenge, we developed a scalable protocol in which each individual EB is monoclonally derived from a single mESC and genetically barcoded. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we show how these monoclonal EBs enable us to better quantify the consequences of TF perturbations as well as 'inter-individual' heterogeneity across EBs harboring the same genetic perturbation. Looking forward, monoclonal EBs and EB-derived organoids may be powerful tools not only for genetic screens, but also for modeling Mendelian disorders, as their underlying genetic lesions are overwhelmingly constitutional (i.e. present in all somatic cells), yet give rise to phenotypes with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Electrophysiologic measures of cortical excitability hold promise for monitoring disease progression and evaluating therapeutic responses. The power law exponent (aperiodic slope) reflects the balance between excitatory and inhibitory activity within neuronal networks, a critical aspect of normal brain function often disrupted in neurological conditions. Despite its potential, the significance of the aperiodic slope in glioma-infiltrated tissue and its underlying cellular processes has not been fully investigated. Here, we integrate multi-modal electrophysiological analysis with transcriptomic profiling to analyze the aperiodic slope in both normal and glioma-infiltrated cortex. We determine that glioma infiltration induces a flattening of the aperiodic slope, indicating a shift toward excitation dominance that varies according to tumor subtype and correlates with impairments in semantic naming. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that cortical regions with flat aperiodic slope exhibit transcriptional programs enriched in glutamatergic signaling, membrane depolarization, and excitatory synaptic transmission. The aperiodic slope responds to pharmacologically induced changes in cortical inhibition during propofol administration, a GABAA agonist. Our results establish the aperiodic slope as a robust biomarker of glioma-associated excitation-inhibition imbalance, with potential applications in tumor classification and treatment monitoring.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Importantly, not all patients benefit from this treatment regimen, which means the number needed to treat is very high. Moreover, this makes clinical trials large and costly, limiting clinical translation. Thus, there is a high medical need to develop a first etiology-specific therapy. Mutations in RBM20, a splicing factor that targets multiple pivotal cardiac genes including TTN and CAMK2D, cause a clinically aggressive form of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with a high risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Here, we hypothesized that CAMK2D is the heart disease-causing target of RBM20. We crossed Camk2d- to Rbm20-deficient mice and found that double knockout (DKO) mice were protected from heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Phosphorylation of multiple CAMK2D targets was increased in Rbm20-deficient mouse hearts, which was reverted in DKO hearts, confirming that CAMK2D is not only misspliced but also overactivated. AAV9-mediated re-expression of single CAMK2D splice variants in DKO mice reintroduced cardiac dysfunction irrespective of the splice variant, unmasking that overactivation rather than missplicing underlies the detrimental phenotype. To test whether heart failure could pharmacologically be reversed, we treated heterozygous Rbm20-R636Q knock-in (KI) mice with hesperadin, a potent CAMK2 inhibitor, which rescued both cardiac function and ventricular geometry.

Pharmacological inhibition of CAMK2D could therefore become the first cause-directed DCM therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

Minor temperature oscillations can alert the pathogen to a changing niche ecosystem, necessitating efficient sensing and rapid integration to trigger behavioral change. This is typically achieved through master regulators, which act as umbrella systems dictating pleiotropic phenotypes. Here, we uncover a pivotal role of minor temperature shifts in transition of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) from commensal to virulent lifestyles, mediated via an RNA thermosensing (RNAT) element within the untranslated region of the global regulator CiaR. By positively regulating the expression of the surface adhesin, Phosphorylcholine (PCho), in response to elevated temperature, CiaR potentiates pneumococcal infection. Engineering the RNAT structure to create translation restrictive or permissive versions allowed us to demonstrate how modulation in expression of CiaR could alter pneumococcal invasion capability, influencing infection outcomes. Moreover, intranasal administration of PCho mitigated SPN-induced bacteraemic pneumonia. Since a majority of opportunistic respiratory bacterial pathogens decorate their surface with PCho, this signaling arm could be exploited for anti-infective interventions.

Significance statementOur nasopharyngeal area is dominated by opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN), which typically reside as harmless bystanders. However, in individuals with heightened nasopharyngeal inflammation, resulting from allergy, viral infection or an immature or senescent immune system, these seemingly innocuous microbes, including SPN, switch to virulent lifestyles. We reveal an elegant mechanism for rewiring of SPN virulence genes upon sensing temperature oscillations in the nasopharynx by the master regulator CiaR. Elevated nasopharyngeal temperatures due to pathologic conditions is sensed by thermosensing ciaR mRNA. This primarily promotes SPN surface decoration by PCho which facilitates improved invasion, triggering virulence phenotypes. Our findings point towards adoption of a common mechanism for switch to virulent lifestyles by variety of microbes sharing the specific respiratory niche.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

McdA, a member of the ParA/MinD family of ATPases, forms dynamic gradients on the nucleoid that position McdB-bound carboxysomes. McdB belongs to a widespread but poorly characterized class of ParA/MinD partner proteins, and the molecular basis of its interaction with McdA remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the N-terminal 20 residues of H. neapolitanus McdB are both necessary and sufficient for interaction with McdA. Within this region, we identify three lysine residues whose individual substitution modulates McdA binding and leads to distinct carboxysome organization phenotypes. Notably, lysine 7 (K7) is critical for McdA interaction: substitutions at this site result in the formation of a single carboxysome aggregate positioned at mid-nucleoid. This phenotype contrasts with that of an McdB deletion, in which carboxysome aggregates lose their nucleoid association and become sequestered at the cell poles. These findings suggest that weakened McdA-McdB interactions are sufficient to maintain carboxysome aggregates on the nucleoid but inadequate for partitioning individual carboxysomes across it. We propose that, within the ParA/MinD family of ATPases, cargo positioning and partitioning are mechanistically separable: weak interactions with the cognate partner can mediate positioning, whereas effective partitioning requires stronger interactions capable of overcoming cargo self-association forces.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo-Dropout CNN (MCD-CNN), as well as a few-shot learning approach to address dataset size limitations. Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1748383781562

Here, we present the deepest sequence coverage screen of the bacterial N-degron pathway using combinatorial site-saturation mutagenesis, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Our results reveal new categories of exceptions and nuance to the N-degron pathway observed in bulk and context-specific analyses. For example, we find cases where penultimate residues can reinforce or shift the stability expected based only on the identity of position 1 (P1). We observe lowered stability for P2-P5 motifs rich in bulky residues and Gln as well as heightened stability for P2-P5 motifs rich in negatively charged residues, Gly, and Pro, particularly when these residues are at P2. We find that P1 Cys can be a component of an N-degron in a sequence-specific manner. Furthermore, we employ machine learning to predict protein stability, identifying several motifs with unexpected fates. Our work expands the sequence determinants of the bacterial N-degron pathway with unprecedented granularity, providing a set of sequence guidelines for proteomic investigation and protein engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1748383781562

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1748383781562

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1748383781562

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.
