PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS","NA","medrxiv",1746655729185

DesignMatched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

The 10-minute National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lean Test (NLT) is an objective clinical test used to assess these symptoms and direct management. There is, however, no robust literature on normative data for this test, particularly from a younger population. Aims: The aim of this study was to produce a healthy control data set for NLT, which can be used for comparison with the patient population with health conditions. Methods: Individuals recruited into the study had no history or symptoms of orthostatic intolerance; autonomic dysfunction; post-infection conditions (such as long COVID); or other neurological conditions with hemodynamic instability. Participants were primarily recruited from the general population in a metropolitan city. All participants underwent a standardised NLT. Lying Blood Pressure (BP) and Heart Rate (HR) after 2 min of lying down supine was recorded, followed by BP and HR recordings at every minute of standing (leaning against a wall) up to 10 minutes, along with recording patient-reported symptoms at each time point. Results: A complete dataset was available for 112 individuals (60.7% Female, 39.3% Male). The population was 61.6% Caucasian, 8.0% Asian, 3.6% Black/Caribbean, 9.8% Mixed, and 17.0% Other; the mean age was 35.3 {+/-} 15.1, with a BMI of 24.8 {+/-} 4.0; 30.6% of individuals had a background medical condition, but none of the exclusion criteria. During NLT, upon standing, the average change of HR was an increase of 9.89 {+/-} 8.15bpm. The sustained HR increase (HR increase sustained at two consecutive readings) was an average of 6.23 {+/-} 6.94bpm. The predominant response with BP was an increase of systolic BP, with the average initial increase being 7.55 {+/-} 10.88mmHg. None of the participants met the diagnostic criteria for symptomatic OH or PoTS during NLT. Conclusion: For the first time in the current literature, NLT data from a relatively younger healthy population without orthostatic intolerance have been gathered. This normative data will help interpret NLT findings in younger patients with Orthostatic Intolerance better and be useful in managing dysautonomia in specific conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1746655729185

Nasal anti-CD3 treats animal models of progressive MS by inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and lessen clinical disease.

MethodsTen patients with non-active secondary progressive MS (naSPMS) that continued to progress on B cell therapy were treated with nasal anti-CD3 (foralumab) for a minimum of six months in an open label study. Safety monitoring included otolaryngology evaluation and neurologic assessments including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC-4), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II) and Low Contract Visual Acuity (LCVA). MRI and microglial translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging with [F-18]PBR06 were conducted. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic biomarkers and single cell RNA sequencing of blood was performed to evaluate foralumab-induced immunomodulation. The endpoints of our study were safety, clinical effects, microglial signal and immune measures.

ResultsAll patients stabilized on EDSS scores and three of four patients treated continuously for 12 months had improvement on EDSS. Six of 10 patients had improvement in fatigue on the MFIS scale. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) or severe AEs and no new T2 lesions were observed on MRI. There was a reduction in TSPO-PET signal over six months (p<0.05). Changes in peripheral blood gene expression occurred as early as three months and affected antigen presentation, interferon responses and regulatory pathways in multiple cell types including FoxP3+ Tregs, CD4+ Tcm cells, CD8+ Tem cells, CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes and B cells. TGF{beta} expression was increased across cell multiple subsets.

InterpretationThese findings identify a novel, non-toxic immune based therapy for the treatment for PIRA that acts by the induction of a regulatory immune responses and dampens microglial inflammation. Double blind placebo-controlled trials are warranted to explore nasal foralumab for the treatment of naSPMS.","NA","medrxiv",1746655729185

By hijacking the cellular ubiquitin-proteasome-system pathogenic proteins are degraded via heterobifunctional molecules, referred to as proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs). However, to date, only few PROTACs targeting viral or proviral proteins have been developed. To explore the possibilities and advantages of antiviral PROTACs, we have developed an antiviral PROTAC against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPro) using an allosteric warhead. Here, we present the design of ten MPro degraders that were developed using pelitinib as a warhead, an allosteric binder of MPro. Among several candidates, LLP019 emerged as the most potent molecule, capable of degrading up to 90% of MPro after ectopic expression in HEK293F cells. LLP019 displayed significant antiviral activity against several variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2 in infected Calu3 cells. In conclusion, we show that the development of antiviral PROTACs using an allosteric warhead represents a promising antiviral strategy, expanding the range of possible target proteins and ligands.","NA","biorxiv",1746655729185

This represents a ~five-fold increase in the number of phages with known hosts and fundamentally reshapes our understanding of phage biology. Identifying BAPS has enabled the discovery of entirely novel phage clusters, including clusters distantly related to Salmonella Goslarviruses in E. coli, and Shigella, while significantly expanding known genera such as Seoulvirus (from 16 to >300 members). Notably, close relatives of therapeutic lytic phages were also detected, suggesting clinical isolate sequencing unknowingly archives viable phage candidates.

To address this gap, we introduce an integrated approach where we generate ultra-deep Region Capture Micro-C (RCMC) and Micro-C data specifically designed for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. We developed Cleopatra, an attention-based deep learning model that takes epigenomic inputs and is pre-trained on genome-wide Micro-C data followed by fine-tuning with high-resolution RCMC data. Cleopatra accurately predicts 3D maps at sub-kilobase bin sizes and unprecedented resolution, enabling us to generate ultra-high-resolution, genome-wide 3D contact maps across four human cell types. These maps revealed cell-type-specific microcompartments and over 900,000 loops across the cell types, about half of which are cell-type-specific. Using Cleopatra maps, we observe that promoters form about a dozen loops on average, and that expression increases monotonically with the number of loops, indicating that looping is associated with higher gene expression. We further show the enhancer-promoter loops are often anchored by CTCF, and nominate new transcription factors that may regulate cell-type-specific enhancer-promoter interactions. Overall, we establish a framework for ultra-high-resolution 3D genome mapping, providing a broadly applicable resource for gaining new insights into cell-type-specific gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1746655729185

Underlying this variation are evolutionary forces, such as selection, that operate on changes to circuitry against a background of constraints. The interplay between selection and potentially limiting constraints determine how circuits evolve. Understanding how this process operates requires an evolutionary framework that facilitates comparative analysis of neural traits, within a clear behavioural and functional context. We leverage a large radiation of Heliconiini butterflies to examine how selection shapes the evolution of the central complex and the mushroom bodies, two integration centres in the insect brain involved in spatial navigation. Within the Heliconiini, one genus, Heliconius, performs systematic spatial foraging and navigation to exploit specific plants as a source of pollen, a novel dietary resource. Closely related genera within Heliconiini lack this dietary adaptation, and are more vagrant foragers. The evolution of increased spatial fidelity in Heliconius has led to changes in brain morphology, and in specific learning and memory profiles, over a relatively short evolutionary time scale. Here, using a dataset of 41 species, we show that in contrast to a massive expansion of the mushroom bodies, the central complex and associated visual processing areas are strongly conserved in size and general architecture. We corroborate this by characterising patterns of fine anatomical conservation, including conserved patterns in dopamine and serotonin expression. However, we also identify a divergence in the expression of a neuropeptide, Allatostatin A, in the noduli, and in the numbers of GABA-ergic ellipsoid body ring neurons and their branching in the fan-shaped body, which are essential members of the anterior compass pathway. These differences match expectations of where evolutionary adaptability might occur inside the central complex network and provide rare examples of divergence of these circuits in a shallow phylogenetic context. We conclude that due to the contrasting volumetric conservation of the central complex and the massive volumetric differences in the mushroom bodies, their circuit logics must determine distinct responses to selection associated with divergent foraging behaviours.","NA","biorxiv",1746655729186

Their existence leads one to wonder whether amino acid sequences are sufficiently degenerate with respect to protein folding to broadly allow arbitrary pairs of functional proteins to be overlapped. Here, we investigate this question by engineering synthetic OLGs using state-of-the-art generative models. To evaluate the approach, we first design overlapped sequences targeting two different protein families. We then encode distinct highly ordered de novo protein structures and observe surprisingly high in silico and experimental success rates. This demonstrates that the overlap constraints under the structure of the standard genetic code do not significantly restrict simultaneous accommodation of well defined 3D folds in alternative reading frames. Our work suggests that OLG sequences may be frequently accessible in nature and could be readily exploited to compress and constrain synthetic genetic circuits.","NA","biorxiv",1746655729186

We hypothesized that sequence-based models can be used to systematically prioritize such mutations for their functional relevance. Here we present a computational framework that leverages sequence-based models to assess the functional impact of (ultra-)rare somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in promoter regions. We analysed SNVs derived from 24,529 whole-tumour genomes from three cohorts and applied the sequence-based model PARM, which was trained on massively parallel reporter assay data. We identified up to 492 promoter regions significantly enriched for putatively functional SNVs, including known cancer-drivers such as TERT. Overall, we find that functional promoter mutations are significantly enriched in established cancer-driver genes (p-value = 9.7x10-5). Cross-cohort validation and replication using an independent sequence-based model (Borzoi) identified nine candidate cancer genes where the prioritized promoter mutations were shown to be functional by affecting gene expression levels. These genes included well known cancer genes such as including TERT, TP53 and PMS2, but also several new candidates for which no coding mutations have previously been implicated in cancer, including PMS2, AIMP2, SASS6, RPL13A, ALKBH4, FICD and YAE1.

Gamete release is often synchronised with respect to the daily light changes at sunrise and sunset. In the hydrozoan jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica, morning spawning occurs when oocyte maturation and gamete release are induced by maturation-inducing hormone (MIH) neuropeptides released from opsin-expressing cells in the gonad directly upon light stimulus. Here, we characterise the distinct spawning cycle of a previously undescribed species Clytia sp. IZ-D identified on the Pacific coast of Japan, which releases gametes in the evening. Clytia sp. IZ-D jellyfish spawn 14 hours after light stimuli under a 24-hour light-dark cycle and exhibit autonomous and synchronised spawning cycles with a 20-hour interval under constant light. We found that the female spawning cycle reflects the growth and acquisition of maturation competence by oocytes, such that each day a new batch of growing oocytes becomes responsive to MIH at a time that correlates with the timing of actual spawning. We propose that the synchronised evening spawning in this species is controlled by an unusual circadian timing mechanism based on the progressive development of gamete competence to MIH and modulation of the opsin-controlled MIH signalling pathway. This mechanism may provide resilience to light cycle instability due to local climate variation and ensure reproductive isolation from other Clytia species by alternating the gamete release timing.","NA","biorxiv",1746655729186

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1746655729186

Here, we identify a small RNA (svsR) encoded by the lambdoid prophage NC-SV in adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) strain NC101 that confers resistance to lytic coliphages. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that NC-SV-like prophages and svsR homologs are conserved across diverse Enterobacteriaceae. Transcriptional analyses reveal that svsR represses maltodextrin transport genes, including lamB, which encodes the outer membrane maltoporin LamB--a known receptor for multiple phages. Nutrient supplementation experiments show that maltodextrin enhances phage adsorption, while glucose suppresses it, consistent with established effects of these sugars on lamB expression. In vivo, we compared wild-type NC101 and a prophage-deletion strain (NC101deltaNC-SV) in mice to assess the impact of NC-SV on lytic phage susceptibility. Although intestinal E. coli densities remained stable across groups, animals colonized with NC101 exhibited markedly reduced phage burdens in both the intestinal lumen and mucosa compared to mice colonized with NC101deltaNC-SV. This reduced phage pressure was associated with increased dissemination of NC101 to extraintestinal tissues, including the spleen and liver. Together, these findings highlight a nutrient-responsive, prophage-encoded mechanism that protects AIEC from phage predation and may promote bacterial persistence and dissemination in the inflamed gut.","NA","biorxiv",1746655729186

We present a new framework - Adaptive Diagnostic Architecture for Personalized Testing by Mass Spectrometry (ADAPT-MS) - that enables direct diagnostic and prognostic interpretation of discovery-mode proteomics data at the level of individual samples. ADAPT-MS dynamically retrains simple, robust classifiers based on the proteins quantified in each sample, eliminating the need for imputation or fixed panels. Applied to plasma and cerebrospinal fluid datasets across diseases and clinical centers, it achieves high performance and generalizability using robust, transparent and generalizable statistical models. A single proteomic measurement can support multiple diagnostic questions via retrospective cohort matching, with each classification taking only seconds. As population-scale proteomics datasets grow, this approach lays the foundation for scalable, real-time, and personalized diagnostics directly from proteome-wide data. Such a community effort may help to transform discovery proteomics into a routine clinical tool.

A critical challenge in developing rationally designed therapeutics is understanding how these various factors converge to disrupt cellular networks in the human brain, ultimately contributing to SCZ. Towards this aim, we generated multimodal data, including SCZ-specific protein-protein interactions in stem-cell-derived neuronal models and adult postmortem cortex, integrated with genetic and transcriptomic datasets from individuals with psychiatric disorders. We identified three distinct neuron-specific SCZ protein networks, or modules, significantly enriched for genetic and transcriptional perturbations associated with SCZ. The relevance of these modules was validated through whole-cell proteomics in patient-derived neurons, revealing their disruption in 22q11.2 deletion carriers diagnosed with SCZ. We demonstrated their therapeutic potential by showing that these modules are targets of GSK3 inhibition using phosphoproteomics. Our findings present a foundational model that integrates genetic, transcriptional, and proteomic perturbations in SCZ. This model provides a cohesive framework for understanding how polygenic and multimodal perturbations affect neuronal pathways in the human brain, as well as a data-driven pathway resource for identifying potential drug targets to reverse disruptions observed in these neuronal networks.","NA","medrxiv",1746655729186

Contrary to the common assumption that PGCs directly develop into germline stem cells (GSCs), recent mammalian data and our zebrafish observations suggest a more complex picture. We hypothesized that individual PGCs contribute differentially to gonad development. To test this hypothesis, we developed two Cre-based lineage tracing systems and demonstrate that PGCs give rise to at least four distinct clone types in zebrafish. We observed no restriction in clone type localization along the anterior-posterior axis, suggesting these differences are PGC intrinsic or locally determined. Further examination of the ovarian reserve revealed functional evidence that some PGCs generate self-renewing GSCs, while others produce non-renewing progenitors that are depleted with successive matings. Collectively, our findings propose a revised model of vertebrate germline establishment with implications to reproductive lifespan. This model suggests that differentiation potential varies among PGCs, allowing individual PGCs to directly differentiate into multiple distinct germ cell types, including renewing GSCs and transient populations that contribute to an early wave of gametes.","NA","biorxiv",1746655729186

To investigate this, we examined freely moving marmoset dyads in a cooperative lever-pulling task. Marmosets successfully coordinated actions, relying on social vision rather than environmental cues. Blocking visual access or replacing the partner with an automated agent disrupted coordination. Causal dependencies between social gaze and pull actions revealed both gaze-dependent and gaze-independent strategies. Cooperation depended on social relationships, including dominance, kinship, and sex. Remarkably, marmosets adapted strategies based on partner identity, indicating rapid social learning and memory. Altogether, these findings show that flexible, cognitively driven cooperation extends more broadly across primates than previously recognized, informing our understanding of cooperative behavior mechanisms and evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1746655729186

PFC often uses distinct subspaces to represent incoming sensory information and to maintain it in working memory. However, its generally assumed that a subspace carries specific information within a specific time frame. Here, in two datasets, we show that neither assumption is correct. The same subspace used during initial encoding was later reactivated during the behavioral response. We also found that subspaces ostensibly dedicated to processing sensory information were recycled to represent behavioral response information later in a trial. We further found a consistent spatial mapping between the original subspace usage and its later recycling. These results demonstrate previously unknown flexibility of PFC subspace coding, both in the deployment of subspaces across time and in their multiplexing of information. This flexibility suggests that PFC subspaces function more like ""workspaces"" into which different types of information can be written.","NA","biorxiv",1746655729186

MM is preceded by an asymptomatic precursor monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Studies have identified several risk factors for the progression of MGUS to MM; however, the relative contributions of these remain unknown. Particularly, understanding the contribution among those modifiable factors may inform MM prevention.

METHODSThis study quantified these contributions by estimating the adjusted population attributable fractions (aPAF) of modifiable risk factors for MM among the Veteran population with MGUS.

RESULTSAmong all evaluated risk factors, excess body mass index (BMI [&ge;]25 kg/m2) was the leading factor (Black: aPAF=27.0%, 95% CI 19.3-33.9%; White: 27.1%, 95% CI 20.3-33.4%; All: aPAF=27.1%, 95% CI: 22.0-31.8%).

To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1746655729186

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1746655729186
