How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1749679769829

Here we uncover an unprecedented mechanism of RNA-guided gene activation involving the coordinated action of {sigma}E factor in complex with nuclease-dead Cas12f (dCas12f). We screened a large set of genetically-linked dCas12f and {sigma}E homologs in E. coli using RIP-seq and ChIP-seq experiments, revealing systems that exhibited robust guide RNA enrichment and DNA target binding with a minimal 5'-G target-adjacent motif (TAM). Recruitment of {sigma}E was dependent on dCas12f and guide RNA (gRNA), suggesting direct protein-protein interactions, and co-expression experiments demonstrated that the dCas12f-gRNA-{sigma}E ternary complex was competent for programmable recruitment of the RNAP holoenzyme. Remarkably, dCas12f-RNA-{sigma}E complexes drove potent gene expression in the absence of any requisite promoter motifs, with de novo transcription start sites defined exclusively by the relative distance from the dCas12f-mediated R-loop. Our findings highlight a new paradigm of RNA-guided transcription (RGT) that embodies natural features reminiscent of CRISPRa technology developed by humans(4,5).","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

Here, we identify myeloid leukemia factor 2 (MLF2) as a disease-agnostic biomarker for phase transitions, including stress granules and nuclear condensates associated with dystonia. Exploiting fluorophore-derivatized MLF2 constructs, we developed a high-content platform and computational pipeline to screen modulators of NE condensates across chemical and genetic space. We identified RNF26 and ZNF335 as protective factors that prevent the buildup of nuclear condensates sequestering K48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins. Chemical screening identified four FDA-approved drugs that potently modulate condensates by resolving polyubiquitinated cargo and MLF2 accumulation. Our exploratory integrated chemical-genetics approach suggests that modulation of zinc, and potentially autophagy and oxidative stress, is critical for condensate modulation and nuclear proteostasis, offering potential therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders. Application of our platform to a genome-wide CRISPR KO screen identified strong enrichment of candidate genes linked to primary microcephaly and related neurodevelopmental disorders. Two hypomorphic microcephaly-associated alleles of ZNF335 failed to rescue nuclear condensate accumulation in ZNF335 KO cells, suggesting that aberrant condensates and impaired nuclear proteostasis may contribute to the pathogenesis of microcephaly.

Chronic active white matter lesions (CAL), identifiable radio-logically as paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), indicate progression-relevant chronic neuroinflammation. Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) and T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood immune cells of 34 radiologically characterized adults with MS (17 untreated, 6 treated with B-cell-depletion) and 5 healthy controls. Coupled with proteomics, we found PRL-associated enrichment of interferon (IFN) signaling and upregulation of TCR signaling in CSF and blood. This was accompanied by clonal expansion of CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, with the highly expanded clonal cells exhibiting T helper type 1 (TH1) and cytotoxic profiles. Validating the cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells.

In the present paper, we demonstrate that sperm whale codas not only resemble human vowels acoustically, but also pattern like them across several dimensions. First, traditional count- and timing-based coda types interact with coda ""vowel"" quality (a vs. i). Second, a-codas are generally longer than i-codas. Third, the duration of i-codas has a bimodal distribution, showing a contrast between short i-codas and long [i]-codas. Fourth, the baseline coda length differs across whales. And fifth, edge clicks mismatching their coda often match an adjacent coda, a phenomenon that resembles human coarticulation. All five properties have close parallels in the phonetics and phonology of human languages. Sperm whale coda vocalizations thus represent one of the closest parallels to human phonology of any known animal communication systems.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1749679769830

Using a live reporter of BMP pathway activity and nascent transcription reporters, we find that gene expression is best predicted by time integration of BMP signaling, rather than instantaneous levels. However, in sog mutant embryos with broad BMP activity, integration alone fails to predict gene expression outside the normal domain. We show that the transcription factor Zen lowers the signaling threshold required for activation, enabling integration to drive rapid transcriptional responses even at low BMP levels. Together, these results suggest that cells interpret dynamic morphogen signals through the combined action of temporal integration and spatial competence, providing a framework for robust pattern formation on fast developmental timescales.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

This broadband activity indicates spontaneous fluctuations in excitation-inhibition (E:I) balance across vigilance states and has recently been shown to systematically covary across the respiratory cycle during waking resting state. We used simultaneous EEG and respiratory recordings over a full night of sleep collected from N = 23 healthy participants to unravel the nested dynamics of respiration phase-locked excitability states across the wake-sleep cycle. We demonstrate a prominent phase shift in the coupling of aperiodic brain activity to respiratory rhythms as participants were transitioning from wakefulness to sleep. Moreover, respiration-brain coupling became more consistent both across and within participants, as interindividual as well as intraindividual variability systematically lessened from wakefulness and the transition to sleep towards deeper sleep stages. Our results suggest that respiration phase-locked changes in E:I balance conceivably add to sleep stage-specific neural signatures of REM and NREM sleep, highlighting the complexity of brain-body coupling during sleep.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

In bacteria, diverse clades of repurposed TnpB and CRISPR-associated proteins repress gene expression by blocking transcription initiation or elongation, enabling non-canonical modes of regulatory control and adaptive immunity(1,6,7). Intriguingly, a distinct class of nuclease-dead Cas12f homologs (dCas12f) instead activates gene expression through its association with unique extracytoplasmic function sigma factors ({sigma}E)(8), though the molecular basis has remained elusive. Here we reveal a novel mode of RNA-guided transcription initiation by determining cryo-electron microscopy structures of the dCas12f-{sigma}E system from Flagellimonas taeanensis. We captured multiple conformational and compositional states, including the DNA-bound dCas12f-{sigma}E-RNAP holoenzyme complex, revealing how RNA-guided DNA binding leads to {sigma}E-RNAP recruitment and nascent mRNA synthesis at a precisely defined distance downstream of the R-loop. Rather than following the classical paradigm of {sigma}E-dependent promoter recognition, these studies show that recognition of the -35 element is largely supplanted by CRISPR-Cas targeting, while the melted -10 element is stabilized through unusual stacking interactions rather than insertion into the typical recognition pocket. Collectively, this work provides high-resolution insights into an unexpected mechanism of RNA-guided transcription, expanding our understanding of bacterial gene regulation and opening new avenues for programmable transcriptional control.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

Here, we demonstrate that SALL4, a transcription factor strongly expressed in cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) and associated with syndromes featuring craniofacial anomalies, plays a critical role in this early regulatory process. Using a SALL4-haploinsufficient human iPSC model that recapitulates clinical haploinsufficiency, we show that the SALL4A isoform directly interacts with the BAF complex subunit DPF2 through its zinc-finger-3 domain. This interaction enables SALL4-mediated recruitment of BAF to CNCC-specific enhancers during early neural plate stages. Without functional SALL4, BAF fails to load at chromatin, leaving CNCC enhancers inaccessible despite normal neuroectodermal progression. Consequently, cells cannot undergo proper CNCC induction and specification due to persistent enhancer repression. Our findings reveal SALL4 as an essential regulator of BAF-dependent enhancer activation during early neural crest development, providing molecular insights into SALL4-associated craniofacial anomalies.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

Phenotype-based discovery in ST data holds transformative potential for linking spatial molecular expression patterns to clinical outcomes; however, appropriate ST data analysis remains fundamentally fragmented and highly labor-intensive. Due to its limited scalability considering the size of typical ST data in large cohorts, researchers must rely on other phenotype-annotated omics data modalities (e.g. bulk RNA-sequencing) and align them with ST data to extract clinically meaningful spatial patterns. Yet, this process requires manually identifying relevant cohorts, aligning multi-modal data, selecting and tuning analysis pipelines, and interpreting results, typically without any built-in support for biologically context-aware reasoning.

Rotational and translational binocular optic flow patterns need to be clearly distinguished to induce different behavior outputs. However, the specific neuron types and their connectivity involved in this computation remain unclear. Here, we developed a method to link the functional labeling using a photoconvertible calcium indicator called CaMPARI2 and single-cell RNA-sequencing (CaMPARI-seq) to investigate the transcriptional profile of the pretectum, a center for processing optic flow in larval zebrafish. Using this technique, we identified a pretectal cluster expressing tcf7l2, which can be further classified into molecularly distinct subclusters. In vivo calcium imaging and cell ablation revealed that nkx1.2lb-positive pretectal neurons are commissural inhibitory neurons required for the optomotor response but not for the optokinetic response. Our genetic and functional dissection using CaMPARI-seq uncovered the neuronal organization essential for dissociating different optic flow-dependent behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

The effects of OTR could be mediated by modulating the activity of pre-synaptic axon terminals or via post-synaptic neurons or glia. Using a viral-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system in California mice (Peromyscus californicus), we selectively knocked down OTR in the anteromedial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) or the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to examine their roles modulating social approach and vigilance behaviors. Knockdown of OTR in the BNST attenuated stress-induced decreases of social approach and increases of social vigilance behaviors in adult female California mice, similar to prior pharmacological studies. These effects were more prominent in the large arena social interaction where mice could control proximity to a social target with a barrier (wire cage). In a small arena interaction test where focal mice freely interacted with target mice, effects of BNST OTR knockdown were muted. This suggests that within the BNST OTR are more important for modulating behavioral responses to more distal stimuli versus more proximal social contexts. In mice with OTR knockdown in the NAc, few behavioral changes were observed which is consistent with previous findings of the importance of presynaptic OTR, which were unaffected by our gene editing strategy, driving social approach behaviors in the NAc. Interestingly, BNST OTR knockdown increased exploratory behavior toward a non-social stimulus after stress, pointing to a potentially broader role for BNST OTR function. Our findings highlight the region- and context-specific functions of OTR in social behavior and the advantages of using a selective gene-editing tool to dissect the neural circuits that influence social and stress-related responses.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

Gene expression is known to vary within a species pangenome, but the extent to which these changes could be explained by genetic variants in cis non-coding regions has so far been poorly investigated. Statistical genetics offers a hypothesis-free approach to this problem, as opposed to mechanistic models, which can be used only for reference isolates that are not representative of the whole species. In this study, we assembled two genomic and transcriptomic datasets for Escherichia coli (N=117) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N=413) and identified associations between genetic variants in cis non-coding regions and recorded gene expression variation. We identified at least one associated variant in up to 39% of the tested genes in both species. We partly validated the associations in-silico and in-vitro for E. coli, reinforcing the difficulty of identifying a single mechanism generating gene expression diversity. We then investigated the relevance of non-coding variants in explaining the variability in antimicrobial resistance in both species using two additional publicly available datasets, identifying a large number of these variants across antimicrobial compounds. This work confirms the role of genetic variation in often overlooked regions of bacterial genomes in influencing molecular and clinically relevant phenotypes.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

The core challenge lies in balancing quality and scalability. Manual curation delivers high quality, reliable annotations but is time-intensive and non-scalable; automated approaches, including those based on natural language processing, can scale but often fall short in accuracy and completeness. This tradeoff is particularly severe in public datasets, where metadata is frequently distributed across multiple sources for a single dataset. A notable example includes multi-omics datasets available on GEO and similar public repositories, which are often accompanied by associated publications. These supplementary sources can be leveraged to substantially enhance metadata quality, thereby supporting downstream applications such as classifier model development or the identification of biologically relevant cohorts, etc. We present a first-in-class multi-agent AI system that bridges the gap, achieving both high quality and scalability in metadata curation. Built on large-language models (LLMs), our system orchestrates a set of specialized agents that collaboratively extract, normalize, and infer critical metadata fields such as tissue, disease, cell line, sampling site, demographics, and experimental context from GEO entries, associated publications. A central orchestrator agent delegates tasks such as data retrieval, document parsing, ontology mapping, and context inference to expert sub-agents, enabling scalable, end-to-end automation. Applied to GEO data sets, a notoriously difficult metadata domain, our system achieves a 93% recall on average across 23 key fields (all original terms, normalized terms, and corresponding ontology ids) that include information about disease, tissue, treatment, donor-related information, outperforming existing automated baselines and approaches expert level quality. We also present a system that can easily scale to curate hundreds of metadata fields of interest with similar precision. This work demonstrates that an LLM-based multi-agent architecture can overcome traditional trade-offs in metadata curation, enabling both precision and scale, and offers a promising path forward for curating large public biomedical repositories for downstream AI applications.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

These observations inform how mitochondrial membranes can limit the growth and dynamics of the condensates they enclose, without the need of additional regulatory mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

BMP-dependent patterning of the secondary body axis is ancestral for Bilateria and possibly also for the bilaterian sister clade Cnidaria. However, the variety of levels of centralization of the nervous systems in Bilateria - from diffuse to fully centralized - as well as the lack of centralization of the nervous system in Cnidaria, suggest that BMP signaling cannot be perceived as a universally ""anti-neural"" signal. Here we use transgenic reporter lines in the anthozoan cnidarian Nematostella to show that BMP signaling is active in distinct neuronal populations. Moreover, attenuation of BMP signaling followed by RNA-Seq shows that BMP signaling is a positive regulator of many neuronal genes, including the top-tier neural progenitor marker soxB(2). Further, we analyze BMP signaling activity in the true jellyfish Aurelia and box jellyfish Tripedalia proving that BMP signaling in the diffuse cnidarian nervous system is not an anthozoan but an ancestral cnidarian feature, shared by anthozoans and medusozoans. Finally, we show that the highly centralized ventral nervous system of the non-model spiralian, the chaetognath Spadella, forms out of paired BMP signaling-positive domains on the lateral sides of the embryo. Together, our data suggest that one of the ancestral roles of BMP signaling was in promoting neurogenesis. We propose that the ""anti-neural"" function of BMP signaling in vertebrates and arthropods is a side effect of its global role in the dorsoventral patterning of the ectoderm.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

While we are beginning to understand the behavioral consequences of this exposure, the neural correlates of spatial cognition deficits are underexplored. Thus, we recorded a mixture of neurons from the AT and surrounding brain regions in mice with TTAE while they freely moved within a controlled environment. To model acute binge-like TTAE, C57BL/6J mice received 2 injections of 2.5 g/kg alcohol (or saline) on post-natal day (PND) 7. Subjects were then left undisturbed until the day of surgery as adults (>PND 60), when they were implanted with silicon or multi-wire arrays. Mice were placed in a circular 40 cm diameter arena under dim red light with 2 LED cues on the walls that rotated on a pseudo-random basis while electrophysiological data was recorded. Following data preprocessing, spike and waveform features were extracted from each putative single spiking unit. These features were reduced utilizing uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). Following dimensionality reduction, we used agglomerative hierarchical clustering to find populations of neurons with similar features. Following this, we compared each feature based on treatment and found the features most important to disambiguate TTAEs impact on neural activity. TTAE was associated with decreases in mean firing rate, peak firing rate, rebound index, and tail decay constant, increases in alpha, peak to trough time, and repolarization time, and bidirectional differences as a function of neuronal subtype in burst index and rebound index. This suggests that TTAE produces long-lasting and fundamental differences in spiking features that can be observed in vivo and are amenable to intervention. Together, this dataset provides further clarifying criteria that can be utilized to diagnose and treat FASD.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

Here, we analyzed CM and 3D structural brain MRI data from 3,711 participants in the ENIGMA MDD and PTSD Working Groups (25 sites; 33.3+/-13.0 years; 59.9% female). Normative modeling estimated deviation z-scores for 14 subcortical volumes (SV), 68 cortical thickness (CT), and 68 surface area (SA) measures, capturing differences from population norms. Transdiagnostic associations between CM and brain deviation scores were evaluated within each sex and age cohort. In young adults (ages 18-35), abuse was associated with larger volumes in thalamus and pallidum, thinner isthmus cingulate and middle frontal regions, and thicker medial orbitofrontal cortex; there were no significant effects in pediatric ([&le;]18 years) participants. The strongest effects were observed in young female adults (|{beta}|=.07-.22, q<.05): greater abuse and neglect were correlated with smaller hippocampus and putamen volumes, thinner entorhinal cortex, and smaller SA in fusiform/inferior parietal regions, and with larger SA in orbitofrontal and occipital cortices.

LIPTACs enable efficient and selective degradation of diverse extracellular membrane proteins. Additionally, by coupling LIPTACs with cytotoxic payloads to generate degrader-drug conjugates, we can achieve superior intracellular delivery and enhanced cytotoxicity compared to conventional ADCs. The dual modality addresses key challenges of inadequate internalization in conventional ADCs and cytotoxic potency for current eTPD strategies.

Elasmobranchs, including sharks, rays, and skates, exhibit high among-species variation of genome size and high within-species variation of chromosome length, offering a unique study system to address the question. In this study, we present the first whole genome sequences of the whitebelly skate with remarkably small genome size among elasmobranchs (2.2 Gb), and the red stingray. These chromosome-scale assemblies enabled the assessment of genomic compositions including centromeres and non-coding elements, which revealed notable profiles of tRNA loci and unbiased intragenomic distribution of transposons in elasmobranch genomes. Comparative analyses across these species revealed a shared genomic architecture characterized by correlations of intergenic and intronic sequence lengths with chromosome sizes, with repetitive element accumulation in elongated regions. We analyzed tandemly duplicated genes with high copy number variability. This genome-wide survey revealed the tendency for more frequent tandem gene duplications along with genome size expansion.

Following SSRI exposure, we assessed cellular viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial function through adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assays and performed high throughput metabolomic profiling at two timepoints: proliferation and neural differentiation stages. Sertraline and paroxetine significantly decreased ROS and ATP levels, indicating mitochondrial alteration.

We introduce an automated analysis pipeline (TURBO) for preprocessing and kinetic modeling of total-body [15O]H2O and [18F]FDG PET data, enabling efficient and reproducible analysis of tissue perfusion and metabolism at regional and voxel level. The approach employs automated CT segmentation for ROI delineation, image-derived input determination, and region-specific PET data kinetic modelling.

MethodsWe validated the analysis pipeline using Biograph Vision Quadra (Siemens Healthineers) total-body PET/CT scans from 21 subjects scanned with [15O]H2O and 16 subjects scanned with [18F]FDG using six ROIs (cortical brain gray matter, left iliopsoas, right kidney, pancreas, spleen and liver) representing different levels of blood flow and glucose metabolism.

ResultsModel fits showed good quality with consistent parameter estimates at both regional and voxel levels (R2 > 0.91 for [15O]H2O, R2 > 0.99 for [18F]FDG). Estimates from manual and automated input functions were correlated (R2 > 0.86 for [15O]H2O, and R2 > 0.88 for [18F]FDG) with minimal bias (<10% for [15O]H2O and <2% for [18F]FDG). Manually and automatically (CT-based) extracted ROI level data showed strong agreement (R2 > 0.82 for [15O]H2O and R2 > 0.83 for [18F]FDG), while motion correction had little impact on parameter estimates (R2 > 0.83 for [15O]H2O and R2 > 0.88 for [18F]FDG) compared with uncorrected data.

Our group has previously developed a local ancestry informed generalized linear model based method, Tractor, for GWAS in admixed samples, which produces accurate ancestry-specific effect sizes and boosts discovery power to identify ancestry-enriched loci. Tractor has been instrumental for elucidating the genetic architecture of complex traits across admixed cohorts, however it operates under an assumption of unrelated samples. As biobanks and other large-scale data sources continue to grow, increasing numbers of closely or cryptically related admixed samples are included. This brings new statistical challenges in conducting GWAS and motivates the timely development of novel tools that can model admixture in various cohort settings. Here, we propose a novel mixed model method, Tractor-Mix, that allows for well-calibrated association studies in datasets containing admixed samples with high degrees of relatedness. Similar to Tractor, our method conducts genetic association tests by leveraging local ancestry to produce more accurate effect sizes and boost power under heterogeneity while effectively controlling false positives. Extensive simulations show this enhanced method is competitive with other state-of-the-art approaches that do not produce ancestry-specific results. Empirical testing of Tractor-Mix on multiple cohorts, including admixed samples from the UK Biobank and Mexico City Prospective Study, highlight the value of the method, identifying ancestry-specific associations. In summary, Tractor-Mix is a powerful association framework that extends the capabilities of current models and will facilitate the inclusion of admixed samples in large-scale GWAS.","NA","medrxiv",1749679769830

While there are hundreds of diverse GPCRs, only two {beta}-arrestin isoforms ({beta}arrs) must recognize and engage this wide range of receptors with varied phosphorylation patterns. Traditional models suggest that {beta}arr activation requires displacement of its autoinhibitory C-tail by a phosphorylated GPCR C-terminus; however, this paradigm fails to explain how minimally phosphorylated GPCRs still complex with {beta}arrs. Using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer imaging and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we observe basal dynamics in which the {beta}arr1 C-tail spontaneously releases from the N-domain, transiently adopting an active conformation that can facilitate binding of the phosphorylated GPCR C-terminus. We further demonstrate the importance of an intermediate state of {beta}arr1 arising from spontaneous C-tail release stabilized by the membrane phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2. Both PI(4,5)P2 and mutations in the proximal or middle regions of the C-tail shift {beta}arr1 towards a partially released state, revealing an allosteric connection that informs a refined model for {beta}arr activation. In this model, membrane engagement conformationally primes {beta}arrs prior to receptor binding, thereby explaining how {beta}arrs are recruited by diverse GPCRs, even those with limited C-terminal phosphorylation.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

Using yeast communities in apple orchards as a model system, we tested whether local adaptation of a dominant species affects community composition and performance through reciprocal transplant experiments across eight Connecticut orchards and three apple varieties. The dominant yeast Hanseniaspora uvarum varied dramatically in abundance (4.3-97.5%) and exhibited significant local adaptation and maladaptation patterns across orchard-variety combinations. Critically, H. uvarum local adaptation strongly predicted community composition: locally adapted populations achieved higher abundance while suppressing competitors. However, local adaptation had no effect on community-level performance in apple decomposition. Communities dominated by locally adapted H. uvarum performed equivalently to diverse assemblages, indicating functional redundancy among species. These results demonstrate that rapid evolutionary change can decouple community composition from performance, suggesting that functional redundancy can maintain community performance despite dramatic compositional shifts driven by local adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

Detection at diagnosis often signals poor prognosis, but it can also enable opportunities for treatment with highly effective targeted therapies. Predicting the likelihood that a patient will acquire these driver alterations in the future using a genomic test represents an opportunity to realise the benefits of interventions earlier, potentially with preventative intent. Here, we present a forecasting framework that takes as input a DNA copy number profile and predicts whether the tumour will acquire an oncogene amplification or tumour suppressor deletion in the future. This framework leverages mutation rate estimates from the input tumour, alongside gene-specific selection coefficients derived from a large cohort of 7,880 tumours. We demonstrate feasibility using 7,042 single-time-point samples and longitudinally collected tumour pairs from 44 prostate and 100 lung cancers, identifying tumours that went on to acquire amplifications at a later time point with an average AUC of 0.87. We show potential clinical utility by forecasting poor prognosis in low-grade gliomas via CDK4/PDGFRA amplification or CDKN2A deletion, and osimertinib resistance in lung cancers via MET amplification. This study serves as a proof-of-concept for a new class of biomarker, wherein selective pressures and mutation-generating processes can be harnessed to anticipate future genomic alterations.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

Here, we introduce spatial ISOform sequencing (Spl-ISO-Seq), which reveals exons and polyadenylation sites from long reads with near-single-cell resolution. Spl-ISO-Seq selects long cDNAs and doubles to triples read lengths compared to standard preparations. Adding a highly specific software tool (Spl-ISOquant) and comparing human post-mortem pre-puberty samples of the visual cortex (8-11 years) to post-puberty samples (16-19 years), we find that cortical layers harbor stronger splicing and poly(A)-site regulation than the adjacent white matter, with enrichment of multiple protein-domain types. For oligodendrocytes however, developmental splicing changes are stronger in white matter. Among cortical layers, layer 4 has the most developmental changes in alternative-exon inclusion in excitatory neurons and in poly(A) sites. We also find many repeat elements, especially ERV1 long terminal repeats downstream of developmentally-regulated layer 4 exons. Overall, alternative splicing changes are linked to synapses -- specifically at the post-synapse. Age-linked splicing changes in layers 1-3 and 4 are associated with autism spectrum disorder but not with schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. These results root developmental splicing changes during puberty and the resulting protein changes in specific layers and cell types. More generally, our new technologies enable new observations for any complex tissue.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

However, the nature of these computations remains unclear. Current models disagree on two fundamental questions: what stopping-rule is applied to post-choice evidence sampling and to what degree do choice and confidence reports rely on shared versus distinct evidence accumulation processes? These models have proven difficult to dissociate because they often make similar behavioural predictions. Therefore, we used a neurally-informed modelling approach to jointly model initial choices and subsequent confidence reports while leveraging the additional constraints offered by human electrophysiological signatures of evidence accumulation. Participants made self-paced confidence reports after indicating perceptual choices on a random dot motion task, with stimulus presentation continuing during the interval between these responses. Model comparison showed that boundary-based stopping rules provided superior fits to the behavioural data than time-based stopping rules, as the latter could not account for relationships between confidence and confidence-RT. The behavioural fits were inconclusive when comparing models with a single evidence accumulation process dictating choices and confidence reports compared to models invoking a distinct post-choice process. However, the single-process model markedly outperformed the other models in terms of its ability to recapitulate the observed neural evidence accumulation patterns associated with choice confidence. Our study thus demonstrates that choice behaviour, subjective confidence, and associated neural decision signals can be jointly explained by a model invoking a single process of evidence accumulation with separate boundaries for the initial choice and subsequent confidence reports.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

This study aimed to investigate these effects using a porcine model. Experimental Approach: Naive and anti-PEG antibody-sensitized pigs were intravenously injected with Comirnaty. Acute anaphylactic responses were assessed through hemodynamic monitoring, hematological changes, and plasma inflammatory markers. Multiorgan inflammatory effects were evaluated by qPCR detection of spike protein (SP) mRNA uptake and inflammatory cytokine gene expression in seven organs over 6 hours. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry were also performed. Key Results: Severe cardiopulmonary distress developed within minutes of repeated i.v. injections of Comirnaty. qPCR revealed predominant SP mRNA accumulation in liver and PBMCs, with spleen, kidney, lymph nodes, heart, and brain also affected in 40-90% of animals. Repetitive PBMC transfection showed reversible mRNA peaks at 15 minutes, followed by rapid decay. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1RA, CXCL10, TNF-alpha, CCL2) paralleled mRNA uptake, suggesting a causal relationship. Cytokine profiles varied by organ (e.g. IL-1RA in kidney, CCL2 in PBMCs). Histologic abnormalities and SP immunopositivity were noted in the kidney, heart, and brain. Booster injections replicated PBMC transfection kinetics observed at the first dose. Conclusions and Implications: This porcine model reveals systemic anaphylactic reactivity and multiorgan SP mRNA transfection following i.v. injection of mRNA-LNPs, resulting in organ-specific inflammatory responses. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the rare vaccine-related AEs and may support future efforts to improve the safety of the mRNA-LNP platform technology.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

Here, we combine single-cell analysis with long-read nanopore sequencing to capture full-length RNA isoforms and uncover temporal changes in RNA transcription, processing, and alternative splicing in the aging mouse cortex and hippocampus. By profiling transcriptomes from young adult to very old mice, we identify non-linear, cell-type-specific isoform expression changes and isoform usage shifts, primarily driven by transcription start site selection. These aging-associated isoform changes alter the coding potential and poly(A) site position of genes. Our data also reveal a high proportion of senescence in immune cells, far exceeding that of other cell types. We also identify isoform markers that, when applied to a machine learning model, distinguish senescent from normal immune cells. This study provides a full-length RNA isoform-based atlas of the aging mouse brain, offering insights into RNA metabolism remodeling across brain cell types throughout the lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

We conducted a randomized controlled trial (n=70 clinicians) to evaluate the value of employing a custom GPT system designed to engage collaboratively with clinicians on diagnostic reasoning challenges. The collaborative design began with independent diagnostic assessments from both the clinician and the AI. These were then combined in an AI-generated synthesis that integrated the two perspectives, highlighting points of agreement and disagreement and offering commentary on each. We evaluated two workflow variants: one where the AI provided an initial opinion (AI-first), and another where it followed the clinicians assessment (AI-second). Clinicians using either collaborative workflow outperformed those using traditional tools, achieving average accuracies of 85% (AI-first) and 82% (AI-second), compared to 75% with traditional resources (p < 0.0004 and p < 0.00001; mean differences = 9.8% and 6.8%; 95% CI = 4.6%-15% and 4.0%-9.6%).

Emerging evidence increasingly indicates that astrocytes are also involved in nervous system disorders, including addiction, but the cocaine-induced astrocyte-specific transcriptome has not yet been investigated. We utilized whole cell sorting of astrocytes, RNA-sequencing, and bioinformatic approaches to characterize the astrocyte transcriptome in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain region involved in reward-processing, following cocaine self-administration, prolonged abstinence, and ""relapse"" in male mice. We found that astrocytes exhibit robust and contextually-specific transcriptional signatures that converge strongly with human cocaine use disorder. Bioinformatic analysis revealed CREB as a highly ranked predicted upstream regulator of cocaine-induced transcriptional regulation in NAc astrocytes, and CUT&RUN-sequencing mapped increased CREB binding across the astrocyte genome in response to cocaine. Viral-mediated manipulation of CREB activity selectively in NAc astrocytes, in combination with several measures of addiction-related behaviors including conditioned place preference and self-administration, revealed that astrocytic CREB increases the rewarding and reinforcing properties of cocaine. This effect is sex-specific, with no change in astrocytic CREB activity or CPP found in females. Subsequent experiments identify potential molecular mechanisms of astrocytic CREBs influence through modulating astrocytic Ca2+ signaling in response to cocaine. Finally, we show that astrocytic CREB selectively modulates D1-type medium spiny neurons in NAc to control cocaine-related behaviors. Together, these data demonstrate that the astrocyte transcriptome responds robustly to cocaine and that CREB mediates cocaines effects on gene expression in astrocytes, with consequent effects on neuronal activity and rewarding responses to the drug.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

Cyclic peptides offer greater stability and potential oral delivery, but their de novo design with computational methods as agonists is unproven. Here, we used the EvoBind AI platform to design cyclic peptide agonists for GCGR from sequence alone, without any structural templates or prior binding site information. EvoBind consistently identified the receptors activation surface, producing peptides that also activated GLP1R. Of three synthesised peptides, two showed potent dual activation of GCGR and GLP1R in cAMP assays, while all three activate GLP1R, with the 18-residue design achieving EC50 values of 32 nM (GLP1R) and 542 nM (GCGR), rivalling natural hormones. The designed sequences show no similarity to known agonists, and structural modelling indicates that they adopt novel binding modes compatible with active-state stabilisation. This is made possible by EvoBinds purely sequence-based, template-free approach, which enables the discovery of alternative solutions that are inaccessible to structure-guided methods. This study presents the first successful blind de novo design of a cyclic peptide agonist for a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), using only the receptor sequence as input. The findings highlight EvoBinds capacity to go beyond static binding, offering a generalisable strategy for therapeutic discovery through target-agnostic, sequence-driven peptide design.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

Each sense organ is composed of two glial cells, called the sheath and socket, and one or more neurons. A major challenge in studying their development has been the lack of methods to directly observe these structures in the embryo. Here, we mine a recently published high-resolution ultrastructural dataset of a comma-stage embryo that provides an untapped resource for visualizing early developmental events. From this dataset we reconstructed all head sense organs (two amphid (AM), four cephalic (CEP), six inner labial (IL), four outer labial quadrant (OLQ), and two outer labial lateral (OLL)). Symmetric sense organs were at different stages of morphogenesis, allowing us to infer developmental steps by which they form. First, we found that the sheath glial cell begins wrapping its partner neurons at the distal tip of the dendrites where it self-fuses into a seamless tube and then ""zippers"" down the dendrite. In many cases, sheath glia wrap the progenitors of partner neurons prior to their terminal division. After sheath wrapping has begun, the socket glia wraps the sheath glia circumferentially before presumably elongating to form the mature sheath-socket channel. We also observed transient interactions not found in the mature animal, such as amphid sheath glia wrapping the AUA neuron, that may reflect ancestral relationships. This study demonstrates the value of large public EM datasets that can be mined for new insights, and sheds light on how neurons and glia undergo coordinated morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

In mammals, the menthol receptor, TRPM8, is activated by temperatures below [~]26{degrees}C and is essential for the perception of cold or chemical cooling agents 4-6. A fascinating, yet still unachieved goal is to elucidate structural mechanisms whereby TRPM8 or other thermosensitive channels are gated by changes in ambient temperature. Recent studies using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have attempted to address this challenging question but are limited by difficulties in visualizing temperature-evoked conformational substates or assessing the energetic landscape governing gating transitions 7,8. Here, we close this gap by using cryo-EM to visualize TRPM8 channels in cellular membranes, where bona fide menthol- and cold-evoked open states are captured. We identify a novel  semi-swapped architecture in which interdigitation of channel subunits is substantially rearranged following repositioning of the S6 transmembrane helix and elements of the pore region. By combining this structural analysis with thermodynamic measurements using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we are able to pinpoint the pore and TRP helices as key regions undergoing stimulus-evoked conformational dynamics that drive channel gating. Structural mechanisms associated with activation are validated by comparison of human TRPM8 with the menthol-sensitive, but relatively cold-insensitive avian orthologue. We propose a free energy landscape to explain channel gating by cold or cooling agents.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

Mutations and certain post-translational modifications impact its aggregation propensity and pathogenicity. Glycation, a non-enzymatic modification enhanced during hyperglycemia and aging, both known risk factors for PD, has been implicated in -Syn pathology. Although preformed -Syn-fibrils induce PD-like phenotypes in mice, the impact of glycation on their pathogenicity is unclear. In the current study, we glycated -Syn using methylglyoxal (MGO), a potent glycating agent, resulting in altered biophysical characteristics in comparison to non-glycated -Syn. Glycation inhibited the formation of typical beta sheet structures under aggregating conditions. Despite that, glycated -Syn assemblies induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation to a similar extent as the non-glycated -Syn fibrils upon their injection in the mouse substantia nigra (SN). However, these glycated assemblies triggered higher neuroinflammation and increased accumulation of receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) compared to non-glycated fibrils. Consequently, an earlier onset of neuromuscular deficits and anxiety was observed in these mice. Thus, glycation of -Syn causes distinct PD-associated pathology compared to non-glycated -Syn, causing an earlier onset of motor symptoms. These findings provide insight into how glycation of -Syn due to hyperglycemia may contribute to an increased risk of PD in diabetic populations.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

The relationship between the dynamics of Wnt signaling and specification of AP coordinates is difficult to study in mammalian embryos due to the inaccessibility of developing embryos and the difficulty of live imaging. Here, we developed an in vitro model of human neuroectoderm patterning, where the anterior-posterior axis self-organizes along the radius of a micropatterned human pluripotent stem cell colony. We used this system to study the quantitative relationship between Wnt signaling in space and time and the resulting AP patterns. We found that rather than a smoothly varying gradient along the axis, signaling is elevated in midbrain compared to either surrounding region. The timing, rather than the amplitude or duration, of the Wnt response played the most important role in setting axial coordinates. These results establish a simple system for studying the patterning of the human nervous system and elucidate how cells interpret Wnt dynamics to determine their position along the AP axis.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

They are characterized by extensive genetic heterogeneity, possibly the highest among all human genetic diseases, as well as diverse inheritance patterns. Despite advances in gene discovery, limited understanding of gene function and challenges in accurately interpreting variants continue to hinder both molecular diagnosis and genetic research in IRDs. One key problem is the absence of a comprehensive and widely accepted catalogue of disease genes, which would ensure consistent genetic testing and reliable molecular diagnoses. With the rapid pace of IRD gene discovery, gene catalogues require frequent validation and updates to remain clinically and scientifically useful.

We describe a novel mechanism whereby JIP4 regulates lysosomal cystine storage by controlling the abundance of cystinosin (CTNS), the transporter responsible for lysosomal cystine efflux. To this end, JIP4, previously characterized as a motor adaptor and kinase signaling scaffold, suppresses TMEM55B-dependent ubiquitylation of CTNS. Loss of JIP4 reduces CTNS protein levels, leading to lysosomal cystine accumulation and lysosomal storage defects that phenocopy loss of CTNS in both human cells and the renal proximal tubules of JIP4 knockout mice. These phenotypes mirror cystinosis, the lysosomal storage disease caused by CTNS loss-of-function. Our findings thus reveal a fundamental process that controls the efflux of lysosomal cystine and has relevance to understanding human disease arising from JIP4 mutations.","NA","biorxiv",1749679769830

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract.

Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo-Dropout CNN (MCD-CNN), as well as a few-shot learning approach to address dataset size limitations. Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1749679769830

We demonstrate the real world implications of the use of testing and evaluate adverse events and outcomes in individuals who did not receive pharmacogenomic testing for clopidogrel.

MethodsWe analyzed ~100K individuals with paired EHR and exome sequencing data from population health studies administered at multiple medical centers using the Helix Exome+(R) assay. We inferred clopidogrel dosage by processing the prescription with an LLM. We identified all instances of individuals with at least one prescription that is not in concordance with their CYP2C19 genotype. Lastly, we identify instances of thrombosis using a comprehensive codeset based on ICD9, ICD10, and SNOMED terms.

ResultsWe identified 16,140 prescriptions of clopidogrel given to 3,853 participants. We found that 29% of these individuals have a mismatch between the recommended clopidogrel dosage guideline based on their CYP2C19 genotype and their actual prescribed daily dosage. 25% of poor metabolizers experienced thrombosis, with 40% occurring within 2 months of treatment. Poor and intermediate metabolizers receiving clopidogrel are much more likely to experience thrombosis and myocardial infarction (binomial p-value = 0.001).

ConclusionsWe estimate a 38% excess of adverse events occur in poor and intermediate metabolizers relative to normal and rapid metabolizers. The lack of testing may be responsible for 1 thrombosis event per every ~30 people prescribed clopidogrel.","NA","medrxiv",1749679769830

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.
