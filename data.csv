Remote sensing technologies such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) now enable the 3D mapping of entire landscapes. However, we lack the large, harmonized and geographically representative ALS collections needed to build a global picture of woody ecosystem structure. To address this challenge, we developed the Global Canopy Atlas (GCA): 3,458 standardized and analysis-ready maps of canopy height and elevation at 1 m2 resolution derived from high-resolution ALS acquisitions. The GCA covers 56,554 km2 across all major biomes. Of its acquisitions 19% of have been scanned multiple times and 87% are publicly available, covering 95% of the total area. To showcase its wide range of applications, we applied the GCA in three case studies. First, we validated three global satellite-derived canopy height maps, finding poor performance at native resolution (1-30 m, R2 < 0.38) and moderate performance at 250 m resolution (R2 < 0.65). Second, analyzing global patterns in canopy gap size frequency we discovered an unexpectedly large variation of power law exponents from branch to stand level ( = 1.52 to 2.38), pointing to fundamental scale-dependencies of forest structure. Third, we developed a framework to standardize forest turnover quantification from multi-temporal ALS. Applied to repeat acquisitions in a temperate forest in North America, it revealed that 21% of canopy gaps closed within 12 years of opening and would thus be missed by infrequent monitoring. As demonstrated by these case studies, the GCA provides a novel data source for ecologists, foresters, remote sensing scientists and the ecosystem modelling community that substantially advances our ability to understand the structure and dynamics of woody ecosystems at global scales.","[{""name"":""Leverhulme

Elucidating MHC-I-independent immune recognition mechanisms is therefore crucial for enhancing treatment responses and improving clinical outcomes in a greater number of patients. Leveraging single cell approaches, we discovered {gamma}{delta} T cell infiltration in biospecimens from patients with SCLC. Despite PD-1 expression, {gamma}{delta} T cells maintained a cytotoxic transcriptional profile, suggestive of an anti-tumor role. Indeed, high {gamma}{delta} T cell infiltration predicted improved response to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy in patients with SCLC. Moreover, using pre-clinical models, we demonstrated that {gamma}{delta} T cells are effective at tarlatamab (DLL3-CD3 BiTE) redirected SCLC killing and that zoledronate, an FDA-approved compound, can sensitize SCLC cells to {gamma}{delta} T cell-mediated killing. Thus, our findings suggest that engaged {gamma}{delta} T cells are potentially valuable targets for SCLC therapy.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757196426791

However, the resulting signals are vulnerable to multiple sources of noise, such as those related to non-neuronal physiological fluctuations and head motion, which can alter FC estimates and influence their associations with behavioral outcomes. The best strategy for acquiring and processing rsfMRI data to mitigate noise remains an open question. In this study of 358 healthy individuals, we compared the denoising efficacy of 60 multi-echo (ME) and 30 single-echo (SE) rsfMRI preprocessing pipelines across six distinct measures of data quality. We also evaluated how each pipeline influences the effect sizes of FC-based predictive models of personality and cognitive measures estimated via cross-validated kernel ridge regression. We found that ME pipelines generally showed superior denoising efficacy to SE pipelines, but that no single pipeline was associated with both superior denoising efficacy and behavioural prediction. Using a heuristic scheme to rank pipelines across benchmark evaluations, we found that an ME acquisition combined with Automatic Removal of Motion Artifacts Independent Component Analysis (ICA-AROMA) and Regressor Interpolation at Progressive Time Delays (RIPTiDe) offered a reasonable compromise between denoising efficacy and brain-behavior predictions for both ME and SE data. In general, ME pipelines ranked more highly than SE pipelines. These findings support the use of ME acquisitions in future work but suggest that no single denoising pipeline should be considered optimal for all purposes.","[{""name"":""Australian Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mmh0f86"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FL220100184;""},{""name"":""National Health and Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/011kf5r70"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1197431;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757196426791

By contrast, epithelial cells can utilize an imbalance in contractile force to communicate various information to induce tissue-wide response as in wound healing. Contractility is generated and processed at the apical junctional complex (AJC) by the dynamic behavior of the actin cytoskeleton. Calcium signaling can pattern cellular responses based on its reach and amplitude and the actin cytoskeleton is supported by its wide ranging effects on actin regulators. Calcium transients regulate various cell behaviors associated with actin remodeling, such as in damage response and developmental morphogenesis. Here we report that calcium maintains an adaptive pool of AJC-associated actin that is sensitive to tension and encoded by calcium dynamics. For this, the recently identified epithelial polarity module Homer-MUPP1/PatJ is required. Homer regulates calcium signaling in various tissue contexts through interaction with numerous components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) calcium signal toolkit. Knockout of either Homer or MUPP1/PatJ attenuated tension-induced calcium response and severely disrupted wound healing migration, which is dependent on guidance input through AJC tension. We also show that Homer is integral to early embryonic neurodevelopment as its suppression causes failure of neural tube closure. Our findings highlight the critical role of localized calcium dynamics on AJC actin remodeling and cellular behavior, elucidating the means of tissue coordination through intercellular tension.","[{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JP25H01325;JP25H00994;JP23KJ1689;JP22K06225;""},{""name"":""Japan Science and Technology Agency"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00097mb19"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JPMJFR204L;""},{""name"":""Takeda Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02y123g31"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Toyota Physical and Chemical Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03q75vf28"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757196426791

Here, we constructed robust maximum likelihood phylogenies of full-length BBX proteins, the B-box domain, and the CCT domains by using diverse plant species ranging from algae to eudicots and monocots. Our analysis resolved five major structural groups (I - V) with BBXs from algae at the root of major clades. Our results suggest that Group II emerged after the split between Chlorophytes and Streptophytes. Our results also highlight subgroupings in the different BBXs clades. The evolution of the B-box domains showed a dynamic domain losses and acquisitions overall correlating with the BBX phylogeny. While the CCT domain was overall highly conserved across all groups, we identified secondary loss of the CCT domain in select lineages. We also detected significant expansions and contractions among angiosperm BBX orthogroups. Overall, the BBX family demonstrates ancient origins, structural plasticity via domain gain, loss and duplication, and lineage-specific innovations that underpin their diverse roles in light signaling, development and stress responses.","[{""name"":""China Scholarship Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04atp4p48"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""201606180057;""},{""name"":""Biology Centre CAS, Institute for Plant Molecular Biology"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Startup Funding for MW;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757196426791

Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.

We have previously shown that the transcription factor ADNP forms the ChAHP complex with the chromatin remodeler CHD4 and HP1 proteins, acting as a site-specific regulator of transcription and antagonist of CTCF binding. However, the molecular basis of these functions remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the CHD4 subunit is essential to antagonize CTCF and silence transcription of transposons, while HP1 proteins are dispensable. Although the remodeling activity of CHD4 is not required for ChAHP chromatin association, it is critical for both transposon repression and CTCF antagonism. Our findings support a model wherein ADNP recruits chromatin remodeling activity in a sequence-specific manner, enabling transcriptional control and local modulation of chromatin architecture.","[{""name"":""Novartis Research Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""n.a.;""},{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""grant 310030_188835;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757196426791

The physical principles guiding this centromere positioning remain unknown. Here, we reveal that human core centromeres are directed to the chromatin surface by repulsion of centromere-associated proteins - independent of condensin-mediated loop extrusion and microtubule engagement. Using cellular perturbations, biochemical reconstitution, and multiscale molecular dynamics simulations, we show that chromatin surface localisation emerges from repulsion between condensed chromatin and both the kinetochore and the highly negatively charged centromere protein, CENP-B. Together, these elements form a centromeric region composed of two domains with opposing affinities, one favouring integration within the mitotic chromosome and the other favouring exposure to the surrounding cytoplasm, thereby driving surface positioning. Tethering synthetic negatively charged proteins to chromatin was sufficient to recapitulate this surface localisation in cells and in vitro, indicating that electrostatic repulsion is a key determinant of surface localisation. These findings demonstrate that centromere layering is not hardwired by chromatin folding patterns but instead emerges from phase separation in chromatin. Our work uncovers electrostatic polarity as a general and programmable mechanism to spatially organise chromatin.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757196426791

Here, we demonstrate that prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus promoted lung tumor progression by reprogramming the local immune landscape. Retrospective clinical analysis revealed that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 exhibited increased lung cancer incidence. Using multiple murine lung cancer models, we show that prior severe respiratory viral infections accelerated tumor growth and reduced survival. Mechanistically, prior viral pneumonia epigenetically remodeled the lung to establish a pro-tumor microenvironment, including the local accumulation of SiglecFhi tumor-associated neutrophils, a transcriptionally reprogrammed, immunosuppressive population whose signature predicted poor prognosis in human lung adenocarcinoma. In parallel, epithelial compartments exhibited altered differentiation trajectories, with persistence of injury-associated alveolar intermediates positioned along tumorigenic lineages. We observe sustained chromatin remodeling at key cytokine loci in immune and structure cells, linking inflammatory memory to persistent immune suppression. Therapeutically, combined inhibition of neutrophil recruitment via CXCR2 and PD-L1 signaling restored CD8 T cell infiltration and suppressed tumor growth. Together, our findings establish a direct causal relationship between viral pneumonia, including COVID-19, and lung tumorigenesis, highlighting the urgent need to monitor survivors for elevated cancer risk and to develop targeted interventions and therapies aimed at preventing potential cancer bursts in COVID-19 convalescents.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AI147394, AG069264, AI112844, HL170961, AI176171 and AG090337;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757196426791

Coadaptation within the ""Molassodon"" ecospecies of Vibrio parahaemolyticus is concentrated in 48 core genes and over 100 accessory genes on an otherwise undifferentiated genetic background. Using this list of adaptive differences as a foundation for laboratory experiments, we find that the ecological strategy of the ecospecies is to hunt, kill and devour bacterial prey in viscous liquids. Instead of swarming on surfaces, Molassodon strains have differentiated and repurposed their lateral flagella to enhance swimming. We functionally link Type VI secretion and nutrient uptake to this motility phenotype and reconstruct the evolution of Molassodon, showing that several key genes have been imported from other Vibrio species. Our analysis confirms the functional coherence of bacterial ecospecies and provides a window into adaptation for environmental microbes, where characterizing relevant microhabitats and evolutionary strategies remains a challenge.","[{""name"":""National Natural Science Foundation of China"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h0zpd94"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""32250610209;92478118;32270064;32270003;32350710791;""},{""name"":""Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""24ZR1493200;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757196426791

Based on the number of formants, two different coda quality categories have been described: a-codas and i-codas. In the present paper, we demonstrate that sperm whale codas not only resemble human vowels acoustically, but also pattern like them across several dimensions. First, traditional count- and timing-based coda types interact with coda ""vowel"" quality (a vs. i). Second, a-codas are generally longer than i-codas. Third, the duration of i-codas has a bimodal distribution, showing a contrast between short i-codas and long[i] -codas. Fourth, the baseline coda length differs across whales. And fifth, edge clicks mismatching their coda often match an adjacent coda, a phenomenon that resembles human coarticulation. All five properties have close parallels in the phonetics and phonology of human languages. Sperm whale coda vocalizations thus represent one of the closest parallels to human phonology of any known animal communication system.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSperm whales communicate using series of clicks known as codas. The codas acoustically resemble human vowels. In addition, they pattern in ways similar to human sound systems. For example, different coda types are correlated with particular click qualities, and their durations are intentionally controlled. This shows that sperm whale vocalizations are highly complex and likely constitute one of the most sophisticated communication systems in the animal kingdom. By studying it, we may be able to gain a broader understanding of animal intelligence and social behaviors, determine the impact of human activities on whale habitat, develop strategies to protect whales from threats such as noise pollution and ship traffic, and advance legislation which facilitates that protection.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757196426791
