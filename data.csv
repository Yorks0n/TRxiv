Our results revealed that ~2/3 of dire wolf ancestry is derived from a lineage sister to the clade comprising the gray wolf, coyote, and dhole, and the remaining ~1/3 from a lineage near the base of Canini diversity. We identified 80 genes evolving under diversifying selection in dire wolves. Our results underscore the power of paleogenomes to resolve long-standing taxonomic questions and contribute to growing evidence of the role of post-speciation gene flow as an evolutionary force.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710749

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1744495710749

To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1744495710749

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1744495710749

RNU4-2 is a non-protein-coding gene that is transcribed into the U4 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of the major spliceosome. ReNU syndrome variants disrupt spliceosome function and alter 5' splice site selection. Here, we performed saturation genome editing (SGE) of RNU4-2 to identify the functional and clinical impact of variants across the entire gene. The resulting SGE function scores, derived from variants' effects on cell fitness, discriminate ReNU syndrome variants from those observed in the population and dramatically outperform in silico variant effect prediction. Using these data, we redefine the ReNU syndrome critical region at single nucleotide resolution, resolve variant pathogenicity for variants of uncertain significance, and show that SGE function scores delineate variants by phenotypic severity. Further, we identify variants impacting function in regions of RNU4-2 that are critical for interactions with other spliceosome components. We show that these variants cause a novel recessive NDD that is clinically distinct from ReNU syndrome. Together, this work defines the landscape of variant function across RNU4-2, providing critical insights for both diagnosis and therapeutic development.","NA","medrxiv",1744495710749

Using Sex-lethal (Sxl)-mediated translation repression of msl-2 in female fly dosage compensation as a model system, we show that different mechanisms in mRNP assembly synergistically achieve tight translation repression. Using multi-color single-molecule fluorescence microscopy we show that 1) Sxl targets its binding sites via sliding and double-binding, 2) that Unr recruitment is accelerated over 500-fold by RNA-bound Sxl and 3) that Hrp48 further stabilizes RNA-bound Sxl indirectly via ATP-independent RNA remodeling.

Here, we identify key neurochemical and cellular asymmetries that underpin cortical lateralization. Specifically, we demonstrate lateralized gradients in neurotransmitter receptor densities, particularly along the acetylcholine-norepinephrine axis, as well as asymmetries in mitochondrial distribution and the spatial prevalence of microglia and glutamatergic excitatory neurons. Using a multimodal approach that integrates in vivo functional MRI, PET imaging, and post-mortem transcriptomic and cellular data, we delineate two distinct cortical clusters: a left-lateralized network centered on language processing and a right-lateralized network supporting visuospatial attention.

Highly active enzymes have been designed starting from such descriptions using the generative AI method RFdiffusion, but there are two current methodological limitations. First, the geometry of the active site can only be specified at the residue level, so for each catalytic residue functional group placed around the reaction transition state, the possible locations of the residue backbone must be enumerated by building side chain rotamers back from the functional group. Second, the location of the catalytic residues along the sequence must be specified in advance, which considerably limits the space of solutions which can be sampled. Here we describe a new deep generative method, RoseTTAFold diffusion 2 (RFdiffusion2), that solves both problems, enabling enzymes to be designed from sequence agnostic descriptions of functional group locations without inverse rotamer generation. We first evaluate RFdiffusion2 on an in silico enzyme design benchmark of 41 diverse active sites and find that it is able to successfully build proteins scaffolding all 41 sites, compared to 16/41 with prior state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Next, we design enzymes around three diverse catalytic sites and characterize the designs experimentally; in each case we identify active catalysts in testing less than 96 sequences. RFdiffusion2 demonstrates the potential of atomic resolution generative models for the design of de novo enzymes directly from their reaction mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710749

Disrupting this interaction or binding an activating SLiM dislocates the TPR shoulder, freeing the motor domains and promoting transition between its closed, inactive, and open states.

A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

To address this gap, we developed Altair-LSFM, a high-resolution, open-source, sample-scanning light-sheet microscope specifically designed for sub-cellular imaging. By optimizing the optical pathway in silico, we created a custom baseplate with precisely positioned dowel pins to simplify alignment and assembly. The system integrates streamlined optoelectronics and optomechanics with seamless operation through our open-source software, navigate. Altair-LSFM achieves lateral and axial resolutions of approximately 235 nm and 350 nm, respectively, across a 266-micron field of view after deconvolution.

Many recent studies have quantified their adverse events with a focus on gastrointestinal adverse events. However, no large epidemiologic study has investigated the risk of hair loss with these medications. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of hair loss. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone. The adjusted hazard ratio for hair loss for all patients using semaglutide, for men, and for women compared to bupropion-naltrexone were 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.86-2.69), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.05-14.49), and 2.08 (95% CI: 1.17-3.72) respectively.

A protein destined for degradation is first tagged with a polyubiquitin chain, which is selected by the proteasome. Different ubiquitin chain topologies serve as distinct signals, with K48-linked chains acting as the canonical degradation signal and K11/K48-branched chains providing even more potent targeting, particularly during cell cycle regulation. However, the structural basis for how the proteasome distinguishes between these different chain architectures has remained unclear. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the human 26S proteasome bound to both a K48-linked tetraubiquitin chain and a K11/K48-branched chain. Our structures reveal distinct binding modes for these two types of chain linkage. K48 chains wrap around the Ubiquitin interaction motif of the receptor RPN10 in an unexpected spiral conformation, while K11 branches engage the proteasome through previously uncharacterised interfaces in a cleft formed between RPN2 and RPN10. Through structure-guided mutagenesis and cellular studies, we demonstrate that these binding modes are essential for efficient substrate degradation and cell cycle progression. These findings establish how the proteasome achieves selective substrate recognition through chain topology-specific interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710749

Depending on cell state, cell type, and cell fate, a cell's mitochondrial phenotype might range from relatively isolated mitochondrial segments to complex branching networks, and from stationary mitochondria to highly motile structures. While isolated mitochondrial phenotypes have been described for a subset of cell states, types, and fates, an integrated map of how mitochondrial phenotypes change over the full course of tissue development has so far been lacking. Here, we identify the mitochondrial phenotypes that appear throughout the course of lung and intestinal epithelial development from stem cells to differentiated tissue. Using human stem cell-derived intestinal and branching lung organoids that mimic developing human organs as model systems, we extract and analyze key mitochondrial biophysical phenotypes in human development. To achieve this, we employ lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM), which enables high-resolution, 4D (x, y, z, time) imaging of mitochondria in organoid tissues with minimal damage to the sample. We image at key developmental time points from stem cell differentiation into mature organoid tissue. For data processing, we utilize the MitoGraph and MitoTNT software packages along with our developed custom computational tools. These tools allow for automated 4D organoid to single cell image processing and quantitative 4D single cell mitochondrial temporal network tracking. This work represents the first 4D high spatiotemporal-resolution quantification of live human organoid tissues at the single-cell level through development. We identified distinct mitochondrial phenotypes unique to each organoid type and found correlations between mitochondrial phenotypes, cellular age, and cell type. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mitochondrial network characteristics can predict both organoid type and cell age. Our findings reveal fundamental aspects of mitochondrial biology that were previously unobservable, offering new insights into cell-type-specific mitochondrial dynamics and enabling new findings in relevant human model systems. We believe that our findings and methods will be essential for advancing 4D cell biology, providing a powerful framework for characterizing organelles in organoid tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710749

A hallmark of the co-translational folding (coTF) of many proteins are highly stable folding intermediates that are absent or only transiently populated off the ribosome, yet persist during translation well-beyond complete emergence of the domain from the ribosome exit tunnel. Intermediates are important for folding fidelity; however, their structures have remained elusive. Here, we have structurally characterised two coTF intermediates of an immunoglobulin-like domain by developing comprehensive 19F NMR analyses using chemical shifts, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), and protein engineering. We integrated these experimental data with extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to obtain atomistic structures of the folding intermediates on the ribosome. The resulting structures are distinguished by native-like folds initiated from either their N- or C-termini, and reveal multiple parallel folding pathways, which are structurally conserved within the protein domain family, in contrast to their in vitro refolding mechanisms. By redirecting proteins to fold along hierarchical, parallel routes, the ribosome may promote efficient folding by avoiding kinetic traps, and regulate nascent chain assembly and targeting by auxiliary factors to maintain cellular proteostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710749

An essential transmembrane beta-barrel protein, LptD, and a cognate lipoprotein, LptE, translocate LPS selectively into the OM external leaflet via a poorly understood mechanism. Here, we characterize two additional translocon subunits, the lipoproteins LptM and LptY (formerly YedD). We use single-particle cryo-EM analysis, functional assays and molecular dynamics simulations to visualize the roles of LptM and LptY at the translocon holo-complex LptDEMY, uncovering their impact on LptD conformational dynamics. Whereas LptY binds and stabilizes the periplasmic LptD beta-taco domain that functions as LPS receptor, LptM intercalates the lateral gate of the beta-barrel domain, promoting its opening and access by LPS. Remarkably, we demonstrate a conformational switch of the LptD beta-taco/beta-barrel interface alternating between contracted and extended states. The LptD beta-strand 1, which defines the mobile side of the lateral gate, binds LPS and performs a stroke movement toward the external leaflet during the contracted-to-extended state transition.

Despite their importance, our understanding of the cell biology of sporozoite formation and salivary gland invasion is limited. Here, we apply a technique called Mosquito Tissue Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (MoTissU-ExM), which physically expands infected mosquito tissues while preserving both host and parasite ultrastructure. Using MoTissU-ExM we are able to observe a range of parasite structures and organelles including features previously seen only by electron microscopy as well as structures not observed before. We leverage MoTissU-ExM to investigate a number of cell biology events during sporozoite formation and salivary gland invasion. In particular we focus on the rhoptries, a secretory organelle important for host cell invasion. We establish a timeline for sporozoite rhoptry biogenesis, show that two rhoptries are used up during salivary gland invasion, and provide the first evidence that rhoptry pairs are specialized for different invasion events. Building on this new knowledge, we characterize the rhoptry protein RON11 and identify it as the first protein involved in sporozoite rhoptry biogenesis. Disruption of RON11 led to the production of sporozoites that specifically fail to invade the salivary gland epithelial cell, thereby blocking transmission of these parasites.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710749

This sensing is done by redistribution of charged membrane proteins on the cell's surface (""sensors"") via electrophoresis and electroosmotic flow. If membrane proteins have to physically rearrange on the cell's surface, how quickly can a cell respond to an applied signal? What limits the cell's ability to respond? Are galvanotaxing cells, like chemotaxing cells, limited by stochasticity from the finite number of molecules? Here, we develop a model for the response dynamics of galvanotaxing cells and show that, for weak enough field strengths, two relevant timescales emerge: the time for the cell's sensors to rearrange, which depends on their diffusion across the cell, and the time for the cell's orientation to respond to an applied field, which may be very different. We fit this model to experimental measurements on the recently-identified sensor galvanin (TMEM154) in neutrophil-like HL-60 cells, finding that given the dynamics of a cell responding to an applied field, we can predict the dynamics of the cell after the field is turned off. This fit constrains the noise of the galvanotaxis process, demonstrating that HL-60 is not limited by the stochasticity of finite sensor number. Our model also allows us to explain the effect of media viscosity on cell dynamics, and predict how cells respond to pulsed DC fields. These results place constraints on the ability to guide cells with pulsed fields, predicting that a field on half of the time is no better than a field that is always on with half the magnitude.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710749

The mechanisms linking this peripheral disease to cognitive symptoms are thought to include heightened circulating cytokines and other inflammatory mediators resulting in a leaky blood-brain barrier and increased neuroinflammation (i.e., inflammation taking place in the brain). This can lead to aberrant synaptic transmission and cognitive dysfunction. A key component of neuroinflammation is the reactivity of astrocytes, in a process termed  astrogliosis, associated with altered morphology, proliferative capacity, gene expression, and function. Accumulating evidence suggests astrogliosis likely occurs in mild-moderate COVID-19; however, there has been limited investigation. In this study, we quantified changes to astrocytes in a Syrian hamster model of mild-moderate respiratory COVID-19.

MethodsWe used an intranasal inoculation model to produce mild-moderate respiratory COVID-19 in 8-10-week-old male and female Syrian hamsters. We extracted brains at 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, and 31-days post-inoculation and from uninfected controls, and immunolabelled brain sections with astrocyte- (GFAP and SOX9) and neuron-specific (NEUN) markers. We captured tiled confocal micrographs of entire brain sections and analyzed the resulting signals from five regions of interest: cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus, third ventricle, and dorsal striatum.

ResultsTo systematically quantify cell-type-specific labelling for astrogliosis markers, we first developed an unbiased pipeline. We found a transient increase in GFAP signal density in female hamster, specifically in the cortex at 3 days post-inoculation. There were no corresponding changes noted in astrocyte (SOX9), neuron (NEUN) or total cell (Hoechst) numbers. Moreover, there were no changes in male hamsters at any timepoint in any region of interest.

ConclusionsOur findings provide the first spatiotemporal insight into astrogliosis in a hamster model of mild-moderate respiratory COVID-19. We identified a transient and sex-specific increase in GFAP signal density, indicative of astrogliosis. Our findings contribute to the literature surrounding sex differences in (neuro)immune responses and add to the growing body of COVID-19 literature, in which sex-specific outcomes are apparent in both human patient populations and rodent experimental models.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710749

Recent developments in metric space regression methods allow the use of full empirical distributions as response objects instead of simple summary statistics such as mean.

These two aspects of meaning are traditionally studied separately, resulting in two large, multi-method literatures, which we sought to bring together in this study. Not only would this address basic cognitive questions of how semantic cognition operates but also because, despite their distinct focuses, both literatures ascribe a critical role to the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in each aspect of semantics. Given these considerations, we explored the notion that these systems rely on common underlying computational principles when activating conceptual semantic representations via single words, vs. building a coherent semantic representation across sequences of words. The present study used magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography to track brain activity in participants reading nouns and adjective-noun phrases, whilst integrating conceptual variables from both literatures: the concreteness of nouns (e.g., ""lettuce"" vs. ""fiction"") and the denotational semantics of adjectives (subsective vs. privative; e.g., ""bad"" vs. ""fake""). Region-of-interest analyses show that the left, and to a lesser extent the right, ATLs responded more strongly to phrases at different timepoints, irrespective of concreteness, suggesting a unified ATL function for semantic memory and composition. Decoding analyses further revealed a time-varying representational format for adjective semantics, whereas representations of noun concreteness were more stable and maintained for around 300 ms. Further, the neural representation of noun concreteness was modulated by the preceding adjectives: decoders learning concreteness signals in single words generalized better to subsective relative to privative phrases.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710749

However, the reproducibility and reliability of these findings could remain uncertain for years. Here, we implemented a multi-institutional collaborative approach to define the robust and replicable effects of the psychedelic drug psilocybin on mouse behavior. Five laboratories performed the same experiments to test the acute and persistent effects of psilocybin (2 mg/kg, IP) on various behaviors that psychedelics have been proposed to affect, including anxiety-related approach-avoidance, exploration, sociability, depression-related behaviors, fear extinction, and social reward learning. Through this coordinated approach, we found that psilocybin had several robust and replicable acute effects on mouse behavior, including increased anxiety- and avoidance-related behaviors and decreased fear expression. Surprisingly, however, we found that psilocybin did not have replicable effects 24 hours post psilocybin administration on reducing anxiety- and depression-like behaviors or facilitating fear extinction learning. Additionally, we were unable to observe psilocybin-induced alterations in social preference or social reward learning. Overall, our comprehensive characterization of psilocybins acute and persistent behavioral effects using [~]200 total male and female mice per experiment spread across five independent labs demonstrates with unique certainty several acute drug effects and suggests that psilocybins persistent effects in mice may be more modest and inconsistent than previously suggested.

However, this high structural heterogeneity has limited their observation at high-resolution. Here, we have used an integrated structural biology approach to explore the structures of the multi-domain immunoglobulin-like FLN5-6 during its biosynthesis, capturing early folding through to native folding. We developed an in-silico purification approach for cryo-EM of ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs), and integrated the resulting cryo-EM maps with NMR spectroscopy and atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to produce experimentally reweighted structural ensembles of RNC. The resulting atomistic structures reveal insights into the orientational heterogeneity of the nascent chain and its dynamic interactions with the ribosome. In particular, we find that two distinct pathways exist for nascent polypeptides in the exit tunnel vestibule, influenced by their stage of biosynthesis, folding conformational state and ribosomal RNA helices lining the tunnel. Our systematic analysis of the structures of nascent proteins translation-stalled at multiple time-points provides insights into how the ribosome dynamically modulates its pathway out of the exit tunnel to regulate its folding and accessibility for auxiliary factors of other co-translational events.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710749

What neural mechanisms support this increase of movement vigor for greater rewards? We had three rhesus monkeys perform reaching movements to targets worth different magnitudes of reward. We recorded neural population activity from primary motor and dorsal premotor cortex, brain areas at the output of cortical processing for voluntary movements, and asked how neural activity mediated the translation of reward into increased vigor. We identified features of neural activity during movement preparation, initiation, and execution that were both correlated with vigor and modulated by reward. We also found that the neural metrics that correlate with different aspects of movement vigor exhibit only limited correlation with one another, suggesting that there are multiple mechanisms through which reward modulates vigor. Finally, we note that the majority of rewards modulation of motor cortical activity cannot be accounted for by reward-mediated vigor differences in behavior, indicating that reward modulations within motor cortex may serve roles in addition to affecting vigor. Overall, our results provide insight into the neural mechanisms that link reward-driven motivation to the modulation of the details of movement.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710749

Unfortunately, the extent to which microbiomes from different populations are characterised is limited by their economic resources. Over 70% of the sequenced human microbiomes come from analyses of European and North American populations, skewing our understanding by focusing excessively on just 15% of the global population. Thus, entire continents rely on results from research conducted in wealthier countries whose main findings are unlikely to generalize across other world regions. Moreover, statistical models perform poorly when applied to minorities, a blind spot with serious consequences in biomedicine, and which can only be addressed by analysing microbiome data from currently neglected areas. To address this problem, we created saMBA-- the largest archive of gut microbiomes from South America, one of the worlds most biodiverse regions in terms of the gut microbiome of its inhabitants, yet the one with the fewest samples.  saMBA includes 33 gut microbiome studies, [~]73% of which were incorporated in a microbiome archive for the first time. By leveraging this resource, we uncovered a high biodiversity within --and uniqueness between-- gut microbiomes across the continent, expanding the concept of the healthy microbiome to be more globally representative. Additionally, our results highlight that the gut microbiome biodiversity of this region remains far from fully characterized. We demonstrate how saMBA can guide new sampling efforts to better capture this diversity. Finally, the code deployed to build saMBA is compatible with that of a previous global compendium and is openly available to researchers from other underrepresented regions, fostering the inclusion of other neglected populations to accelerate microbiome research globally.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710749

Interestingly, NALCN and FAM155 have orthologous phylogenetic relationships with the fungal calcium channel Cch1 and its extracellular subunit Mid1, however, UNC79 and UNC80 have not been reported outside of animals. In this study, we leveraged expanded gene sequence data available for eukaryotes to re-examine the evolutionary origins of NALCN and Cch1 channel subunits. Our analysis corroborates the direct phylogenetic relationship between NALCN and Cch1 and identifies a larger clade of related channels in additional eukaryotic taxa. We also identify homologues of FAM155/Mid1 in Cryptista algae, and UNC79 and UNC80 homologues in numerous non-metazoan eukaryotes including basidiomycete and mucoromycete fungi, and the microbial eukaryotic taxa Apusomonadida, Malawimonadida, and Discoba. Furthermore, we find that most major animal lineages, except ctenophores, possess a full complement of NALCN subunits. Comparing structural predictions with the solved structure of the human NALCN complex supports orthologous relationships between metazoan and non-metazoan FAM155/Mid1, UNC79, and UNC80 homologues.

Here, we used single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate the developmental trajectories of Nestin-expressing progenitors (NEPs) in the neonatal mouse cerebellum. We identified FOXO1 as a key regulator of NEP-to-inhibitory neuron differentiation, acting directly downstream of ASCL1. Genome occupancy and functional experiments using primary NEPs showed that both ASCL1 and FOXO1 regulate neurogenesis genes during differentiation while independently regulating proliferation and survival, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated that WNT signalling promotes the transition from an ASCL1+ to a FOXO1+ cellular state. Finally, we showed that the role of WNT signalling in promoting neuron production via FOXO1 is conserved in primary human NEPs.

While many existing studies have primarily focused on omics data, they often fail to integrate clinical heterogeneity, which is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of disease biology. Although significant progress has been made in researching crosstalks between inter-pathways and inter-cells, and tools like CellChat have emerged to analyze these interactions, they have notable limitations. These include the assumption that mRNA expression directly reflects protein activity, a heavy reliance on pre-established ligand-receptor interactions, and an inability to connect ""chats"" with clinical phenotypes. Furthermore, existing methods have limitations in distinguishing between paracrine signaling (interactions between different cell types) and autocrine signaling (self-signaling within the same cell type). These limitations hinder the ability to translate molecular insights into phenotypic outcomes, thereby limiting clinical applicability. To provide another solution for these challenges, we introduce RNAchat, a novel approach that utilizes machine learning techniques to identify metapathways for crosstalks among pathways at not only the bulk level but also cell types at the single-cell level, incorporating both clinical and multi-omics data.

ResultsRNAchat provides another solution by providing an interactive, reproducible platform designed to analyse metapathways between inter-pathways and inter-cell types using multi-omics level data in a clinical context. This tool enables researchers to integrate diverse datasets, conduct exploratory analyses, and identify cooperated pathways. The platform facilitates hypothesis generation and produces intuitive visualizations to support further investigation.

As a proof of concept, we applied RNAchat to connect omics data to pain, drug resistance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), disease severity to RA and Heart Failure (HF). We discovered cooperated molecular pathways associated with different treatments using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) values. Then, we demonstrated how to use it to find cellular interactions at single cell level. Last but not the least, we further extended crosstalk exploration between host and parasites and found potential novel important pathways interaction not mentioned by previous studies.

ConclusionWe introduce RNAchat, a computational platform designed to identify pathway communications with clinical and multi-omics data in real-time. This tool supports both user-generated and publicly available datasets, offering a robust solution and enhancing our understanding of complex diseases such as RA and HF.

However, most preclinical studies rely on inbred mouse strains that do not capture the genetic complexity of human populations. One key area of translational research focuses on identifying the neural and behavioral consequences of early life trauma. Rodent models of childhood neglect, such as maternal separation with early weaning (MSEW), have been used in isogenic mouse strains like C57BL/6J (B6) to identify behavioral domains and neural loci of deficits stemming from exposure to MSEW. To understand how genetic diversity may contribute to the outcomes produced by MSEW, and thus inform future studies on the topic, we utilized the Jackson Laboratory Diversity Outbred (DO) line, a population derived from eight founder strains that exhibit broad genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. We first compared MSEW effects on social behavior in DO mice versus B6 mice, because we have previously found social behavior deficits in B6 mice with a history of MSEW. Indeed, we established that MSEW incited social motivation deficits in DO mice, in a sex-specific manner. We then expanded our investigation of DO mice to test MSEW-related changes in anxiety-like behavior, fear learning and expression, and reward-seeking. Results revealed that MSEW produces distinct, sex-specific phenotypes: female DO mice displayed reduced social motivation and elevated anxiety-like behavior, while male DO mice showed attenuated CS-evoked fear expression and diminished reward-seeking behavior. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased Fos expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in MSEW-exposed DO mice, both at baseline and following acute stress.

Using multiparametric deep mutational scanning across eight substrates and two energy conditions, we deconvolute the contributions of substrate recognition, energetic coupling, and protein stability, providing an integrated, high-resolution view of multidrug transport. We find that substrate specificity arises from a distributed network of residues extending beyond the binding site, with mutations that reshape binding, coupling, conformational flexibility, and membrane interactions. Further, we apply a pH-based selection scheme to measure the effect of mutation on pH-dependent transport efficiency. By integrating these data, we reveal a fundamental relationship between efficiency and promiscuity: highly efficient variants exhibit broad substrate profiles, while inefficient variants are narrower.

RNA-seq analysis of RSV-infected primary nasal epithelial cell cultures from healthy infants at birth and one year revealed diminished expression of interferon epsilon (IFNE), a poorly characterised type I IFN, in newborns versus one-year. We hypothesised, therefore, that IFNE plays an important role during infant RSV infection. We found that IFNE is endogenously expressed in airway epithelial cell lines. Recombinant human IFN{varepsilon} (rhIFN{varepsilon}) induced an antiviral state against an RSV clinical isolate and related Sendai virus, but not SARS-CoV-2 under the conditions tested. The antiviral potency of rhIFN{varepsilon} was diminished relative to rhIFN beta (rhIFN{beta}1) or rhIFN lambda-1 (rhIFN{lambda}1), as evidenced by IC50 data. Importantly, rhIFN{varepsilon} induced similar ISGs as rhIFN{beta}1 but demonstrated a transient temporal expression profile that differed from both rhIFN{beta}1 and rhIFN{lambda}1. These results suggest that lower IFN{varepsilon} expression at birth may contribute to increased susceptibility to severe RSV-associated disease, offering insights into potential therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710749

Their main purpose is to catch and interact with pollen, to mediate compatibility responses, to regulate pollen germination, and to guide pollen tubes to the transmitting tract so that the sperm cells carried in the pollen can be delivered to the female gametophyte to achieve double fertilization. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the stigma consists of single-celled stigma papillae that emerge from the apex of the fused carpels. Despite their critical function in plant reproduction, the molecular mechanisms that govern growth and maturation of stigma papillae remain poorly understood. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) have been implicated in stigma receptivity, but their roles in papillae development are less explored. Here we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) also play different roles in stigma papillae development, with superoxide accumulating during the initiation and growth phase and hydrogen peroxide accumulating in mature papillae that are receptive to pollen. Reducing superoxide levels in the stigma by pharmacological treatments or over-expressing superoxide dismutase enzymes under an early stigma promoter inhibited stigma papillae growth, suggesting that ROS homeostasis is critical to papillae growth and differentiation for optimal pollination.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710749

Consequently, bacterial metabolites such as quorum sensing (QS) signaling molecules are transferred along with the phage lysate to recipient bacterial cells. Here, we show that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa QS molecules 3OC12-HSL and C4-HSL are rapidly degraded in phage lysates. In contrast, the hydrophobic QS molecule PQS is remarkably stable, for at least one year, due to its binding within outer membrane vesicles. Strikingly, we find that PQS exceeds concentrations of 10 M in standard phage lysate preparations. We show that PQS carried over from phage lysates induces QS-controlled production of the virulence factor pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa. This PQS carryover does not oppose previous conclusions of phage infection-induced PQS production, as we show here, that this response is also triggered by PQS-free phage lysates. Since other bacterial species, including Paracoccus and Vibrio harveyi, also produce hydrophobic QS molecules that are bound within outer membrane vesicles, it is likely that phage lysates from these bacteria may similarly contain stable QS molecules. Collectively, we demonstrate that membrane-bound QS molecules may significantly confound QS-related physiological outcomes of phage-host interaction studies. This can be avoided by using QS synthase mutants for phage propagation or by purifying phage particles from lysates to eliminate QS molecule carryover.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710749

In this study we sought to answer the question - does enough information exist to do proteomics on any organism we want? As a case study we started with material available due to an infestation of a home with black widow spiders. Thanks to the recent publication of an annotated genome for one species of black widow spider, we were able to identify 5502 protein groups and assign putative annotations using ortholog mapping. We also demonstrate that had we not had this resource, over 2000 proteins could be identified using other available spider genome annotations, despite their unrelatedness. Moreover, regardless of spider proteome used, proteins annotated as toxins were almost exclusively observed in the main body of the mature female black widow spider. Overall, these results provide a draft proteome map for the black widow spider and valuable data for validating machine learning models, while also suggesting that the door to insightful quantitative proteomics may already be open for millions of less studied organisms.

While Rheo-FLUCS is facilitated by thermoviscous expansion phenomena rather than external forces, we here show equivalence in its ability to measure canonical viscoelastic properties. Specifically, we demonstrate a phase-lag equivalence with probe-dependent active microrheology in a wide range of physically different, yet chemically identical materials.

In particular, DNA-functionalized dye-loaded polymeric NPs (DNA-NPs), owing to their exceptional fluorescence brightness emerge as powerful nanomaterials for ultrasensitive detection and imaging of nucleic acids. Here, we addressed a fundamental question unexplored for polymeric DNA-NPs: how dense packing of oligonucleotides at the particle surface impacts their capacity to specifically hybridize with complementary sequences. Using Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between DNA-NPs and labelled complementary strands, we found that the DNA at the NPs surface exhibit dramatic enhancement in the duplex stability compared to free DNA duplexes (>20 {degrees}C). This effect increases at higher densities of DNA on NPs surface, which suggests that DNA cooperativity is responsible for the duplex stability enhancement. For example, 8 nt DNA duplexes were perfectly stable at RT on the surface of DNA-NPs. Furthermore, these DNA-NPs preserve capacity to distinguish mutations, even at the single nucleotide level within 21 nt sequence, when appropriate hybridization temperature is used. The hybridization between DNA-NPs and the complementary sequences proceeds on the min time scale at probe and target concentrations [&ge;] 10 and [&ge;]100 pM, respectively. Below that, this diffusion-controlled processes becomes too slow, which points on the fundamental limitation in the DNA/RNA sensing assays that require sufficiently high nanoprobe concentration.

However, their proliferation can trigger harmful algal blooms, posing risks to aquatic biodiversity and public health. Despite their ecological significance, the interplay between cyanobacterial genomic traits and ecosystem dynamics remains poorly resolved. Here, we employed culture-independent metagenomic approaches to reconstruct cyanobacterial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from Chilika Lagoon, India, and investigate their spatiotemporal distribution and functions. Our analysis revealed distinct temporal patterns in cyanobacterial MAG abundance, with salinity emerging as the primary environmental driver of community structure and functional gene composition. Genes associated with biogeochemical cycling and toxin synthesis displayed pronounced seasonal variation, suggesting that functional genomic traits, rather than taxonomic identity govern species selection. Notably, five MAGs harboured the complete phosphate acetyltransferase-acetate kinase (Pta-Ack) pathway, a critical component of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, indicating an underappreciated potential for alternative carbon fixation mechanisms alongside the canonical Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. Furthermore, genomic variability, rather than phylogenetic relatedness was the dominant factor shaping cyanobacterial dynamics in the lagoon. This study establishes a direct link between physicochemical fluctuations and cyanobacterial functional diversity, offering critical insights into how climate-driven changes in salinity and nutrient regimes may influence aquatic ecosystems. By elucidating the genomic basis of cyanobacterial adaptation, these findings enhance our capacity to predict ecological outcomes of harmful algal blooms and inform strategies to safeguard ecosystem services in vulnerable coastal habitats.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710750

Applying this pipeline to 11 diverse natural peptides and synthetic peptidomimetics uncovered shared antibacterial activities, but with different kinetics that categorized them into two classes: class I, where inner membrane permeabilization predominantly correlates with growth inhibition, and class II, where it does not. With the class I peptides, intracellular ribosome and DNA reorganization, along with growth inhibition, occurred abruptly and was coupled with inner membrane permeabilization. However, this coupling led to rapid peptide absorption by the first exposed cells and poor antibacterial activity against dense cell populations. With the class II peptides, ribosome/DNA reorganization and growth inhibition occurred more gradually, as inner membrane permeabilization was either absent or delayed. This was offset by slower intracellular uptake and greater efficacy against high cell densities. These kinetic differences reveal functional trade-offs between classes that have immunological and therapeutic implications.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710750

Here we present a numba accelerated implementation for any polymer of the calculation of Menger curvatures as a MDAKit from the widely-used MDAnalysis package.

We applied all 3 flexibility metrics to a {beta}III-tubulin monomer as an example, as tubulins are known to possess the entire range of proteic elements, from -helix and {beta}-sheets to a flexible loop and a disordered C-terminal tail (CTT). RMSF, LFs and Neq all succeed in identifying the flexible loops and the CTT, although the RMSF requires a system-specific alignment to do so.

These models rely on tokenizers to split input sequences into manageable chunks -- a straightforward task in natural language but more challenging for long DNA sequences that lack distinct ""words."" Most biological tokenizers are data-driven and do not align with the ""central dogma of molecular biology"": DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins, with each three-letter codon specifying a particular amino acid, some of which are synonymous for the amino acids they represent. Start codons signal the beginning of protein synthesis, while stop codons signal its termination. The Genomic Tokenizer (GT) incorporates this biological process flow into a standard tokenizer interface within the HuggingFace transformer package. GT can be used to pre-train foundational transformer models on DNA sequences. We compare the performance of GT with two alternate tokenization strategies and discuss its potential applications.

This phenomenon is particularly significant in microscopy imaging, where high-resolution acquisitions come with substantial costs in throughput, data storage requirements, and potential photodamage to specimens. Through systematic experimentation, we evaluate how varying image resolution impacts deep learning performance in cellular image segmentation tasks. We trained popular architectures on datasets downsampled to 6-50% of their original resolution, mimicking acquisitions at lower image magnification, and compared their performance against models trained on native-resolution images. Our results show that segmentation accuracy either improves (by up to 25% of mean Intersection over Union (IoU)) or experiences only minimal degradation (< 5% of mean IoU) when using images downsampled by up to a factor of 4 (25% of the original resolution). This downsampling proportionally increases information throughput while reducing data storage requirements and inference time.

To achieve such cognitive flexibility, the brain is wired by plastic synapses that are hotspots of energy consumption. Supplying energy to distant synapses is challenging as they are distributed throughout dendrites and axons, spanning hundreds of microns from their cell body. Synapses, therefore, require an instant and local energy supply provided by mitochondria stabilized near dendritic spines. However, the mechanisms by which synapses communicate their energy demands to locally stable mitochondria to drive local energy production and sustain synaptic plasticity is unknown. Using highly sensitive spine- and mitochondrial ATP reporters and two-photon glutamate uncaging to stimulate individual spines, we find that synaptic plasticity input drives instant and sustained increase in spine ATP levels, provided by local ATP synthesis in [~]10-20 m spatially confined compartments within mitochondria. This spatially localized mitochondrial ATP generation is driven by a spatially localized mitochondrial calcium influx independent of the endoplasmic reticulum. Notably, the initial spine ATP increase, supported by local mitochondrial ATP synthesis, is independent of CaMKII and the energy demands of spine structural plasticity. Without local calcium signaling and mitochondrial stabilization, synapses do not meet their instant and sustained energy needs, resulting in synaptic plasticity defects, as observed in neurological disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710750

The Movile Cave, isolated from external influences 5.5 million years, offers a unique opportunity to explore microbial evolution under prolonged environmental stability. Here, we analyzed metagenome-assembled genomes from this cave, revealing that prokaryotes exhibit lower gene diversity and higher levels of pseudogenization compared to those from non-isolated environments, mainly affecting housekeeping functions involved in translation. Functional redundancy across genomes remained comparable to related habitats. Our results suggest that pseudogenization may serve as a fine-tuning mechanism to reduce excess redundancy. Although horizontal gene transfer is limited overall, the cave virome seems to contribute to microbial adaptation through the transfer of auxiliary metabolic genes. Movile microorganisms harbor fewer phage-defense systems than counterparts in related environments, suggesting a long-term adaptation to a relatively stable virosphere. Our findings indicate that prolonged isolation under stable selective pressures does not necessarily lead to major genomic divergence, but rather promotes adaptive gene loss. This study provides key insights into how long-term stability shapes microbial genome evolution and ecosystem function.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710750

This is because it is especially useful for incorporating fossil data into such analyses, integrating fossils along with their age information directly into the tree as tips or sampled ancestors. Two approaches are common for placing fossil taxa in trees: inference based on morphological character data or using taxonomic constraints to control their topological placement. These approaches have historically been treated as alternatives, though combining the two is theoretically possible. For phylogenetic inference of entirely extinct organisms, additional related fossil taxa other than those for which morphology is available are generally overlooked. Here, we implement a combined approach on an empirical dataset for a group of trilobites. We use a morphological matrix and ages for 56 taxa and age information for another 196 taxa from the Paleobiology Database. To evaluate the effects of a combined approach, we conducted FBD dated phylogenetic analyses using a combined approach with morphology and taxonomic constraints and compared them to analyses of taxa with morphology alone. We find that a combined approach yields topologies that are more stratigraphically congruent, substantially more precise parameter estimates (e.g., divergence times), and more informative tree distributions. These findings are a consequence of the substantial increase in stratigraphic age information and a more representative sample of their temporal distributions.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710750

Identifying genes involved in specialized metabolism remains difficult. While coexpression analysis is a widely used approach to identify genes acting in the same pathway or process, it has limitations, particularly in distinguishing genes coexpressed due to shared regulatory triggers from those directly involved in the same pathway. To enhance functional predictions, integrating phylogenetic analysis provides an additional layer of confidence by considering evolutionary conservation. Here, we introduce CoExpPhylo, a computational pipeline that systematically combines coexpression analysis and phylogenetics to identify candidate genes involved in specialized biosynthetic pathways across multiple species based on one to multiple bait gene candidates.

ResultsCoExpPhylo systematically integrates coexpression information and phylogenetic signals to identify candidate genes involved in specialized biosynthetic pathways. The pipeline consists of multiple computational steps: (1) species-specific coexpression analysis, (2) local sequence alignment to identify orthologs, (3) clustering of candidate genes into Orthologous Coexpressed Groups (OCGs), (4) functional annotation, (5) global sequence alignment, (6) phylogenetic tree generation, and optionally (7) visualization. The workflow is highly customizable, allowing users to adjust correlation thresholds, filtering parameters, and annotation sources. Benchmarking CoExpPhylo on multiple pathways, including anthocyanin, proanthocyanidin, and flavonol biosynthesis, confirmed its ability to recover known genes while also suggesting novel candidates.

ConclusionCoExpPhylo provides a systematic framework for identifying candidate genes involved in the specialized metabolism. By integrating coexpression data with phylogenetic clustering, it facilitates the discovery of both conserved and lineage-specific genes. The resulting OCGs offer a strong foundation for further experimental validation, bridging the gap between computational predictions and functional characterization. Future improvements, such as incorporating multi-species reference databases and refining clustering for large gene families, could further enhance its resolution. Overall, CoExpPhylo represents a valuable tool for accelerating pathway elucidation and advancing our understanding of specialized metabolism in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710750

These breaks are scheduled to maintain tolerably high levels of tumor burden, employing competitive suppression of treatment-resistant sub-populations by treatment-sensitive sub-populations. AT has been integrated into several ongoing or planned clinical trials, including treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and BRAF-mutant melanoma, with initial clinical results suggesting that it can offer significant extensions in the time to progression over the standard of care.

However, these clinical protocols may be sub-optimal, as they fail to account for variation in tumor dynamics between patients, and result in significant heterogeneity in patient outcomes. Mathematical modeling and analysis have been proposed to optimize adaptive protocols, but they do not account for clinical restrictions, most notably the discrete time intervals between the clinical appointments where a patients tumor burden is measured and their treatment schedule is re-evaluated. We present a general framework for deriving optimal treatment protocols which account for these discrete time intervals, and derive optimal schedules for a number of models to avoid model-specific personalization. We identify a trade-off between the frequency of patient monitoring and the time to progression attainable, and propose an AT protocol based on a single treatment threshold. Finally, we identify a subset of patients with qualitatively different dynamics that instead require a novel AT protocol based on a threshold that changes over the course of treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1744495710750

Despite being the first recombinant therapeutic approved by the FDA, insulin remains challenging to access for many around the globe. Here we report on advancements in manufacturing insulin using cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems to rapidly produce mature desB30-insulin in less than a day. This is a major advance towards decentralizing insulin manufacturing and bringing production closer to the point-of-care, thereby improving diabetic patient accessibility. To this end, a purified cell-free extract, PUREfrex(R) 2.1, was utilized to synthesize a tagged proinsulin construct that can be captured and converted into mature insulin using an on-column affinity chromatography process. Notably, two chaperones, peptidyl prolyl isomerase (FkpA), and seven kilodalton protein (Skp) were observed to play a critical role during cell-free expression of proinsulin. The proinsulin was then immobilized on a Ni-NTA column where the purification and conversion of cell-free products were performed sequentially to yield desB30-insulin. Following further optimization, this method serves as a time and resource-efficient production process as compared to current methods. When applied simultaneously, the cell-free expression and on-column conversion methods reported here can be adopted to enable rapid on-demand insulin manufacturing in order to improve the accessibility of insulin and prevent future shortages.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710750

These events reduce overall protein expression levels of affected genes, potentially contributing to gene regulation and disease mechanisms.

Here, we present LeafCutter2, which enables identification and quantification of unproductive splicing from short-read RNA-seq data. LeafCutter2 requires minimal gene annotations (start and stop codons) to annotate NMD-inducing splicing events, and identifies differential unproductive splicing between groups, providing insights into its contributions to differential gene expression. Moreover, LeafCutter2 enables mapping of unproductive splicing quantitative trait loci (u-sQTLs), which often colocalize with expression QTLs and GWAS loci.

Applying LeafCutter2 to RNA-seq data across human and 6 non-human species, we uncovered a broad landscape of unproductive splicing, which varies widely across tissues. Strikingly, we observed a conserved developmental-stage-specific increase in unproductive splicing during testis maturation across all species.

In Alzheimers disease (AD), we analyzed RNA-seq data from the AD Functional Genomics consortium FunGen-xQTL project and identified unproductive splicing events in 18 AD risk genes, including TSPAN14, PICALM, and CASS4, likely mediating genetic effects on disease risk. We performed an integrative analysis using gene expression QTLs, protein expression QTLs, and AD GWAS data, showing that unproductive splicing provides unique regulatory insights beyond traditional approaches.

Hubs are often thought to have emergent nucleus-wide properties depending on transcription factor nuclear concentrations and intrinsic, protein sequence-dependent properties. This global model does not account for gene-specific hub regulation. Using high-resolution lattice light-sheet microscopy in Drosophila embryos, we examined hubs formed by the morphogen transcription factor, Dorsal, at reporter genes with distinct enhancer compositions. We found that snail recruits long-lived, high-intensity hubs; sog exhibits shorter-lived, lower-intensity hubs; and hunchback, lacking Dorsal binding sites, shows only transient hub interactions. Hub intensity and interaction duration correlate with burst amplitude, RNAPII loading rate, and transcriptional output. These findings challenge the global view of hub formation and support a model where hub properties are locally tuned in a gene-specific manner to regulate transcriptional kinetics.","NA","biorxiv",1744495710750

Immunohistochemical analysis of the synaptic architecture of these spinal circuits has been notoriously difficult in formaldehyde-fixed tissue and often requires antigen retrieval techniques to reveal antigen binding epitopes. To avoid the damage this harsh treatment can induce, studies have used antibodies raised against scaffolding proteins Homer1 and gephyrin, which anchor glutamate and GABA receptors to the membrane, respectively, to identify synaptic associations in rodent spinal cord underlying pain and itch transmission. In contrast, few studies have attempted to visualise spinal cord synapses in the human, partly due to a lack of high-quality tissue with low postmortem intervals. In this study, we reveal both excitatory and inhibitory synapses at a high resolution in human lumbar spinal cord tissue using antibodies to Homer1 and gephyrin and show that the basic organisation of these proteins within the dorsal horn is similar to that seen in the rodent. We show these postsynaptic markers are highly colocalised with glutamate and GABA receptor subunits and are in close apposition to presynaptic markers, confirming their specificity. Finally, we use Homer1-immunolabelling to demonstrate that primary afferents can form complex synaptic arrangements in human.

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1744495710750

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1744495710750
