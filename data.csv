Here, we present clinical, pathological, and molecular findings associated with HPAI H5N1 infection in pinnipeds from Chubut, Argentina. Necropsies were conducted on three South American Sea Lions (SASLs) (Otaria flavescens) and one Southern Elephant Seal (SES) (Mirounga leonina), followed by histopathological, immunohistochemical and RT-sqPCR analyses. Neurological clinical signs were observed in two SASLs, with one also exhibiting respiratory distress. Neuropathological findings included lymphoneutrophilic meningoencephalomyelitis and choroiditis, neuronal necrosis, gliosis, hemorrhages, and perivascular cuffing. Viral antigen was localized in neurons, glial cells, choroid plexus epithelial cells, ependymal cells, and the neuropil. Systemic manifestations included HPAI-related necrotizing myocarditis in the elephant seal and placental necrosis in a sea lion, with fetal tissues testing positive for HPAIV. Pulmonary lesions were minimal, limited to bronchial glands in one individual. RT-sqPCR confirmed HPAI H5 in all tested animals. Our findings highlight the neurotropism of HPAI H5N1 in pinnipeds, and expand the known systemic effects of the virus, revealing new tissue tropism and vertical transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

Despite various hypotheses, the biological mechanisms underlying PCC remain unclear. Previous studies have linked PCC to alterations in the DNA methylome of blood immune cells, but the effects on lung cells over time remain unknown. Methods Patients (n=13) with persistent symptoms following COVID-19 in 2020-2021 donated blood and sputum samples at inclusion and after one year. Symptom and physiological testing data were collected concurrently. DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles were analysed longitudinally and compared to pre-pandemic DNAm data from healthy controls. Results While peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) showed no significant changes, longitudinal DNAm changes were observed in neutrophil- and macrophage-enriched fractions. The changes were significantly associated with symptoms and physiological measures. Pathway analysis showed enrichment for cellular processes involved in cardiac function. Conclusions We identified longitudinal DNAm changes in lung immune cells associated with pathways linked to cardiac function. These changes correlate with symptom burden and heart and lung metrics.

Recent deep learning all-atom methods have been built to address this challenge, but evaluating their performance on the prediction of protein-ligand complexes has been inconclusive due to the lack of relevant benchmarking datasets. Here we present a comprehensive evaluation of four leading all-atom cofolding deep learning methods using our newly introduced benchmark dataset Runs N' Poses, which comprises 2,600 high-resolution protein-ligand systems released after the training cutoff used by these methods. We demonstrate that current co-folding approaches largely memorise ligand poses from their training data, hindering their use for de novo drug design. This limitation is especially pronounced for ligands that have only been seen binding in one pocket, whereas more promiscuous ligands such as cofactors show moderately improved performance. With this work and benchmark dataset, we aim to accelerate progress in the field by allowing for a more realistic assessment of the current state-of-the-art deep learning methods for predicting protein-ligand interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

The pathomechanisms underlying neurological impairments in COVID-19 and post COVID-19 condition remain incompletely understood, hence experimental studies under defined conditions, in a suitable animal model, can help to clarify the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the brain. The K18-hACE2 mouse represents such a model, as intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 VOC generally results in widespread neuronal infection with limited tissue response in the brain, consistent with a mild non-suppurative (meningo)encephalitis, with microgliosis, astrogliosis and (peri)vascular leukocyte infiltrates but no evidence of infection of vessel structures. The present study used this model to address the hypothesis that the vascular reaction is secondary to the neuronal infection. It confirmed that in intranasally challenged K18-hACE2 mice the virus targeted the neurons without overt neuropathic effect, whilst sparing the blood vessels, and further characterised the resulting inflammatory response in the brain in situ and through bulk RNA sequencing. The former highlighted the recruitment of leukocytes (neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and lymphocytes) via postcapillary venules, with their accumulation in the perivascular space and occasional emigration into the neuroparenchyma, without targeting and/or damage to the vessel wall. At the transcriptome level, this was accompanied by positive enrichment of pathways and the upregulation of genes involved in both the inflammatory reaction and the recruitment (including adhesion and migration) and activity of the leukocytes. We also found morphological and molecular evidence of subtle impairment of blood-brain barrier function, i.e. increased permeability. The results obtained from the model indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection of the neurons induces neuroinflammation, with leukocyte recruitment and activation as well as blood-brain barrier dysfunction. These data can help to understand more fully the reaction of the CNS in COVID-19 patients, and neurotropic virus infections in general.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

Distinct serotypes correspond to diverse polysaccharide structures that are encoded by distinct biosynthesis gene clusters, e.g. the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex (KpSC) K- and O- loci encode the synthesis machinery for the capsule (K) and outer-lipopolysaccharides (O), respectively. We previously presented Kaptive and Kaptive 2, programs to identify K and O-loci directly from KpSC genome assemblies (later adapted for Acinetobacter baumannii), enabling sero-epidemiological analyses to guide vaccine and phage therapy development. However, for some KpSC genome collections, Kaptive (v[&le;]2) was unable to type a high proportion of K-loci. Here we identify the cause of this issue as assembly fragmentation, and present a new version of Kaptive (v3) to circumvent this problem, reduce processing times and simplify output interpretation. We compared the performance of Kaptive v2 and Kaptive v3 for typing genome assemblies generated from subsampled Illumina read sets (decrements of 10x depth), for which a corresponding high quality completed genome was also available to determine the 'true' loci (n=549 KpSC, n=198 A. baumannii). Both versions of Kaptive showed high rates of agreement to the matched true locus among 'typeable' locus calls ([&ge;]96% for [&ge;]20x read depth), but Kaptive v3 was more sensitive, particularly for low depth assemblies (at <40x depth, v3 ranged 0.85-1 vs v2 0.09-0.94) and/or typing KpSC K-loci (e.g. 0.97 vs 0.82 for non-subsampled assemblies). Overall, Kaptive v3 was also associated with a higher rate of optimal outcomes i.e. loci matching those in the reference database were correctly typed and genuine novel loci were reported as untypeable (73-98% for v3 vs 7-77% for v2 for KpSC K-loci). Kaptive v3 was >1 order of magnitude faster than Kaptive v2 making it easy to analyse thousands of assemblies on a desktop computer, facilitating broadly accessible in silico serotyping that is both accurate and sensitive.

Dopaminergic (DA) neurons project to most brain areas, with particularly dense innervation in the striatum. DA varicosities bind to target striatal synapses and form dopamine hub synapses (DHS). However, the basic features of dopamine release sites are still largely unknown. Here we studied the ultrastructure of fluorescent DA and glutamatergic (GLU) synaptosomes isolated from the striatum of adult mice with cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography. We observed that DA synaptosomes display ~10 times fewer vesicles than GLU ones. DA vesicles are bigger and less round. Vesicle organization at single nanometer scale indicates that most GLU synaptosomes have tethered and primed vesicles, indicative of a readily releasable pool, while only 39 % of DA synaptosomes have tethered vesicles, which appear not to be primed. In addition, GLU terminals contacted by DA terminals in DHS have more primed vesicles than others. While DA varicosities do not form genuine synapses, their adhesion to cortico-striatal synapses may convey a local regulation of synaptic release properties.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

These microtubules are organized uniformly in axons with their plus-end pointing away from the soma. In contrast, in the dendrites of vertebrate neurons, microtubules are of mixed polarity, but organized into bundles of uniform polarity with stable, long-lived microtubules preferentially oriented minus-end-out and dynamic microtubules oriented plus-end-out. This organization is thought to be essential for guiding selective transport into dendrites, yet how this organization is established is unclear. Here we use a combination of single molecule localization microscopy, expansion microscopy, and live-cell imaging to examine how the microtubule cytoskeleton is reorganized during neuronal development of cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We find that, while the youngest neurites contain microtubules of mixed polarity, stable microtubules are initially preferentially oriented plus-end-out. At this stage of development many stable microtubules are connected to the centrioles, providing an explanation for their plus-end out orientation in emerging neurites. In later stages, these microtubules are released from the centrioles and reorient by sliding between or within neurites to become progressively more minus-end-out. Moreover, prior to axon specification, we commonly observed already one or two minor neurites with an almost uniformly plus-end-out microtubule network, indicative of transient polarization.

The mechanism by which these drugs may assist recovery in addiction, mood disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is still not well understood. Most investigations of the effects of these drugs on brain activity have focussed on cortical resting-state networks, however the striatum is a key reward and motivation hub of the brain and aberrant striatal processing may be part of the pathophysiology of these disorders. Consequently, we investigated striatal connectivity following acute MDMA and LSD administration. Method Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data were acquired, and seed-voxel functional connectivity analyses were used with the striatum subdivided into three seed regions: the associative, limbic, and sensorimotor striatum. Within-network connectivity was measured using group mean network maps and whole-brain connectivity (seed-to-voxel) was also examined. Results Neither MDMA nor LSD significantly changed within-network connectivity of any of the three striatal seed regions. However, striatal connectivity with other brain regions was significantly altered with both MDMA and LSD. Most notably, MDMA reduced connectivity between the limbic striatum and the amygdala, while LSD increased connectivity between the associative striatum and the frontal, sensorimotor, and visual cortices. Conclusion Changes in connectivity were mostly observed outside the standard striatal networks, consistent with previous findings that psychedelics reduce network modularity or between-network segregation and increase connectivity across standard networks.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

Little is known about the molecular basis of eukaryogenesis, but it is likely that lipids played a key role in this process. Modern eukaryotic membranes contain polycyclic triterpenoids (mainly sterols) that are essential for a variety of cellular functions, but these lipids have not been identified in archaea. The lipid composition of Asgardarchaeota including the newly described class Hodarchaeales, which share a common ancestor with eukaryotes, is unknown. Here, we investigated the potential for Asgards to produce cyclic terpenoids. Phylogenomics coupled with structural prediction revealed that Asgards lack the capacity to make sterols, yet organisms from the clades Hodarchaeales and Kariarcheales encode for divergent homologs of sterol cyclases, predicted to produce diterpenoids. We tested the functionality of these enzymes in vitro, showing that they cyclize geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to form bicyclic halimadienyl pyrophosphate. Halimadienyl lipids have previously been shown to mediate intracellular persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in host endosomes, and may function similarly Asgardarchaeota. This is the first evidence of experimentally validated diterpenoid cyclases in archaea, providing new insights into the biochemistry of these microbes pivotal in the evolution of complex cellular life.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

While (AVR) effectors have long been considered species- or genotype-specific, based on a lack of homology in sequence databases, a growing number of studies have now shown that these proteins belong to a limited set of structural families. This is an important finding because it paves the way for the identification or engineering of broad-spectrum R proteins capable of recognizing several members of the same structural family. In the Leptosphaeria maculans / rapeseed (Brassica napus) pathosystem, 13 AVR genes have been cloned, of which four encode effectors belonging to the LARS (Leptosphaeria AviRulence and Supressing) structural family that has also been found in thirteen other phytopathogenic fungi. Homologues of the L. maculans AvrLm3 AVR protein, a LARS family member, have been identified in other fungal species, including an AVR protein from Fulvia fulva called Ecp11-1. We have previously shown that Ecp11-1 is recognized by rapeseed varieties carrying the Rlm3 R gene, and that this recognition is masked by the presence of another LARS AVR gene, AvrLm4-7. In this study, we expanded our characterization of the Rlm3 resistance spectrum to putative effectors from Fusarium oxysporum and Zymoseptoria ardabiliae and showed that one effector from F. oxysporum f. sp. narcissi behaves like Ecp11-1, being recognized by Rlm3, and this recognition also being masked by the presence of AvrLm4-7. We finally investigated which protein regions and amino acids were necessary for the recognition of AvrLm3 and Ecp11-1 by Rlm3. This analysis is a first step towards the identification or engineering of broad-spectrum R proteins that confer protection against multiple phytopathogens through the recognition of structural effector families.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

Fifty articles involving experiments necessitating the agreement of an ethics committee were searched in each of the three journals to June 30th 2023. Because PNAs announced that a Statistical Review Committee was created and working since September 2023, a further set of 50 articles was retrieved and analyzed from 2024 January 1st. The following items were checked in articles: an explicit statement of approval from an animal ethics committee, the calculation of the appropriate samples size needed and how randomization and blinding were performed, the minimum sample size reported, the presence of repeats, and the methods used to limit type I and type II errors.

No clear experimental design was fully reported in any article. The major problems were 1) extremely small sample sizes (<4/group) in nearly half of the articles, 2) confusion between biological repeats and technical replications, and 3) lack of correction for multiple comparisons. These errors led to major inflation of type I and type II errors.

In conclusion, only 10 percent of the articles analyzed presented correct statistical methodology.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

Constructing a pangenome graph, however, is still a time-consuming and expensive process. A promising approach for pangenome construction consists of progressively augmenting a pangenome graph with additional high-quality assemblies. Currently, there is no approach to augment a pangenome graph using unassembled reads from newly sequenced samples that does not require to align them and genotype the new individuals. In this work we present the first assembly-free and mapping-free approach for augmenting an existing pangenome graph using unassembled long reads from an individual not already present in the pangenome. Our approach consists of finding sample specific sequences in reads using efficient indexes, clustering reads corresponding to the same novel variant(s), and then building a consensus sequence to be added to the pangenome graph for each variant separately. Using simulated reads based on Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) assemblies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for progressively augmenting the pangenome with long reads, without the need for de novo assembly or predicting genetic variants of the new sample.

Here, we used longitudinal in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to examine the activity of two cortical inhibitory neuron (IN) subtypes and excitatory corticostriatal projection neurons (CSPNs) in the motor cortex of R6/2 HD mouse model throughout disease progression. We found that motor deficits in R6/2 mice were accompanied by neuron type-specific abnormalities in movement-related activity, including hypoactivity of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-INs and CSPNs.

Since the intestine is the interface of host-microbe interactions, we conducted an analysis of the larval midgut transcriptome in presence or absence of an intestinal Lactobacilli strain representative of the Drosophila microbiota. Among the different biological processes identified, Ecdysone signaling has emerged as a new Lactobacilli-mediated signature. Through functional and morphometrical approaches, we show that, upon bacteria association, intestinal Ecdysone is not rate limiting for the larval systemic plastic growth but required for the adaptation of midgut growth to Lactobacilli. Our results reveal a tissue-specific contribution of the pleiotropic hormone Ecdysone in the control of midgut adaptive growth and maturation.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

It is, however, well-known that TEs can also be active in the soma, although the high-confidence detection of somatic events has been challenging. Here, we leveraged the high accuracy of PacBio HiFi long reads to evaluate the somatic mobility of TEs in individuals of an A. thaliana non-reference strain lacking activity of METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1), a major component of the DNA methylation maintenance machinery. Most somatically mobile families coincided with those found in germline studies of hypomethylated genotypes, although the exact TE copies differed. We also discovered mobile elements that had been missed by standard TE annotation methods. Somatic TE activity was variable among individual plants, but also within TE families. Finally, our approach pointed to the possible involvement of alternative transposition as a cause for somatic hypermutability in a region that contains two closely spaced VANDAL21 elements. We conclude that long-read sequencing can reveal widespread TE transposition in the soma of A. thaliana hypomethylated mutants. Assessing somatic instead of germline mobilization is a fast and reliable method to investigate different aspects of TE mobility at the single plant level.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

Mosquito vision plays a role in predator avoidance, mate finding, oviposition, locating vertebrate hosts, and vectoring disease. Recent work has shown that when sensitized to CO2, the visual responses of Aedes aegypti are wavelength-dependent, but little is known about how other olfactory stimuli can modulate visual responses. The visual cues associated with flowers, vertebrate hosts, or oviposition sites differs substantially and it is possible that odors might prime the mosquito visual system to respond to these different resources. To investigate the interplay of olfactory and visual cues, we adapted previously used wind tunnel bioassays to use quasi-monochromatic targets (390-740 nm) created with a novel LED synth. We coupled these visual targets with CO2 and the odors representative of vertebrate hosts, floral nectar or oviposition sites and assessed responses via 3D tracking of female mosquitos. When CO2 alone is present, we observe a lower preference for wavelengths in the green portion of the visible spectrum with a gradual increase as wavelengths moved towards the violet and red ends of the spectrum. However, when odors associated both with flowers and oviposition sites, we observed significant increases in mosquito preference for green (475-575 nm) stimuli. In contrast when vertebrate host odor was present, we saw increased preference for stimuli across the entire visible spectrum. These odor shifts in the mosquito spectral preferences suggest these preferences are not fixed and shift depending on behavioral context.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

Surprisingly, the expansion of these traditional European strains into other human-associated niches, including the human body, has been very limited. This is in stark contrast to the Mixed-origin clade commercial baking yeasts, which consists of only a few globally distributed clonal lineages that dominate the yeast market and recurrently colonize sourdoughs and human hosts. These clonal lineages consistently maintain their ploidy, unique heterozygous chromosomal rearrangements, and stable aneuploidies in addition to several diverse structural variants.

There is no approved medical treatment for these types of head injuries. To this end, we tested the healing effects of the psychedelic psilocybin, as it is known to reduce neuroinflammation and enhance neuroplasticity. Using a model of mild repetitive head injury in adult female rats, we provide unprecedented data that psilocybin can reduce vasogenic edema, restore normal vascular reactivity and functional connectivity, reduce phosphorylated tau buildup, enhance levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and its receptor TrkB, and modulate lipid signaling molecules.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

Many actin probes have been developed to visualize F-actin architectures in eukaryotic cells. However, it is known that double-stained images of F-actin obtained by two different types of actin probes often show partial inconsistencies. While developing actin probes, we observed that the merged images of three distinct actin probes, each labeled with a different fluorescent dye (red, green and blue), enabled various F-actin architectures to be distinguished based on color. This differentiation arises from slight variations in the distribution of each actin probe, and results in a unique color combination of actin probes that reflects the relative intensities of the three fluorescent dyes. In this report, we introduce a new cell staining method, named Actin Painting, which exploits the unique affinity of actin-binding molecules in each actin probe to F-actin architectures. This technique allows the classification of various cell types based on their specific actin cytoskeleton.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

The ribosomal RNAs (rRNA), which are essential components of the ribosome, are coded by the multi-copy ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Despite its highly conserved function, the rDNA displays substantial variation within all species analysed to date. This variation comprises both inter-individual differences in total copy number (CN) as well as inter- and intragenomic sequence variation in the form of single nucleotide variants (SNV) and insertions/deletions (INDELs) across rDNA copies. Whether germline variation of rDNA sequence associates with phenotypic traits in humans is, to date, unknown. Here, using the UK Biobank whole genome sequencing data, we first derive a high confidence list of rDNA-associated SNVs and INDELs that we validate in multiple ways. Using this list, we show that specific rDNA variants associate with several human traits. In particular, traits associated with body size appear enriched in variants within the Expansion Segment 15L region in the 28S rRNA. The strength of these associations does not diminish when accounting for the total rDNA CN of each individual. Our work represents the first large-scale association analysis of human traits with germline sequence variation in the rDNA, a source of human complex trait-relevant genetic variation that has thus far been largely ignored.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

Most cancer cells express two homologous isoforms (HK1 and HK2) that can each bind to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). CRISPR screens across hundreds of cancer cell lines indicate that both are dispensable for cell growth in traditional culture media. By contrast, HK2 deletion impairs cell growth in Human Plasma-Like Medium (HPLM). Here, we find that HK2 is required to maintain sufficient cytosolic (OMM-detached) HK activity under conditions that enhance HK1 binding to the OMM. Notably, OMM-detached rather than OMM-docked HK promotes aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), an enigmatic phenotype displayed by most proliferating cells. We show that several proposed theories for this phenotype cannot explain the HK2 dependence and instead find that HK2 deletion severely impairs glycolytic ATP production with little impact on total ATP yield for cells in HPLM. Our results reveal a basis for conditional HK2 essentiality and suggest that demand for compartmentalized ATP synthesis underlies the Warburg effect.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

Here, we introduce a refinement approach in which i) several initial models are generated by stochastic subsampling of the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) space in AlphaFold2, ii) the resulting models are subjected to structure-based clustering, iii) density-guided molecular dynamics simulations are performed from the centroid structures, and iv) a final model is selected on the basis of both map fit and model quality. This approach improves fitting accuracy compared to single starting point scenarios for three membrane proteins (the calcitonin receptor-like receptor, L-type amino acid transporter and alanine-serine-cysteine transporter which undergo substantial conformational transitions between functional states.

The gradient formation requires that the low molecular weight morphogens slow down their diffusion by at least one order of magnitude. However, the precise slow-down of diffusion across the relevant micrometre scales has not been directly observed. Here, we develop and employ Single-Plane Illumination Microscope based spatial Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy (SPIM-sFCCS) to directly measure the diffusion coefficient of the morphogen Squint in early zebrafish embryos as a function of topography and length scale. We show that Squint's diffusion coefficient changes on length scales that are commensurate with the diameter of the intercellular spaces in the embryo and that the slow-down is regulated by receptor binding. The slowdown can be reduced by either the knockdown of Activin receptor 2b, a receptor for Squint, or the overexpression of Lefty2, an inhibitor of Squint. Based on our results and supporting simulations, we propose an interstitial space-dependent transient receptor binding and diffusing mechanism to explain this slowdown, which is crucial for gradient formation and embryonic patterning.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

However, identifying the causal function of H3K4me3 in these diverse pathways remains a challenge, and we lack the tools to manipulate it for agricultural benefit. Here we use the CRISPR-based SunTag system to direct H3K4me3 methyltransferases in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Targeting of SunTag-SDG2 activates the expression of the endogenous reporter gene, FWA. We show that SunTag-SDG2 can be employed to increase pathogen resistance by targeting the H3K4me3-dependent disease resistance gene, SNC1. Meiotic crossover recombination rates impose a limit on the speed with which new traits can be transferred to elite crop varieties. We demonstrate that targeting of SunTag-SDG2 to low recombining centromeric regions can significantly stimulate crossover formation. Finally, we reveal that the effect is not specific to SDG2 and is likely dependent on the H3K4me3 mark itself, as the orthogonal mammalian-derived H3K4me3 methyltransferase, PRDM9, produces a similar effect on gene expression with reduced off-target potential. Overall, our study supports an instructive role for H3K4me3 in transcription and meiotic recombination and opens the door to precise modulation of important agricultural traits.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

We demonstrate the accuracy of such inferences using both simulations and data from humans. These results offer a new way to understand the effects of recombination on patterns of sequence data, as well as providing an example of how the internal workings of ML methods can give insight into biological processes.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

Compared to Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (EcoRNAP), MtbRNAP transcribes more slowly, has similar mechanical robustness, and only weakly recognizes E. coli pause sequences. The three small-molecule inhibitors of MtbRNAP exhibit strikingly different effects on transcription elongation. In the presence of D-IX216, which inhibits RNAP active-center bridge-helix motions required for nucleotide addition, the enzyme exhibits transitions between slowly and super-slowly elongating inhibited states. Stl, which inhibits the RNAP trigger-loop motions also required for nucleotide addition, inhibits RNAP primarily by inducing pausing and backtracking. PUM, a nucleoside analog of UTP, in addition to acting as a competitive inhibitor, induces the formation of slowly elongating RNAP inhibited states. Our results indicate that the three classes of small-molecule inhibitors affect the enzyme in distinct ways and show that the combination of Stl and D-IX216, which both target the RNAP bridge helix, has a strong synergistic effect on the enzyme.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

How cerebral blood perfusion maps onto micro-, meso- and macro-scale brain structure and function is therefore a key question in neuroscience. Here we analyze pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (ASL) data from 1 305 healthy individuals in the HCP Lifespan studies (5-100 years) to reconstruct a high-resolution normative cerebral blood perfusion map. At the cellular and molecular level, cerebral blood perfusion co-localizes with granular layer IV, biological pathways for maintenance of cellular relaxation potential and mitochondrial organization, and with neurotransmitter and neuropeptide receptors involved in vasomodulation. At the regional level, blood perfusion aligns with cortical arealization and is greatest in regions with high metabolic demand and resting-state functional hubs. Looking across individuals, blood perfusion is dynamic throughout the lifespan, follows microarchitectural changes in development, and maps onto individual differences in physiological changes in aging. In addition, we find that cortical atrophy in multiple neurodegenerative diseases (late-onset Alzheimers disease, TDP-43C, and dementia with Lewy bodies) is most pronounced in regions with lower perfusion, highlighting the utility of perfusion topography as an indicator of transdiagnostic vulnerability. Finally, we show that ASL-derived perfusion can be used to delineate arterial territories in a data-driven manner, providing insights into how the vascular system is linked to human brain function. Collectively, this work highlights how cerebral blood perfusion is central to, and interlinked with, multiple structural and functional systems in the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

While laboratory studies suggest a role for isoprene in plant defense, its function in plant-plant communication under natural conditions remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that isoprene acts as a signaling molecule, triggering systemic immune responses in neighboring plants against bacterial pathogens under field conditions. We established an experimental system using wild-type and transgenic silver birch (Betula pendula) lines engineered to emit varying levels of isoprene. Over two growing seasons, we examined the effects of birch-emitted volatile organic compounds on neighboring Arabidopsis thaliana, including wild-type and immune signaling mutants (llp1: legume lectin-like protein 1; jar1: jasmonate resistant 1). Isoprene emission rates positively correlated with systemic resistance in receiver plants, with higher emissions enhancing inhibition of Pseudomonas syringae growth. This immune response occurred independently of jasmonate signaling but required functional LLP1, suggesting a specific recognition pathway. By combining Arabidopsis mutant responses with birch volatile profiles, we confirmed that isoprene, rather than other terpenoids, mediates this effect. These findings reveal an unrecognized ecological function of isoprene as an airborne immune signal, establishing transgenic birch as a robust model for studying volatile-mediated plant defense networks in natural environments. Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant volatile perception and expand our understanding of chemical communication in terrestrial ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

While the predominant effect of DNA methylation in non-bivalent promoters is gene repression, we show that in bivalent promoters this often leads to gene activation. We demonstrate that gain of DNA methylation leads to reduced MTF2 binding and eviction of H3K27me3, a repressive mark that guards bivalent genes against activation. Our cancer patient data analyses reveal that in cancer, this mechanism likely leads to activation of a large group of transcription factors regulating pluripotency, apoptosis, and senescence signalling.

Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) utilises the pathogenicity island-encoded Accessory -arabinose Uptake (Aau) transporter to effectively colonise the mouse gut, hypothesised to be achieved via an enhanced capacity to scavenge -arabinose. Aau is regulated exclusively in response to -arabinose, but it is unclear how this system specifically benefits EHEC in vivo. Here, we show that Aau displays a >200-fold higher affinity for the monosaccharide D-ribulose, over -arabinose. EHEC cannot grow on D-ribulose as a sole carbon source and this sugar does not trigger aau transcription. However, Aau effectively transports D-ribulose into the cell only in the presence of -arabinose, where it feeds into the pentose phosphate pathway, after phosphorylation by the -ribulokinase AraB, thus providing EHEC a significant fitness advantage. EHEC has therefore evolved a mechanism of hijacking the canonical -arabinose utilisation machinery to promote D-ribulose utilisation in vivo. Furthermore, Citrobacter rodentium encodes an analogous system that exclusively transports D-ribulose and metabolises it via a dedicated D-ribulokinase. These unique mechanisms of D-ribulose utilisation suggest that convergent evolution has driven the ability of distinct pathogenic species to exploit this nutrient during invasion of the gut niche.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

Prevailing wisdom suggests somatic mutations are limited by evolved defences, either targeting DNA or post-mutational cellular states. Here, I analyse simple models for metazoans and humans in particular, incorporating the possibility that mutation rate trades off of organism longevity, defined as the age at which natural selection becomes negligible. The models assume selection acts to reduce mutation rate and prevent disease, both of which contribute to selecting for longer lifespan. We detail equilibrium conditions and find coevolutionary oscillations under certain parameter combinations. Notably, disease prevention can lead to mutational tolerance and this can contribute to explaining empirical cross-species patterns in longevity vs. mutation rate. We conclude that mutational disease and cancer in particular have required characteristics to be mediators of mutation rate-lifespan coevolution. The mutational tolerance that results from this coevolution can contribute to explaining the incidences of other diseases and conditions, including aging.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

ESM-Effect fine-tunes ESM2 PLM with an inductive bias regression head to achieve state-of-the-art performance. It surpasses the multi-modal state-of-the-art method PreMode, indicating redundancy of structural and evolutionary features, while training 6.7-times faster. In addition, we develop a benchmarking framework with robust test datasets and strategies, and propose a novel metric for prediction accuracy termed relative Bin-Mean Error (rBME): rBME emphasizes prediction accuracy in challenging, non-clustered, and rare gain-of-function regions and correlates more intuitively with model performance than commonly used Spearmans rho. Finally, we demonstrate partial generalization of ESM-Effect to unseen mutational regions within the same protein, illustrating its potential in precision medicine applications. Extending this generalization across different proteins remains a promising direction for future research.

While plants have remarkable regeneration ability, not all species, genotypes or even explants exhibit the same transformation and regeneration potential under in vitro conditions. To tackle this bottleneck, we have developed a seamless and user-friendly system to induce transgenic and gene-edited de novo meristems via a synthetic cascade comprising a wound-induced regeneration pathway, plant developmental regulators (DRs) and gene-editing reagents. WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION 1 (WIND1) is used as a transcriptional regulator to control the expression of various DR genes through ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION 1 (ESR1) promoter. This cascade was strategically applied in planta to the non-meristematic internode of N. benthamiana to induce meristematic activity and regenerate de novo shoots with knock-out mutations of the phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene. This synthetic toolkit was further applied successfully to tomato and soybean. This methodology offers a transformative approach to overcome barriers in plant biotechnology, potentially accelerating the generation of transgenic and gene-edited plants without reliance on conventional tissue-culture intermediates.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

Visual cortex hyperexcitability has been observed consistently across different migraine subtypes. During cortical hyperexcitability events, aberrant neurotransmitter release drives heightened G-coupled receptor signaling in cortical astrocytes, which in turn release gliotransmitters and other factors with algesic properties. This study investigated whether heightened activation of cortical astrocytes Gq-coupled signaling is sufficient to drive peripheral meningeal nociceptive responses linked to the generation of migraine headaches. Using a rat model, we employed an AAV-based chemogenetic approach that allows selective activation of visual cortex astrocyte Gq-GPCR signaling. We combined this chemogenetic approach with in vivo single-unit recording of trigeminal meningeal nociceptors to assess changes in their ongoing activity and mechanosensitivity. We further used behavioral testing of migraine-like behaviors and pharmacological targeting of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), using a monoclonal antibody (anti-CGRP mAb) to further assess the relevance of cortical astrocyte activation to migraine. We discovered that heightened activation of Gq-coupled signaling in visual cortex astrocytes drives persistent discharge and increased mechanosensitivity of trigeminal nociceptors innervating the meninges overlying the visual cortex. Cortical astrocytic activation also generated cephalic mechanical pain hypersensitivity, reduced exploratory behavior, and anxiety-like behaviors linked to migraine headaches. Targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide signaling, implicated in migraine pathophysiology, using a monoclonal antibody effectively suppressed astrocyte-mediated meningeal nociceptor discharge and alleviated migraine-related behaviors. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for augmented visual cortex astrocyte signaling as a triggering factor sufficient to generate meningeal nociception and migraine pain and greatly expand our understanding of migraine pathophysiology.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

This paper evaluates the hypothesis that yeasts can reshape intrinsic individual differences in nectar traits. We address the question, Do local genotypes of the nectar yeast specialist Metschnikowia reukaufii have the ability of obfuscating intrinsic individual variation among Helleborus foetidus plants in nectar sugar concentration ? An array of paired plant-yeast genotypes mimicking a natural field situation was created in the laboratory by inoculating nectar from different plant individuals with different yeast genotypes following a factorial design. Chemical analyses of nectar sugars before and after exposure to yeasts were performed using ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography. Plant individual, yeast genotype, and their interaction all had strong, significant effects on sucrose concentration of H. foetidus nectar. Metabolic activity of yeasts abolished 79% of intrinsic variance among plants in nectar sucrose concentration, considerably reducing the opportunity for selection by pollinators on this important nectar trait. We propose that pollinator selection on nectar traits of plant x yeast combinations will supersede ""naive"" selection on plants' intrinsic nectar traits, and that nectar phenotypes found by pollinators will largely represent extended phenotypes of the yeast genotype(s) living in the nectar.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

Here, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen to identify host restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2, revealing DAZAP2 as a potent antiviral gene. DAZAP2, previously implicated in SARS-CoV-2 restriction, is found to inhibit viral entry by blocking virion fusion with both endolysosomal and plasma membranes. Additionally, DAZAP2 suppresses genomic RNA replication without affecting the primary translation of viral replicases. We demonstrate that DAZAP2 functions as a pan-coronavirus restriction factor across four genera of coronaviruses. Importantly, knockout of DAZAP2 enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection in mouse models and in human primary airway epithelial cells, confirming its physiological relevance. Mechanistically, antiviral activity of DAZAP2 appears to be indirect, potentially through the regulation of host gene expression, as it primarily localizes to the nucleus. Our findings provide new insights into the host defense system against coronaviruses and highlight DAZAP2 as a potential target for host-directed antiviral therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

The mechanisms by which neuronal circuits discriminate and encode the source of sensory signals remain elusive. To address this, we utilized as a model the posterior lateral line system of larval zebrafish, which is used to detect water currents. This system comprises a series of mechanosensory organs called neuromasts, which are innervated by neurons from the posterior lateral line ganglion. By combining single-neuromast optogenetic stimulation with whole-brain calcium imaging, we developed a novel approach to investigate how inputs from neuromasts are processed. Upon stimulating individual neuromasts, we observed that neurons in the brain of the zebrafish show diverse selectivity properties despite a lack of topographic organization in second-order circuits. We further demonstrated that complex combinations of neuromast stimulation are represented by sparse ensembles of neurons within the medial octavolateralis nucleus (MON) and found that neuromast input can be integrated nonlinearly. Our approach offers an innovative method for spatiotemporally interrogating the zebrafish lateral line system and presents a valuable model for studying whole-brain sensory encoding.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

To assess differences within the basin, we subdivided the Mediterranean Sea into three subregions - Western, Eastern and Adriatic. Our work revealed significant climatic and anthropogenic impacts on three species: the banded-dye murex, the Atlantic bluefin tuna and the gilthead sea bream. Climate change, particularly temperature changes, influenced the abundance and body size of Atlantic bluefin tuna, while subregional differences in the stable isotopic composition of archaeological skeletal material reflected shifts in the system's primary productivity. Human activities, particularly overexploitation, impacted the abundance of both banded-dye murex and Atlantic bluefin tuna, as well as the body size of gilthead sea bream and Atlantic bluefin tuna. These results highlight the significance of studying the relationships between climate, human activities, and marine resources in this large marine ecosystem. As well as integrating past data with contemporary data to reconstruct ecological baselines and obtain longer and more comprehensive time series of ecosystem change.

Here, we investigated the extent of KC plasticity and the impact of origin in mycobacterial infections that target macrophages and can persist for months. Fate-mapping combined with high-resolution imaging revealed the emergence of a unique, infection specific KC subset which downregulated the signature markers CLEC4F and VSIG4 (''KClow''). KClow were derived from bona fide KCs and located exclusively to granuloma cores. In contrast, monocyte-derived macrophages were contained at the granuloma borders and contributed to this tissue reaction. ATAC and single-cell RNA sequencing identified a specific signature of KClow with high antimycobacterial activity and specialization to a hypoxic microenvironment. Despite their fundamental deviation from the classical KC phenotype, KClow showed remarkable adaptability, and were capable to return to a homeostatic-like KC state. Accordingly, mycobacterial infections unmask KCs as highly plastic cells, capable of responding to extreme environmental changes.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

To address this, we develop ambisim, a genotype-aware read-level simulator that can flexibly control ambient molecule proportions and generate realistic joint snRNA/snATAC data. We use ambisim to evaluate demultiplexing methods across several important parameters: doublet rate, number of multiplexed donors, and coverage levels. Our simulations reveal that methods are variably impacted by ambient contamination in both modalities. We then applied the demultiplexing methods to two joint snRNA/snATAC datasets and found highly variable concordance between methods in both modalities.

The mechanisms that sense and mediate host tolerance to ROS are little understood.

Relative to other giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea and Chelonoidis abingdonii), we found Jonathan has gene variants in pathways associated with aging, including DNA repair and telomere regulation. Consistent with his advanced age, Jonathan has significant age-related changes in DNA methylation and methylation entropy, compared with a 5-year-old Aldabra individual. Notably, we found that low entropy regions in Jonathans methylome were enriched for genes involved in the electron transport chain. This suggests that high-fidelity transcription of these genes may be crucial for extreme longevity. With this data, we propose a model for aging, that links efficient mitochondrial energy production with nuclear maintenance of low methylation entropy.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

Cell cycle associated genes expression in early progenitors at the crux of fate decision trajectories were correlated with cortical growth rate from 6-12 months of age, and were enriched in microcephaly and neurodevelopmental disorder genes. Our data suggest the hCOs capture inter-individual variation in cortical cell types influencing infant cortical surface area expansion.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

While training CNNs on brain-relevant object-recognition tasks may be an important pre-requisite to predict brain activity, the CNN's brain-like architecture alone may already allow for accurate prediction of neural activity. Here, we evaluated the performance of both task-optimized and brain-optimized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in predicting neural responses across visual cortex, and performed systematic architectural manipulations and comparisons between trained and untrained feature extractors to reveal key structural components influencing model performance. For human and monkey area V1, random-weight CNNs employing the ReLU activation function, combined with either average or max pooling, significantly outperformed other activation functions. Random-weight CNNs matched their trained counterparts in predicting V1 responses. The extent to which V1 responses can be predicted correlated strongly with the neural network's complexity, which reflects the non-linearity of neural activation functions and pooling operations. However, this correlation between encoding performance and complexity was significantly weaker for higher visual areas that are classically associated with object recognition, such as monkey IT. To test whether this difference between visual areas reflects functional differences, we trained neural network models on both texture discrimination and object recognition tasks. %, and analyzed the relationship between model complexity and task performance. Consistent with our hypothesis, model complexity correlated more strongly with performance on texture discrimination than object recognition. Our findings indicate that random-weight CNNs with sufficient model complexity allow for comparable prediction of V1 activity as trained CNNs, while higher visual areas require precise weight configurations acquired through training via gradient descent.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

However, its clinical use is threatened by the emergence of bedaquiline-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Bedaquiline targets mycobacterial ATP synthase but the predominant route to clinical bedaquiline resistance is via upregulation of the MmpS5L5 efflux pump due to mutations that inactivate the transcriptional repressor Rv0678. Here, we show that the MmpS5L5 efflux pump reduces susceptibility to bedaquiline as well as its new, more potent derivative TBAJ-876 and other antimicrobial substrates, including clofazimine and the DprE1 inhibitors PBTZ-169 and OPC-167832. Furthermore, the increased resistance of Rv0678 mutants stems entirely from increased MmpS5L5 activity. These results highlight the potential of a pharmacological MmpS5L5 inhibitor to increase drug efficacy. Verapamil, primarily used as a calcium channel inhibitor, is known to inhibit diverse efflux pumps and to potentiate bedaquiline and clofazimine activity in M. tuberculosis. Here, we show that verapamil potentiates the activity of multiple diverse MmpS5L5 substrates. Using biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that verapamil does not exert this effect by acting as a disruptor of the protonmotive force used to power MmpS5L5, as previously proposed, suggesting that verapamil inhibits the function of the MmpS5L5 pump. Finally, norverapamil, the major verapamil metabolite, which has greatly reduced calcium channel activity, has equal potency in reducing resistance to MmpS5L5 substrates. Our findings highlight verapamils potential for enhancing bedaquiline TB treatment, for preventing acquired resistance to bedaquiline and other MmpS5L5 substrates, while also providing the impetus to identify additional MmpS5L5 inhibitors.

Significance StatementBedaquiline, an antitubercular drug targeting ATP synthase, forms the backbone of highly efficacious treatment regimens for drug-resistant tuberculosis. Bedaquiline resistance is emerging as a significant problem and is most commonly caused by mutations in Rv0678 that result in upregulation of the MmpS5L5 efflux pump. Here we define the contribution of the MmpS5L5 efflux pump to drug resistance in wild-type and Rv0678 mutant strains and show that the commonly used drug verapamil can inhibit MmpS5L5 activity. This suggests that this safe and inexpensive drug may be useful in enhancing bedaquiline treatment of TB and to help prevent bedaquiline acquired resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

The mechanism that mediates chromosome segregation in archaea remains enigmatic, despite the centre-stage role assumed by these organisms in the discourse about the origin of eukaryotes. Previously, we identified two proteins, SegA and SegB, which form a minimalist chromosome partition machine in Sulfolobales. Here we uncover patterns and mechanisms that the SegAB system employs to link chromosome organization to genome segregation. Deletion of the genes causes growth and chromosome partition defects. SegB binds to multiple sites scattered across the chromosome, but mainly localised close to the segAB locus in most archaeal genera. The sites are predominantly intragenic and enriched in one of the two compartments into which the chromosome folds. We show that SegB coalesces into multiple foci through the nucleoid, exhibiting a biased localisation towards the cell periphery, which hints at potential tethers to the cell membrane. The short-range DNA compaction activity of SegB and long-range looping of distant sites point to a significant role for SegB in chromosome condensation that in turn enables genome segregation. Collectively, our data put forward SegAB as important players in bridging chromosome organization to genome segregation in archaea.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

This study unveils a previously unknown regulatory mechanism in mast cell biology: de novo steroidogenesis. Through comprehensive multi-omics analysis and functional assays, we demonstrate that mast cells express Cyp11a1 and produce pregnenolone, representing a primitive form of steroidogenesis. This cell-intrinsic steroidogenic pathway is essential for mast cell development, survival, and functional regulation. Genetic abrogation of mast cell steroidogenesis leads to exaggerated inflammatory and anaphylactic responses in vivo. Our integrative approach reveals extensive transcriptional and proteomic remodelling during mast cell regranulation, with steroidogenesis playing a pivotal role in coordinating recovery and tissue repair processes. We uncover significant sexual dimorphism in mast cell proteomes and a global uncoupling of transcriptional and translational programmes. These findings advance our understanding of mast cell physiology and provide a foundation for developing targeted therapies for mast cell-associated pathologies.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

Despite microscopic idiosyncrasies of mutational effects, laboratory evolution experiments showed consistent patterns of declining adaptability, indicating some underlying 'rule' that dictates mutational effects. Recently, global epistasis showed that mutations become less beneficial as the fitness of the genetic background in which they occur increases, thus making epistasis predictable. However, there exists no mechanistic explanation of this fitness dependence of fitness effects. In this work, we use a prokaryotic cell growth and division model based on metabolic sizing to study the mechanistic basis, and predict the likelihood of global epistasis. We report two important results. One, although the average extent of global epistasis does not change with genetic variation, the likelihood of strong global epistasis decreases as genetic variation increases. Two, the fitness effects of mutations in the slow reaction modules are well predicted using the global epistasis approach. Therefore, when the fitness of the cell is contingent on a rate-limiting step, mutations in that step are well-predicted by the fitness of the background in which they occur. Thus, declining adaptability is a consequence of evolution acting in a step-wise fashion to improve the slowest modules in a cell. Overall, our work offers a first-principle explanation of global epistasis and declining adaptability.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

Our findings suggest that mediating bulk lipid transport between the ER and the PM is a key function of this protein as BLTP2 tethers the ER to tubular endosomes only after they become continuous with the PM and that it also tethers the ER to macropinosomes in the process of fusing with the PM. We further identify interactions underlying binding of BLTP2 to the PM, including phosphoinositides, the adaptor proteins FAM102A and FAM102B, and also N-BAR domain proteins at membrane-connected tubules. The absence of BLTP2 results in the accumulation of intracellular vacuoles, many of which are connected to the plasma membrane, pointing to a role of the lipid transport function of BLTP2 in the control of PM dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

However, the suitability of PCA is contingent on appropriate normalization and transformation of count data, and accurate selection of the number of principal components; improper choices can result in the loss of biological information or corruption of the signal due to excessive noise. Typical approaches to these challenges rely on heuristics that lack theoretical foundations. In this work, we present Biwhitened PCA (BiPCA), a theoretically grounded framework for rank estimation and data denoising across a wide range of omics modalities. BiPCA overcomes a fundamental difficulty with handling count noise in omics data by adaptively rescaling the rows and columns -- a rigorous procedure that standardizes the noise variances across both dimensions. Through simulations and analysis of over 100 datasets spanning seven omics modalities, we demonstrate that BiPCA reliably recovers the data rank and enhances the biological interpretability of count data. In particular, BiPCA enhances marker gene expression, preserves cell neighborhoods, and mitigates batch effects. Our results establish BiPCA as a robust and versatile framework for high-throughput count data analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

However, the sparse nature of the scRNA-seq data with many zero counts or missing values presents a major challenge to its analysis. The presence of low-quality cells further complicates the analysis. Here, we showed that the trans-differentiation of plasmablasts (activated plasma cells) into neutrophils reported in COVID patients (Wilk et al., 2020 in Nature Medicine) was an artefact of trajectory analysis. It was caused by ~30 low-quality cells linking the 2 cell populations that are of unrelated lineages in hematopoietic differentiation. Such artefacts are not readily spotted during the current practice of peer reviews as the current statistical guidelines of most journals are not catered for big data such as that of scRNA-seq. New standards of statistics and quality control measures for machine algorithms are not in place and they are urgently needed to safeguard against over-interpretation of high dimensional data.

A powerful framework for understanding neural computation uses neural dynamics - the rules that describe the temporal evolution of neural activity - to explain how goal-directed input-output transformations occur. As dynamical rules are not directly observable, we need computational models that can infer neural dynamics from recorded neural activity. We typically validate such models using synthetic datasets with known ground-truth dynamics, but unfortunately existing synthetic datasets don not reflect fundamental features of neural computation and are thus poor proxies for neural systems. Further, the field lacks validated metrics for quantifying the accuracy of the dynamics inferred by models. The Computation-through-Dynamics Benchmark (CtDB) fills these critical gaps by providing: 1) synthetic datasets that reflect computational properties of biological neural circuits, 2) interpretable metrics for quantifying model performance, and 3) a standardized pipeline for training and evaluating models with or without known external inputs. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how CtDB can help guide the development, tuning, and troubleshooting of neural dynamics models. In summary, CtDB provides a critical platform for model developers to better understand and characterize neural computation through the lens of dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

In spite of this overwhelming disease prevalence and staggering cost, its severe impact on patients lives and intense global research efforts, study of the disease has proved challenging due to its complexity. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified only four loci potentially associated with the disease, although these results did not statistically replicate between studies. A previous combinatorial analysis study identified a total of 73 genes that were highly associated with two long COVID cohorts in the predominantly (>91%) white European ancestry Sano GOLD population, and we sought to reproduce these findings in the independent and ancestrally more diverse All of Us (AoU) population.

MethodsWe assessed the reproducibility of the 5,343 long COVID disease signatures from the original study in the AoU population. Because the very small population sizes provide very limited power to replicate findings, we initially tested whether we observed a statistically significant enrichment of the Sano GOLD disease signatures that are also positively correlated with long COVID in the AoU cohort after controlling for population substructure.

ResultsFor the Sano GOLD disease signatures that have a case frequency greater than 5% in AoU, we consistently observed a significant enrichment (77% - 83%, p < 0.01) of signatures that are also positively associated with long COVID in the AoU cohort. These encompassed 92% of the genes identified in the original study. At least five of the disease signatures found in Sano GOLD were also shown to be individually significantly associated with increased long COVID prevalence in the AoU population. Rates of signature reproducibility are strongest among self-identified white patients, but we also observe significant enrichment of reproducing disease associations in self-identified black/African-American and Hispanic/Latino cohorts. Signatures associated with 11 out of the 13 drug repurposing candidates identified in the original Sano GOLD study were reproduced in this study.

ConclusionThese results demonstrate the reproducibility of long COVID disease signal found by combinatorial analysis, broadly validating the results of the original analysis. They provide compelling evidence for a much broader array of genetic associations with long COVID than previously identified through traditional GWAS studies. This strongly supports the hypothesis that genetic factors play a critical role in determining an individuals susceptibility to long COVID following recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. It also lends weight to the drug repurposing candidates identified in the original analysis. Together these results may help to stimulate much needed new precision medicine approaches to more effectively diagnose and treat the disease.

This is also the first reproduction of long COVID genetic associations across multiple populations with substantially different ancestry distributions. Given the high reproducibility rate across diverse populations, these findings may have broader clinical application and promote better health equity. We hope that this will provide confidence to explore some of these mechanisms and drug targets and help advance research into novel ways to diagnose the disease and accelerate the discovery and selection of better therapeutic options, both in the form of newly discovered drugs and/or the immediate prioritization of coordinated investigations into the efficacy of repurposed drug candidates.","NA","medrxiv",1739138885586

To address this limitation, we developed Plexus, a novel self-supervised model specifically designed to capture and quantify network-level neuronal activity dynamics. Unlike existing phenotyping tools that focus on static readouts, Plexus leverages a novel network-level cell encoding method, which enables it to efficiently encode dynamic neuronal activity data into rich representational embeddings.

We validated Plexus using a comprehensive GCaMP6m simulation framework and demonstrated its enhanced ability to classify distinct neuronal activity phenotypes compared to traditional signal-processing approaches. To enable practical application, we integrated Plexus with a scalable experimental system utilizing human iPSC-derived neurons equipped with the GCaMP6m calcium indicator and CRISPR interference machinery. This integrated platform successfully identified nearly twice as many distinct phenotypic changes in response to genetic perturbations compared to conventional methods, as demonstrated in a 52-gene CRISPRi screen across multiple iPSC lines.

We obtained the VA Frailty Index from VA CDW (Corporate Data Warehouse).

ResultsWe included 106 patients from the Long COVID clinic and 97 from the frailty clinic. Patients from the Long COVID clinic were significantly younger than those from the frailty clinic (60{+/-}12.6 vs.. 79.8{+/-}5.8, p<0.01). In the standard frailty group, weakness and slowness were the predominant features present in both the frail and pre-frail groups, with increasing exhaustion and lower activity in the frail group. Patients with frailty in the Long COVID group experienced exhaustion and low activity at a higher rate than those in the Geriatric frailty clinic.

ConclusionsLong COVID may predispose patients to develop a subtype of frailty (""post-viral frailty"") that presents with a higher frequency of exhaustion and low activity. This frailty appears phenotypically different from the frailty encountered in geriatric patients with multimorbidity, which presents more often with slowness and weakness as the initial drivers.","NA","medrxiv",1739138885586

However, while myriad studies have investigated relationships between MGEs and variation in fitness among microbial and eukaryotic hosts, few studies have incorporated this variation into the context of MGE evolution and ecology. Combining HiC-resolved metagenomics with the model honey bee worker gut microbiome, we show that the worker gut contains a dense, nested MGE community that exhibits a wide degree of host range variation among microbial hosts. Using measures of gene similarity and syntenty, we show that plasmids likely mediate gene flow between individual honey bee colonies, though these plasmids exhibit broad host range variation within their individual microbiomes. We further show that phage-microbe networks exhibit high variation among individual metagenomes, and that phages show broad host range with respect to both the number and phylogenetic distance of their hosts. Finally, we provide evidence that measures of nucleotide variation positively correlate with host range in bee-associated phages, and that functional targets of diversifying selection are partitioning differently between broad or narrow host range phages. Our work underscores the variability of MGE x microbial interactions within host-associated microbial communities and highlights the genomic variation associated with MGE host range diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586
"Non-Redundant Roles of Topoisomerase 2α and 2β in the Cytosolic Replication of Vaccinia Virus","10.1101/2025.02.05.636656","biorxiv",7.25,0,7.25,7.25,7.25,"Dalla Rosa, I.; Way, M.","Michael Way","The Francis Crick Institute","2025-02-06","1","new results","cc_by","cell biology","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2025/02/06/2025.02.05.636656.source.xml","Vaccinia virus is a large enveloped DNA virus, which, like all poxviruses, replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Vaccinia was historically thought to encode all the proteins required for its replication. However, recent findings have shown that nuclear host proteins are redirected to the cytoplasm to facilitate viral replication. Among these, topoisomerase 2 (TOP2A) and 2{beta} (TOP2B), which mediate nuclear transcription, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation are the most abundant host proteins associated with nascent viral genomes. Here, we investigate the mechanisms driving TOP2A and TOP2B cytoplasmic translocation and their role in viral replication. We found that early viral protein synthesis induces the cytosolic relocalization of both isoforms, which are subsequently recruited to viral factories by an interaction of their C-terminal domains with the viral ligase, A50. TOP2A promotes replication by interacting with the vaccinia DNA replication machinery. In contrast, TOP2B suppresses replication by enhancing the formation of double-stranded RNA and antiviral granules, containing components of the tRNA splicing ligase complex. Our analysis provides new insights into host-pathogen interactions during poxvirus infection and the role of topoisomerase 2 outside of the nucleus.","NA","biorxiv",1739138885586

The aim of the reCOVer trial was to investigate safety, tolerability and clinical effects of BC007 on fatigue, its severity and quality of life in PCS patients.

MethodsreCOVer is a prospective, exploratory, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover phase IIa clinical trial with 1350 mg BC007 at the University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany. Eligible participants were 18-80 years with GPCR-fAAb, whose PCS symptoms persisted [&ge;]3 months after PCR-confirmed COVID-19, with fatigue as the major symptom (Bell score [&le;]60) and at least three of eight defined PCS symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) according to a crossover design to either receive BC007 (sequence A) or placebo (sequence B) at day 0 and day 48 with a follow-up of 28 days, respectively. A crossover design was chosen to increase patient adherence. Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in comparison between sequence A and B from d0 to d28 and d0 to d70 were the primary and co-primary endpoint, respectively.

FindingsBetween 31.10.2023 and 12.06.2024, 30 PCS patients were randomised and analysed. The trial has been concluded. Summarising all AE rates, no statistically significant differences between sequence A und sequence B were observed within day 28 and day 70. One report of a serious adverse event, not related to treatment, was recorded. As a secondary endpoint, BC007 showed a significant improvement on self-reported fatigue and its severity, as well as quality of life.

InterpretationAs BC007 was well tolerated and showed a significant improvement of fatigue and quality of life, it might offer a therapeutic option for an autoimmune subgroup of PCS patients.

To enable a more reliable and rigorous evaluation of NPIs based on time series data, we reanalyse the data for the original official evaluation of NPIs in Germany using an ensemble of 9 competitive statistical methods for estimating the effects of NPIs and other determinants of disease spread on the effective reproduction number [R](t) and the associated error bars. A proper error analysis for time series data leads to significantly wider confidence intervals than the official evaluation. In addition to vaccination and seasonality, only few NPIs - such as restrictions in public spaces - can be confidently associated with variations in [R](t), but even then effect sizes have large uncertainties. Furthermore, due to multicollinearity in NPI activation patterns, it is difficult to distinguish potential effects of NPIs in public spaces from other interventions that came into force early, such as physical distancing. In future, NPIs should be more carefully designed and accompanied by plans for data collections to allow for a timely evaluation of benefits and harms as a basis for an effective and proportionate response.","NA","medrxiv",1739138885586
