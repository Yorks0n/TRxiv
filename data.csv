Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1740089312976

Currently, limited information exists about long-term oral health manifestations in COVID-19 patients with limited healthcare access. Methods: We conducted a sequential, cross-sectional study (December 2020-March 2024) to assess how racial/ethnic differences (Black/Hispanic vs White/Asian) and health disparities affect oral and non-oral long COVID symptoms and their relationship with COVID-19 vaccination. We retrospectively reviewed patients oral health record from University of Illinois Chicago dental clinics before vaccination (December 2020; N=1150; Covid+/- N=575/group) and after vaccination (December 2021; N=592; Covid+/- N=292/group). Participants were recruited in two separate prospective groups of COVID-19 positive subjects (February-April 2021; pre-vaccination: N=158; January-March 2024; post-vaccination: N=171), we examined clinical indicators of oral (periodontal and salivary glands) and non-oral (neurologic) sequalae 3-6 months after initial exposure. We measured viral S protein by flow cytometry and quantified inflammatory markers, viral entry receptors, and oral viral load to correlate molecular, and cellular changes in COVID-19 positive subjects before and after vaccination. Results: Our results identified racial disparity indicating oral associated post-acute sequelae (PASC) primarily manifested as periodontal (gum) disease (COVID-19 positive: ~73% vs COVID-19 negative: ~33%) and correlated with higher rates of dry mouth (57.5%), taste disturbance (47%), and smell loss (20%). Vaccination reduced oral PASC in COVID-19 positive subjects; however, periodontal disease indicators persisted compared to the COVID-19 negative group. Notably, 3-6 months post-infection, while SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) transcript was rarely detected in saliva (~6%), its protein was commonly detected (~70%) in the COVID-19 positive subjects indicating incomplete viral clearance. This correlates with significantly higher salivary expression of viral entry receptors (ACE2, and TRMPSS2), and inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-8), in COVID-19 positive subjects. This finding was further supported by higher prevalence of other oral viruses including Epstein-Barr Virus (70.5%), Herpes Simplex Virus (8.1%), and Human Papillomavirus (17.5%) in COVID-19 positive subjects. Interpretation: COVID-19 history significantly correlates with severe oral health complications in predominantly Black communities, while vaccination reduced but did not eliminate these issues. The oral cavity serves as a long-term viral reservoir, and periodontal inflammation with increased oral viral presence in COVID-positive patients may increase susceptibility to oral and non-oral viral diseases and identify risk for long COVID.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

Here, we challenge the ability of a recently developed LLM-based platform, AI co-scientist, to generate high-level hypotheses by posing a question that took years to resolve experimentally but remained unpublished: How could capsid-forming phage-inducible chromosomal islands (cf-PICIs) spread across bacterial species? Remarkably, AI co-scientist top-ranked hypothesis matched our experimentally confirmed mechanism: cf-PICIs hijack diverse phage tails to expand their host range. We critically assess its five highest-ranked hypotheses, showing that some opened new research avenues in our laboratories. We benchmark its performance against other LLMs and outline best practices for integrating AI into scientific discovery. Our findings suggest that AI can act not just as a tool but as a creative engine, accelerating discovery and reshaping how we generate and test scientific hypotheses.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

These structural differences may reflect evolutionary changes in the developmental expression of shared genes. To investigate this possibility, we compared cell-type-specific developmental gene expression across species in the developing mouse and human neocortex, and human cortical organoids, by developing a shared transcriptional reference framework. This identified genes with conserved/divergent expression patterns, providing a molecular foundation to interrogate species-specific cellular properties. Using this resource, we discovered that the transcription factor JUNB is expressed in human but not mouse progenitors. Through cell-typespecific gain- and loss-of-function experiments in mice and human organoids, we demonstrate that JUNB bidirectionally controls human cortical features, including progenitor proliferation rates, neuronal production timing, and total neuronal output. This reveals how cell-type-specific regulation of shared genes during development can drive species-specific cortical features, providing a framework for understanding the molecular basis of cortical evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

In this study, we integrated single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate an atlas of cell types and expression domains during the early stages of wheat spike development. We characterized spatiotemporal expression of 99 genes by smFISH in 48,225 cells at the early transition (W1.5), late double ridge (W2.5) and lemma primordia (W3.25) stages. These cells were clustered into 21 different expression domains, including four beneath the developing spikelets and three different meristematic regions, which were consistent across spikelets and sections. We also identified genes differentially expressed during the transition of the inflorescence meristem into a terminal spikelet. The smFISH study was complemented by the scRNA-seq profiling of 26,009 cells from W2.5 and W3.25 that were clustered into 23 distinct cell types. We annotated the single-cell clusters as meristem, boundary domains, cortex, central spike, epidermis, and vasculature by using known markers, co-expression analysis of genes selected from the smFISH study, and correlation matrices of clusters identified in both studies. The scRNA-seq data uncovered genes associated with boundary genes TCP24 and FZP, as well as the meristematic genes AGL6 and ULT1. The smFISH and scRNA-seq studies provided complementary tools for characterizing the gene networks that regulate spike development, supporting the functional characterization of key regulatory genes, and informing the engineering of more productive wheat spikes.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

However, how NR5A2 differentially regulates transcriptional networks at distinct developmental stages remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate the dynamics of chromatin binding profiles of NR5A2 from the 2-cell to morula stage, which corresponds to the totipotency-to-pluripotency transition. Our NR5A2 CUT&Tag analysis identifies lineage-determining factor KLF and GATA families as co-regulators for NR5A2 in mouse embryos. We find that KLF5 cooperates with NR5A2 to enhance H3K27ac deposition, and NR5A2 predominantly promotes chromatin accessibility. NR5A2 regulates Xist expression either directly or indirectly through its role in up-regulating GATA factor expression. In vitro assays reveal that NR5A2 co-binds to nucleosomes with KLF5 and GATA6, suggesting that these pioneer transcription factors can simultaneously bind to the chromatin. Our findings highlight the role of NR5A2 in ensuring robust gene activation during pre-implantation development through feed-forward regulatory loops with lineage-determining transcription factors.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

In this study, we established a working model to investigate chromosome dynamics in S. aureus using a Fluorescent Repressor-Operator System (FROS), which enabled precise localization of specific chromosomal loci. This approach revealed that the S. aureus cell cycle and chromosome replication cycle are not coupled, with cells exhibiting two segregated origins of replication at the start of the cell cycle. The chromosome has a specific origin/terminus/origin conformation, with origins localizing near the membrane, towards the tip of each hemisphere, or the cell poles. We further used this system to assess the role of various proteins with a role in S. aureus chromosome biology, focusing on the ParB/parS and SMC/ScpAB systems. Our results demonstrate that ParB binds five parS chromosomal sequences and the resulting complexes influence chromosome conformation, but play a minor role in chromosome compaction and segregation. In contrast, the SMC/ScpAB complex plays a key role in S. aureus chromosome biology, contributing to chromosome compaction, segregation and spatial organization. Additionally, we systematically assessed and compared the impact of proteins linking chromosome segregation to cell division (Noc, FtsK, SpoIIIE and XerC) on origin and terminus number and positioning. This work provides a comprehensive study of the factors governing chromosome dynamics and organization in S. aureus, contributing to our knowledge on chromosome biology of spherical bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

In frogs, however, odontogenesis is delayed, occurring instead during the postembryonic metamorphosis. Nearly all adult frogs have teeth on the upper jaw and lack lower jaw dentition, but a single species re-evolved mandibular teeth. Developmental-genetic mechanisms that underlie tooth formation in frogs are poorly understood, including whether an ancestral program is partially retained in the lower jaw that could facilitate the evolutionary reappearance of lost mandibular teeth. Using a developmental series of an unconventional model species, we assessed 1) if the gene network underlying odontogenic competence is conserved in the late-forming teeth of frogs; 2) if unique keratinized mouthparts, which function as an alternative feeding tool in anuran larvae, impede tooth induction; and 3) if transient tooth rudiments form in the anuran mandible. The tooth development network is conserved in the frog upper jaw, which displays dental expression patterns comparable to those of other vertebrates. There is, however, no evidence of tooth development in the mandible. Teeth emerge before keratinized mouthparts degenerate, but their location may be spatially constrained by keratin, and gene expression patterns of keratinized mouthparts and teeth overlap. We hypothesize that the novel mouthparts of tadpoles did not arise de novo but instead originated by partially co-opting the developmental program that typically mediates true tooth development.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

SOS splicing, which operates independently of the spliceosome, is a pattern recognition system triggered by base-pairing of inverted terminal repeat elements, which are a defining feature of the DNA transposons. We identify three factors required for SOS splicing in both C. elegans and human cells; AKAP17A, which binds TE-containing mRNAs; the RNA ligase RTCB; and CAAP1, which bridges RTCB and AKAP17A, allowing RTCB to ligate mRNA fragments generated by TE excision. We propose that SOS splicing is a novel, conserved, and RNA structure-directed mode of mRNA splicing and that one function of SOS splicing is to genetically buffer animals from the deleterious effects of TE-mediated gene perturbation.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

However, prioritizing causal common and rare non-coding variants in human disease, and understanding how selective pressures have shaped the non-coding genome, remains a significant challenge. Here, we predicted the effects of 15 million variants with deep learning models trained on single- cell ATAC-seq across 132 cellular contexts in adult and fetal brain and heart, producing nearly two billion context-specific predictions. Using these predictions, we distinguish candidate causal variants underlying human traits and diseases and their context-specific effects. While common variant effects are more cell-type-specific, rare variants exert more cell-type-shared regulatory effects, with selective pressures particularly targeting variants affecting fetal brain neurons. To prioritize de novo mutations with extreme regulatory effects, we developed FLARE, a context- specific functional genomic model of constraint. FLARE outperformed other methods in prioritizing case mutations from autism-affected families near syndromic autism-associated genes; for example, identifying mutation outliers near CNTNAP2 that would be missed by alternative approaches. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of integrating single-cell maps with population genetics and deep learning-based variant effect prediction to elucidate mechanisms of development and disease--ultimately, supporting the notion that genetic contributions to neurodevelopmental disorders are predominantly rare.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

This was achieved by electroporation of strains stably expressing a codon-optimized Cas9 with two separate DNA molecules, one encoding a selectable marker flanked by short homology arms and a second encoding a sgRNA under the control of the U6 snRNA promoter. However, the efficiency of desired homology-dependent repair relative to undesired non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) events can be low and variable. Here, we describe methods and strains enabling extremely efficient ([~]99%) homology-dependent genome editing in C. neoformans. This high-efficiency method requires two manipulations. First, we placed the sgRNA-expressing segment into the marker-containing DNA flanked by targeting homology; thus, only a single DNA molecule is introduced into cells. Second, we used a strain mutant for the non-homologous end-joining factor Ku80 (encoded by YKU80). We also report the engineering of a yku80::amdS mutant strain harboring an insertion mutation that can be removed scarlessly via recombination between direct repeats. This enables the functional restoration of YKU80 after homology- dependent genome editing via selection against the amdS marker using fluoroacetamide. This approach minimizes documented drawbacks of using Ku-defective strains in downstream experiments. Finally, we describe a plasmid series that enables rapid cloning of sgRNA-marker constructs for genomic manipulation of C. neoformans, including gene deletion and C-terminal tagging.

Knowledge of flagellar assembly and function has mainly come from studies of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, which have simple flagellar motors (3-7). However, most flagellated bacteria possess complex motors with unique, species-specific adaptations whose mechanisms and evolution remain largely unexplored 8-10. Here, we deploy a multidisciplinary approach to build a near-complete model of the flagellar motor in Campylobacter jejuni, revealing its remarkable complexity in architecture and composition. We identify an E-ring around the MS-ring, a periplasmic cage with two distinctive conformations, and an intricate interaction network between the E-ring and cage. These scaffolds play critical roles in stabilizing and regulating 17 torque-generating stator complexes for optimal motility. In-depth evolutionary analyses uncover the ancient origin and prevalence of the E-ring in flagellated species of the domain Bacteria as well as a unique exaptation of type IV pili components PilMNOPQF in the ancestral motor of the phylum Campylobacterota. Collectively, our studies reveal novel mechanisms of assembly and function in complex flagellar motors and shed light on the evolution of flagella and modern bacterial species.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

These independent studies often include overlapping data, presenting a unique opportunity to build macrophylogenies (phylogenies sampling > 1,000 taxa) for entire classes across the Tree of Life. However, the inference of large trees remains constrained by logistical, computational, and methodological challenges. The Avian Tree of Life provides an ideal model for evaluating strategies to robustly infer macrophylogenies from intersecting datasets derived from smaller studies. In this study, we leveraged a comprehensive resource of sequence capture datasets to evaluate the phylogenetic accuracy and computational costs of four methodological approaches: (1) supermatrix approaches using concatenation, including the ""fast"" maximum likelihood (ML) methods, (2) filtering datasets to reduce heterogeneity, (3) supertree estimation based on published phylogenomic trees, and (4) a ""divide-and-conquer"" strategy, wherein smaller ML trees were estimated and subsequently combined using a supertree approach. Additionally, we examined the impact of these methods on divergence time estimation using a dataset that includes newly vetted fossil calibrations for the Avian Tree of Life. Our findings highlight that recently developed fast tree search approaches offer a reasonable compromise between computational efficiency and phylogenetic accuracy, facilitating inference of macrophylogenies.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

In general practice in England up to one-in-two nursing posts are predicted to be unfilled by 2030/31, with Wales similarly threatened. This is reflected internationally. Limited attention has been paid to how cultural and structural issues affect retention of nurses in general practice. The aim of our study is to understand factors that challenge retention and support nurses to stay in general practice.

MethodsWe conducted an exploratory qualitative interview study with n=41 with members of nursing teams working in, or who have worked in, general practice as well as nurse leaders associated with general practice across England and Wales. Recruitment was through professional and social media networks and snowballing techniques. Data were collected between October 2023-June 2024 and analysed following framework analysis. University of York ethics approval (Ref: HSRGC/2023/586/A) was gained. The study was funded by the General Nursing Council Trust.

ResultsRecognition of value of nurses working in general practice was central to the retention of nurses at all levels of practice and was affected by structural and cultural issues and reflected in several themes: The essence of nursing in general practice; The commodification and deprofessionalisation of nursing in general practice; Opportunities for development; Employment of nurses outside of the National Health Service; Lack of voice, precarity of position and lack of recourse; Tipping points.

ConclusionCultural and structural issues impacted on retention of nurses in general practice. While some supported retention, others revealed deep-seated, complex issues which require addressing at practice, local and national organisational levels. Nurses in general practice experience factors which leave them vulnerable and underserved. Policy makers, employers and professional organisations need to work to support retention and enable nurses in general practice, not only to survive, but thrive.

However, no study has validated its functional role in these diseases, explored the disease stage at which it is acting nor its mechanism of action. Here, we show that syntaxin-6 acts at early stages of prion disease in experimental mice by increasing disease transmission risk following inoculation with low prion doses. Conversely, syntaxin-6 does not affect prion propagation kinetics or toxicity during established disease. Syntaxin-6 manipulation in cellular models profoundly alters the subcellular distribution and morphologies of disease-related PrP and modifies prion export. Furthermore, syntaxin-6 knockout in a transgenic tauopathy mouse model exerts protective effects on numerous physiological, behavioural and neuropathological outcome measures. Therefore, our studies firmly establish syntaxin-6 as a modifier of prion and tau pathogenesis, providing key insights into a fundamental mechanism of neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

However, most underlying gene discovery efforts have focused on individuals of European ancestry, limiting insights into genetic risks across diverse populations. To help address this, the Genomics of Autism in Latin American Ancestries Consortium (GALA) was formed, presenting here the largest sequencing study of ASD in Latin American individuals (n>15,000). We identified 35 genome-wide significant (FDR < 0.05) ASD risk genes, with substantial overlap with findings from European cohorts, and highly constrained genes showing consistent signal across populations. The results provide support for emerging (e.g., MARK2, YWHAG, PACS1, RERE, SPEN, GSE1, GLS, TNPO3, ANKRD17) and established ASD genes, and for the utility of genetic testing approaches for deleterious variants in diverse populations, while also demonstrating the ongoing need for more inclusive genetic research and testing. We conclude that the biology of ASD is universal and not impacted to any detectable degree by ancestry.

Spatiotemporal information on the contribution of distinct bone marrow niche populations to this process is incomplete. We demonstrate that fibrosis-inducing hematopoietic cells cause profibrotic reprogramming of perivascular CXCL12 abundant reticular (CAR) progenitor cells resulting in loss of their hematopoiesis-support and upregulation of osteogenic and pro-apoptotic programs. In turn, peritrabecular osteolineage cells (OLCs) are activated in an injury-specific, Wnt-dependent manner, comparable to skeletal repair. OLCs fuel bone marrow fibrosis through their expansion and skewed differentiation, resulting in osteosclerosis and expansion of Ly6a+ fibroblasts. NCAM1 expression marks peritrabecular OLCs and their expansion into the central marrow is specific for fibrosis in mice and patients. Peritrabecular stromal b-catenin expression is linked to fibrosis in patients and inhibition of Wnt signaling reduces bone marrow fibrosis and osteosclerosis, possibly being a clinically relevant therapeutic target.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

Prior obesity and metabolic disease increase the severity of acute disease, but SARS-CoV-2 infection also contributes to the development of new-onset metabolic disease. Since the COVID pandemic occurred in the context of the global obesity epidemic, an important question is the extent to which pre-existing obesity modifies long-term responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We utilized a nonhuman primate model to compare the effects of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in lean and obese/insulin-resistant adult male rhesus macaques over a 6-m time course. While some longitudinal responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including overall viral dynamics, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG induction, cytokine profiles, and tissue persistence of viral RNA, did not appreciably differ between lean and obese animals, other responses, including neutralizing Ab dynamics, lung pathology, BW, degree of insulin sensitivity, adipocytokine profiles, body temperature, and nighttime activity levels were significantly different in lean versus obese animals. Furthermore, several parameters in lean animals were altered following SARS-CoV-2 infection to resemble those in obese animals. Notably, persistent changes in multiple parameters were present in most animals, suggesting that PASC may be more prevalent than estimated from self-reported symptoms in human studies.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

However, the full potential of real-time metagenomics remains largely unfulfilled due to a lack of accessible, open-source bioinformatic tools.

We present MARTi (Metagenomic Analysis in Real-Time), an innovative open-source software designed for the real-time analysis, visualisation, and exploration of metagenomic data. MARTi supports various classification methods, including BLAST, Centrifuge, and Kraken2, letting users customise parameters and utilise their own databases for taxonomic classification and antimicrobial resistance analysis. With a user-friendly, browser-based graphical interface, MARTi provides dynamic, real-time updates on community composition and AMR gene identification.

MARTis architecture and operational flexibility make it suitable for diverse research applications, ranging from in-field analysis to large-scale metagenomic studies. Using both simulated and real-world data, we demonstrate MARTis performance in read classification, taxon detection, and relative abundance estimation. By bridging the gap between sequencing and actionable insights, MARTi marks a significant advance in the accessibility and functionality of real-time metagenomic analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

Disruption of this bond, particularly following offspring loss, can result in profound trauma with long-lasting consequences. While considerable research has focused on the impact of maternal separation on offspring development, the biological effects of offspring loss on the mother remain largely unexplored. In this study, we examined the long-term effects of offspring loss on neuroplasticity, the oxytocin (OXT) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) systems, and stress-coping behaviors in Sprague-Dawley rat mothers. We compared mothers that experienced one day of motherhood followed by 19 days of offspring loss, mothers that were with their pups throughout the 20 days, and naive virgin rats.

Our results reveal that mothers who lost their pups expressed increased oxytocin receptor binding and decreased dendritic spine density in limbic brain regions, with no changes in estrogen receptor  or calbindin cells. Additionally, separated mothers showed increased passive stress-coping behaviors in the forced swim test and elevated plasma corticosterone levels. Remarkably, the passive stress-coping behavior was rescued by central CRF receptor blockade but not by oxytocin treatment, suggesting that the CRF system plays a key role in the grieving process following offspring loss, and highlights the suitability of the rat model for studying maternal grief. This research provides insights into the complex neurobiology of grief, and suggests potential directions for future studies.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

Although tangible improvements have been made in academic publishing and conference participation, gender imbalances in citations among leading neuroscience journals persist and are increasing with time. Here, we expand upon prior work by providing a more comprehensive analysis of citation practices across fifty journals to improve our understanding of the dynamics of the field as a whole, particularly across different kinds of journals. We first confirm that reference lists tend to include more papers with men as first and last author than expected if gender were unrelated to citation practices. Further, we demonstrate that this effect is strongest in the most influential journals. We also find that the apparent closure of the gender gap is due to the interaction of three unique, nuanced patterns of citation: one that is characterized by relative overcitation of papers with men as both first and last author; one that is characterized by relative overcitation of women as the last author, and one that is characterized by relative undercitation of women as the first author. In addition, we find that these patterns of citation are not distributed evenly across the field: more prestigious journals tend to have articles with citation gaps favoring men, while less prestigious journals tend to overcite papers with women as last authors. We discuss potential drivers for these patterns and suggest some implications for the field moving forward.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

Due to the importance of the Asgard archaea for our understanding of cellular evolution and eukaryotic complexity, recent efforts have focused on better characterizing the genomic diversity of this lineage and its relatives from the TACK archaea. Newly discovered lineages, the Njordarchaeales and Panguiarchaeales, are difficult to place, branching either with Korarchaeota or Asgard archaea. The phylogenetic position of these taxa is important because they include genome-reduced and potentially symbiotic lineages, which may help to inform our understanding of genome evolution and the evolution of symbiotic interactions within Asgard archaea and their relatives. To resolve the placement of Njordarchaeales and Panguiarchaeales in the archaeal tree, we performed a range of phylogenetic analyses revealing that the Njordarchaeales and Pangiuarchaeales constitute the newly-identified class Njordarchaeia within the Asgard archaea. Members of the Njordarchaeia exhibit hallmarks of adaptations to (hyper-) thermophilic lifestyles, which may contribute conflicting signals to phylogenetic analyses. Panguiarchaeum appears to be metabolically distinct from its relatives, displaying reduced metabolic potential and various auxotrophies. Gene tree-species tree reconciliation recovers a complex common ancestor of Asgard archaea that encoded the Wood Ljungdahl pathway, however the subsequent loss of this pathway during the reductive evolution of Panguiarchaeum may have been associated with the switch to a symbiotic lifestyle based on H2 syntrophy. Our analyses identify Panguiarchaeum as the first described Asgard archaea lineage with streamlined genomes that show indications for a symbiotic lifestyle.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

Humans can also transmit viral infections back to domestic and wild animals, which can then act as reservoir for the maintenance of viruses, with the risk of epidemic diseases re-emergence. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the COVID-19, likely originated from wildlife and has already been evidenced to be transmitted from humans to captive, domestic and wild animals. In particular, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) show high-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 following human contamination, and recent data suggest that white-tailed deer could act as an emerging virus reservoir. Here, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 could also have emerged in several longitudinally-monitored populations of European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in direct contact with humans in France. We performed indirect tests (serological ELISAs and seroneutralization) on serum collected pre- and post-emergence of the virus in human populations. We also performed direct tests (nasal swabs followed by RT-PCR) to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in those populations in 2022. We also investigated the exposure and prevalence of the virus in three other cervid species in France. ELISA tests were positive for 2.20 % of the sera tested, both pre- and post-emergence of the virus, but all positive samples were negative with seroneutralization. Direct PCR testing showed no positive results in 2022. Thus, although seroprevalence increased after the COVID-19 emergence (2022) in one out of three roe deer population, our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has not emerged in those populations, and that ELISA cross-reaction with another circulating virus, possibly an unidentified bovine coronavirus, is possible.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

As a result, a diverse array of protein variants can coexist within a single proteome, such as that of humans. However, until now, methods to detect, quantify, and evaluate the functional consequences of these variants have been lacking. Here we examined a large-scale proteogenomic dataset from 29 healthy human tissues and uncovered over 46,000 of unique single amino acid variants co-existing alongside their corresponding reference proteoforms. Our analysis reveals that substitutions preferentially occur in proteins with low expression levels and often affect less frequently encoded amino acids such as tryptophan, cysteine, histidine, or methionine. We found that the abundance of both genetic (SNPs, somatic mutations) and mistranslated protein variants mirror their allele frequencies in the human population. Moreover, we show that non-genetic substitutions provide a distinct route for exploring protein sequence space, circumventing the mutational constraints imposed by the genetic code. Further, we demonstrate that substitution prevalence correlates negatively with their predicted pathogenicity, particularly in proteins expressed at low levels. We identified hundreds of substituted non-genetic proteoforms that recur consistently in multiple individuals and map to annotated protein functional sites. We propose that these substitutions constitute a novel class of functional protein phenotypic variants. Finally, we illustrate the impact of active-site substitutions in genes such as GAPDH and hemoglobin and highlight potential non-genetic routes of immunoglobulin diversification. Collectively, our findings indicate that non-genetic amino acid substitutions in human proteins provide a recurring and specific route to expanding the functional proteome.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

Previous structural studies of Orf9b in isolation revealed a {beta}-sheet-rich homodimer, however, structures of Orf9b in complex with Tom70 revealed a monomeric helical fold. Here, we developed a biophysical model that quantifies how Orf9b switches between these conformations and binds to Tom70, a requirement for suppressing the type 1 interferon response. We used this model to characterize the effect of lipid binding and mutations in variants of concern to the Orf9b:Tom70 equilibrium. We found that the binding of a lipid to the Orf9b homodimer biases the Orf9b monomer:dimer equilibrium towards the dimer by reducing the dimer dissociation rate [~]100-fold. We also found that mutations in variants of concern can alter different microscopic rate constants without significantly affecting binding to Tom70. Together our results highlight how perturbations to different steps in these coupled equilibria can affect the apparent affinity of Orf9b to Tom70, with potential downstream implications for interferon signaling in coronavirus infection.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

Granulomas are organized immune aggregates that form in the lung in response to mycobacterial infection and are an important site of pathogen-host interaction. The composition and cellular microenvironment within the granuloma impacts the bacterial control capacity. To identify protective responses in granulomas, imaging mass cytometry was used to study archived lung tissue from low dose Mtb-infected non-human primates presenting with various levels of disease. This approach revealed that granuloma composition is correlated with the severity of lung pathology. Granulomas of animals with limited lung pathology were enriched for NK cells showing increased interactions with tissue macrophages. This work improves our understanding of local immune interactions in the lung and how these correlate with severity of tuberculosis disease.

Author summaryTuberculosis remains the deadliest infectious disease in the world with 10 million new infections and 1.5 million deaths annually. The existing vaccine is not effective enough to halt the tuberculosis epidemic. In order to develop an improved vaccine, more complete and detailed knowledge on the immune responses that can successfully protect against tuberculosis is required. Individuals that are exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogen that causes tuberculosis disease, fall along a spectrum, with some individuals showing a strong innate capacity to protect against disease, while others fall ill. By studying these differences in a model organism, namely non-human primates, we can learn about protective immune responses. In primates with limited disease, the immune cell aggregates surrounding the bacteria in the lung contained more NK cells than were found in severe disease. In addition, interactions between NK cells and macrophages, cells that can eat bacteria, were seen a lot more in protected animals. This suggests that the interaction between NK cell and macrophages contributes to controlling tuberculosis disease, this knowledge can contribute to improved vaccine strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

A critically important aspect of anaphylaxis pertains to the factors that modulate its severity. The human microbiota is known to influence oral tolerance, but the microbial mechanisms directly involved in IgE-mediated anaphylaxis remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that human saliva harbors peanut-degrading bacteria that metabolize immunodominant allergens (Ara h 1 and Ara h 2) and alter IgE binding. Additionally, we provide in vivo evidence showing that oral bacteria metabolize peanut allergens, influencing systemic allergen exposure and the severity of anaphylaxis. Finally, in a clinical study, we observe that common peanut-degrading bacteria, such as Rothia, from the oral cavity, are more abundant in peanut-allergic patients who exhibit better tolerance to allergen exposure. Altogether, these results demonstrate the role of the human microbiota in modulating IgE-mediated reactions through allergen metabolism. These findings reveal a novel microbial mechanism with potential to prevent, or reduce, the severity of IgE-mediated anaphylaxis.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

Accurately identifying regions that are spatially coherent in both gene expression and physical tissue structures is an emerging topic, but challenging due to the lack of ground truth labels which renders complicating validation of clustering consistency and reproducibility. This highlights a need for a computational evaluation framework to rigorously and unbiasedly assess clustering performance.

ResultsTo address this gap, we propose STEAM (Spatial Transcriptomics Evaluation Algorithm and Metric), a user-friendly computational pipeline designed to evaluate the consistency and reliability of clustering results by leveraging machine learning classification and prediction methods, with the goal of maintaining the spatial proximity and gene expression patterns within clusters. We benchmarked STEAM on various public datasets, spanning multi-cell to single-cell resolution, as well as spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. The results highlighted its robustness and generalizability through comprehensive statistical evaluation metrics, such as Kappa score, F1 score, accuracy, and adjusted rand index. Notably, STEAM supports multi-sample training, enabling cross-replicate clustering consistency assessment. Moreover, STEAM provides practical guidance by comparing clustering results across multiple approaches; here, we evaluated four different methods, including spatial-aware and spatial-ignorant approaches. In summary, we believe that STEAM provides researchers a promising tool for evaluating clustering robustness and benchmarking clustering performance for spatial omics data, offering valuable insights to drive reproducible discoveries in spatial biology.

Unexpectedly, it autonomously uncovered brominated lipid tails as a novel feature enhancing mRNA delivery. In vivo validation further confirmed that inhalation of LNPs containing the top-performing lipid, LUMI-6, achieved 20.3% gene editing efficacy in lung epithelial cells in murine models, surpassing the highest efficiency reported for inhaled LNP-mediated CRISPR-Cas9 delivery in mice to our knowledge.

However, the role of macrocephaly in ASD pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we address the mechanistic link between macrocephaly and ASD by investigating a novel ASD-associated gain-of-function A1877T mutation in ASPM (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated). ASPM is a key regulator of cortical size and cell proliferation expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal progenitors but not in differentiated neurons. We found that Aspm gain-of-function knock-in mice exhibit macrocephaly, excessive embryonic neurogenesis with expanded outer radial glia, an increased excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) ratio, brain hyperconnectivity, and social-cognitive deficits with male specificity. Our results suggest that macrocephaly in ASD is not a proportional expansion of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but a shift in the E-I ratio, independent of the expression patterns of the causative gene. Thus, macrocephaly alone can cause a subset of ASD-like symptoms.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

Australias geographic isolation, strict biosecurity measures and native dingo populations present a unique model for understanding the spread and evolution of canine viruses. However, aside from a few well-characterised pathogens, genomic data are scarce for many common dog viruses, limiting our understanding of their evolution and disease ecology. Using a metatranscriptomic approach we identified the viruses in dogs and dingoes from various geographical locations across mainland Australia and sample types, revealing 86 vertebrate-associated viruses belonging to 16 distinct species, including a new vesivirus-like species. Many of the viruses identified here have not previously been sequenced in Australia. We identified important dog pathogens associated with canine infectious respiratory disease syndrome--such as canine pneumovirus, canine herpesvirus, and canine respiratory coronavirus--and gastroenteritis, including canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, and rotavirus A. The sequences of Australian canine viruses often occupied multiple distinct clades phylogenetically and had little geographic structure, suggesting multiple virus introductions and subsequent spread across the country. Notably, we identified the first RNA virus - rotavirus A - in a dingo. This virus was phylogenetically distinct from dog-associated rotavirus A sequences and more closely related to viruses found in humans and bats, indicative of the past cross-species transmission of a reassortant virus into dingoes, and shows dingoes and domestic dogs may have distinct viromes. Our findings expand the knowledge of viral diversity in Australian canines, improving our understanding of viral movement into and within Australia, as well as the potential zoonotic risks associated with dogs and dingoes.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

Previous work on eukaryotic cytoskeletal elements such as actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments investigating the mechanisms of polymerization have been critical to understand how cells control the assembly of the cytoskeleton. Most biophysical analyses have considered cooperative versus isodesmic modes of polymerization; this framework is useful for specifying functions of regulatory proteins that control nucleation and understanding how cells regulate elongation in time and space. The septins are considered a fourth component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, but they are poorly understood in many ways despite their conserved roles in membrane dynamics, cytokinesis, and cell shape, and in their links to a myriad of human diseases. Because septin function is intimately linked to their assembled state, we set out to investigate the mechanisms by which septin polymers elongate under different conditions. We used simulations, in vitro reconstitution of purified septin complexes, and quantitative microscopy to directly interrogate septin polymerization behaviors in solution and on synthetic lipid bilayers of different geometries. We first used reactive Brownian dynamics simulations to determine if the presence of a membrane induces cooperativity to septin polymerization. We then used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to assess septins ability to form filaments in solution at different salt conditions. Finally, we investigated septin membrane adsorption and polymerization on planar and curved supported lipid bilayers. Septins clearly show signs of salt-dependent cooperative assembly in solution, but cooperativity is limited by binding a membrane. Thus, septin assembly is dramatically influenced by extrinsic conditions and substrate properties and can show properties of both isodesmic and cooperative polymers. This versatility in assembly modes may explain the extensive array of assembly types, functions, and subcellular locations in which septins act.

SIGNIFICANCEThe septin cytoskeleton plays conserved and essential roles in cell division, membrane remodeling, and intracellular signaling with links to varied human diseases. Unlike actin and microtubules, whose polymerization dynamics have been extensively characterized, the molecular details of septin polymerization remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the mode of septin polymerization through the lens of isodesmic and cooperative polymer assembly models in solution, on planar and curved supported membranes, and under different ionic conditions. Our findings show that the mechanisms of septin assembly are highly sensitive to ionic conditions, membrane geometry, and protein concentrations. Notably, assembly can show either cooperative or isodesmic properties depending on context, thereby revealing unexpected plasticity.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

While COVID-19 exacerbated the decline in routine vaccination through disruption of healthcare services and the diversion of resources, factors including vaccine hesitancy, socioeconomic disparities and vaccine policy also contribute to changes in vaccination behavior. Understanding the factors that influence vaccination choice is necessary to develop effective public health policy.

MethodsWe collect county-level MMR vaccination rates for kindergarten children from 2017 - 2024 for 2,266 U.S. counties, evaluate coverage patterns and trends before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and implement multivariable weighted logistic regression models to identify factors associated with low and declining MMR vaccination rates in U.S. counties.

FindingsWe reveal a nationwide decline in MMR rates following the COVID-19 pandemic, with declines observed in 1,688 of the counties evaluated. We find state-level non-medical exemption (NME) policies to be strongly associated with low and declining MMR rates. We identify a positive association in vaccination rates across vaccine types. We find higher MMR rates are positively associated with Republican-aligned counties and declines in MMR rates to be positively associated with COVID-19 death rates.

InterpretationThe significant association between NMEs and low and declining MMR rates suggest these state level policies are harmful and reduce vaccination coverage. The positive associations among vaccine types suggest spillover effects in vaccine seeking behavior. The association between MMR rates and Republican-aligned counties contrast COVID-19 vaccination patterns, highlighting the complex nature of political polarization on vaccine-related behavior, while the association between MMR declines and COVID-19 death rate reveals an additional burden posed by the pandemic.

To elucidate which gene(s) are responsible for the 1q21.1 duplication/deletion-associated phenotypes, we performed gene manipulation in zebrafish and mice. We modeled 1q21.1 duplication by overexpressing the eight human protein-coding genes in zebrafish. We found that overexpression of CHD1L only led to macrocephaly and increased larval body length, whereas chd1l deletion caused opposite phenotypes. These mirrored phenotypes were also observed in mouse embryos. Transcriptomic, cistromic, and chromatin accessibility analyses of CHD1L knock-out hiPSC-derived neuronal progenitor cells revealed that CHD1L regulates the expression levels and chromatin accessibility of genes involved in neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis, including autism genes. Moreover, we found that CHD1L favors telencephalon development during forebrain regionalization by facilitating chromatin accessibility to pioneer transcription factors including SOX2 and OTX2 while simultaneously compacting chromatin through its interaction with the repressor NuRD complex. Last, atypical 1q21.1 CNV encompassing CHD1L and pathogenic missense and truncating CHD1L variants were found in individuals with autism. Overall, our data reveal a novel role for CHD1L as a master regulator of cell fate and its dosage imbalance contributes to the neuroanatomical and growth phenotypes associated with the 1q21.1 distal CNV.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

However, they also serve as entry points for microbial pathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) bacteria. To prevent microbe invasion, guard cells detect pathogens-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including the bacterial peptide flagellin (flg22), triggering stomatal closure. This study identifies hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and its cytosolic source L-CYSTEINE DESULFHIDRASE 1 (DES1), as key players in stomatal immunity. We demonstrate that H2S and DES1 are involved in flg22- and bacterial-induced responses, including stomatal closure and modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We have found that knock out mutants in DES1 gene exhibit reduced susceptibility to Pst spray-inoculation and lower apoplastic and cytosolic H2O2 levels in response to flg22. Additionally, H2S independently induces cytosolic H2O2 levels in guard cells without requiring RBOHD activity. All together, these findings establish H2S and its source, DES1, as critical components of the stomatal immune response.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

Here, in 18 human participants with amnesia, we decoded the effects of bilateral focal hippocampal damage on distinct autobiographical representations using representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs). Hippocampal pathology resulted in: (1) impaired generalised episodic memory retrieval RDM model fit in the left angular gyrus; and, (2) reduced distinct episodic memory RDM model fit and trial-by-trial voxel-representational stability in the right angular gyrus, right orbitofrontal cortex, and right inferior frontal gyrus.

A fundamental unresolved question is whether and how T cell exhaustion is determined at the onset of TCR signaling6-8. Here we report an unexpected role of Themis, a TCR-proximal signaling molecule9, in T cell exhaustion. Chronic viral infection in mice usually leads to T cell exhaustion and survival of the host. Surprisingly, Themis T-cell conditional knockout mice died from severe CD8+-dependent lung immunopathology in chronic viral infection, showing Themis importance in establishing T cell exhaustion. We found that Themis-deficient CD8+ T cells were hyperactivated at the single-cell level - producing more TNF and IFN{gamma} compared to wild-type counterparts - but defective in population-level expansion. Moreover, TCF-1 and TOX expression were inhibited in Themis-deficient CD8+ T cells, thereby impairing differentiation of exhausted T cell precursors (T-pex) and maintenance of terminally exhausted T cells (T-ex), respectively. Mechanistically, Themis initially promotes TCR signaling to induce PD-1 expression and subsequently mediates PD-1 signaling. In the latter, Themis binds to PD-1 and promotes PD-1 phosphorylation and its recruitment of SHP2, thereby acting as a negative regulator to inhibit T cell effector functions. Without Themis, the orderly regulation of TCR and PD-1 signaling, and therefore exhaustion, is disrupted. Thus, our results unequivocally demonstrate that Themis-mediated early TCR signaling plays a decisive role in T cell exhaustion and provide a novel mechanism of PD-1 signaling through Themis.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

The spatial organization of cell surface proteins is central to these processes. High-resolution fluorescence microscopy and proximity labeling have advanced studies of surface protein associations, but the spatial organization of the complete surface proteome remains uncharted. In this study, we systematically mapped the surface proteome of human T-lymphocytes and B-lymphoblasts using proximity labeling of 85 antigens, identified from over 100 antibodies tested for binding to surface-exposed proteins. These experiments were coupled with an optimized data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry workflow to generate a robust dataset. Unsupervised clustering of the resulting interactome revealed functional modules, including well-characterized complexes such as the T-cell receptor and HLA class I/II, alongside novel clusters. Notably, we identified mitochondrial proteins localized to the surface, including the transcription factor TFAM, suggesting previously unappreciated roles for mitochondrial proteins at the plasma membrane. A high-accuracy machine learning classifier predicted over 6,000 surface protein associations, highlighting functional associations such as IL10RBs role as a negative regulator of type I interferon signaling. Spatial modeling of the surface proteome provided insights into protein dispersion patterns, distinguishing widely distributed proteins, such as CD45, from localized antigens, such as CD226 pointing to active mechanisms of regulating surface organization.

Instead, these models implicitly reason about crucial sidechain interactions based on backbone geometry and known amino acid sequence labels. To address this, we present FAMPNN (Full-Atom MPNN), a sequence design method that explicitly models both sequence identity and sidechain conformation for each residue, where the per-token distribution of a residues discrete amino acid identity and its continuous sidechain conformation are learned with a combined categorical cross-entropy and diffusion loss objective. We demonstrate that learning these distributions jointly is a highly synergistic task that both improves sequence recovery while achieving state-of-the-art sidechain packing. Furthermore, benefits from explicit full-atom modeling generalize from sequence recovery to practical protein design applications, such as zero-shot prediction of experimental binding and stability measurements.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

The expression of conserved bilaterian patterning genes in echinoderms provides a molecular framework for resolving this puzzle. Recent studies in juvenile asteroids suggest that the bilaterian antero-posterior axis maps onto the medio-lateral axis that is perpendicular to each of the five rays of the pentaradial body plan. Here we test this hypothesis in another echinoderm class, the ophiuroids, using the cosmopolitan brittle star Amphipholis squamata. Our results show that the general principles of axial patterning are similar to those described in asteroids, and comparisons with existing molecular data from other echinoderm taxa support the idea that medio-lateral deployment of the AP patterning program across the rays predates the evolution of the asterozoan and likely the echinoderm crown-groups. Our data also reveal expression differences between A. squamata and asteroids, which we attribute to secondary modifications specific to ophiuroids. Together, this work provides important comparative data to reconstruct the evolution of axial properties in echinoderm body plans.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

Through systematic comparison of transcriptomes from fresh-collected, silica-dried, and archival specimens, we demonstrate the suitability of herbarium-derived RNA for transcriptomics. The practical applicability of archival mRNA was further illustrated by the functional validation of a plant immune receptor synthesized from a specimen collected in 1956. These results contradict the community consensus regarding archival RNA and open the door to subsequent transcriptomic explorations in rare and extinct species.

Despite intrinsic links to their oncogenic potential, the fidelity and mechanisms of ecDNA inheritance are poorly understood. Here, we show that ecDNA are protected against cytosolic mis-segregation through mitotic clustering and by tethering to the telomeric and subtelomeric regions of mitotic chromosomes. ecDNA-chromosome tethering depends on BRD4 transcriptional co-activation and mitotic transcription of the long non-coding RNA PVT1, which is co-amplified with MYC in colorectal and prostate cancer cell lines. Disruption of ecDNA-chromosome tethering through BRD4 inhibition, PVT1 depletion, or inhibiting mitotic transcription results in cytosolic mis-segregation, ecDNA reintegration, and the formation of homogeneously staining regions (HSRs). We propose that nuclear inheritance of ecDNA is facilitated by an RNA-mediated physical tether that links ecDNA to mitotic chromosomes and thus protects against cytosolic mis-segregation and chromosomal integration.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

Currently, drugs and drug candidates against AR target the steroid-binding domain to antagonize or degrade AR. However, these compounds cannot therapeutically access largely intrinsically disordered truncated splice variants of AR, such as AR-V7, that only possess the DNA binding domain and are missing the ligand binding domain. Targeting intrinsically disordered regions within transcription factors has remained challenging and is considered ""undruggable"". Herein, we leveraged a cysteine-reactive covalent ligand library in a cellular screen to identify degraders of AR and AR-V7 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. We identified a covalent compound EN1441 that selectively degrades AR and AR-V7 in a proteasome-dependent manner through direct covalent targeting of an intrinsically disordered cysteine C125 in AR and AR-V7. EN1441 causes significant and selective destabilization of AR and AR-V7, leading to aggregation of AR/AR-V7 and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Consistent with targeting both AR and AR-V7, we find that EN1441 completely inhibits total AR transcriptional activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells expressing both AR and AR-V7 compared to AR antagonists or degraders that only target the ligand binding domain of full-length AR, such as enzalutamide and ARV-110. Our results put forth a pathfinder molecule EN1441 that targets an intrinsically disordered cysteine within AR to destabilize, degrade, and inhibit both AR and AR-V7 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and highlights the utility of covalent ligand discovery approaches in directly targeting, destabilizing, inhibiting, and degrading classically undruggable transcription factor targets.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

Yet our understanding of value-based decision-making comes primarily from studying individuals in isolation, leaving open fundamental questions about how animals adapt their strategies during social competition. Here, we developed an ethologically relevant multi-player game, in which freely-moving mice make value-based decisions in a competitive spatial foraging task. We found that mice integrate real-time spatial information about  self and the opponent to flexibly shift their preference towards safer, low-payout options when appropriate. Analyses of mice and reinforcement learning agents reveal that these behavioural adaptations cannot be explained by simple reward learning, but are instead consistent with optimal decision strategies guided by opponent features. Using a dynamical model of neural activity, we found that in addition to opponent effects, decisions under competition were also noisier and more sensitive to initial conditions, generating testable predictions for neural recordings and perturbations. Together, this work reveals a fundamental mechanism for competitive foraging, and proposes novel quantitative frameworks towards understanding value-based decision-making in a fast-changing social environment.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

Here, to explore hyperparasitism in Archaea, we focused on ultra-small archaea of the phylum Nanohaloarchaeota, a distinct lineage within the DPANN superphylum, which establish obligate symbiotic interactions with extreme halophiles of the class Halobacteria. We assembled five metagenomes originating from geothermally influenced salt lakes in the Danakil Depression, Ethiopia, and reconstructed the viromes associated with both haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea. Both archaeal lineages were associated with viruses from four distinct groups, including head-tailed viruses (class Caudoviricetes), tailless icosahedral viruses, pleomorphic viruses and spindle-shaped viruses, which represent 12 previously undescribed families. The haloarchaeal viruses (HVs) and nanohaloarchaeal viruses (NHVs) are only distantly related, suggesting that viruses from the four groups co-evolved with their respective hosts for an extended period, likely since the divergence of the two archaeal lineages from their last common ancestor. Consistently, our results show that HVs and NHVs are well-adapted to replicate in their respective hosts and to thrive in hypersaline environments. No evidence of host switching between haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea was obtained, but multiple horizontal transfers of genes implicated in virion structure and morphogenesis between HVs and NHVs were detected. We also identified several NHVs-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes implicated in nucleotide and amino acid metabolisms, which could enhance the metabolic capabilities of the nanohaloarchaeal hosts that have highly reduced genomes. Finally, in addition to HVs and NHVs, we describe plasmid-derived virus satellites that appear to have originated convergently to parasitize spindle-shaped viruses of both haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea, uncovering an additional layer of parasitism. Collectively, our findings fill the knowledge gap on the diversity of HVs and NHVs, highlight the complexity of virus-host and virus-virus interactions in hypersaline environments, and open doors for further mining of the virosphere of the globally distributed DPANN archaea.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

Among these tasks, cell type annotation remains particularly challenging, with researchers exploring various methods to improve accuracy and efficiency. While recent studies on GPT-like models have demonstrated annotation performance comparable to manual annotations, a significant gap remains in understanding their limitations and generalizability. In this work, we compare and evaluate the annotation performance of the GPT-4 model against traditional methods on nine randomly selected public single-cell RNA seq datasets from cellxgene, covering diverse tissue types. Our evaluation highlights the complexity of annotating cell types in single-cell data, revealing key differences between automated and manual approaches. We found specific cases where GPT-4 underperforms, demonstrating its limitations in certain contexts. We further introduce an automated approach to incorporate literature search using a RAG approach which enhances and outperforms GPT-4 cell type annotation when compared to traditional methods. We also introduce metrics based on taxonomic distance in the ontology tree to evaluate the granularity of the cell type annotations. To support future research, we also release an open-source Python package 1 that enables fully automated cell-type annotation of single-cell data using GPT-4 alongside other methods.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1), with its high case fatality rate and potential for adaptation in avian reservoirs, is a prime candidate for triggering such a pandemic. We applied the Viral Trait Assessment for Pandemics (ViTAP) model, a quantitative framework, to assess the pandemic potential of H5N1 strains currently circulating in the United States. Through a systematic literature review and structured expert elicitation involving virologists and epidemiologists, we refined and validated ViTAP scores across 11 key viral traits. The resulting assessment yielded a final ViTAP score of 3.28 out of 5, placing the U.S. H5N1 strains in the moderate-to-high risk category. This elevated risk is driven by the viruss high human fatality rate, its segmented RNA genome enabling reassortment, and its propensity for mutation. Sensitivity analyses highlight the transmission mode of the virus as a critical factor, with even minor increases in human-to-human spread dramatically escalating the pandemic threat. Comparisons with historical pandemics underscore the potential for H5N1 to rival the devastating impact of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for enhanced surveillance in avian and mammalian hosts, targeted vaccine development, and comprehensive pandemic preparedness efforts. By demonstrating the utility of the ViTAP model for pandemic risk assessment, we provide a valuable tool to guide policy and interventions in the face of emerging zoonotic threats.","NA","medrxiv",1740089312976

This BAM complex is radically different from the canonical Escherichia coli system and includes an extensive extracellular canopy that overhangs the substrate folding site and a subunit that inserts into the BAM pore. We find that two of the novel subunits involved in forming the extracellular canopy are essential for BAM function. For one of these subunits isolation of a suppressor mutation allows the separation of their essential and non-essential functions.

However, the microbial factors that influence host longevity and their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Using the expression of Caenorhabditis elegans FAT-7, a stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase, as a proxy for lifespan modulation, we conduct a genome-wide bacterial mutant screen and identify 26 Escherichia coli mutants that enhance host lifespan. Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses reveal that these mutant diets induce oxidative stress and activate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). Lifespan extension requires the oxidative stress response regulators SKN-1, SEK-1, and HLH-30. Mechanistically, these effects are linked to reduced iron availability, as iron supplementation restores FAT-7 expression, suppresses UPRmt activation, and abolishes lifespan extension. Iron chelation mimics the pro-longevity effects of the mutant diets, highlighting dietary iron as a key modulator of aging.

While the design and modeling of peptides in general has seen rapid advances since the advent of modern machine learning methods, existing deep learning models cannot effectively predict cyclic peptide structures containing non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs), which are often crucial for peptide therapeutics. To address this limitation, we here extend the recent AF3-style model Boltz to cyclic peptides with ncAAs. In addition to the positional encoding offset, we used a simple yet effective extension of the cyclic offset encoding based on AlphaFold3s tokenization scheme that allows the modeling of cyclic peptides with modified residues. On a test set of peptides with ncAAs, our approach outperforms HighFold2 on 13/17 cases, with an average C RMSD of 1.877[A] and an average all-atom RMSD of 3.361[A]. Our results show that the cyclic offset encoding shown for AlphaFold2 generalizes to AlphaFold3-based models and can be extended to incorporate ncAAs, showing potential in the design of novel cyclic peptides with ncAAs for therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

How different immune cell types engage PRR- and guard protein-dependent defenses in response to infection is poorly understood. Here, we show that macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) respond in distinct ways to bacterial virulence activities. In macrophages, the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila deploys its Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS) to deliver effector proteins that facilitate its robust intracellular replication. In contrast, T4SS activity triggers rapid DC death that potently restricts Legionella replication within this cell type. Intriguingly, we found that infected DCs exhibit considerable heterogeneity at the single cell level. Initially, a subset of DCs activate caspase-11 and NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis and release IL-1{beta} early during infection. At later timepoints, a separate DC population undergoes apoptosis driven by T4SS effectors that block host protein synthesis, thereby depleting the levels of the pro-survival proteins Mcl-1 and cFLIP. Together, pyroptosis and effector-triggered apoptosis robustly restrict Legionella replication in DCs. Collectively, our work suggests a model where Mcl-1 and cFLIP guard host translation in DCs, and that macrophages and DCs distinctly employ innate immune sensors and guard proteins to mount divergent responses to Legionella infection.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

The manual quantification of the FI from 2D microscopy images is tedious and biased, thus several automated methods have been developed. However, they still face challenges such as efficient nucleus segmentation and classification of fused and isolated myoblast nuclei. Here, we developed a novel workflow entirely based on AI for fully automated and unbiased quantification of the FI.

ResultsUsing current methods, we show that myoblast nuclei located above or below myotubes can significantly corrupt accurate FI computation. To circumvent this issue, we developed MyoFuse which enables an accurate and high-throughput segmentation and classification of myonuclei. It comprises a nuclei segmentation step using Cellpose, followed by a classification network trained with Svetlana. MyoFuse demonstrated strong accuracy when tested against manual annotation in mouse C2C12 and human primary myotubes. The trained classifier is able to differentiate myotube nuclei from myoblast nuclei based on myotube cytoplasm staining only. Experimental comparisons also highlighted that the previously developed methods lead to a significant overestimation of the FI.

ConclusionIn summary, we underscore the lack of accuracy of traditional methods for automated FI quantification. MyoFuse enables a direct and accurate segmentation of nuclei even in nuclei clusters frequently observed in myotubes. This workflow thus offers a new and more reliable method to evaluate the FI. It also limits the selection bias by processing large images.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

A key debate in the field centers on whether compositional methods are necessary for DA analysis, which is challenging to answer due to the lack of ground truth data. To address this gap, we created the Bioconductor data package MicrobiomeBenchmarkData, featuring three microbiome datasets with established biological ground truths: 1) diverse oral microbiomes from supragingival and subgingival plaques, expected to favor aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, respectively, 2) low-diversity microbiomes from healthy vaginas and bacterial vaginosis, conditions that have been well-characterized through cell culture and microscopy, and 3) a spike-in dataset with constant, known absolute abundances of three bacteria. We benchmarked 17 DA approaches and demonstrated that compositional DA methods are not beneficial but rather lack sensitivity, show increased variability in constant-abundance spike-ins, and, most surprisingly, more frequently produce paradoxical results with DA in the wrong direction for the low-diversity microbiome. Conversely, commonly used methods in microbiome literature, such as LEfSe, the Wilcoxon test, and RNA-seq-derived methods, performed best. We conclude that researchers continue using widely adopted non-parametric or RNA-seq DA methods and that further development of compositional methods includes benchmarking against datasets with known biological ground truth.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

It has been hypothesized that fixation of a single morph can result in character release, whereby the monomorphic form evolves without the constraint of accommodating multiple adaptive peaks. However, the rates of evolution between populations fixed for different morphs likely depend on the specific adaptive zones occupied by each morph. We studied the evolution of dorsal color polymorphism (striped and unstriped morphs) in woodland salamanders (Plethodon), a North American radiation in which the polymorphism can be found in even the most distantly related species ([~]44 Ma divergence). We estimated a phylogenomic tree of Plethodon, representing all extant taxa with multiple samples for most species. Morphometric data suggest that between-species variation exists predominantly along an axis of relative body elongation, likely corresponding to a terrestrial-fossorial continuum. Polymorphic species occupy an intermediate phenotypic space between the evolutionary optima of striped and unstriped species, although polymorphic species did not have elevated speciation rates. Faster rates of body shape evolution were observed in unstriped species, suggesting that body elongation, which is co-adapted with the unstriped morph, is constrained by the polymorphism. Striped species had slower rates of evolution than polymorphic species, despite lacking the genetic constraints often associated with polymorphism. Our results demonstrate that rates of phenotypic evolution and speciation following character release can be asymmetric and idiosyncratic depending on the alternative adaptations of each morph.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

However, these models typically do not take into account chromatin accessibility, a major factor limiting gene regulation. We hypothesized that supplying accessibility as an input feature would allow a sequence-to-expression model to focus on important open regions of the genome. Using single-nucleus multiome RNA- and ATAC-sequencing data, we found that the predictive performance of such an augmented model was significantly greater than that of sequence-only or accessibility-only models with similar architectures. Specifically, its ability to predict the expression of highly variable genes and gene expression in other cell types improved, which we attribute to a reduction in bias originating from lowly variable genes. Moreover, post-hoc analyses revealed that higher attribution scores in the input DNA sequences of the augmented model conformed to accessibility, whereas those in the sequence-only model were scattered. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a pre-trained sequence-only model with both sequence and accessibility can boost performance even further. We also highlight the importance of sequencing depth in sequence-to-expression prediction. Altogether, the results of this study provide a compelling argument for the inclusion of chromatin accessibility in sequence-to-expression models, as this strategy can be implemented easily and may improve downstream applications.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312976

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mrx6 belongs to the Pet20-domain-containing protein family, consisting of Mrx6, Pet20, and Sue1. Notably, absence of Mrx6 leads to increased mtDNA copy number. Here, we identify the C-terminus of Mrx6 as essential for its stability and interaction with the mitochondrial matrix protein Mam33. Deletion of Mam33 mimics the effect of Mrx6 loss, resulting in elevated mtDNA copy number. Bioinformatics, mutational analyses, and immunoprecipitation studies reveal that a subcomplex of Mam33 and Mrx6 trimers interacts with the substrate recognition domain of the conserved mitochondrial Lon protease Pim1 through a bipartite motif in the Pet20 domain of Mrx6. Loss of Mrx6, its paralog Pet20, Mam33, or mutations disrupting the interaction between Mrx6 and Pim1 stabilize key proteins required for mtDNA maintenance, the RNA polymerase Rpo41 and the HMG-box-containing protein Cim1. We propose that Mrx6, alongside Pet20 and Mam33, regulates mtDNA copy number by modulating substrate degradation through Pim1. Additionally, Mrx6 loss alters Cim1s function, preventing the detrimental effect on mtDNA maintenance observed upon Cim1 overexpression. The presence of three Pet20-domain proteins in yeast implies broader roles of Lon protease substrate recognition beyond mtDNA regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312977
"Rewiring protein sequence and structure generative models to enhance protein stability prediction","10.1101/2025.02.13.638154","biorxiv",9,3.2,9,9,9,"Li, Z.; Luo, Y.","Yunan Luo","Georgia Institute of Technology","2025-02-18","1","new results","cc_by_nc_nd","bioinformatics","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2025/02/18/2025.02.13.638154.source.xml","Predicting changes in protein thermostability due to amino acid substitutions is essential for understanding human diseases and engineering useful proteins for clinical and industrial applications. While recent advances in protein generative models, which learn probability distributions over amino acids conditioned on structural or evolutionary sequence contexts, have shown impressive performance in predicting various protein properties without task-specific training, their strong unsupervised prediction ability does not extend to all protein functions. In particular, their potential to improve protein stability prediction remains underexplored. In this work, we present SPURS, a novel deep learning framework that adapts and integrates two general-purpose protein generative models-a protein language model (ESM) and an inverse folding model (ProteinMPNN)-into an effective stability predictor. SPURS employs a lightweight neural network module to rewire per-residue structure representations learned by ProteinMPNN into the attention layers of ESM, thereby informing and enhancing ESMs sequence representation learning. This rewiring strategy enables SPURS to harness evolutionary patterns from both sequence and structure data, where the sequence like-lihood distribution learned by ESM is conditioned on structure priors encoded by ProteinMPNN to predict mutation effects. We steer this integrated framework to a stability prediction model through supervised training on a recently released mega-scale thermostability dataset. Evaluations across 12 benchmark datasets showed that SPURS delivers accurate, rapid, scalable, and generalizable stability predictions, consistently outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. Notably, SPURS demonstrates remarkable versatility in protein stability and function analyses: when combined with a protein language model, it accurately identifies protein functional sites in an unsupervised manner. Additionally, it enhances current low-N protein fitness prediction models by serving as a stability prior model to improve accuracy. These results highlight SPURS as a powerful tool to advance current protein stability prediction and machine learning-guided protein engineering workflows.

This may result from long-term coevolution between viruses and bats, that have led to host adaptations contributing to an effective balance between strong antiviral responses with innate immune tolerance. To better understand these virus-host interactions, we combined comparative transcriptomics, phylogenomics and functional assays to characterize the evolution of bat innate immune antiviral factors. First, we stimulated the type I interferon immune pathway in Myotis yumanensis primary cells and identified guanylate-binding protein 5 (GBP5) as the most differentially expressed interferon-stimulated gene (ISG). Phylogenomic analyses showed that bat GBP5 has been under strong episodic positive selection, with numerous rapidly evolving sites and species-specific gene duplications, suggesting past evolutionary arms races. Functional tests on GBP5 orthologs from ten bat species covering the >60 million years of Chiroptera evolution revealed species- and virus-specific restrictions against RNA viruses (retrovirus HIV, and rhabdoviruses European bat lyssavirus and VSV), which are typical signatures of adaptations to past viral epidemics. Interestingly, we also observed a lineage-specific loss of the GBP5 prenylation motif in the common ancestor of Pipistrellus and Eptesicus bats, associated with different GBP5 subcellular localization and loss of antiviral functions. Resurrection of the ancestral prenylation motif in Eptesicus fuscus GBP5 rescued its subcellular localization, but not the complete antiviral activities, suggesting that additional determinants are necessary for the antiviral restriction. Altogether, our results highlight adaptations that contribute to bat specific immunity and provide insights into the functional evolution of antiviral effector GBP5.

Key FindingsO_LIGBP5 is the most differentially expressed gene upon type I interferon stimulation of Myotis yumanensis primary cells.

Despite the parent-of-origin being important in the etiology of the pregnancy, our knowledge of their causes is limited, especially at the point of conception. Using a dataset of 96,660 biopsies and a validation dataset of 44,324 from human blastocysts embryos generated by intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), we estimate that 1.1% of human conceptions (n=1,063) contain extra or missing chromosome sets in zygotes. We identify a maternal age effect, with a 1.059 per year increased risk in triploidy/haploidy (p=0.0008). In 0.03% of couples, we identified three or more triploid/haploid embryos, suggesting a personal risk effect (p=0.03). Genotype analysis of 55 triploid embryo biopsies and their parents show that one third of maternal triploid conceptions originate in meiosis I and two thirds in meiosis II. Seven of these embryos are inferred to have entirely failed to initiate meiotic recombination genome-wide, suggesting that human oocytes with pervasive meiotic recombination failure that are formed during fetal development are capable of ovulation in adult life. Finally, we identify a new type of genome-wide maternal isodiploidy (two maternal chromosome sets) in 0.05% of embryos (41 of 74,009). Collectively, our findings shed light on the biology of meiosis and the formation of human oocytes with the number of chromosome sets.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312977

Chromatin, particularly transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin, resists nuclear deformations through its mechanical response. However, chromatin also exhibits liquid-like properties, casting ambiguity on the physical mechanisms of chromatin-based nuclear elasticity. To determine how heterochromatin strengthens nuclear mechanical response, we performed polymer physics simulations of a nucleus model validated by micromechanical measurements and chromosome conformation capture data. The attachment of peripheral heterochromatin to the lamina is required to transmit forces directly to the chromatin and elicit its elastic response. Thus, increases in heterochromatin levels increase nuclear rigidity by increasing the linkages between chromatin and the lamina. Crosslinks within heterochromatin, such as HP1 proteins, can also stiffen nuclei, but only if chromatin is peripherally tethered. In contrast, heterochromatin affinity interactions that may drive liquid-liquid phase separation do not contribute to nuclear rigidity. When the nucleus is stretched, gel-like peripheral heterochromatin can bear stresses and deform, while the more fluid-like interior euchromatin is less perturbed. Thus, heterochromatins internal structure and stiffness may regulate nuclear mechanics via peripheral attachment to the lamina, while also enabling nuclear mechanosensing of external forces and external measurement of the nucleus internal architecture.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312977

The considerable time and cost of training transformer models has motivated development of alternative approaches inspired by ideas from the signal-processing literature, such as state-space models (Mamba), Fourier transforms (Hyena), and wavelet transforms (MultiResNet). To evaluate these methods as potential replacements (or complements) for attention, we developed a software library bilby, implemented using Python and Jax/Flax, providing convolutional, attention, bidirectional Hyena, bidirectional Mamba, and striped-architecture models for supervised multi-task learning in functional genomics. We report a comparison of these architectures, testing several hyperparameters and variations, and reporting performance statistics for the withheld test set as well as downstream SNP classifiers. Relative to models comprising convolution and attention layers (implemented in Python and TensorFlow via the Baskerville library used by the Borzoi software), models comprising convolutional, bidirectional Mamba, and (optionally) attention layers achieve small but consistent improvements in prediction accuracy, for roughly comparable training times and parameter counts, when averaged across all output tracks and data splits (a proportional increase of 3-4% in Pearson R, and 1-2% in r2, with the highest gains achieved when Mamba and attention layers were combined in a striped architecture). In contrast, Hyena (when reimplemented as described in the literature) was not competitive with attention-based models at these tasks, while MultiResNet proved too slow to be practical. The gains in prediction accuracy of the Mamba-based models do not yet translate to significantly improved performance on downstream SNP classification tasks: benchmarks using a GTEx eQTL dataset yield roughly similar results for Mamba- and attention-based classifiers, with attention marginally outperforming Mamba in one metric (a difference of +0.007 in area under ROC) and slightly underperforming by another metric (a difference of -0.006 in Spearman rank correlation). We argue that these results suggest selective state-space models (such as Mamba and Striped Mamba) warrant further exploration for functional genomics tasks.

However, the drivers of these effects intracellularly remain unclear. Here, in Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that loss of coordinated inter-organelle dynamics causally initiates metabolic inflexibility with age. In young animals, peroxisomes emerge as the priming orchestrators of the fasting response, simultaneously governing lipid droplets (LDs) utilization and mitochondrial bioenergetics. With age, peroxisomal priming is lost, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and impaired dynamic nutrient responses during fasting. Notably, dietary restriction (DR) exerts a rejuvenating effect on peroxisomal function, thereby preserving mitochondrial integrity and promoting longevity. Our study uncovers the expansive network of organelles enabling lipid mobilization during youth, providing critical context to the poorly understood role of peroxisomes in actively maintaining organelle homeodynamics and metabolic flexibility throughout the aging process.","NA","biorxiv",1740089312977
