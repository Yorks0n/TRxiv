This review investigates whether excess weight increases the risk of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with PCC. Methods: Studies published up to July 2023 were searched independently across eight electronic databases to evaluate the risk of developing neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms more than 12 weeks post-infection between exposure and controls groups (excess weight vs. normal weight; obesity vs. non-obesity). Meta-analyses were conducted under a random-effects model. Results: Of the 10,122 abstracts screened, 18 studies (n = 139,091 adults) met the inclusion criteria and reported PCC symptoms according to nutritional status. These studies included 79,050 individuals with excess weight vs 57,926 normal-weight individuals and 30,694 individuals with obesity vs 107,612 non-obese individuals. The presence of excess weight in PCC significantly increased the risk of depression (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.03-1.42), headache (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.09-1.35), memory issues (RR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.24-1.65), sleep disturbance (RR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.16-1.48), and vertigo (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.04- 1.41). Obesity significantly increased the risk of headache (RR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.34- 1.49), smell disorder (RR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.09-1.21), taste disorder (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.07-1.36), and vertigo (RR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.35-1.53). Conclusions: Excess weight or obesity increases the risk of experiencing neuro-symptoms related to PCC. Individuals with these conditions urgently need enhanced personalized care management in current post-pandemic context.","NA","medrxiv",1732313410806

To control the infection with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron JN.1 subvariants, JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccines have been developed. Some previous reports showed that the JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccine of Pfizer/BioNTech (US/Germany) increased antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 subvariants and XEC. However, the efficacy of other available JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccines (e.g., Daiichi-Sankyo, Japan) remains unassessed. To validate the antiviral efficacy induced by JN.1 mRNA vaccines, sera were collected from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech JN.1 mRNA vaccine (N=15) or Daiichi-Sankyo JN.1 mRNA vaccine (N=19) before and 3-4 weeks after vaccination. We then performed a neutralization assay using these sera and pseudoviruses. Both Pfizer/BioNTech JN.1 vaccine (2.4-to 8.0-fold, P=0.0001) and Daiichi-Sankyo JN.1 vaccine (2.3-to 13-fold, P=0.0001) boosted antiviral humoral immunity against all variants tested with statistical significance. While the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine encodes the full-length JN.1 spike (S), the Daiichi-Sankyo mRNA vaccine encodes the receptor-binding domain of JN.1 S. Our data suggest that the receptor-binding domain of JN.1 S can effectively induce antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 subvariants and XEC comparable to the full-length JN.1 S. However, it should be considered that the sizes of our cohorts are relatively small (<20 donors per cohort), and donor characteristics, such as age, sex, underlying disease status, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, may critically affect the experimental results. Future investigations with larger cohorts will address this concern. When compared to vaccination with JN.1 mRNA vaccines, our previous investigations showed that the natural infection of JN.1 and KP.3.3 elicited poorer antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 and its subvariants. Our results suggest that the JN.1 mRNA vaccination more robustly induces antiviral humoral immunity against recent JN.1 subvariants than the natural infection of JN.1 subvariants regardless of manufacturer. Moreover, as we reported last year, the humoral immunity induced by XBB.1.5 monovalent mRNA vaccine against XBB.1.5 was weaker than that against ancestral B.1.1. However, in the case of JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccine, here we showed that the 50% neutralization titer against XBB.1.5 is greater than that against ancestral B.1.1. These observations imply that immune imprinting has shifted from that biased toward pre-Omicron to that biased toward Omicron, depending on the time and/or number of immune stimuli (e.g., infection and/or vaccination).","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

The capability for producing custom-shape high-quality backbones for very large proteins would further expand the scope of protein design. To this end, here we introduce the AlphaFold2 (AF2) cycler (af2cycler) design pipeline. AF2cycler is used to refine draft protein backbone geometries of arbitrary shape created by the Chroma diffusion model or other methods, using a combination of AF2 and ProteinMPNN to achieve high designability with minimal deviations from the initial target structure. In silico testing on multiple protein designs (100-1000 amino acids) demonstrated improvements in structural integrity and designability after af2cycling confirmed by enhanced ESMFold repredictions. Experimental wet lab validation through the design of a variety of test proteins with distinct shapes, each comprising 1000 amino acids, showed structural agreement between in silico predictions and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, establishing the af2cycler's efficacy in translating designs into real-world results. Af2cycler provides a convenient and reliable protein design workflow, particularly for large proteins, with potential for expanding to applications in areas such as design of higher-order protein complexes and multi-state backbone optimization.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Using imaging, we identify genetic perturbations in individual cells while simultaneously measuring their gene expression and subcellular morphology. Using single-cell sequencing, we measure transcriptomic responses to the same genetic perturbations. We apply this approach to study hundreds of genetic perturbations in the mouse liver.

Additionally, 27.3% reported somatic symptoms, 27.3% experienced anxiety, 39% had depressive symptoms, and 80.5% reported stress. Gut microbiome profiling was performed using full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Elevated interleukin-6 levels were observed in the most severe cases, indicating systemic inflammation. Reduced gut bacterial diversity was more pronounced in women and obese patients and correlated with higher disease severity. The presence of the genus Mitsuokella was significantly associated with increased physical, stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, and Granulicatella with critically ill patients.

Recent studies have suggested that SARS- CoV-2 infection can lead to reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), yet, the extent and impact of viral reactivation in COVID-19 and its effect on the host immune system remain incompletely understood.

Here we present a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of viral reactivation of all known chronically infecting viruses in 1,154 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study, who were followed prospectively for twelve months. We reveal significant reactivation of Herpesviridae, Enteroviridae, and Anelloviridae families during acute stage of COVID-19 (0-40 days post- hospitalization), each exhibiting distinct temporal dynamics. We also show that viral reactivation correlated with COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and clinical outcomes, including mortality. Integration of cytokine profiling, cellular immunophenotyping, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics demonstrated virus-specific host responses, including elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, CXCL10, and TNF), increased activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and upregulation of cellular replication genes, independent of COVID-19 severity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Notably, persistent Anelloviridae reactivation during convalescence ([&ge;]3 months post-hospitalization) was associated with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptoms, particularly physical function and fatigue.

Our findings highlight a remarkable prevalence and potential impact of chronic viral reactivation on host responses and clinical outcomes during acute COVID-19 and long term PASC sequelae. Our data provide novel immune, transcriptomic, and metabolomic biomarkers of viral reactivation that may inform novel approaches to prognosticate, prevent, or treat acute COVID- 19 and PASC.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

DesignCohort study.

SettingElectronic health record data.

Participants2 528 916 singleton births from the UKs Clinical Practice Research Datalink (1996-2018), Norways Medical Birth Registry (2009-2020), and Swedens Medical Birth Register (2006-2020).

Main outcome measuresStillbirth, neonatal death, pre- and post-term delivery, small and large for gestational age, and low Apgar score five minutes post-delivery.

ResultsA total of 120 209 (4.8%) deliveries were exposed to maternal antidepressant use during pregnancy. Maternal antidepressant use during pregnancy was associated with increased odds of stillbirth (adjusted pooled OR (aOR) 1.16, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.28), preterm delivery (aOR 1.26, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.30), and Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.75 to 1.91). These findings persisted in the discordant sibling analysis, but with higher uncertainty. The adjusted predicted absolute risk for stillbirth was 0.34% (95% CI 0.33 to 0.35) among the unexposed and 0.40% (95% CI 0.36 to 0.44) in the antidepressant exposed. Restricting to women with depression or anxiety, the association between antidepressant exposure and stillbirth attenuated (aOR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.21). Paternal antidepressant use was modestly associated with preterm delivery and low Apgar score. Most antidepressants were associated with preterm delivery (except paroxetine) and Apgar score (except mirtazapine and amitriptyline).

ConclusionsMaternal antidepressant use during pregnancy may increase the risk of stillbirth, preterm delivery, and low Apgar score, although the absolute risks remained low. Confounding by severity of indication cannot be ruled out, as the severity of symptoms was not available. The modest association between paternal antidepressant use and both preterm delivery and low Apgar score suggests that residual confounding by familial environment cannot be ruled out.","NA","medrxiv",1732313410806

However, we show that organelle boundaries, which are important for defining MCS, are the least confident predictions made by AI. We outline a segmentation strategy termed AI-directed Voxel Extraction (AIVE), that combines AI predictions with image electron signals to confidently segment membrane boundaries irrespective of the AI model used. We demonstrate the precision conferred by AIVE by applying it to the quantitative analysis of organelle interactomes from multiple FIB-SEM datasets. Through AIVE, we discover a previously unknown category of mitochondrial contact that we term the mitochondrial intrusion. We hypothesise that intrusions serve as anchors that stabilize MCS and promote organelle communication.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

However, the specific mechanisms by which viral proteins influence cholesterol remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cholesterol sequestration within lysosomes, with the viral protein ORF3a identified as the primary driver of this effect. Mechanistically, we found that ORF3a interacts directly with the HOPS complex subunit VPS39 through a hydrophobic interface formed by residues W193 and Y184. A W193A mutation in ORF3a significantly rescues cholesterol egress and corrects the mislocalization of the lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC2, which is caused by defective trafficking of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) sorting receptor, the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). We further observed a marked reduction in bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a lipid essential for lysosomal cholesterol egress, in both SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and ORF3a-expressing cells, suggesting BMP reduction as an additional mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-caused cholesterol sequestration. Inhibition of lysosomal cholesterol egress using the compound U18666A significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting a potential viral strategy of manipulating lysosomal cholesterol to modulate host cell susceptibility. Our findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a disrupts cellular cholesterol transport by altering lysosomal protein trafficking and BMP levels, providing new insights into virus-host interactions that contribute to lipid dysregulation in infected cells.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Human skin undergoes both chronological aging and environmental degradation, particularly UV-induced photoaging. Detrimental structural and physiological changes caused by aging include epidermal thinning due to stem cell depletion and dermal atrophy associated with decreased collagen production. Here, we present a comprehensive single-cell atlas of skin aging, analyzing samples from young, middle-aged, and elderly individuals, including both sun-exposed and sun-protected areas. This atlas reveals age-related cellular composition and function changes across various skin cell types, including epidermal stem cells, fibroblasts, hair follicles, and endothelial cells. Using our atlas, we have identified basal stem cells as a highly variable population across aging, more so than other skin cell populations such as fibroblasts. In basal stem cells, we identified ATF3 as a novel regulator of skin aging. ATF3 is a transcriptional factor for genes involved in the aging process, with its expression reduced by 20% during aging. Based on this discovery, we have developed an innovative mRNA-based treatment to mitigate the effects of skin aging. Cell senescence decreased 25% in skin cells treated with ATF3 mRNA, and we observed an over 20% increase in proliferation in treated basal stem cells. Importantly, we also found crosstalk between keratinocytes and fibroblasts as a critical component of therapeutic interventions, with ATF3 rescue of basal cells significantly enhancing fibroblast collagen production by approximately 200%. We conclude that ATF3-targeted mRNA treatment effectively reverses the effects of skin aging by modulating specific cellular mechanisms, offering a novel, targeted approach to human skin rejuvenation.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Barrier formation requires positioning of functional tight junctions (TJ) to the most suprabasal viable layer of the epidermis through a mechanical circuit that is driven by generation of high tension at adherens junctions. However, what allows the sensing of tension build-up at these adhesions and how this tension is balanced to match the requirements of tissue mechanical properties is unclear. Here we show that the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 is essential for the maturation of intercellular junctions into functional, continuous adhesions. Deletion of Piezo1 results in an imbalance of cell contractility and membrane tension, leading to a delay in adhesion maturation. Consequently, the requirement for Piezo1 activity can be bypassed by lowering contractility or elevating membrane tension. In vivo, Piezo1 function in adhesion integrity becomes essential only in aged mice where alterations in tissue mechanics lead to impaired TJs and barrier dysfunction. Collectively these studies reveal an essential function of Piezo1 in the timely establishment and maintenance of cell-cell junctions in the context of a mechanically tensed epidermis.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty. We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit. Based on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still undeniably demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1732313410806

The reconstructed patterns of clonal variation uncovered gene programs driving dynamic positional biasing of clonal composition during axial skeletogenesis and peripheral neurogenesis.

Electrical communication between qNSCs and neurons enables this precise spatial and temporal control of reactivation throughout the entire span of the CNS. Using single-cell RNA-seq we discovered that, remarkably, qNSCs switch on a host of neuronal genes while maintaining a stem cell identity. This transient mixed identity is specific to qNSCs, as neuronal genes are turned off after stem cells resume proliferation. Our results uncover long-range communication between qNSCs to coordinate reactivation, enabled by a transient stem cell-neuron fate.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Here, we characterize the mechanisms that drive the formation of these structures and their function in gene regulation in a lymphoid-to-myeloid differentiation system. Based on analyses at base-pair resolution, we demonstrate a close correlation between binding of regulatory proteins, formation of chromatin interactions, and gene expression. Integration of single-allele topologies and computational modeling shows that tissue-specific gene loci are organized into chromatin hubs, characterized by cooperative interactions between multiple enhancers, promoters, and CTCF-binding sites. Depletion of CTCF strongly impairs the formation of these structures, but has mild effects on gene expression, which can be explained by rewired enhancer-promoter interactions. This demonstrates an instructive role for enhancer-promoter interactions in gene regulation that is independent of cooperative interactions in chromatin hubs. Together, these results contribute to a mechanistic understanding of the structure-function relationship of the genome during cellular differentiation.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

This makes it challenging to obtain high-resolution reconstructions or may even cause projects to fail altogether. We have previously observed that laser flash melting and revitrification of cryo samples reduces preferred orientation for large, symmetric particles. Here, we demonstrate that our method can in fact be used to scramble the orientation of proteins of a range of sizes and symmetries. The effect can be enhanced for some proteins by increasing the heating rate during flash melting or by depositing amorphous ice onto the sample prior to revitrification. This also allows us to shed light onto the underlying mechanism. Our experiments establish a set of tools for overcoming preferred orientation that can be easily integrated into existing workflows.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Biased compounds that selectively activate therapy-relevant pathways promise to be safer, more effective medications. The determinants of bias are poorly understood, however, and rationally-designed, G protein-subtype-selective compounds are lacking. Here, using the prototypical class A GPCR neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), we find that small molecules binding the intracellular GPCR-transducer interface change G protein coupling by subtype-specific and predictable mechanisms, enabling rational drug design. We demonstrate that the compound SBI-553 switches NTSR1 G protein preference by acting both as a molecular bumper and a molecular glue. Structurally, SBI-553 occludes G protein binding determinants on NTSR1, promoting association with select G protein subtypes for which an alternative, shallow-binding conformation is energetically favorable. Minor modifications to the SBI-553 scaffold produce allosteric modulators with distinct G protein subtype selectivity profiles. Selectivity profiles are probe-independent, conserved across species, and translate to differences in in vivo activity. These studies demonstrate that G protein selectivity can be tailored with small changes to a single chemical scaffold targeting the receptor-transducer interface and, as this pocket is broadly conserved, present a strategy for pathway-selective drug discovery applicable to the diverse GPCR superfamily.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

However, within individual brain areas, neurons often exhibit very diverse and seemingly disorganized responses. A more careful analysis shows that these neurons can sometimes be grouped together into specialized subpopulations (categorical representations). Organization can also be found at the level of the representational geometry in the activity space, typically in the form of low-dimensional structures. It is still unclear how the geometry in the activity space and the structure of the response profiles of individual neurons are related. Here, we systematically analyzed the geometric and selectivity structure of the neural population from 40+ cortical regions in mice performing a decision-making task (IBL public Brainwide Map data set). We used a reduced-rank regression approach to quantify the selectivity profiles of single neurons and multiple measures of dimensionality to characterize the representational geometry of task variables. We then related these measures within single areas to the position of each area in the sensory-cognitive cortical hierarchy. Our findings reveal that only a few regions (in primary sensory areas) are categorical. When multiple brain areas are considered, we observe clustering that reflects the brains large-scale organization. The representational geometry of task variables also changed along the cortical hierarchy, with higher dimensionality in cognitive regions. These trends were explained by analytical computations linking the maximum dimensionality of representational geometry to the clustering of selectivity at the single neuron level. Finally, we computed the shattering dimensionality (SD), a measure of the linear separability of neural activity vectors; remarkably, the SD remained near maximal across all regions, suggesting that the observed variability in the selectivity profiles allows neural populations to maintain high computational flexibility. These results provide a new mathematical and empirical perspective on selectivity and representation geometry in the cortical neural code.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Endothelial cells (ECs) of the BBB are enwrapped by mural cells including pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) that regulate angiogenesis, vessel stability and barrier function. To explore mural cell control of the BBB, we investigated neurovascular phenotypes in zebrafish pdgfrb mutants that lack brain pericytes and vSMCs. As expected, mutants showed an altered cerebrovascular network with mis-patterned capillaries. Unexpectedly, mutants displayed no BBB leakage from larval through to young adult stages. This demonstrates that pericytes and vSMCs do not control BBB function in young zebrafish. Instead, we observed adult BBB disruption occurring at ""hotspot"" focal haemorrhages at major vessel aneurysms. ECs at leakage hotspots showed induction of caveolae on abluminal surfaces and major structural defects including basement membrane thickening and disruption. Our work suggests that capillary pericytes regulate cerebrovascular patterning in development and vSMCs of major arteries protect from haemorrhage and BBB breakdown in older zebrafish. The fact that young zebrafish can have a conserved BBB with intact barrier function in the absence of mural cells, warrants renewed interrogation of the paradigm of mural cell control of the BBB.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Viewing videos of tail-shocked mice was sufficient to elicit a pupil response in the observer. Whole-brain c-Fos mapping revealed a broad network of 88 brain regions activated during ECo, with all areas activated in the demonstrator also engaged in the observer.

Here we use a computational model to explore how local and global components of a network shape the Slow Wave Activity (SWA). We performed a sensitivity analysis of multiple cellular and synaptic features in models of isolated and connected networks. This allowed us to explore how the interaction of local properties and long-range connections shape the SWA of a population and its neighbors, as well as how the sequential propagation of active Up states lead to the emergence of preferred modes of propagation. We described relevant features of cortical Up states that are modulated by stiff combinations of parameters of the local circuit as opposed to other that are sensitive to the level of excitability of the whole network and the input coming from neighbor populations. We found that while manipulations in the synaptic excitatory/inhibitory balance can create local changes, cellular components that modulate the excitability or adaptation of a population have a long-range effect that leads to changes in neighbor populations too. Additionally, our simulations guided in vivo experiments that showed how heterogeneities in excitability between cortical areas can determine the directionality of travelling waves during SWA. We expect these results to motivate future research exploring and comparing cortical circuits through the analysis of their Up states.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

By training SAEs on embeddings from the PLM ESM-2, we identify up to 2,548 human-interpretable latent features per layer that strongly correlate with up to 143 known biological concepts such as binding sites, structural motifs, and functional domains. In contrast, examining individual neurons in ESM-2 reveals up to 46 neurons per layer with clear conceptual alignment across 15 known concepts, suggesting that PLMs represent most concepts in superposition. Beyond capturing known annotations, we show that ESM-2 learns coherent concepts that do not map onto existing annotations and propose a pipeline using language models to automatically interpret novel latent features learned by the SAEs. As practical applications, we demonstrate how these latent features can fill in missing annotations in protein databases and enable targeted steering of protein sequence generation. Our results demonstrate that PLMs encode rich, interpretable representations of protein biology and we propose a systematic framework to extract and analyze these latent features.

Thirty healthy, untrained participants conducted either periodic RT (RT1-DT-RT2, n=17) or a 10-week no-training control period (n=13) followed by 20 weeks of RT (n=11). RT included twice-weekly supervised whole-body RT sessions, and resting vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained for proteomics analysis using high-end DIA-PASEF's mass spectrometry. First RT period altered 150 proteins (93% increased) involved in e.g. energy metabolism, cytokine signalling, and protein processing compared with minor changes during the no-training control period. The proteome adaptations were similar after the second RT compared to baseline demonstrating reproducibility in proteome adaptations to RT. Many of the proteins were reversed towards baseline after detraining and increased again after retraining. These reversible proteins were especially involved in aerobic energy metabolism. Interestingly, several proteins remain elevated after detraining, including carbonyl reductase 1, histone H1.5, and many calcium-binding proteins. Specifically, Calpain 2 (CAPN2), a calcium-activated protease was recently identified as an epigenetic muscle memory gene. We show for the first time that human skeletal muscle experiences retained levels of several proteins even into detraining.

Crucially, fMRI is vital for studying subcortical areas, as those are practically out of reach for conventional EEG. At the same time, EEG is cost-effective and, thus, often preferable to fMRI if comparable information could be extracted which is not the case then the deep subcortical brain activity is of interest. Here we explore the possibility of recovering subcortical hemodynamics from the non-invasively recorded scalp EEG signals. To this end, we have developed a lightweight EEG-to-fMRI neural network and using an extended and publicly available dataset with concurrently recorded EEG-fMRI data show that our model allows for the prediction of the detailed Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity of 7 bilaterally symmetric subcortical structures solely from multichannel EEG data. We report the performance significantly above chance and exceeding the scores achieved for a single subcortical structure and obtained on the proprietary datasets. In contrast to the studies focusing on a single subcortical region in our approach we were able to decode multichannel EEG into 14 + 4 region-specific variations of BOLD signals measured relative to their mean hemodynamic activity. The use of relative BOLD signals allowed us to exert control over the artificial inflation of decoding accuracy scores when the decoder predicts the common mode component that is likely to have a non-neuronal origin (heartbeat, movement, etc). Finally, we interpreted our model. The electrical activity of the sensorimotor cortex appeared to contribute most to the prediction of the subcortical hemodynamics. Also, the hemodynamics of the thalamus has the smallest delay with respect to the EEG signals. Both observations are physiologically plausible and ensure the potential reliability of the decoder. Taken together, these findings pave the road towards the creation of low-cost AI-powered EEG-based fMRI digital twin technology capable of tracking subcortical activity in an ecological setting. The technology, once mature, will find numerous applications from fundamental neuroscience through diagnostics to neurorehabilitation and affective neurointerfaces.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Unlike classical senses, signals from vestibular organs are not conveyed to a dedicated cortical area but are broadcast throughout the cortex. Surprisingly, the routes taken by vestibular signals to reach the cortex are still largely uncharted. Here we show that the primary visual cortex (V1) receives real-time head movement signals -- direction, velocity, and acceleration -- from the ipsilateral pulvinar and contralateral visual cortex. The ipsilateral pulvinar provides the main head movement signal, with a bias toward contraversive movements (e.g. clockwise movements in left V1). Conversely, the contralateral visual cortex provides head movement signals during ipsiversive movements. Crucially, head movement variables encoded in V1 are already encoded in the pulvinar, suggesting that those variables are computed subcortically. Thus, the convergence of inter- and intrahemispheric signals endows V1 with a rich representation of the animals head movements.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Compared with 3 Tesla (3T) MRI, 7 Tesla (7T) MRI can detect more subtle injuries, including hippocampal subfield volume differences and additional standard biomarkers such as white matter lesions. 7T MRI could help with the interpretation of the various persistent post-acute and distal onset sequelae of COVID-19 infection.

ObjectiveTo investigate the differences in white matter hyperintensity (WMH), hippocampal subfields volumes, and cognition between patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and non-hospitalized participants in a multi-site/multi-national cohort.

DesignOriginal investigation of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between 5/2020 and 10/2022 in 3 USA and 1 UK medical centers with follow-up at hospital discharge.

ParticipantsA total of 179 participants without a history of dementia completed cognitive, mood and other assessments and MRI scans.

ExposureCOVID-19 severity, as measured by hospitalization vs no hospitalization

Main Outcomes and Measures7T MRI scans were acquired. All WMH and hippocampal subfield volumes were corrected for intracranial volumes to account for subject variability. Cognition was assessed using a comprehensive battery of tests. Pearson correlations and unpaired t-tests were performed to assess correlations and differences between hospitalized and non-hospitalized groups.

ResultsWe found similar WMH volume (4112 vs 3144mm3, p=0.2131), smaller hippocampal volume (11856 vs 12227mm3, p=0.0497) and lower cognitive and memory performance, especially the MoCA score (24.9 vs 26.4 pts, p=0.0084), duration completing trail making test B (97.6 vs 79.4 seconds, p=0.0285), Craft immediate recall (12.6 vs 16.4 pts, p<0.0001), Craft delay recall (12.0 vs 15.6 pts, p=0.0001), and Benson figure copy (15.2 vs 16.1 pts, p=0.0078) in 52 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (19[37%] female; mean[SD] age, 61.1[7.4] years) compared with 111 age-matched non-hospitalized participants (66[59%] female; mean[SD] age, 61.5[8.4] years).

Conclusions and RelevanceOur results indicate that hospitalized COVID-19 cases show lower hippocampal volume when compared to non-hospitalized participants. We also show that WMH and hippocampal volumes correlate with worse cognitive scores in hospitalized patients compared with non-hospitalized participants, potentially indicating recent lesions and atrophy.

Key PointsQuestion: Do white matter hyperintensity burden, hippocampal whole and subfield volumes, and cognition differ between patients hospitalized with COVID-19 versus participants without hospitalization?

Findings: We found no significant difference in white matter hyperintensity volume, but hippocampal volume was reduced, and cognitive and memory performance were worse in those hospitalized for COVID-19 compared with age-matched non-hospitalized group (either mild COVID-19 or no COVID-19 reported). In the hospitalized group, increased white matter hyperintensity and reduced hippocampal volumes are significantly higher correlated with worse cognitive and memory scores.

Meaning: Adults hospitalized for COVID-19 had lower hippocampal volumes and worse cognitive performance than adults with COVID-19 that did not lead to hospitalization or without reported COVID-19 infection.","NA","medrxiv",1732313410806

Overexpressing the subunits RPB1, RPB3 and RPB4 in cells we find that these induce DNA damage. However, the mechanisms behind this increased genome instability are specific for each subunit, linked to the unique transcription alterations generated by the subunit overexpression. Importantly, we find significant overlap between the genes with more DNA damage in our cell line models and those more affected in cancers with subunit upregulation, indicating that upregulations could be responsible for some of the phenotypes present in these patients.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

In Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), considerable evidence shows that the dynamics between residual leukemia and the patients immune system can result in either sustained disease control, leading to treatment-free remission (TFR), or disease recurrence. The question remains how to integrate mechanistic and data-driven models to support prediction of treatment outcomes. Starting from classical ecological modeling concepts, which allow to explicitly account for immune interactions at the cellular level, we incorporate time-course data on natural killer (NK) cell number, function, and their tumor-induced suppression into our general model of CML treatment. We identify relevant time scales governing treatment and immune response, enabling refined model calibration using tumor and NK cell time courses from different datasets. While the model successfully describes patient-specific response dynamics, critical parameters for predicting treatment outcome remain uncertain. However, by explicitly incorporating tumor load changes in response to TKI dose alterations, these parameters can be estimated and used to derive model predictions for treatment cessation. Further exploring dynamic changes in the number of functional immune cells, we suggest specific measurement strategies of immune effector cell populations to enhance prediction accuracy for CML recurrence following treatment cessation. The generalizability and flexibility of our approach represent a significant step towards quantitative, personalized medicine that integrates tumor-immune dynamics to guide clinical decisions and optimize dynamic cancer therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Here we introduce a methodology grounded in spectral graph theory to elucidate a one-dimensional curve that effectively approximates the spatial coordinates of the examined sample. This curve is then used to establish a new coordinate system that better reflects tissue morphology. We then develop a generalized additive model (GAM) to detect genes with variable expression in the new morphologically relevant coordinate system. Our approach directly models gene counts, thereby eliminating the need for normalization or transformations to satisfy normality assumptions. We demonstrate improved performance relative to current methods based on hypothesis testing, while also accurately estimating gene expression patterns and precisely identifying spatial loci where deviations from constant expression are observed.

In bryophytes the dominant multicellular haploid phase produces motile sperm that swim through water to the egg to effect fertilization from which a relatively small diploid phase develops. In angiosperms, the reduced multicellular haploid phase produces non-motile sperm that is delivered to the egg through a pollen tube to effect fertilization from which the dominant diploid phase develops. These different life cycle characteristics are likely to impact the distribution of genetic variation among populations. However, little is known about the distribution of genetic variation among populations of bryophytes. To understand how genetic variation is distributed among populations of a bryophyte and to establish the foundation for population genetics research in bryophytes, we described the genetic diversity of collections of Marchantia polymorpha subspecies ruderalis, a cosmopolitan ruderal liverwort. We explored genetic diversity of this species using 78 genetically unique (non-clonal) accessions from a total of 209 collected from 37 sites in Europe and Japan. There was no detectable population structure among European populations but significant genetic differentiation between Japanese and European populations. By associating genetic variation across the genome with global climate data, we identified summer temperature and precipitation as climate factors influencing the frequency of adaptative alleles.

In this study, we identify a novel, non-canonical role for TORC1 in regulating P starvation responses in Arabidopsis. We demonstrate that P limitation activates TORC1, leading to the stabilization of PHR1. Inhibition of TORC1 increased sensitivity to P starvation, accompanied by disruption of starvation-induced transcriptional reprogramming. Additionally, our results reveal that the TORC1-PHR1 signaling axis plays a crucial role in reprogramming the expression of genes involved in the plant immune signaling network. This regulation is critical for the symbiotic association with the endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica under P starvation.

Although the ability of Stentor to habituate has been extensively documented, the mechanism of learning is currently not known. Here we take a bottom-up approach and investigate a simple biochemistry-based model based on prior electrophysiological measurements in Stentor along with general properties of receptor molecules. In this model, a mechanoreceptor senses the stimulus and leads to channel opening to change membrane potential, with a sufficient change in polarization triggering an action potential that drives contraction. Receptors that are activated can become internalized, after which they can either be degraded or recycled back to the cell surface. This activity-dependent internalization provides a potential means for the cell to learn. Stochastic simulations of this model confirm that it is capable of showing habituation similar to what is seen in actual Stentor cells, including the lack of dishabituation by strong stimuli and the apparently step-like response of individual cells during habituation. The model also can account for several habituation hallmarks that a previous two-state Markov model could not, namely, the dependence of habituation rate on stimulus magnitude, which had to be added onto the two state model but arises naturally in the receptor inactivation model; the rate of response recovery after cessation of stimulation; the ability of high frequency stimulus sequences to drive faster habituation that results in a lower response probability, and the potentiation of habituation by repeated rounds of training and recovery. The model makes the prediction that application of high force stimuli that do not normally habituate should drive habituation to weaker stimuli due to decrease in the receptor number, which serves as an internal hidden variable. We confirmed this prediction using two new sets of experiments involving alternation of weak and strong stimuli. Furthermore, the model predicts that training with high force stimuli delays response recovery to low force stimuli, which aligns with our new experimental data. The model also predicts subliminal accumulation, wherein continuation of training even after habituation has reached asymptotic levels should lead to delayed response recovery, which was also confirmed by new experiments. The model is unable to account for the phenomenon of rate sensitivity, in which habituation caused by higher frequency stimuli is more easily reversed leading to a frequency dependence of response recovery. Such rate sensitivity has not been reported in Stentor. Here we carried out a new set of experiments which are consistent with the models prediction of the lack of rate sensitivity. This work demonstrates how a simple model can suggest new ways to probe single-cell learning at an experimental level. Finally, we interpret the model in terms of a kernel estimator that the cell may use to guide its decisions about how to response to new stimuli as they arise based on information, or the lack thereof, from past stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

However, mapping transcriptomic changes across diverse cell types in response to various stimuli and elucidating underlying disease mechanisms remains challenging. Studies involving physical stimuli, such as radiotherapy, or chemical stimuli, like drug testing, demand labor-intensive experimentation, often hindering the rapid advancement of mechanistic insight and drug discovery. To address this, we present Squidiff, a diffusion model-based generative framework designed to predict transcriptomic changes across diverse cell types in response to a wide range of environmental changes. We demonstrate Squidiffs robustness across various scenarios, including cell differentiation, gene perturbation, and drug response prediction. Through continuous denoising and semantic feature integration, Squidiff effectively learns transient cell states and predicts high-resolution transcriptomic landscapes over time and conditions. Furthermore, we applied Squidiff to model the development of blood vessel organoids and cellular responses to neutron irradiation and growth factors. Our results demonstrate that Squidiff enables in silico screening of cell molecular landscapes, facilitating rapid hypothesis generation and providing valuable insights for precision medicine.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Many neuronal types show a large depolarization baseline offset (DBLO), which is defined as the positive difference between the minimum membrane potential during action potential trains and resting. We used stochastic parameter search in experimentally constrained conductance-based models to show that four key factors together account for high DBLO: Liquid Junction Potential correction, high backpropagating passive charges during the repolarization phase of an action potential, fast potassium delayed rectifier kinetics, and appropriate transient sodium current kinetics. Several plausible mechanisms for DBLO, such as Ohmic depolarization due to current input or low-pass filtering by the membrane, fail to explain the effect, and many published conductance-based models do not correctly manifest high DBLO. Finally, physiological levels of DBLO constrain ion channel levels and kinetics, and are linked to cellular processes such as bistable firing, spikelets, and calcium influx.

The complex landscape of tRNA modification presents significant analysis challenges and to date no single approach enables the simultaneous measurement of important but disparate chemical properties of individual, mature tRNA molecules. We developed a new, integrated approach to analyze the sequence, modification, and aminoacylation state of tRNA molecules in a high throughput nanopore sequencing experiment, leveraging a chemical ligation that embeds the charged amino acid in an adapted tRNA molecule. During nanopore sequencing, the embedded amino acid generates unique distortions in ionic current and translocation speed, enabling application of machine learning approaches to classify charging status and amino acid identity. Specific applications of the method indicate it will be broadly useful for examining relationships and dependencies between tRNA sequence, modification, and aminoacylation.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Here we developed IMMClock, a novel immune aging clock that uses gene expression data to predict the biological age of individual CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, and NK cells. The accuracy of IMMClock is first validated across multiple independent datasets, demonstrating its robustness. Second, utilizing the IMMClock, we find that intrinsic cellular aging processes are more strongly altered during immune aging than differentiation processes. Thirdly, our analysis confirms the strong associations between immune aging and established processes such as cellular senescence, exhaustion, and telomere length at the single cell level. Furthermore, immune aging is accelerated under several disease conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Finally, we apply IMMClock to analyze a perturb-seq gene activation screen of T cell functionality. We find that the post-perturbation immune age of individual T cells is strongly correlated with their pre-perturbation immune age. Furthermore, the immune age at resting state of individual T cells is strongly predictive of their post-stimulation activation state. Overall, IMMClock advances our understanding of immune aging by providing precise, single-cell level age estimations. Its future applications hold promise for identifying interventions that concomitantly rejuvenate and activate T cells, potentially enhancing efforts to counteract age-related immune decline.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Here, we leverage the repeated, independent evolution of obligate cavity-nesting in birds to test the hypothesis that pressure to compete for a limited breeding resource has facilitated convergent evolution in behavior, hormones, and gene expression. We used an integrative approach, combining aggression assays in the field, testosterone measures, and transcriptome-wide analyses of the brain in wild-captured females and males. Our experimental design compared species pairs across five avian families, each including one obligate cavity-nesting species and a related species with a more flexible nest strategy. We find behavioral convergence, with higher levels of territorial aggression in obligate cavity-nesters, particularly among females. Across species, levels of testosterone in circulation were not associated with nest strategy, nor aggression. Phylogenetic analyses of individual genes and co-regulated gene networks revealed more shared patterns of brain gene expression than expected by drift, but the scope of convergent gene expression evolution was limited to a small percent of the genome. When comparing our results to other studies that did not use phylogenetic methods, we suggest that accounting for shared evolutionary history may reduce the number of genes inferred as convergently evolving. Altogether, we find that behavioral convergence in response to shared ecological pressures is associated with largely independent gene expression evolution across different avian families, punctuated by a narrow set of convergently evolving genes.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Recently, a comprehensive model of object space in macaques was proposed, defined by the orthogonal axes of animacy and aspect ratio (Bao et al., 2020). However, when using stimuli that dissociated category, animacy, and aspect ratio in humans, no tuning of aspect ratio was observed in fMRI data (Yargholi & Op de Beeck, 2023). This difference could be a result of different stimuli, the limited temporal resolution of fMRI, or information available about the presented stimuli. Here, we asked if and when information about aspect ratio, animacy, and category is available over time. We collected whole-brain electroencephalography (EEG) data while participants (N = 20) viewed the stimulus set used by Yargholi & Op de Beeck (2023). To mask object details and increase reliance on shape information, we also presented silhouette versions of the stimuli. Stimuli were presented in 5Hz streams using rapid serial visual presentation, with intact and silhouette stimuli sets were shown in separate streams. Using standard multivariate decoding pipelines and representational similarity analysis, we found that aspect ratio, category, and animacy were represented during visual object processing. The dominant dimension was modulated by stimulus type, demonstrating that the observable dimensions of object space depend on the nature of the stimuli presented. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that aspect ratio is represented during object processing, however earlier and more transiently than categorical dimensions, such as animacy. By focusing on underlying temporal dynamics, our results provide clear new insights into the contradicting findings reported in previous work and reveal a more nuanced understanding of how object space evolves over time.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

These molecules have been shown to react with cysteine residues of the androgen receptor transactivation domain and form covalent adducts under physiological conditions. It is currently unclear how covalent attachment of these molecules alters the conformational ensemble of the androgen receptor. Here, we utilize all-atom molecular dynamics computer simulations to simulate covalent adducts of the small molecule ligands EPI-002 and EPI-7170 bound to the disordered androgen receptor transactivation domain. Our simulations reveal that the conformational ensembles of androgen receptor transactivation domain covalent adducts are heterogeneous and disordered. We find that covalent attachment of EPI-002 and EPI-7170 increases the population of collapsed helical transactivation domain conformations relative to the populations observed in non-covalent binding simulations and we identify networks of protein-ligand interactions that stabilize collapsed conformations in covalent adduct ensembles. We compare the populations of protein-ligand interactions observed in covalent adduct ensembles to those observed in non-covalent ligand-bound ensembles and find substantial differences. Our results provide atomically detailed descriptions of covalent adducts formed by small molecules and an intrinsically disordered protein and suggest strategies for developing more potent covalent inhibitors of intrinsically disordered proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are widespread cis-regulatory elements in eukaryotic genomes that regulate translation, but it remains unclear whether and how uORFs contribute to stabilizing protein levels. In this study, we performed ribosome translation simulations on mRNA to quantitatively assess the extent to which uORF translation influences the translational variability of downstream coding sequences (CDS) across varying contexts. Our simulations revealed that uORF translation dampens CDS translational variability, with buffering capacity increasing in proportion to uORF efficiency, length, and number. We then compared the translatomes at different developmental stages of two Drosophila species, demonstrating that uORFs buffer mRNA translation fluctuations during both evolution and development. Experimentally, deleting a uORF in the bcd gene--a prominent example of translational buffering--resulted in extensive changes in gene expression and phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster. Additionally, we observed uORF-mediated buffering between primates and within human populations. Together, our results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism by which uORFs stabilize gene translation during development and across evolutionary time.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Without voluntary practice related to anthropic mummification, as will be seen with the Egyptian Dynastic empires, human remains from this period were naturally mummified because of the natural environmental conditions, possibly enveloped in plant mats and animal skins. This study focuses on four mummies from the Natural History Museum of Musee des Confluences in Lyon (France). The geographic origin of the mummies and climatic conditions at that time were deduced from {delta}18O measurements on teeth and bones. These measurements confirm that the primary source of drinking water was the Nile, and that one mummy of unknown origin also originated from Upper Egypt like the other three. The diet and life habits of these individuals were inferred from carbon ({delta}13C), nitrogen ({delta}15N) and sulfur ({delta}34S) isotope compositions of their skins and bone collagens. Our study is of particular interest as we were able to analyse the animal skins and plant material enveloping the mummies using the same isotopic systems. The mean {delta}15N values obtained in human skins (17.9{+/-}2.4{per thousand}, AIR) were found to be high, and consistent with the values measured in animal skins (16.0{+/-}2.9{per thousand}, AIR). The analysed plants have even higher values, with an average of 22.1{+/-}2.2{per thousand}, AIR. The most probable explanation for the markedly elevated {delta}15N values observed in all the materials investigated is localised soil amendment practices. This is corroborated by the consistent nitrogen isotopic signatures across all the examined tissues, with a notable prevalence in plant tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

We provide evidence that differentiating germ cell cysts extend cytonemes towards the niche during dedifferentiation to reactivate BMP signalling. We show that the Enabled (Ena) actin polymerase is localised to the tips of germ cell cytonemes and is necessary for robust cytoneme formation, as its mislocalisation reduces the frequency, length and directionality of cytonemes. Furthermore, specifically perturbing cytoneme function through Ena mislocalisation reduces germ cell BMP responsiveness and the ability of differentiating cysts to dedifferentiate. We discuss how cytonemes may be widely used by differentiating cells to re-establish niche contact and signal responsiveness following stem cell loss, promoting robust dedifferentiation of stem cells in diverse contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Despite much progress, little is known about how genetic architecture varies across the trait continuum and, in particular, if it differs in the tails of complex traits, where disease often occurs. Here, applying a novel approach based on polygenic scores, we reveal striking departures from polygenic architecture across 148 quantitative trait tails, consistent with distinct concentrations of high-impact rare alleles in one or both tails of most of the traits. We demonstrate replication of these results across ancestries, cohorts, repeat measures, and using an orthogonal family-based approach. Furthermore, trait tails with inferred enrichment of rare alleles are associated with more exome study hits, reduced fecundity, advanced paternal age, and lower predictive accuracy of polygenic scores. Finally, we find evidence of ongoing selection consistent with the observed departures in polygenicity and demonstrate, via simulation, that traits under stabilising selection are expected to have tails enriched for rare, large-effect alleles. Overall, our findings suggest that while common variants of small effect likely account for most of the heritability in complex traits, rare variants of large effect are often more important in the trait tails, particularly among individuals at highest risk of disease. Our study has implications for rare variant discovery, the utility of polygenic scores, the study of selection in humans, an for the relative importance of common and rare variants to complex traits and diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

This advocates for investigating methods to accelerate motor axon growth. Electrical nerve stimulation and exercise both enhance motor axon regeneration in rodents and patients, but these interventions cannot always be easily implemented. A roadblock to uncover novel therapeutic approaches based on the effects of activity is the lack of understanding of the synaptic drives responsible for activity-mediated facilitation of axon regeneration. We hypothesized that the relevant excitatory inputs facilitating axon regrowth originate in GABA/glycine synapses which become depolarizing after downregulation of the potassium chloride cotransporter 2 in motoneurons following axotomy. To test this, we injected tetanus toxin (TeTx) in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of mice to block the release of GABA/glycine specifically on TA motoneurons. Thereafter, we axotomized all sciatic motoneurons by nerve crush and analyzed the time-courses of muscle reinnervation in TeTx- treated (TA) and untreated (lateral gastrocnemius, LG) motoneurons. Muscle reinnervation was slower in TA motoneurons with blocked GABA/glycine synapses, as measured by recovery of M- responses and anatomical reinnervation of neuromuscular junctions. Post-hoc immunohistochemistry confirmed the removal of the vesicular associated membrane proteins 1 and 2 by TeTx activity, specifically from inhibitory synapses. These proteins are necessary for exocytotic release of neurotransmitters. Therefore, we conclude that GABA/glycine neurotransmission on regenerating motoneurons facilitates axon growth and muscle reinnervation and discuss possible interventions to modulate these inputs on regenerating motoneurons.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

Here we show that dietary restriction (DR) suppresses tumor growth by enhancing CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. DR reshapes CD8+ T cell differentiation within the tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting the development of effector T cell subsets while limiting the accumulation of exhausted T (Tex) cells, and synergizes with anti-PD1 immunotherapy to restrict tumor growth. Mechanistically, DR enhances CD8+ T cell metabolic fitness through increased ketone body oxidation (ketolysis), which boosts mitochondrial membrane potential and fuels tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-dependent pathways essential for T cell function. T cells deficient for ketolysis exhibit reduced mitochondrial function, increased exhaustion, and fail to control tumor growth under DR conditions. Our findings reveal a critical role for the immune system in mediating the anti-tumor effects of DR, highlighting nutritional modulation of CD8+ T cell fate in the TME as a critical determinant of anti-tumor immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410806

In this paper, we present an alternative visual analysis tool that uses Protein Language Model (PLM) embeddings. Our PLVis pipeline employs dimensionality reduction algorithms to cluster similar sequences, enabling rapid assessment of proteins based on their neighbors. Through analysis using average Jaccard distance and cosine similarity metrics, we found that well-separated clusters (those with silhouette scores above 0.95) captured high-dimensional information better than other regions of the projection.

While small-molecule degraders 20 recruiting the autophagy machinery to targets are starting to emerge, it remains unclear which component 21 of the autophagy lysosomal pathway is most efficacious to induce selective target degradation. Here, we 22 describe two orthogonal induced-proximity strategies to identify and prioritize autophagy effectors that are 23 sufficient to degrade organelles as well as soluble targets. We show that induced proximity of different 24 effectors such as autophagy cargo receptors, ATG8-like proteins or the kinases ULK1 and TBK1 are 25 sufficient to trigger mitophagy. In contrast, self-oligomerizing autophagy cargo receptors outperform ATG8-26 like effectors and autophagy-related kinases in clearing a soluble cytosolic protein. We further explore the 27 importance of avidity for targeted degradation via autophagy and reveal that the PB1 domain of p62 fused 28 to a LIR peptide is a minimal degron to induce the degradation of mitochondria as well as cytosolic proteins. 29 By developing a novel and highly selective intrabody against the autophagy cargo receptor p62 into a 30 heterobifunctional degrader, we demonstrate that recruitment of endogenous p62 is sufficient to clear 31 mitochondria.

Prior to testing whether aging biomarkers may be useful as surrogate endpoints, it is first necessary to determine whether they are responsive to interventions that target aging. Epigenetic clocks are aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation with prognostic value for many aging outcomes. Many individual studies are beginning to explore whether epigenetic clocks are responsive to interventions. However, the diversity of both interventions and epigenetic clocks in different studies make them difficult to compare systematically. Here, we curate TranslAGE-Response, a harmonized database of 51 public and private longitudinal interventional studies and calculate a consistent set of 16 prominent epigenetic clocks for each study, along with 95 other DNAm biomarkers that help explain changes in each clock. With this database, we discover patterns of responsiveness across a variety of interventions and DNAm biomarkers. For example, clocks trained to predict mortality or pace of aging have the strongest response across all interventions and show consistent agreement with each other, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions drive the strongest response from DNAm biomarkers, and study population and study duration are key factors in driving responsiveness of DNAm biomarkers in an intervention. Some classes of interventions such as TNF-alpha inhibitors have strong, consistent effects across multiple studies, while others such as senolytic drugs have inconsistent effects. Clocks with multiple sub-scores (i.e. ""explainable clocks"") provide specificity and greater mechanistic insight into responsiveness of interventions than single-score clocks. Our work can help the geroscience field design future clinical trials, by guiding the choice of interventions, specific subsets of epigenetic clocks to minimize multiple testing, study duration, study population, and sample size, with the eventual aim of determining whether epigenetic clocks can be used as surrogate endpoints.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

While intracellular Ca2+ signalling has been shown to control cell migration in multiple cell contexts, it is unknown whether it is required for DVE migration.

Using the GCaMP6f Ca2+ reporter line we performed a detailed assessment of Ca2+ dynamics between E0.5 - E5.5 using live imaging. We find that prior to implantation, Ca2+ transients are rare, but at E5.5 widespread, periodic, Ca2+ transients in extra-embryonic tissues can be observed, including in the VE and ExE. In contrast, cells of the E5.5 epiblast remain relatively quiescent but show sporadic large-scale multi-cellular waves. Inhibition of SERCA at E5.5 abolishes Ca2+ transients and leads to DVE arrest, indicative that these transients are required for axial patterning. Together these results reveal the pattern of Ca2+ handling in the early mouse embryo and a novel requirement in anterior-posterior axis formation.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

Representation learning methods summarize high-dimensional single-cell data into a manageable latent space in a typically nonlinear fashion, allowing cross-sample integration or generative modeling. However, these methods often produce entangled representations, limiting interpretability and downstream analyses. Existing disentanglement methods instead either require supervised information or impose sparsity and linearity, which may not capture the complexity of biological data. We, therefore, introduce Disentangled Representation Variational Inference (DRVI), an unsupervised deep generative model that learns nonlinear, disentangled representations of single-cell omics. This is achieved by combining recently introduced additive decoders with nonlinear pooling, for which we theoretically prove disentanglement under reasonable assumptions. We validate DRVIs disentanglement capabilities across diverse relevant biological problems, from development to perturbational studies and cell atlases, decomposing, for example, the Human Lung Cell Atlas into meaningful, interpretable latent dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that if applied to batch integration, DRVIs integration quality does not suffer from the disentanglement constraints and instead is on par with entangled integration methods. With its disentangled latent space, DRVI is inherently interpretable and facilitates the identification of rare cell types, provides novel insights into cellular heterogeneity beyond traditional cell types, and highlights developmental stages.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

Despite considerable progress in physics-based methods for peptide design and deep-learning methods for protein design, there are currently no robust approaches for de novo design of protein-binding macrocycles. Here, we introduce RFpeptides, a denoising diffusion-based pipeline for designing macrocyclic peptide binders against protein targets of interest. We test 20 or fewer designed macrocycles against each of four diverse proteins and obtain medium to high-affinity binders against all selected targets. Designs against MCL1 and MDM2 demonstrate KD between 1-10 M, and the best anti-GABARAP macrocycle binds with a KD of 6 nM and a sub-nanomolar IC50 in vitro. For one of the targets, RbtA, we obtain a high-affinity binder with KD < 10 nM despite starting from the target sequence alone due to the lack of an experimentally determined target structure. X-ray structures determined for macrocycle-bound MCL1, GABARAP, and RbtA complexes match very closely with the computational design models, with three out of the four structures demonstrating Ca RMSD of less than 1.5 [A] to the design models. In contrast to library screening approaches for which determining binding mode can be a major bottleneck, the binding modes of RFpeptides-generated macrocycles are known by design, which should greatly facilitate downstream optimization. RFpeptides thus provides a powerful framework for rapid and custom design of macrocyclic peptides for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

This longevity discrepancy also extends to health and aging-larger dogs show higher rates of age-related diseases. Despite this well-established phenomenon, we still know little about the biomarkers and molecular mechanisms that might underlie breed differences in aging and survival. To address this gap, we generated an epigenetic clock using DNA methylation from over 3 million CpG sites in a deeply phenotyped cohort of 864 companion dogs from the Dog Aging Project, including some dogs sampled annually for 2-3 years. We found that the largest breed size tends to have epigenomes that are, on average, 0.37 years older per chronological year compared to the smallest breed size. We also found that higher residual epigenetic age was significantly associated with increased mortality risk, with dogs experiencing a 34% higher risk of death for each year increase in residual epigenetic age. These findings not only broaden our understanding of how aging manifests within a diverse species but also highlight the significant role that demographic factors play in modulating the biological mechanisms underlying aging. Additionally, they highlight the utility of DNA methylation as both a biomarker for healthspan-extending interventions, a mortality predictor, and a mechanism for understanding inter-individual variation in aging in dogs.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

Therefore, we profiled a pediatric malignant rhabdoid tumor patient with complete remission after ICI therapy using deep single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the peripheral blood.

However, tissue tropism differed significantly: while VN1203 replication was largely restricted to the respiratory tract, Bov342 successfully replicated in the respiratory tract as well as various regions of the brain. Bov342-challenged animals exhibited clinical signs consistent with central nervous system (CNS) infection, and infectious virus was detected in brain tissue.

Here, we present an approach that leverages chemical language models to discover previously uncharacterized metabolites. We introduce DeepMet, a chemical language model that learns the latent biosynthetic logic embedded within the structures of known metabolites and exploits this understanding to anticipate the existence of as-of-yet undiscovered metabolites. Prospective chemical synthesis of metabolites predicted to exist by DeepMet directs their targeted discovery. Integrating DeepMet with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data enables automated metabolite discovery within complex tissues. We harness DeepMet to discover several dozen structurally diverse mammalian metabolites. Our work demonstrates the potential for language models to accelerate the mapping of the metabolome.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

Here, we establish a two-step approach to eliminate the abnormal copy of chromosome 8 and restore euploidy in cells derived from an individual with a complex rearrangement of chromosome 8p. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 361 differentially expressed genes between the proband and the euploid revertant, highlighting genes both within and outside the 8p region that may contribute to 8p syndrome pathology.

No obvious signatures of attractor dynamics were detected. Rather, olfactory discrimination training selectively enhanced the separation of neural manifolds representing task-relevant odors from other representations, consistent with predictions of autoassociative network models endowed with precise synaptic balance. Analytical approaches using the framework of manifold capacity revealed multiple geometrical modifications of representational manifolds that supported the classification of task-relevant sensory information. Manifold capacity predicted odor discrimination across individuals, indicating a close link between manifold geometry and behavior. Hence, pDp and possibly related recurrent networks store information in the geometry of representational manifolds, resulting in joint sensory and semantic maps that may support distributed learning processes.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

Multiple cave-dwelling populations of the Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, have converged on sleep loss compared to river dwelling surface fish. However, the extent to which sleep has been lost across cave populations, and whether sleep loss occurs in wild fish, is poorly understood. We have measured sleep and locomotor activity in 15 distinct populations of A. mexicanus representing multiple lineages that are broadly representative of the 34 cavefish populations identified to date. Strikingly, sleep was largely lost in all cave and hybrid populations that were tested. Hybrid populations retained intermediate eye and pigmentation phenotypes, suggesting sleep loss precedes cave-associated morphological changes. Mapping behavioral changes onto the phylogeny of A. mexicanus populations revealed that independent loss of sleep and elevated locomotor activity has occurred at least three times. Analysis of sleep in the wild confirms that the sleep loss phenotype observed in lab-reared fish is also present in the natural environment. Together, these findings reveal deep evolutionary convergence on sleep loss in cavefish and provide evidence for sleep loss as a primary trait contributing to cave adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

The presence of spectrally broad ('white') light is therefore the exclusive remit of the visual foreground. However, if and how aquatic visual systems exploit this 'white effect' as an inductive bias, for example to judge distance, remains unknown. By combining two-photon imaging with hyperspectral stimulation, genetic cone-type ablation, and behaviour, we here show that zebrafish suppress neural responses to the visual background by contrasting 'greyscale' and 'colour' circuits that emerge at the first synapse of vision. To do so, zebrafish use an early retinal architecture that fundamentally differs from that of mammals: Rather than combining cone signals to drive the retinal output leading to behaviour, zebrafish vision is built around competing ancestral cone systems: Red/UV versus green/blue. Of these, the non-opponent red and UV cones, which are retained in mammals, are necessary and sufficient for vision. By contrast, the colour opponent green and blue cones, which are lost in mammals, form a net-suppressive 'auxiliary' system that shape the 'core' drive from red and UV cones. Our insights challenge the long-held notions that cones act in concert to drive visual behaviour, and that their spectral diversity primarily serves colour vision. Instead, we posit that vertebrate vision is ancestrally built upon opposing cone systems that emerged to exploit the strong spectral interactions of light with water. This alternative view points at terrestrialisation, not nocturnalisation, as the leading driver for visual circuit reorganisation in mammals.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

Summarizing this distribution using two numbers yields an informative 2D embedding, the arity map, which summarizes structural elements in all predictions. Second, we establish a clear correlation between the number of homologs of a protein sequence in UniProtKB, and the quality of its prediction, possibly hinting at the learning biases incurred by AlphaFold. Third, we show that certain regions of the arity map are connected with poor quality structures: proteins rich in false positive intrinsically disordered regions. The arity map thus also provides a way for detecting prediction errors that the pLDDT cannot detect.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

Our integration study unexpectedly reveals two distinct apCAF lineages present in most cancer types: one associated with mesothelial-like cells and the other with fibrocytes. Using a high-resolution single-cell spatial imaging platform, we characterize the spatial niches of these apCAF lineages. We find that mesothelial-like apCAFs are located near cancer cells, while fibrocyte-like apCAFs are associated with tertiary lymphoid structures. Additionally, we discover that both apCAF lineages can up-regulate the secreted protein SPP1, which facilitates primary tumor formation and peritoneal metastasis. Taken together, this study offers an unprecedented resolution in analyzing apCAF lineages and their spatial niches.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

While improvements have been made, high-coverage long-read sequencing is associated with higher costs and input DNA requirements. To decrease the cost one can lower the sequence coverage, but the current long-read SV callers perform poorly with coverage below 10x. Synthetic long-read (SLR) technologies hold great potential for structural variant (SV) detection, although utilizing their long-range information for events smaller than 50 kbp has been challenging.

ResultsIn this work, we propose a hybrid novel integrated alignment- and local-assembly-based algorithm, Blackbird, that uses SLR together with low-coverage long reads to improve SV detection and assembly. Without the need for a computationally expensive whole genome assembly, Blackbird uses a sliding window approach and barcode information encoded in SLR to accurately assemble small segments and use long reads for an improved gap closing and contig assembly. We evaluated Blackbird on simulated and real human genome datasets. Using the HG002 GIAB benchmark set, we demonstrated that in hybrid mode, Blackbird demonstrated results comparable to state-of-the-art long-read tools, while using less long-read coverage. Blackbird requires only 5x coverage to achieve F1 scores (0.835 and 0.808 for deletions and insertions) similar to PBSV (0.856 and 0.812) and Sniffles2 (0.839 and 0.804) using 10x Pacbio Hi-Fi long-read coverage.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

The viruss ability to infect the mammary gland suggests potential risks of transmission to offspring through breastfeeding.

However, null space theory makes the counter-intuitive prediction that neurons often generate spikes not to cause behavior, but to prevent the effects that other neurons would have on behavior. What is missing is a direct way to test this theory in the brain. Here, we found that in the marmoset cerebellum, spike-triggered averaging identified a potent vector unique to each Purkinje cell (P-cell) along which the spikes of that cell displaced the eyes. Yet, the P-cells were active not just for saccades along their potent vector, but for all saccades. Simultaneous recordings revealed that two spikes in two different P-cells produced superposition of their potent vectors. The result was a population activity in which the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. But why was one neuron producing spikes that would be canceled by another neuron? To answer this question, we recorded from the mossy fiber inputs and the interneurons in the molecular layer. We found that the mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands as well as the sensory goal of the movement, then the interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P-cells as a population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped. Because this output had faster dynamics than was present in the individual neurons, the cerebellum placed the cells in subtractive competition with each other such that the downstream effects of spiking in one neuron were partially or completely eliminated because of the spiking in another neuron.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

The Virtual Lab consists of an LLM principal investigator agent guiding a team of LLM agents with different scientific backgrounds (e.g., a chemist agent, a computer scientist agent, a critic agent), with a human researcher providing high-level feedback. We design the Virtual Lab to conduct scientific research through a series of team meetings, where all the agents discuss a scientific agenda, and individual meetings, where an agent accomplishes a specific task. We demonstrate the power of the Virtual Lab by applying it to design nanobody binders to recent variants of SARS-CoV-2, which is a challenging, open-ended research problem that requires reasoning across diverse fields from biology to computer science. The Virtual Lab creates a novel computational nanobody design pipeline that incorporates ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta and designs 92 new nanobodies. Experimental validation of those designs reveals a range of functional nanobodies with promising binding profiles across SARS-CoV-2 variants. In particular, two new nanobodies exhibit improved binding to the recent JN.1 or KP.3 variants of SARS-CoV-2 while maintaining strong binding to the ancestral viral spike protein, suggesting exciting candidates for further investigation. This demonstrates the ability of the Virtual Lab to rapidly make impactful, real-world scientific discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

To address this, we present a comprehensive assessment of tissue changes occurring during human aging, utilizing a vast array of whole slide histopathological images from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx). We analyzed 25,712 images from 40 distinct tissue types across 983 individuals, applying deep learning to quantify the nuanced morphological changes that tissues undergo with age.

We developed  tissue clocks--predictors of biological age based on tissue images--which achieved a mean prediction error of 4.9 years and were associated with telomere attrition, the incidence of subclinical pathologies, and comorbidities. In a systematic assessment of biological age rates across organs, we identified pervasive non-uniform rates of aging across the human lifespan, with some organs exhibiting earlier changes (20-40 years old) and others showing bimodal patterns of age-related changes. We also uncovered several associations between demographic, lifestyle, and medical history factors and tissue-specific acceleration or deceleration of biological age, highlighting potential modifiable risk factors that influenced the aging process at the tissue level. Finally, by combining paired histological images and gene expression data, we developed a strategy to predict tissue-specific age gaps from blood samples. This approach was validated in external cohorts of both healthy individuals and those with chronic diseases, revealing the organs most differentially affected by aging in disease contexts.

This work offers a new perspective on the aging process by positioning tissue structure as an integrator of cellular and molecular changes that reflect the physiological state of organs. These findings underscore the value of histopathological imaging as a tool for understanding human aging and provide a foundation for the exploration of tissue-specific aging processes in age-associated diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

Despite ongoing surveillance and control measures recommended by animal and public health authorities to limit viral spread, new herds continue to report infections. We show here that the continued spread between farms could be explained by the rapid pace of pathogen spread reported within farms, which greatly limits the potential effectiveness of these recommendations. Under reasonable surveillance strategies, we show that the time farms have to mobilize interventions is extremely limited, as few as a couple days and typically less than a week. Our findings suggest that passive surveillance measures, such as detection of H5N1 via weekly bulk milk testing, comes too late such that most infections have already occurred. For current interventions to be valuable, more sensitive and extensive surveillance is needed and an emphasis should be placed on biosecurity practices rather than reactive practices.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

While human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived organoids are valuable models for studying human organ function, they often lack critical tissue-resident immune cells. Here, we introduce an advanced human heart assembloid model, termed hHMA (human heart-macrophage assembloid), which fully integrates autologous cardiac tissue-resident macrophages (MPs) with pre-existing human heart organoids (hHOs). Through multi-omic analyses, we confirmed that these MPs are phenotypically similar to embryonic cardiac tissue-resident MPs and remain viable in the assembloids over time. The inclusion of MPs significantly impacts hHMA development, influencing cardiac cellular composition, boosting cellular communication, remodeling the extracellular matrix, promoting ventricular morphogenesis, and enhancing sarcomeric maturation. Our findings indicate that MPs contribute to homeostasis via efferocytosis, integrate into the cardiomyocyte electrical system, and support catabolic metabolism. To demonstrate the versatility of this model, we developed a platform to study cardiac arrhythmias by chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory factors linked to arrhythmogenesis in clinical settings, successfully replicating key features of inflammasome-mediated atrial fibrillation. Overall, this work introduces a robust platform for examining the role of immune cells in cardiac development, disease mechanisms, and drug discovery, bridging the gap between in vitro models and human physiology. These findings offer insights into cardiogenesis and inflammation-driven heart disease, positioning the hHMA system as an invaluable tool for future cardiovascular research and therapeutic development.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

In particular, plague has been linked to population declines in Late Neolithic Europe3,4. Although plague is amongst the most devastating diseases in human history, early strains of Yersinia pestis, the causal agent of plague, lack virulence factors required for the bubonic form5, and their severity remains unclear. Here, we describe the oldest strains of plague reported so far, associated with two early phases of outbreaks among prehistoric hunter-gatherers in the Lake Baikal region in East Siberia, beginning from [~]5600-5400 years ago (cal. BP). These outbreaks occur across four hunter-gatherer cemeteries; the largest of these (Ust-Ida I) has a 38.7% detection rate for plague infection (39% detection across all sites). By reconstructing kinship pedigrees, we show that small familial groups are affected, consistent with human-to-human spread of the disease, and the first outbreak occurred within a single generation. Intriguingly, the infections appear to have resulted in acute mortality events, especially among children. Zoonotic transmission is separately indicated by a Brucella infection in one of the children. Interestingly, we see differences in functional genomic variants in the prehistoric plague strains, including in the ypm superantigen known from Y. pseudotuberculosis today. The new strains diverge ancestrally to all known Y. pestis diversity and push back the Y. pestis divergence from Y. pseudotuberculosis by some 2000 years6. Our results show that plague outbreaks happen earlier than previously thought and that these early outbreaks were indeed lethal. The findings challenge the common notion that high population densities and lifestyle changes during the Neolithic transition were prerequisites for plague epidemics.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

In the context of natural selection analyses, specifically codon evolutionary models, excessive rates of false positives result. A characteristic signature of error-driven findings is unrealistically high estimates of dN/dS (e.g., >100), affecting only a small fraction (e.g., [~]0.1%) of the alignment. Despite the widespread use of codon models to assess alignment quality, their potential for error correction remains unexplored. We present BUSTED-E: a novel method designed to detect positive selection while concurrently identifying alignment errors. This method is a straightforward adaptation of the BUSTED flexible branch-site random effects model used to fit distributions of dN/dS, with an important modification: it integrates an ""error-sink"" component representing an abiological evolutionary regime (dN/dS > 100), and provides the option for masking errors in the MSA for downstream analyses. Statistical performance of BUSTED-E on data simulated without errors shows that there is a small loss of power, which can be mitigated by model averaged inference. Using four published empirical datasets, we show BUSTED-E reduces unrealistic rates of positive selection detection, often by an order of magnitude, and improves biological interpretability of results. BUSTED-E also detects errors that are largely distinct from other popular alignment cleaning tools (HMMCleaner and BMGE). Overall, BUSTED-E is a robust and scalable solution for improving the accuracy of evolutionary analyses in the presence of residual alignment errors, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of natural selection and adaptive evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

Here, we applied an object detection algorithm to classify animal social behaviors. Our system, packaged as ""YORU"" (Your Optimal Recognition Utility), classifies animal behaviors, including social behaviors, based on the shape of the animal as a ""behavior object"". It successfully classified several types of social behaviors ranging from vertebrates to insects.

YORU enables real-time delivery of photostimulation feedback to specific individuals during specific behaviors, even when multiple individuals are close together. We hope that the YORU system will accelerate the understanding of the neural basis of social behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

Oligodendrocyte maturation impacts the cell death mechanisms that occur in degenerative conditions, but it is unclear if and how the cell death machinery changes as OPCs transition into oligodendrocytes. Here, we discovered that differentiating oligodendrocytes transiently upregulate the zymogen procaspase-3, equipping these cells to make a survival decision during differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of caspase-3 decreases oligodendrocyte density, indicating that procaspase-3 upregulation promotes differentiation. Moreover, using procaspase-3 as a marker, we show that oligodendrocyte differentiation continues in the aging cortex and white matter.

Acute inhibition of ATR with ATR inhibitor (ATRi) triggers a surge in origin firing, leading to increased levels of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that rapidly deplete all available RPA. This leaves ssDNA unprotected and susceptible to breakage, a phenomenon known as replication catastrophe. However, the mechanism by which unprotected ssDNA breaks remains unclear. Here, we reveal that APOBEC3B is the key enzyme targeting unprotected ssDNA at replication forks, triggering a reaction cascade that induces fork collapse and PARP1 hyperactivation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that uracils generated by APOBEC3B at replication forks are removed by UNG2, creating abasic sites that are subsequently cleaved by APE1 endonuclease. Moreover, we demonstrate that APE1-mediated DNA cleavage is the critical enzymatic step for PARP1 trapping and hyperactivation in cells, regardless of how abasic sites are generated on DNA. Finally, we show that APOBEC3B-induced toxic PARP1 trapping in response to ATRi drives cell sensitivity to ATR inhibition, creating to a context of synthetic lethality when combined with PARP inhibitors. Together, these findings reveal the mechanisms that cause replication forks to break during replication catastrophe and explain why ATRi-treated cells are particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitors.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates the expression of hundreds of genes relevant to many physiological and pathological processes. As with all members of the steroid receptor family, GR forms condensates of unknown function. Here, we examine whether GR condensates are involved in transcription regulation using Airyscan super-resolution microscopy and nano-antibodies targeting initiation and elongating states of RNA polymerase II (Pol2). We observed subpopulations of GR condensates colocalizing with initiating and, surprisingly, elongating Pol2 foci. The analysis of GR mutants with different transcriptional outputs suggests a correlation between condensate formation capability and transcription initiation. Moreover, the number of GR molecules within initiation and elongation condensates appears to be linked to transcriptional activity. Taken together, our data suggests an involvement of GR condensates in transcription initiation and elongation.

Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

Generally, experienced bullying showed increased subcortical volumes in the putamen ({beta}=0.12), caudate ({beta}=0.06), accumbens ({beta}=0.06), amygdala ({beta}=0.07), hippocampus ({beta}=0.06), paired with decreased cerebellar ({beta}=-0.10), entorhinal, ({beta}=-0.12), and insula ({beta}=-0.11) volumes. Females exhibited more volumetric changes in emotional processing areas whereas males had more changes in motor and sensory regions. These findings point to widespread associations between bullying victimization and brain development, offering a potential neurobiological framework to explain the emotional and behavioral difficulties observed. Importantly, this study emphasizes the need for a sex-sensitive approach in future research and interventions related to bullying.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807

Known CRBN neosubstrates share a generalizable {beta}-hairpin G-loop recognition motif, yet systematic exploration of the CRBN target landscape is still pending. Through computational mining of the human proteome using structure-based approaches, we predict over 1,400 CRBN-compatible {beta}-hairpin G-loop proteins across diverse target classes, identify novel mechanisms of neosubstrate recognition through structurally differentiated helical motifs and molecular surface mimicry, and validate 22 representative neosubstrates with clinical implications. This work broadens the CRBN target space, redefines rules for neosubstrate recognition and establishes a platform for the elimination of challenging drug targets by repurposing CRL4CRBN through next-generation molecular glue degraders.","NA","biorxiv",1732313410807
