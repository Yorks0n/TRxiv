The pathogenesis of LC is incompletely understood. In this study, we performed comprehensive cellular and transcriptional immunometabolic profiling within a cohort that included SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (NC, N=30) and individuals with prior COVID-19 ([~]4-months) who fully recovered (RC, N=38) or went on to experience Long COVID symptoms (N=58). Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing. Our findings support a profound and persistent immunometabolic dysfunction that follows SARS-CoV-2 which may form the pathophysiologic substrate for LC. Our findings suggest that trials of therapeutics that help restore immune and metabolic homeostasis may be warranted to prevent, reduce, or resolve LC symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348182

Recombinant proteins, consisting of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and Spike Receptor Binding Domains (RBD) fused with nanoluciferase reporters (GloBodies) were designed and produced. The SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody within serum, from venous blood or eluted from local or remotely-obtained dried blood spots, form a complex with the GloBody, which can be captured on immobilized Protein G or anti-isotype antibody with the retained nanoluciferase activity being proportional to specific antibody levels. Natural infection, vaccination and human and animal SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were detectable. These were used to serially monitor infection and vaccination responses in dental healthcare workers (n=82), medical healthcare workers (n=72) and laboratory-based scientists (n=62) within the Royal London, dental and medical hospitals and associated university research institute in Whitechapel, East London. This indicated temporally distinct infection and vaccination profiles, consistent with hospital deployments and local and national lockdowns by dentists and scientists. As such, medical healthcare workers had twice the odds of experiencing COVID-19 symptoms (2.01 95%CI 1.13-3.58. P<0.001) compared to dentists, who were more at risk than scientists.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348182

Large-scale real-world data (RWD), such as electronic health records (EHR), encodes practice-based evidence that is of tremendous value to CTD. In recent years, many machine learning methods have been developed to extract such real-world evidence (RWE) from the RWD to inform CTD, but they still need to be communicated with the domain experts extensively in an iterative manner to be further refined and ultimately useful. In this paper, we introduce TrialGenie, an agentic framework that derives RWE for helping with CTD. Through the iterative conversation and analysis across agents with different roles, TrialGenie can autonomously refine trial protocols and finally generate a robust report containing insights that inform better CTD. We applied TrialGenie on the CTD process of several acute diseases including septic shock, acute heart failure, acute pulmonary edema, and acute kidney injury using the MIMIC-IV data. The results demonstrate TrialGenie's capabilities in facilitating and accelerating the CTD process.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348182

We conducted a multi-country evaluation of two novel swab-based molecular tests: Molbio Truenat MTB Ultima (MTB Ultima) and Pluslife MiniDock MTB Test (MiniDock MTB). Methods: Consecutive people [&ge;]12 years old with presumptive TB were enrolled at outpatient health centers in India, Uganda, and Vietnam. We collected two tongue swabs and prepared two sputum swabs for MTB Ultima and MiniDock MTB testing, then evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of MTB Ultima and MiniDock MTB using both swab types against a sputum liquid culture-based microbiological reference standard (MRS). The diagnostic accuracy of swab-based molecular tests was also compared to sputum Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) and auramine smear microscopy. Findings: From January to September 2024, 1,050 participants were included in the tongue swab MTB Ultima evaluation, 197 in the sputum swab MTB Ultima evaluation, and 322 in the MiniDock MTB evaluations. In comparison to sputum Xpert Ultra, sensitivity was similar for both sputum swab MTB Ultima (93.6% vs. 100.0%, difference -6.4%, [95% CI: -15.5, 2.7], p=0.25) and MiniDock MTB (91.0% vs. 94.0%, difference -3.0% [95% CI: -8.6, 2.6], p=0.50). In comparison to sputum smear microscopy, sensitivity was higher for both tongue swab MTB Ultima (77.9% vs. 59.1%, difference 18.8% [95% CI: 10.8, 26.8], p=<0.0001) and MiniDock MTB (85.7% vs. 67.1%, difference 18.6% [95% CI: 7.2, 29.9], p=0.001). Specificity was high (>98%) for both tests with sputum swabs and tongue swabs. Interpretation: MTB Ultima and MiniDock MTB have similar accuracy to current sputum-based molecular tests with sputum swabs and meet minimum accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum, near point-of-care molecular test with tongue swabs. These tests offer strong potential to make universal molecular testing for TB a reality.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348182

Methods We used plasma samples collected from subjects diagnosed with MIS-C and compared them first to controls with asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and then to controls with pneumonia or Kawasaki disease. We used mass spectrometry to identify proteins. Support vector machine (SVM) algorithm-based classification schemes were used to analyze protein pathways. We assessed diagnostic accuracy using internal and external cross-validation. Results Proteomic analysis of a training dataset containing MIS-C (N=17), and asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infected control samples (N=20) identified 643 proteins, of which 101 were differentially expressed. Plasma proteins associated with inflammation and coagulation increased and those associated with lipid metabolism decreased in MIS-C relative to controls. The SVM machine learning algorithm identified a three-protein model (ORM1, AZGP1, SERPINA3) that achieved 90.0% specificity, 88.2% sensitivity, and 93.5% area under the curve (AUC) distinguishing MIS-C from controls in the training set. Performance was retained in the validation dataset utilizing MIS-C (N=17) and asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infected control samples (N=10) (90.0% specificity, 84.2% sensitivity, 87.4% AUC). We next replicated our approach to compare MIS-C with similarly presenting syndromes, such as pneumonia (N=17) and Kawasaki Disease (N=13) and found a distinct three-protein signature (VWF, SERPINA3, and FCGBP) that accurately distinguished MIS-C from the other conditions (97.5% specificity, 89.5% sensitivity, 95.6% AUC). We also developed a software tool that may be used to evaluate other protein pathway signatures using our data. Conclusions We used MIS-C, a novel hyperinflammatory illness, to demonstrate that the use of mass spectrometry to identify candidate plasma proteins followed by machine learning, specifically SVM, is an efficient strategy for identifying and evaluating biomarker signatures for disease classification.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

Study design: Retrospective demographic analysis. Methods: A hierarchical time-varying regression model was applied to prefectural life table data in Japan during 2000-2019. Pre-pandemic baseline mortality rates and death counts during 2020-2022 were projected by this model to evaluate the mortality impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality during 2020-2022. Results: Nationally, the observed mortality rates were higher than projected rates among those aged 10-29 years and lower for ages 1-9 and >80 years in 2020. During 2021 and 2022, mortality rates consistently increased for most age groups, with substantial regional heterogeneity in those aged <14 years. Consistently, the neutral gaps between the observed and projected life expectancy across prefectures in 2020 turned negative in most prefectures during 2022. In 2020, the negative gap in life expectancy ranged from a substantial shortening of -1.41 years (95% prediction interval [PI]: -1.69, -1.12) in Okinawa to a slight shortening of -0.23 years (95% PI: -0.63, 0.17) in Tottori. Excess deaths per population also grew consistently in all prefectures during 2020-2022; Miyazaki yielded the largest estimate at 186.2 (95% PI: 158.6, 214.0) per 100,000 population. Conclusions: Our framework highlights the usefulness of life table data for evaluating the mortality impact caused by an event such as the pandemic. Our estimates, adjusted by pre-pandemic demographic trends, revealed the massive mortality impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across a wide age range.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

However, the lack of scalable and efficient methods to integrate large-scale multi-omics data limits deeper insights into xQTL regulation. Here, we propose ColocBoost, a multi-task learning colocalization method that can scale to hundreds of traits, while accounting for multiple causal variants within a genomic region of interest. ColocBoost employs a specialized gradient boosting framework that can adaptively couple colocalized traits while performing causal variant selection, thereby enhancing the detection of weaker shared signals compared to existing pairwise and multi-trait colocalization methods. We applied ColocBoost genome-wide to 17 gene-level single-nucleus and bulk xQTL data from the aging brain cortex of ROSMAP individuals (average N=595), encompassing 6 cell types, 3 brain regions and 3 molecular modalities (expression, splicing, and protein abundance). Across molecular xQTLs, ColocBoost identified 16,503 distinct colocalization events, exhibiting 10.7 ({+/-} 0.74)-fold enrichment for heritability across 57 complex diseases/traits and showing strong concordance with element-gene pairs validated by CRISPR screening assays. When colocalized against Alzheimer's disease (AD) GWAS, ColocBoost identified up to 2.5-fold more distinct colocalized loci, explaining twice the AD disease heritability compared to fine-mapping without xQTL integration. This improvement is largely attributable to ColocBoost's enhanced sensitivity in detecting gene-distal colocalizations, as supported by strong concordance with known enhancer-gene links, highlighting its ability to identify biologically plausible AD susceptibility loci with underlying regulatory mechanisms. Notably, several genes including BLNK and CTSH showed sub-threshold associations in GWAS, but were identified through multi-omics colocalizations which provide new functional support for their involvement in AD pathogenesis.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

Here, we sought to define the effects of partial DOT1L loss by applying bulk and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, ChIP-sequencing, imaging, multielectrode array recordings, and behavioral analysis of zebrafish and multiple mouse models.

We present a cohort of 16 individuals (12 females, 4 males) with neurodevelopmental disorders and monoallelic DOT1L variants, including a frameshift deletion, an in-frame deletion, a nonsense, and missense variants clustered in the catalytic domain. We demonstrate that specific variants cause loss of methyltransferase activity. In primary cortical neurons, Dot1l knockdown disrupts transcription of synaptic genes, neuron branching, expression of a synaptic protein, and neuronal activity. Further in the cortex of heterozygous Dot1l mice, Dot1l loss causes sex-specific transcriptional responses and H3K79me2 depletion, including within down-regulated genes. Lastly using both zebrafish and mouse models, we found behavioral disruptions that include developmental deficits and sex-specific social behavioral changes.

Overall, we define how DOT1L loss leads to neurological dysfunction by demonstrating that partial Dot1l loss impacts neuronal transcription, neuron morphology, and behavior across multiple models and systems.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

These risk variants have also been shown to influence the structure of the cerebral cortex. However, it is unknown whether cortical differences associated with genetic variants are linked to the risk they confer for NPDs. To answer this question, we analyzed cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) for common and rare variants associated with NPDs, in ~33000 individuals from the general population and clinical cohorts, as well as ENIGMA summary statistics for 8 NPDs. Rare and common genetic variants increasing risk for NPDs were preferentially associated with total SA, while NPDs were preferentially associated with mean CT. Larger effects on mean CT, but not total SA, were observed in NPD medicated subgroups. At the regional level, genetic variants were preferentially associated with effects in sensorimotor areas, while NPDs showed higher effects in association areas. We show that schizophrenia- and bipolar-disorder- associated SNPs show positive and negative effect sizes on SA, suggesting that their aggregated effects cancel out in additive polygenic models. Overall, CT and SA differences associated with NPDs do not relate to those observed across individual genetic variants and may be linked with critical non-genetic factors, such as medication and the lived experience of the disorder.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

Historical data suggest that hypokinetic features, like rigidity and bradykinesia, become more prominent in later stages of HD. No evidence-based analysis has confirmed this observation. Additionally, several motor features of the disease are not clearly defined as hypokinetic or hyperkinetic. Objectives: This study aimed to 1) elucidate the trajectory of hyperkinetic and hypokinetic features across the disease course and 2) to classify vague motor features as following a hyperkinetic or hypokinetic trajectory. Methods: Data from 13,475 motor-manifest HD patients from the Enroll-HD platform were analyzed. Linear mixed-effects models were constructed for each of the 31 Unified Huntingtons Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor subscales, with disease burden as the primary predictor. The models were used to generate the trajectories of features known to represent hyperkinesis and hypokinesis, with the same being done for vague subscales. Dynamic time warping (DTW) was then used to classify said subscales as having a hyperkinetic or hypokinetic trajectory. Results: Hyperkinetic features rise initially and diminish in middle disease, while hypokinetic features continually increase across the disease course. All non-choreiform features demonstrated a hypokinetic-like trajectory. Conclusions: HD is generally considered a hyperkinetic movement disorder, but the middle and late stages of the disease are predominated by hypokinesis. These findings suggest that hypokinetic features may be a larger contributor to the overall motor burden of HD. This has significant implications for clinical trial design, motor phenotype clustering, and pharmacotherapy.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

Here, we utilized established Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) sleep disturbance, sleep relatedness, and sexual function and satisfaction scales questionnaires of sleep behaviors and sexual satisfaction in combination with wearable actigraphy devices and performed a pilot three-way, 18-day cross-over study in adult monogamous women. Three, four-day interventions including (i) intercourse with their partner, (ii) masturbation only with a computer-controlled female vibrational device, and (iii) combined use of both the partner and the device were assessed. We tested the hypothesis that sleep efficiency and rapid-eye-movement (REM) duration were similarly increased during all forms of sexual activity compared to three-day interval washout periods of sexual abstinence. Across all participants and measures (n=4; age=34.0+/-10.4 years), findings were consistent with improvements in sexual satisfaction and interest in sexual activity after the trial as assessed by the PROMIS sexual satisfaction survey (t-statistic) at intake (44.6+/-10.5) vs. closeout (55.2+/-6.5). There was no significant difference in established metrics of sleep behaviors for epochs when masturbation was used vs. a partner was used; however, 75% of women exhibited evidence of an increase in sleep efficiency and REM sleep duration during the masturbation epoch compared with washout epochs with sexual abstinence, with a large effect size of 0.799. Findings are intended to provide feasibility data on the relevance of computer-controlled masturbation devices and assessing these devices with wearable technologies, and corroborate anecdotal evidence of the impact of these devices on objective markers of women's health.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

However, stimulation-induced artifacts critically compromise real-time phase estimation accuracy. Existing approaches either suspend phase-tracking following stimulation or employ dedicated hardware systems yet introduce estimation instability through temporal gaps and signal distortion. Objective: We develop and evaluate a flexible and stable phase-locked deep brain stimulation (PLDBS) system capable of delivering cycle-by-cycle phase-aligned stimulation based on brain oscillations, with an additional focus on its potential for modulating movement. Methods: The PLDBS system was implemented using portable CE-marked devices and a computer-in-the-loop framework. Simulations and clinical experiments were performed targeting distinct phases of neural oscillations. The simulation framework evaluated the real-time performance of different phase-tracking methodologies considering artifacts, ultimately establishing a Kalman filter-based artifact removal system integrated with non-resonant oscillators for instantaneous phase estimation, thereby defining the final cycle-by-cycle PLDBS architecture. We then evaluated the performance of the pipeline for PLDBS in human patients targeting cortical alpha and subthalamic nucleus (STN) beta rhythms. Results: Our system achieved over 90% accuracy in delivering stimulation within a 90 degrees and 45 degrees window centered around the target phase for STN beta (proximal recording) and cortical alpha rhythms (distal recording), respectively. Stimulation delivered at different STN beta phases led to a significant difference in evoked potentials in STN local field potentials in 3 out of 4 participants. However, such an effect was not found in cortical alpha in any participants. STN beta-triggered stimulation showed potential phase-dependent modulation of finger-tapping velocity and amplitude in Parkinson's disease. Conclusion: This study presents a flexible and stable pipeline for precise PLDBS with CE-marked devices and a computer-in-the-loop. Using this pipeline, we showed that PLDBS at different STN beta phases differentially modulates the evoked action potentials in the STN and motor behavior used to quantify bradykinesia, paving the way for further studies and clinical trials for PLDBS.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

Recent evidence proposes the use of Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) to counteract the typical clinical and neurophysiological degeneration. NIBS protocols require multiple sessions in clinical settings, making long interventions difficult. Therefore, this pilot study aims to evaluate the possibility of moving to a home-based approach. METHODS: We conduct a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled, cross-over study of home transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in patients with mild to AD. The intervention consist of daily model-driven personalized home-based tACS delivered for 8 weeks, 5 days per week (40 sessions). tACS is applied daily for 1 hour at 40 Hz on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and temporal cortex bilaterally. The outcomes are assessed at baseline, right after the intervention, and at 2 months follow-up for both conditions (Real and Sham). The primary outcome measures are the safety and feasibility of the intervention, as well as the changes in the AD Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) 13. To assess secondary outcomes, participants undergo extensive neuropsychological assessment. Finally, as exploratory outcomes, functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), resting and evoked electroencephalography (EEG and TMS-EEG), as well as blood biomarkers to measure changes in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory markers, are collected. The study protocol has been approved by the local institutional review board (IRB). RESULTS: We hypothesize that the tACS treatment is safe and feasible and will result in a slower progression of cognitive decline. Moreover, we wish for a restoring of gamma power as measured by TMS-EEG, as well as a structural preservation and functional network reorganization as compared to sham treatment. DISCUSSION: The final goal is to obtain preliminary data in advance of a larger clinical trial to prove the possibility of treating AD patients at home through tACS.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

Accelerated intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (aiTBS) is an innovative form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), delivering bursts of stimulation at theta wave frequencies, which are believed to enhance synaptic plasticity. This pilot study aimed to explore the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of aiTBS in individuals with treatment-resistant bipolar depression (TRBD). Methods: This open label pilot study (Overview of Medical Research in the Netherlands (OMON): NLOMON53634) included eight patients diagnosed with TRBD. Participants received eight daily sessions of intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS) over five consecutive days, with 50minute intervals between sessions. Stimulation targeted the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) using the BeamF3 targeting method. Primary outcomes were safety, tolerability, and efficacy. Safety was assessed by recording (serious) adverse events; tolerability was evaluated through side effect reports and dropout rates. Efficacy was measured as the mean reduction in depression severity, as assessed by the 17 item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS 17). Results: aiTBS was well tolerated and no SAEs occurred during the treatment week. Most observed adverse events were discomfort at the site of stimulation and fatigue [7/8, 87.5%]. No treatment emergent [hypo]mania was observed during intervention week or during the follow up. One patient experienced hypomanic symptoms [YMRS=13] at the 3 month follow up visit. The mean HDRS decreased from 22.9 [SD=4.4] at baseline to 16.6 [SD=4.2] at day 3 of treatment [difference= 6.3 (95% CI, 1.6 to 10.9); 27.3% improvement, p=0.01*], decreased significantly to 12.3 [SD=4.1] at day 5 [difference= 10.1 (95% CI, 2.2 to 18.1); 44.3% improvement, p=0.02*], decreased significantly to 11.1 [SD=3.8] at week 2 of FU [difference= 11.8 (95% CI, 4.5 to 19.0); 51.4% improvement, p=0.004**] and decreased significantly to 13.5 [SD=3.9] at week 4 of FU [difference= 9.4 (95% CI, 1.0 to 17.7); 41.0% improvement, p=0.03*].

However, it remains unclear how various aspects of early life relate to dementia risk, and how they may interact with genetic predisposition. Methods: This study leverages data on nationally representative older adults in the United States from the Health and Retirement Study (2006 to 2020; N=8,676; ages [&ge;] 60 at baseline, 55% female). We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the associations of early life risk factors (financial, social, human capital deficits, adverse experiences, and childhood health conditions) and their interactions with APOE E4 genotype on dementia incidence. Results: Low early life financial, social, and human capital, as well as childhood health conditions were associated with higher dementia risk. After adjusting for comprehensive adulthood risk factors, low social capital and human capital persisted as significant predictors, associated with 16% (95% CI=1,34%) and 21% (95% CI=6,38%) increased risks, respectively. APOE E4 strongly predicted dementia across all models (83,86% increased risk). Notably, significant interactions emerged between APOE E4 and early-life financial capital and adversity. These early life risk factors significantly increased dementia risk only among APOE4 non-carriers. Carrying E4, however, consistently elevated risk regardless of childhood socioeconomic status or adversity exposure. Conclusions: Our findings suggest potential direct, enduring cognitive health impacts of inadequate childhood social and human resources, and show that genetic predisposition via APOE4 may overwhelm the influence of early life socioeconomic adversity, providing evidence consistent with a differential susceptibility hypothesis.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

Findings were compared with metabolomics data from blood plasma. Biostatistical analyses identified discernible metabolic patterns in both biofluids, enabling differentiation of PD patients from healthy controls (OOB error < 1%). Metabolomic breath profiling of PD patients yielded 10 significant hits putatively identified as tetracosanoic acid, tricosanoic acid, HMVA, docosanamide, eicosanoic acid, nonadecanoic acid, homophytanic acid, nonadecyl-MG, stearic acid and palmitic acid in PD patients, irrespective of the genetic status. Most of the proposed structures are intermediates in fatty acid metabolism, introducing new candidate biomarkers for breath analysis in PD. Seven of these metabolites were also found in unaffected carriers of pathogenic variants in LRRK2 when compared to controls. Breath analysis effectively distinguishes between PD patients and healthy controls and nominates metabolites that could serve as noninvasive biomarkers for PD, potentially including its presymptomatic stage.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

In recent decades, the prevalence of MS has increased, leading to a significant global health burden. Methods The study presented a comprehensive analysis of the incidence, prevalence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in MS using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021. Subsequently, Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to investigate potential risk factors associated with MS. Finally, the Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model was used to predict the future trend of MS. Results From 1990 to 2021, the cases of MS increased from 1,004,659 to 1,887,767, while the age-standardized rate (ASR) remained relatively stable. Areas with higher Socio-demographic Index (SDI), such as Western Europe and High-income North America, exhibited a greater disease burden, whereas areas with lower SDI exhibited a higher ASR growth. The highest incidence rate was observed in individuals aged 30 to 34 years. The number of cases in females was approximately twice that in males. In addition to smoking, other risk factors, including body mass index, waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and overweight, were identified by MR. It is anticipated that the ASIR of MS will continue to remain at a relatively high level until 2050. Conclusions The burden of MS was increasing globally, with variations observed across different geographies, sexes, and age groups, presenting a significant challenge to public health. This study provided a comprehensive investigation into the burden of MS, which would assist in the allocation of resources and the development of targeted prevention and control strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

The objective of this study was to examine the association between mean ventilation rates during in-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Methods: This was a secondary analysis of a cohort undergoing CPR for in-hospital cardiac arrest with an advanced airway in place had that ventilation rate and end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) continuously recorded. Subjects were enrolled at 25 tertiary care centers in the United States and United Kingdom. A subset of subjects also had intra-cardiac arrest arterial blood gases collected as part of routine clinical care. Results: Ventilation rate and ETCO2 measurements were collected for 222 subjects and arterial blood gas data for 127 subjects. We observed 84.7% of subjects were ventilated > 10 breaths/min. When dichotomized to subjects receiving close to current guidelines (6-12 breaths/min) and those with higher ventilation rates >12 breaths/min, subjects with higher ventilation rates had greater rate of ROSC (45% vs. 24% p = 0.009). Ventilation rate had a significant impact on ROSC even after adjusting for age, sex, shockable initial rhythm, pre-cardiac arrest severity of critical illness, and mechanical chest compression device usage, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.15 per two breaths/min increase (95% CI 1.04-1.28; p = 0.006). Regression analysis suggested increasing ventilation rates may start to have a negative association with ROSC when beyond 26 breaths/min. Patients ventilated > 12 breaths/min demonstrated increased mean ETCO2 levels (median 25 mm Hg vs. 17 mm Hg for those with mean ventilation rates within 6-12 breaths/min; p < 0.001). PaO2 and PaCO2 levels did not differ between ventilation groups, suggesting that the observed effects may relate to hemodynamic rather than ventilatory effects. Conclusions: Ventilation in excess of guideline-recommended rates is common. Higher ventilation rates above 6-12 breaths and below 26 breaths/min were associated with increased odds of ROSC. This may be due to improved hemodynamics. Guidelines on ventilation during CPR may require further examination.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

In the last decade, health studies have used them to assess environmental exposures, but few have included aging men, particularly those actively working with pesticides. Objective: To explore the feasibility, acceptability, and/or receptiveness of older adults to wear a wristband for multiple days while collecting other biomarkers (serum and urine). Additionally, we aimed to assess exposure differences among actively farming pesticide applicators versus non-farming older adults and examine correlations between pesticides and organophosphate ester flame retardants (OPEFR) detected in the wristbands with target serum/urine metabolites. Methods: Fifteen males age 70-plus in North Carolina; 10 farmers, pesticide applicators and 5 non-farmers with no reported pesticide use. Participants wore wristbands for 5 consecutive days 24/hours a day, provided a serum sample on day one and end-of-day urine samples on days 1, 3, and 5. Six pesticides and four OPEFR were measured in wristbands. Results: All participants were receptive to wristbands and wore them for the required time, were compliant in study procedures, and did not report any adverse reactions to the wristbands. In wristbands, atrazine (Geometric means (GM) of specific gravity-corrected levels=14.5 ng/g) and malathion (GM=21.8 ng/g) were detected only in farmers. wristbands GMs were higher in farmers than non-farmers for chlorpyrifos GM difference=408.8 ng/g, and trans-permethrin GM difference=569.2 ng/g.

The extent to which policies impacted person-to-person contact remains unclear. In this study, we examined changes in contact patterns and their association with behaviors and governmental recommendations in Japan during the pandemic. Ten social contact surveys were conducted between 2021 and 2023 reaching over 1500 participants per survey in Osaka and Fukuoka prefectures where governmental recommendations were first implemented due to high COVID-19 incidence. Their contact patterns were assessed through their demographic characteristics, COVID-19 vaccination status, and individual disease mitigation measures. Generalized linear models were used to identify factors associated with increased contacts. The mean number of contacts during the pandemic declined by at least 49.8% (8.2 weekday contacts and 6.0 weekend contacts per individual, adjusted by age and sex) compared to a study conducted prior to 2020. Weekdays, occupation, larger household sizes, and mask wearing were associated with a higher number of contacts. The frequency and duration of contacts were negatively associated with the issuance of COVID-19 governmental measures, yet the relative change in contacts was not as prominent as pre- and post-lockdown situations in the United Kingdom. There was a gradual increase in contacts with time and less strict public health recommendations. Yet, contacts that did not increase with uptake of COVID-19 vaccination and continuous mask wearing depict cautious behavior across the survey population during the pandemic and into 2023. These results are in contrast with European countries where contacts largely increased among vaccinated individuals compared to the non-vaccinated. Social contacts are country and context specific, highlighting the need for data collection across different communities.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of hair loss. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone.

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

The disease mechanism of ME/CFS is unknown, with no effective curative treatments. In this study, we present a multi-site ME/CFS whole-genome analysis, which is powered by a novel deep learning framework, HEAL2. We show that HEAL2 not only has predictive value for ME/CFS based on personal rare variants, but also links genetic risk to various ME/CFS-associated symptoms. Model interpretation of HEAL2 identifies 115 ME/CFS-risk genes that exhibit significant intolerance to loss-of-function (LoF) mutations. Transcriptome and network analyses highlight the functional importance of these genes across a wide range of tissues and cell types, including the central nervous system (CNS) and immune cells. Patient-derived multi-omics data implicate reduced expression of ME/CFS risk genes within ME/CFS patients, including in the plasma proteome, and the transcriptomes of B and T cells, especially cytotoxic CD4 T cells, supporting their disease relevance. Pan-phenotype analysis of ME/CFS genes further reveals the genetic correlation between ME/CFS and other complex diseases and traits, including depression and long COVID-19. Overall, HEAL2 provides a candidate genetic-based diagnostic tool for ME/CFS, and our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the genetic, molecular, and cellular basis of ME/CFS, yielding novel insights into therapeutic targets. Our deep learning model also offers a potent, broadly applicable framework for parallel rare variant analysis and genetic prediction for other complex diseases and traits.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1745273348183
