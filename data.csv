However, the seasonality of COVID-19 remains in dispute, with significant waves of cases across the United States occurring in both winter and summer. Using wavelet analysis of COVID-19 cases, we find that the periodicity of epidemic COVID-19 varies markedly across the U.S. and correlates with winter temperatures, indicating seasonal forcing. However, seasonal forcing alone cannot explain the pattern of multiple waves per year that has been so disruptive and unique to COVID-19. Using a modified SIRS model that allows specification of the tempo of waning immunity, we show that specific forms of non-durable immunity can sufficiently explain the sub-annual waves characteristic of the COVID-19 epidemic.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969789

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

During the tumult of war they are, however, challenging to obtain due to the conflicts themselves. The Gaza Ministry of Health (GMoH) has provided regular updates to their post-October-7 violent death tally for the Gaza Strip. However, GMoH reports have attracted both criticism and support. Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. Our findings suggest that violent mortality has significantly exceeded official figures. Our central estimate for the extent of GMoH undercount closely matches a separate estimate made using capture-recapture methods. We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden. These results underscore the feasibility of mortality surveillance methodologies in some highly challenging war-affected settings and provide a crucial empirical foundation for assessing the true human cost of the war.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969789

ObjectivesTo evaluate IgG/IgA/IgM responses targeting the enteric nerve and non-myelin antigens in RRMS and investigate associations with EBV and HHV-6 markers and explore molecular mimicry between viral and host antigens.

MethodsThe study included 55 RRMS patients and 63 matched healthy controls. ELISA is used to examine IgG/IgA/IgM levels against nine non-myelin self-epitopes and viral proteins (EBNA-1, dUTPases of EBV and HHV-6). Luminex immunoassay is used to quantify cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Disability was evaluated using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS). In-silico molecular mimicry was analyzed using UniProt, AlphaFold, PyMol, Alignmentaj, and the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), comparing 41 viral and 36 ENS non-myelin antigens.

ResultsIgG/IgA/IgM levels targeting the enteric nerve and non-myelin antigens were significantly higher in RRMS than in controls. A large part of the variance in the EDSS and MSSS scores (>60%) was explained by IgG-chondroitin sulfate, IgM-Asialo-ganglioside, and IgG-enteric nerve. There were highly significant correlations between autoimmunity to those self-antigens and either immune profiles indicating immune activation or Ig-responses to EBNA-1, and EBV/HHV-6 DUTPases. Molecular mimicry analysis confirmed the association between EBV/HHV-6 and the self-antigens by identifying shared pentapeptides, which might cause T-cell immunogenicity.

ConclusionRRMS is characterized by autoimmune responses targeting the enteric nerve and non-myelin proteins. EBV and HHV-6 reactivation contribute via molecular mimicry mechanisms.

Here, we systematically analyze common and rare variants associated with each of 373 phenotypic traits within a large biological knowledge network of gene and protein interactions. While common and rare variants implicate few shared genes, they converge on shared molecular networks for more than 75% of traits. We demonstrate that the strength of this convergence is influenced by core factors such as trait heritability, gene mutational constraints, and tissue specificity. Using neuropsychiatric traits as examples, we show that common and rare variants impact shared functions across multiple levels of biological organization. These findings underscore the importance of integrating variants across the frequency spectrum and establish a foundation for network-based investigations of the genetics of diverse human diseases and phenotypes.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969789

Its importance is reflected by the severe, congenital LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (LAMA2 MD) caused by loss-of-function mutations in the LAMA2 gene. While laminin-2 has an established role in structurally supporting muscle fibers, it remains unclear whether it exerts additional functions that contribute to the maintenance of skeletal muscle integrity. Here, we report that in healthy muscle, activated muscle stem cells (MuSCs) express Lama2 and remodel their microenvironment with laminin-2. By characterizing LAMA2 MD-afflicted MuSCs and inducing MuSC-specific Lama2 knockouts, we show that MuSC-derived laminin-2 is essential for rapid MuSC expansion and regeneration. In humans, we identify LAMA2 expression in MuSCs and demonstrate that loss-of-function mutations impair the cell-cycle progression of myogenic precursors. In summary, we show that self-secreted laminin-2 supports MuSC proliferation post-injury, thus implicating MuSC dysfunction in LAMA2 MD pathology.","NA","biorxiv",1751234969789

While previous studies have linked de novo or dominantly inherited TUBA4A missense variants to neurodegenerative phenotypes, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, hereditary spastic ataxia, and more recently, an isolated report of congenital myopathy, the full phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of TUBA4A-related disorders remains incompletely characterised. In this multi-centre study, we identified 13 novel TUBA4A missense variants in 31 individuals from 19 unrelated families. Remarkably, affected individuals in 17 families presented with a primary axial myopathy without any identified CNS involvement or history of such disease. In the remaining two families, we observed probands with cerebellar ataxia and epilepsy accompanying proximal and axial muscle weakness, establishing the first documented association between TUBA4A variants and multisystem proteinopathy. Our cohort exhibited diverse genotypes and associated inheritance patterns: four families demonstrated autosomal dominant transmission through heterozygous variants in TUBA4A, three probands had homozygous TUBA4A variants, where the biallelic genotype was found to be associated with the disease, and the heterozygous carriers were asymptomatic; five probands carried de novo variants, and nine probands with heterozygous TUBA4A variants were classified as ""isolated-sporadic cases"" where parental samples were unavailable. Clinical phenotypes ranged from mild to severe myopathy, predominantly affecting the axial and paraspinal muscles. We observed a range of disease onset, from congenital to late adulthood. Creatine kinase levels were also variable, ranging from normal to highly elevated. Cardiac function remained preserved across the cohort. Muscle biopsies revealed a range of pathologies, including myofibre size variation, myofibre atrophy, nemaline bodies, core-like regions, internal nuclei, and endomysial fibrosis. Immunohistochemical staining showed evidence of proteinopathy, with autophagic features and TUBA4A accumulation in patient myofibres. Complementary in silico and in vitro investigations suggested that the identified TUBA4A substitutions cause significant protein abnormalities and may differentially impact microtubule dynamics. Our findings establish myo-tubulinopathies as distinct clinical entities, encompassing both primary myopathies and multisystem proteinopathies with muscle involvement. This study broadens the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of TUBA4A-related disorders beyond autosomal dominant or de novo mechanisms and neurodegenerative presentations. These results underscore the importance of considering TUBA4A variants in the differential diagnosis of axial myopathies and multisystem proteinopathies, regardless of central nervous system (CNS) involvement.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969789

Yet, despite growing clinical use, little is known about how sex assigned at birth shapes symptom-specific responses to these interventions, a critical gap in the move toward personalized psychiatry. Methods We conducted a pooled analysis of five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in which adults with TRD received intranasal esketamine or placebo twice weekly for four weeks, alongside a newly initiated oral antidepressant. We evaluated the effects of sex assigned at birth on overall depression severity, measured via total Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores, and across four symptom factors: sadness, negative thoughts, detachment, and neurovegetative symptoms. Rates of clinical response and remission were also analyzed by sex assigned at birth. Findings Overall, esketamine treatment improved total MADRS scores in both sexes; however, significant sex-specific patterns emerged. Females showed greater improvement in total MADRS scores than males towards the end of the trials, in both the placebo and esketamine arms. Females also showed more pronounced reductions in the sadness and detachment factors at the end of the trials, as well as in the neurovegetative factor on day 15, regardless of the treatment group. On the other hand, males showed a significant reduction in sadness symptoms after esketamine on day 2 of the treatment. Females had higher odds of responding, regardless of treatment arm, during later time points. Interpretation These findings reveal that sex assigned at birth influences overall antidepressant response and shapes the trajectory and symptom profile of improvement. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of incorporating sex assigned at birth as a key variable, essential for optimizing TRD treatment strategies and advancing individualized mental healthcare.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969789

However, research on the performance of Elicit is limited. Objectives: To determine whether Elicit AI is a viable tool for systematic literature searches. Methods: We compared the included studies in four systematic reviews to those identified searching with Elicit. We calculated sensitivity, precision and observed patterns in the performance of Elicit. Results: Elicit had an average of 39.6% precision (26.7% - 46.2%) which was higher than the 7.55% average of the original reviews (0.65% - 14.7%). However, the sensitivity of Elicit was poor, averaging 37.9% (25.5% - 69.2%) compared to 93.5% (87.2% - 98.0%) in the original reviews. Elicit also identified some included studies not identified by the original searches. Discussion: At the time of this evaluation, Elicit did not search with high enough sensitivity to replace traditional literature searching. However, the high precision of searching in Elicit could prove useful for preliminary searches, and the unique studies identified mean that Elicit can be used by researchers as a useful adjunct.

Cardiovascular risk is associated with impaired cognitive health, although mechanisms are not completely understood. We sought to explore whether cardiovascular risk moderates the relationship between plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and cognitive status. Methods--We included groups of cognitively normal (n=301) and combined mild cognitive impairment or probable Alzheimer's disease (n=444), based on clinical assessment, from the Bio-Hermes-001 study. Cardiovascular risk was quantified using the Atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk calculator. We conducted a series of logistic regression analyses to evaluate the association of cardiovascular risk, each of several Alzheimer's disease biomarkers (i.e., plasma amyloid beta (A{beta})42/A{beta}40, phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181, p-tau217, and circulating levels of apolipoprotein E (ApoE4)), with cognitive status. We tested moderation by cardiovascular risk in each model. Results--We included 745 participants (mean age=72.3 years; 423 (56.8%) female) in the analysis. In each model, plasma biomarkers and cardiovascular risk were independently associated with cognitive status; the strongest association was found with p-tau217 (odds ratio (OR)=2.33; 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) [1.89-2.9]; p<0.0001). CVD risk only marginally moderated the relationships between p-tau181 and cognitive status, and between p-tau217 and cognitive status (p<0.05). Discussion--Plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and cardiovascular risk were independently associated with cognitive status, but cardiovascular risk only marginally moderated the p-tau181- and p-tau217-cognitive status relationships. If plasma biomarkers and CVD risk potentially confer an independent risk of dementia, cardiovascular risk assessment should complement other dementia biomarker assessments in clinical and research cognitive screening.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969789

A large group of seed stored mRNAs together with newly synthesized transcripts are regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms and selectively translated at different stages to support the germination process. To investigate the mechanism of translational control, we performed ribosome profiling on mRNAs of distinct physiological stages during Arabidopsis thaliana seed germination. The 3-nucleotide periodicity of the ribosome association on mRNAs identified indicates their translational potential. Dry seeds, in which translation is on hold are characterized by a unique ribosome association landscape with high association at the 5 and 3 prime UTR, compared to physiological stages that show active translation. Start codon specific stalling of ribosomes in dry seeds is associated with an adenine enriched sequence motif. Throughout germination codons encoding glycine, aspartate, tyrosine and proline are the most frequent ribosome pausing sites. Moreover, the non-coding RNAs which we identified as associated to ribosomes are indeed translated as was revealed by investigating total seed proteome data. Seed specific upstream Open Reading Frames (uORFs) are identified which may be associated to translational control of adaptative response during early seed germination. Altogether, we present a first ribosome profiling analysis across seed germination that illuminates various regulatory mechanisms that potentially contribute to the seeds survival strategy.","NA","biorxiv",1751234969789

An infectious etiology is strongly suspected, but no causative microorganism has yet been identified. We therefore conducted an age- and sex-matched case-control culturomics study to isolate bacterial species associated with noma and assess their cytotoxicity, their genomic toxin content, and their antibiotic susceptibility.

MethodsA case-control study was conducted in 2023 in the Diourbel region (Senegal) among children aged 5 to 9 years. Gingival plaque samples were analyzed by microbial culturomics. In addition, cytotoxic tests were performed on MRC5 cells, followed by analysis of the toxin and antimicrobial resistance genomic content.

ResultsA total of five cases of noma and five age- and sex-matched controls were included. 102 species were isolated, including five previously unknown species. The cariogenic species Streptococcus mutans and Scardovia wiggsiae were only detected in cases. Interestingly, all seven strains of S. wiggsiae were cytotoxic. Similarly, eight strains of the Bacillus cereus group were only identified in cases, including six cytotoxic strains. After genomic sequencing, six strains of Bacillus pacificus and two strains of Bacillus anthracis (pXO1 and pXO2 negative) were identified. Genes encoding typical toxins (hbl, nhe, ces, entFM, bceT, hlyIII) and penicillin-specific {beta}-Lactamase (bla2) were found in all eight strains of the B. cereus group, but the bla gene and the necrotizing cytotoxins K1 (cytK-1) and K2 (cytK-2) were only identified in the two B. anthracis strains. Among the five new species, Ferdinandcohnia sokhnae sp. nov. was isolated from a child with noma and was cytotoxic. Overall, at least one cytotoxic strain was isolated from each case, but none were found in the controls. B. anthracis, B. pacificus and F. sokhnae strains were all susceptible to clindamycin and vancomycin but resistant to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid and metronidazole. In contrast, all S. wiggsiae strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, but resistant to metronidazole.

ConclusionA microbial specificity was observed in noma characterized by cytotoxic strains with the unexpected isolation of B. anthracis whose genome encoded a previously described necrotizing toxin gene (CytK1). Antimicrobial resistance results did not support the use of amoxicillin nor metronidazole. Microbiota analysis using microbial culturomics was instrumental in these findings, which opens new avenues for understanding the mechanisms of the disease, and for improving WHO and UNICEF guidelines. Future precision medicine based on microbiological knowledge and diagnosis may improve its future clinical management.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969789

This study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying interoceptive attention by examining beta-band power suppression during heartbeat and auditory discrimination tasks. Fifty-one healthy participants engaged in interoceptive (heartbeat detection) and exteroceptive (auditory discrimination) tasks while their brain activity was measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The results revealed significant beta suppression time-locked to the R-peak in the somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, mid-cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 310 to 530 ms post-R-peak. Beta suppression was more pronounced during interoceptive attention, correlating positively with interoceptive accuracy. The findings support the notion that beta suppression in fronto-cingulo- somatosensory network may serve as a neural marker of interoceptive processing, contributing to predictive coding models of interoception. This study highlights the potential for using beta suppression as an objective measure of interoceptive accuracy and suggests that neural oscillations play a critical role in the brains regulation of heartbeat-related information. Furthermore, the study proposes that interoceptive attention involves a top-down mechanism that dynamically adjusts the brains response to cardiac afferent signals, enhancing the precision of interoceptive processing. These findings have implications for understanding how the brain integrates interoceptive signals and may provide insights into clinical applications targeting interoceptive dysfunctions.","NA","biorxiv",1751234969789

In this study, we aimed to determine the similarities and differences between the unconsciousness states caused by sleep and that caused by anaesthesia, and to investigate gene expression profiles by applying tensor decomposition-based unsupervised feature extraction to the two gene expression profiles. One of the two expression profiles was composed of mice treated with sevoflurane, a type of inhaled anaesthesia, whereas the other two expression profiles were composed of sleeping and awake mice. We selected two sets of genes (507 and 1048 genes), which are distinctly expressed between sleep or anaesthesia-induced unconsciousness and the awake or control groups. Both sets of genes include various distinct genes which are common to the state of unconsciousness between sleep and anaesthesia. The former is enriched in GABAergic synapses and layer one of the frontal cortex, whereas the latter is enriched in glutamatergic synapses and layer six of the prefroncal cortes. Additionally, both sets of genes were enriched in the RHO GTPase pathway. Based on these results, we hypothesized that L1 GABAergic neurones in the frontal cortex and L6 glutamatergic neurones in the prefrontal cortex use RHO GTPase to differentiate states of unconsciousness induced with general anaesthesia and sleep.","NA","biorxiv",1751234969789

In low-risk surgical settings such as surgical hubs, accurate risk prediction is particularly valuable. The aim of this review was to identify and map the evidence for 14 validated pre-operative surgical risk prediction tools currently used in Wales within any elective, or non-emergency surgical setting, and to provide a more in-depth look at the findings for a selection of tools deemed to be the most applicable on a population level to the context of surgical hubs. Included studies were published between 1999 and 2024. No evidence was found for two of the risk prediction tools however, a total of 118 studies were identified across 12 risk prediction tools. None of the evidence found was looking at the predictive ability of risk prediction tools for selecting patients suitable for surgical hubs. The tools were used across a range of surgical specialties and measured composite complications, individual complications, and healthcare utilisation and recovery measures. No risk prediction tool adequately predicted complications across all surgical specialties. Among the included studies, there was considerable heterogeneity in which surgical specialties the risk prediction tools were used for, how complications were defined, and which measures were used to determine a tools predictive ability. This makes direct comparisons very challenging. Four tools were selected as being potentially the most impactful at a population level for a more in-depth look at the findings: ACS NSQIP, P-POSSUM, RCRI, ASA classification system. A total of 76 studies were identified across these 4 tools. Key findings for the four risk prediction tools of interest are described. Overall, no one tool was identified that adequately predicted complications across all surgical specialties. The predictive ability of the tools varied across different surgical specialties. Further research using consistent methods is needed to better understand the predictive ability of risk prediction tools and allow a robust evaluation. Given no single risk prediction tool adequately predicted complications across all surgical specialties, it may be likely that some tools are better suited for specific surgery types or that a combination of risk prediction tools may be needed to adequately assess an individuals level of risk.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969789

Understanding RSI incidence can inform quality improvement aimed at prevention and patient safety. Objective: To estimate the incidence of retained surgical items in the United States from 2016 to 2023 overall, annually, and stratified by state and surgery category. Design: This was a longitudinal retrospective cohort study utilizing de-identified healthcare claims data from 2016 to 20243. Setting: Data were from the Komodo Research Dataset, which aggregates medical and pharmacy claims from US commercial and government insurance sources. Participants: 198,619,904 surgeries between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2023 where the patient had at least six months of prior continuous medical and pharmacy insurance enrollment. Surgeries were excluded if there was evidence of RSI before surgery or present on admission, surgery was performed in a US territory, or the patient was aged < 2 on the surgery date. Exposure: Surgical procedures identified by administrative codes categorized as broad or narrow by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The primary outcome was the incidence proportion of RSIs, identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes up to 365 days after surgery. Incidence was estimated overall, annually, and stratified by state and surgical category. Data were analyzed from March 2025 to May 2025. Results: The overall RSI incidence was 1.34 (95% CI: 1.32 to 1.36) per 10,000 surgeries, decreasing from 1.63 (95% CI: 1.58 to 1.70) in 2016 to 1.08 (95% CI: 1.04 to 1.12) in 2023. The 5 highest state-stratified RSI incidences were in the District of Columbia, Maine, Nebraska, Ohio, and West Virginia. Exploratory laparotomies and transplant surgeries had the highest surgery category-stratified RSI incidence. Conclusion and Relevance: This large national claims-based study estimated RSI incidence and describes associated patterns in the US, confirming a persistent but declining annual incidence across the 8-year period. These findings highlight the ongoing need for targeted prevention strategies and system-wide efforts to reduce RSIs and improve surgical care.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969789

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

Here, we use the Drosophila melanogaster midgut model to investigate SARS-CoV-2-induced GI pathogenesis. The fly midgut exhibits susceptibility to orally administered virus, resulting in disrupted epithelial architecture, reduced organ size, and altered visceral muscle dynamics. These effects are accompanied by sustained proliferation of intestinal stem cells alongside decreased replenishment and viability of differentiated cells. Transcriptomic profiling reveals biphasic perturbations in midgut gene expression, particularly in pathways related to lipid metabolism. Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a dichotomous effect on lipid homeostasis, with lipid droplet accumulation in the posterior midgut and depletion in anterior segments. Treatment with Plitidepsin, a COVID-19 drug candidate, mitigates most SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic features in both the Drosophila midgut and human pulmonary cells, while modulating basal lipid droplet homeostasis in uninfected conditions. These findings establish the Drosophila midgut as a potent model for studying SARS-CoV-2 GI pathogenesis and evaluating antiviral compounds.","NA","biorxiv",1751234969789

Accelerometer-derived outcomes describing physical activity (PA) volume and intensity distribution relative to a persons maximal capacity have provided insight into associations with health in adults. Little is known, however, about how the relative intensity of childrens PA volume and intensity distribution relates to health or fitness. To address this, we examined associations between childrens absolute and relative PA volume and intensity distribution with cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), and differences in these PA outcomes for children stratified by CRF level. Materials and Methods. In 9-10-year-old children (N=235) PA was assessed using wrist accelerometers for up to 7-days and CRF estimated from the 20-m multistage shuttle run test (20mSRT). Children were classified as Healthy or Low CRF. Absolute PA outcomes were PA volume (average acceleration; AvAccabs) and intensity distribution (intensity gradient; IGabs). Equivalent relative PA outcomes were generated (AvAccrel and IGrel) using maximum acceleration values derived from the 20mSRT. Results. Absolute, but not relative standardised PA outcomes were positively associated with CRF (AvAccabs Std{beta}=0.21, p=0.02; IGabs Std{beta}=0.21, p=0.03). Absolute standardised PA outcomes were significantly higher among Healthy CRF children (AvAccabs Std{beta}=0.40, p=0.007; IGabs Std{beta}=0.46, p=0.008), but there were no significant differences between Healthy and Low CRF groups for relative PA outcomes. Conclusions. Children were similarly active relative to their physiological capacity, despite children with Healthy CRF being more active in absolute terms.  Future studies should seek to better understand the influence of relative PA on CRF among diverse child populations who differ on a range of physical, physiological and demographic characteristics.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969789

Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for clinical and imaging covariates, including myocardial flow reserve (MFR >=2 vs. <2). Results: The cohort had a median age of 68 years, with 57% male patients. Common risk factors included hypertension (84%), dyslipidemia (76%), diabetes (33%), and prior coronary artery disease (31%). Median follow-up was 4.6 years. Patients with high SR (n=1,091) had an increased risk of MACE (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.31, p=0.002).

However, data on the purity of illicitly manufactured fentanyl in the United States typically comes from law enforcement seizures and is rarely available at the consumer-level, which is most relevant to overdose risk. Methods: Samples were analyzed from a community-based drug checking program operating at four geographic sites in Los Angeles County, California 2023 Q1 to 2025 Q2. Participants answered an anonymous survey about sample characteristics. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted leveraging directly-observed mass spectrometry (DART-MS) and Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) respectively. LC/MS quantified a panel of compounds including fentanyl and fluorofentanyl. Composite fentanyl purity was estimated by adding the percent mass of fentanyl and fluorofentanyl. Results: A total of 353 samples had either fentanyl, fluorofentanyl, or both, quantified. Average purity was 10.0%, SD 11.1%, range 0.1%-64.9%. Samples expected to be fentanyl (n=308) had higher average purity (10.9%) compared to those expected to be heroin (n=24, average purity=2.7%) or other drugs. Powder samples (n=318) had higher average concentration (10.8%) compared to pills (n=11, 1.4%) or tar (n=22, 3.2%).

METHODS: We conducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using neuropsychological testing from 1,697 healthy adults. Factor scores were submitted as predictors for structural MRI, functional connectivity, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. RESULTS: The EFA model identified five latent factors. Factor 1, Verbal Memory, included high loadings from Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and Factor 2, Visual Memory, included high loadings from Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT). Factor 2 positively correlated with hippocampal volume, precuneus and posterior salience network connectivity, and negatively with CSF tau. Factor 1 correlated with hippocampal volume but not with network connectivity or CSF biomarkers. DISCUSSION: Results demonstrate a significant relationship of visual memory with AD biomarkers. RCFT may be an important assessment for evaluating and tracking individuals during the earliest stages of Alzheimer's pathology.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

The risk of falls may be mitigated using reactive balance training (RBT) which has been shown to effectively reduce fall risk by enhancing reactive stepping following repeated balance perturbations. However, the optimal RBT intensity for people with chronic stroke remains unknown. The purpose of this assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial is to investigate the optimal intensity of RBT by comparing high-intensity, moderate-intensity, and walking control groups among 63 individuals with chronic stroke. Participants will undergo four consecutive days of training, with outcomes assessed pre- and post-training and at a one-year follow-up. The primary outcomes are reactive stepping ability, measured using number of steps required to recover balance from a novel perturbation. Secondary outcomes include rates of adverse events, functional balance, falls efficacy, and participation in daily activities. We hypothesize that high-intensity RBT will yield faster adaptations and greater retention compared to moderate-intensity and walking. Determining the optimal RBT intensity could substantially enhance clinical guidelines for stroke rehabilitation, optimize therapy efficiency, and improve patient outcomes by reducing fall risk and improving functional independence.

Ruptured AVMs can cause significant morbidity and mortality. The Ruptured Arteriovenous Malformation Grading Scale (RAGS) was developed to better predict outcomes in patients with ruptured AVMs. However, the reliability of this scale has yet to be confirmed to support its use in clinical practice. Objective: To determine the intra- and inter-rater reliability of RAGS among those most likely to use it in clinical practice. Methods: A cross-sectional sample of 42 patients with ruptured AVMs was selected via retrospective review, and clinical vignettes were created. Five raters were chosen to assign a RAGS score to all 42 patients to assess the inter-rater reliability of RAGS. After two months, ten patients from the study sample were randomly selected to be re-rated to determine the intra-rater reliability of RAGS. Results: The overall agreement rate was 97.2% among all raters. The inter-rater reliability was found to be substantial when measured using Cohen/Conger Kappa (0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.63, 0.82]), Scott/Fleiss Kappa (0.72, 95% CI [0.62, 0.82]), Krippendorf Alpha (0.73, 95% CI [.63, 95% CI [0.63, 0.82]), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (0.78, 95% CI [0.68, 0.86]), and Kendall W (0.79, 95% CI [0.68, 0.86]) and almost perfect using Gwet AC (0.90, 95% CI [0.88, 0.93]). The test-retest percent agreement was between 94.7% and 98.1% among raters. Conclusions: The RAGS classification system is highly reliable and has substantial to near-perfect agreement among raters with different expertise levels and specialties. This study supports the potential use of RAGS in clinical practice across different institutions.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

The aim of this study was to develop and validate an automated method to identify nCET and assess its prognostic value. Methods: Pre operative T2 weighted and FLAIR MRI from 940 patients with newly diagnosed GB in four multicenter cohorts were analyzed. A deep learning model segmented enhancing tumor, edema and necrosis; a non local spatially varying finite mixture model then isolated edema subregions containing nCET. The ratio of nCET to total edema volume - the Diffuse Infiltration Index (DII) - was calculated. Associations between DII and overall survival (OS) were examined with Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox regression. Results: The algorithm distinguished nCET from vasogenic edema in 97.5 percent of patients, showing a mean signal intensity gap greater than 5 percent. Higher DII is able to stratify patients with shorter OS. In the NCT03439332 cohort, DII above the optimal threshold doubled the hazard of death (hazard ratio 2.09, 95 percent confidence interval 1.34 to 3.25; p = 0.0012) and reduced median survival by 122 days. Significant, though smaller, effects were confirmed in GLIOCAT and BraTS (hazard ratio 1.31; p = 0.022), OUS (hazard ratio 1.28; p = 0.007) and in pooled analysis (hazard ratio 1.28; p = 0.0003). DII remained an independent predictor after adjustment for age, extent of resection and MGMT methylation. Conclusions: We present a reproducible, server hosted tool for automated nCET delineation and DII biomarker extraction that enables robust, independent prognostic stratification. It promises to guide supramaximal surgical planning and personalized neuro oncology research and care.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

Methods: Veterans (n=180) age 65+ were recruited from Madison VA Hospital. Resting supine brachial BP and central BP (estimated from radial artery waveforms, Atcor Medical) were obtained. CAS (Peterson's elastic modulus [PEM], Young's elastic modulus [YEM]) and distensibility coefficient (DC) were calculated using brachial and central BP. Differences in CAS were compared using paired Wilcoxon tests. Linear regression models evaluated associations with cardiovascular risk factors. Results: Participants were 70.4 (7.7) years old and 27.8% were female. Average brachial systolic BP was significantly higher than central (132.3 [18.6] mmHg vs 123.8 [17.7] mmHg p<0.001). Compared to brachial BP, using central BP to calculate stiffness measures resulted in significantly lower YEM and PEM and significantly higher DC (PEM: 480.6 [209.5] mmHg vs 378.3 [178.4] mmHg; YEM: 2220.2 [926.6] mmHg vs 1746.9 [785.4] mmHg; DC: 2.4 [1.0] x10-3 mmHg-1 vs 3.1 [1.1] x10-3 mmHg-1; all p<0.001).

Our previous findings demonstrated that while the ratio between tau and phosphorylated tau at T181 (pTau-T181) is decreased, increases in CSF tau correlated with faster disease progression in people with ALS. Here, we measured tau and pTau-T181 in plasma samples from participants with ALS and healthy controls (HC) using two methods (Quanterix Simoa and Meso Scale Discovery, MSD). Using both assays, there was an increase in pTau-T181 levels and in the pTau-T181:tau ratio in ALS compared to HC andlarger increases in pTau-T181 and pTau-T181:tau ratio at baseline correlated with faster ALS progression. Plasma total tau levels were increased in ALS compared to HC on the MSD assay and decreased on Quanterix Simoa assay. Collectively, our results suggest that plasma pTau-T181 levels are increased in ALS.

Despite its recognition by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD), epidemiological data on SE remain scarce in Ghana, particularly in communities fringing protected forest areas such as the Kakum Conservation Area (KCA). Objective This study aimed to quantify and characterize the epidemiology of snakebite envenomation and explore the health-seeking behaviours among residents in the fringe communities of the KCA in the Central Region of Ghana. Methods A cross-sectional household survey was conducted between April and May 2024 in 18 communities fringing the KCA in Ghana's Central Region. A two-stage sampling approach was employed to enumerate a total of 1,445 households for snakebite victims. The survey instrument was programmed into KoBoCollect software and administered to snakebite victim of household heads using the one-on-one interview method. Mainly descriptive statistical analytical analyses were conducted using STATA version 14.0. Results In this study, the lifetime number of snakebites reported was 394 (4.6%), while 164 (1.9%) and 41 (0.5%) snakebites reported in the last 5 years and one (1) year preceding the survey, respectively. The average age of a snakebite victim was 44 years. Snakebite victims were typically female (54%), married (59%), and mainly engaged in farming (73%) for livelihood. Most snakebites occurred during the morning (42%), in the farm field/forest (66%) and along the victims lower limbs (88%). Over seven-in-ten victims sought first aid, with tourniquet (35%) mostly applied. Majority (69%) of victims sought treatment in a healthcare facility, mostly in Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) compounds (32%). Conclusion Snakebites constitute a major public health concern in communities fringing the KCA, especially for those whose livelihoods revolve around agricultural activities. There is the need to establish and strengthen collaborative efforts among primary health authorities, forest conservation managers, and community leaders in the design and implementation of effective interventions to avert snakebite incidents and improve outcomes for victims.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

However, athletes' sleep is impaired in both quality and quantity. Previous research has shown athletes' sleep quality and quantity to be improved using sleep interventions, however very few studies have evaluated sleep and investigated it among female athletes. Therefore, this exploratory study aimed to evaluate the sleep of adult female team-sport athletes over a match week in an ecological context and to assess the effects of a one-to-one sleep intervention (comprising both educational and practical components). Methods: Nine female rugby players completed a two-week protocol including a sleep evaluation (PRE week) and an intervention (POST week). The first week was dedicated to sleep assessment via both actigraphy and self-report questionnaires, and during the second week, players received educational and practical sleep interventions. Results: During the PRE week, 88.9% of the participants were classified as poor sleepers, compared to only 44% during the POST week. A significant positive effect of sleep interventions was particularly found on subjective sleep (from 10.3 +/- 1.1 to 8.8 +/- 1.8, p = 0.03, n2 = 0.38) and psychological state (from 3.7 +/- 0.6 to 2.9 +/- 0.9, p = 0.002, n2 = 0.55). Conclusion: These positive effects highlight the need for sleep among female athletes and the potential benefits of targeted sleep interventions, though confirmation in larger samples of athletic women is needed. This feasible and tailored approach could be effectively implemented among female team-sport athletes over the competitive season.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

We systematically searched records in PubMed capturing the synergistic challenges and potential strategies in achieving triple EMTCT between January 1, 2013, and April 27, 2023. After screening 547 records, 50 reports met inclusion criteria. Overall, testing for HIV was well-established within antenatal care but limited for syphilis and HBV due to poor political support, inadequate funding, and insufficient operational guidance on how to deliver integrated testing within maternal and child health care. MTCT of syphilis and HBV appears to be impeded by lack of integrated systems to enable test-and-treat approaches with same-day test results and immediate treatment initiation, gaps in linkage to care, frequent stockouts of essential drugs and other commodities, prohibitive user fees, and limited clinical familiarity and training of staff in managing syphilis and HBV positive cases. To achieve triple EMTCT, co-strategies that leverage success of HIV programs to gain momentum towards prevention of congenital syphilis and MTCT of HBV, that break down siloed programs by co-delivery of testing, treatment, and training and that are supported through political will, advocacy, policy and funding are critical.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

Contributing to the ongoing debate, we investigated whether treatment response to a highly standardized one-session virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) was predicted by 5-HTTLPR genotype. N=194 patients with arachnophobia (spider phobia) were genotyped for 5-HTTLPR and the functionally related single nucleotide polymorphism rs25531 and grouped into high- (LA/LA), and low-expression (S/S, S/LG, LG/LG, S/LA, LG/LA) genotype. At baseline, after VRET, and at a 6-month follow-up, participants underwent a standardized behavioral avoidance task (BAT) and the spider phobia questionnaire (SPQ) to assess symptom severity. Chi-square tests revealed a significant association between 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 and behavioral treatment outcome, that remained significant at the 6-month follow-up. No association was found between genotype and self-reported symptom severity measured with the SPQ. Our results support the idea that while LA/LA genotype carriers might benefit from highly standardized treatment, lower 5-HTT expression may convey risk to poorer treatment response, likely necessitating more tailored psychotherapeutic interventions to promote sufficient response.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

To determine whether MSIMI is more common in Black women with recent premature MI than other demographic groups. Methods. We studied 602 individuals [&le;] 61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months.

The mean age was 51 years (range, 25-61), 46% were women and 59% self-identified as Black. Black women had a more adverse psychosocial profile and higher rates of obesity and diabetes, but a less severe index MI. The incidence of MSIMI was approximately doubled in Black women than the other groups (p<.001 for interaction). Clinical and psychosocial risk factors did not explain these differences. In a fully adjusted model, the risk ratio of MSIMI for Black women was 2.2 (95% CI, 2.0-2.5) compared to Black men, 2.3 (1.8-2.9) compared to non-Black women, and 1.8 (1.4-2.2) compared to non-Black men.

There is evidence that some facets of the initiation consultation, or the initiating clinician, are associated with adherence. CVD risk estimation is fundamental to statin initiation and shared decision making (SDM), because the benefits of statins are proportional to CVD risk. Absence of a recorded CVD risk score before statin initiation therefore indicates SDM is unlikely. This study investigates whether, in primary prevention, SDM, using CVD risk score as a proxy measure, is associated with adherence to statins and CVD outcomes. Method: A cohort of statin naive patients aged 40-84 years initiated on statins for primary prevention between 2017 and 2020 was identified and categorised by the presence or absence of a CVD risk score at statin initiation. Statin adherence and persistence was determined from subsequent statin prescriptions. Multivariable modelling, accounting for potential confounders determined the association between a recorded CVD risk score and statin adherence and persistence. A secondary analysis investigated the relationship with subsequent CVD outcomes and death. Results: 255,730 patients were included with a mean follow up of 4.6 years. 67.7% had a CVD risk score coded. The presence of a CVD risk score increased odds of adherence at the end of year one by 7% and reduced the chances of discontinuation by 8%. The composite outcome of CVD and all-cause mortality was decreased by 21% when a CVD risk score was present. Conclusion: When a statin is initiated in the presence of a CVD risk score there is a small, but significant improvement in both adherence and persistence which could indicate that the quality of initiation consultations, and a focus on SDM, improves the utility of statins. Additionally, CVD risk scoring is associated with a large decrease in CVD/death which cannot fully be explained by improvements in statin adherence and persistence; an important finding necessitating further investigation.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

However, most epidemiological literature describing the US overdose crisis has still primarily relied on traditional data sources, especially the CDC WONDER system that is limited to assessing drugs with established ICD-10 codes using a maximum of n=2 ICD-10 codes. In this analysis we leverage complete medical examiner records Los Angeles County examine the limitations of CDC WONDER data for detecting polysubstance drug deaths. Methods Deaths counts describing drug-involved deaths occurring in Los Angeles County were described using the CDC WONDER system, and medical examiner data from Los Angeles County. The average number of drugs, and the proportion of polysubstance deaths (involving 2 or more) involving 3 or more substances was summarized by year. Head-to-head comparisons were conducted of single-drug involvement, and UpSet plot visualization was employed for complex set analysis. Results The average number of drugs present per drug-involved death increased from 1.72 in 2012 to a peak of 2.29 in 2023. The percentage of polysubstance deaths (2+ substances) that would not be fully characterizable using the CDC WONDER system given a 2 drug limit), increased from 51% in 2012 to a peak of 74% in 2023. The total number of unique polysubstance combinations with >2 substances increased from n=11 in 2012 to n=57 in 2023 and was n=39 in 2024. Overall concordance in single-substance death counts between CDC WONDER and medical examiner records was high among n=6 substances of interest. Across n=42 drug and year pairs observed between 2018 and 2024, the overall R2 according to a Pearson correlation analysis was 0.99. Discussion Although concordance is very high for trends describing single-substance drug deaths, CDC WONDER fails to capture the majority of polysubstance deaths adequately. We find that a very large fraction of polysubstance deaths (about three quarters) are incompletely described using the 2 drug limit employed by CDC WONDER. This limitation has increased over time, as the complexity of polysubstance overdose deaths has increased. We illustrate a huge variety of polysubstance deaths that can be seen in medical examiner deaths. As the overdose crisis grows increasingly polysubstance in nature, improving the epidemiological tracking of deaths involving multiple drugs, and drugs not captured by ICD-10 codes currently, is of paramount importance. Here we highlight the gaps in existing traditional epidemiological sources which may serve as a motivating example for future improvements.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

Timely VSL-specific VE estimates are essential, but study-specific VSL identification by whole genome sequencing (the ""gold standard"") is expensive and time-consuming. Alternatively, VSL-specific VE has been estimated from external sequencing data (VSL predominance period by proxy: PP). We propose two novel approaches for use in test-negative design (TND) studies to estimate VSL-specific VE when study-specific VSL identification is not possible. Methods We demonstrate the variant category model (VCM) and the variant proportion model (VPM) approaches. Using data from a hospital-based TND study among adults [&ge;]65 years, during the period of sequential predominance of XBB and BA.2.86 in 2023/24, we estimated the VE as (1-OR) x 100%. For the VCM, we used a binary variable categorising ""most likely underlying sublineage"" based on publicly available sequencing data. For the VPM, we used a continuous variable with values from 0 to 1 representing the weekly proportion of BA.2.86. We validated results using study-specific VSL identification from sequenced study data (SD) and the standard PP approach. Results Overall, at 14-59 days post vaccination, VE point estimates against XBB were within {+/-}3% absolute for the VE estimated using both models, with an equivalent standard PP validation. We could not validate using SD, as there were no vaccinated XBB cases. Against BA.2.86, VE was lower than against XBB, and the VCM and VPM results were within {+/-}7% absolute of each other, with lowest validation results from SD but equivalent results from the PP. Conclusions Both proposed approaches produced similar VE estimates to those from well-known methods. The VPM could also provide VE estimates when the validation techniques were limited by low sample size.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

It carries significant social, emotional, and health consequences for women, their children, families, and communities. In Ethiopia, approximately one-third of married women report that their pregnancies are unintended. Despite the considerable burden of unintended pregnancies in the country, there remains limited evidence on the factors contributing to this issue, particularly at Lemi Kura sub city. This study, therefore, aimed to identify the determinants of unintended pregnancy among women attending antenatal care services in health facilities within Lemi Kura sub-city, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods : We conducted a facility-based case-control study in Lemi Kura sub-city, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from January 3 to February 18, 2022. Cluster random sampling technique was used to select 103 cases (women with unintended pregnancies attending antenatal care unit) and 197 controls (women with planned pregnancies attending antenatal care unit). Data were collected through interviewer-administered, pretested questionnaires. The sample size was calculated using Epi-Info version 7. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS version 20, applying multivariable logistic regression to identify determinants of unintended pregnancy. Results were reported as adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and statistical significance was declared at p < 0.05. Results: The Muslim women (AOR: 3.33, 95% CI: 1.21-9.15) ; Protestant women (AOR: 3.06, 95% CI: 1.07-8.75); reduced women's autonomy (AOR: 16.58, 95% CI: 2.40-114.15); residing 4 km or more from the antenatal care facility (AOR: 2.70, 95% CI: 1.07-8.75); having two or more living children(parity) (AOR: 5.37, 95% CI: 1.60-18.15); desiring two or fewer children(Ideal) (AOR: 3.63, 95% CI: 1.50-9.01); and having multiple sexual partners (AOR: 4.25, 95% CI: 1.38-30.38) were significant predictors of unintended pregnancy. Conclusion : Women with Low knowledge about FPMs, unmarried, Protestant and Muslim religious, low autonomy, multiparous, used natural FPM, health service inaccessibility and having multiple sexual partners were primary predicators of the unintended pregnancy. For intervention, engaging religious leaders and focusing on multiparous with empowering women is essential.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

However, these methods are inherently specialized, relying on predefined assumptions and/or limited scalability. Recent advances in simulation and deep learning provide an alternative approach: learning directly to generalize from synthetic genetic data to infer specific hidden evolutionary processes. Here we reframe the inference of coalescence times as a problem of translation between two biological languages: the sparse, observable patterns of mutation along the genome and the unobservable ancestral recombination graph (ARG) that gave rise to them. Inspired by large language models, we develop cxt, a decoder-only transformer that autoregressively predicts coalescent events conditioned on local mutational context. We show that cxt performs on par with state-of-the-art MCMC-based likelihood models across a broad range of demographic scenarios, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Trained on simulations spanning the stdpopsim catalog, the model generalizes robustly and enables efficient inference at scale, producing over a million coalescence predictions in minutes. In addition cxt produces a well calibrated approximate posterior distribution of its predictions, enabling principled uncertainty quantification. Our work moves towards a foundation model for population genetics, bridging deep learning and coalescent theory to enable flexible, scalable inference of genealogical history from genomic data.","NA","biorxiv",1751234969790

We found that hospital AI implementation is significantly clustered, with over 67% misaligned with critical healthcare needs like provider shortages. Clustering- and hotspot-analysis-mapped regions with high and low AI adoption are used to identify specific areas for targeted equity interventions. Geographically weighted regression reveals that factors driving AI implementation vary by region, suggesting universal strategies may be ineffective.

Therefore, we sought to assess age-stratified seroprevalence of monotypic or multi-typic exposure in a community cohort in Sri Lanka.

MethodsThe DENV-specific serostatus was assessed in 4,161 children aged 4 to 16 years, using an in-house DENV specific IgG ELISA and compared the results with a widely used commercial assay (dengue indirect Panbio IgG ELISA). We also used a multiplexed, microsphere-based serological assay, to characterise monotypic vs multi-typic infections and to differentiate exposure rates to different DENV serotypes and ZIKV in a sub-cohort of children (n=604).

ResultsBy IgG-ELISA DENV seropositivity was 72.34% (n=4,161), and the seroprevalence rate significantly increased with age (Spearmans r=1.0, p=0.003). The estimated FOI was 0.16 (95% credible interval 0.14-0.17). Of the 604 individuals tested by Luminex, 258 (42.7%) had a monotypic dengue infection, whereas 209 (34.9%) had a multi-typic response. 100 (16.5%) had evidence of a past infection to zika, while 20 (3.33%) children, only had antibodies to the ZIKV. Of the 258 individuals with evidence of a monotypic infection of DENV, DENV2 (56.83%) and DENV1 (30.57%) accounted for most infections. An inverse correlation between exposure to ZIKV and age (Spearmanss r=-0.72, 0=0.007).

Conclusions72.3% of children were seropositive for dengue with 42.7% been infected with only one DENV in the past. The data suggests that prior immunity to DENV may reduce the risk of ZIKV infection, which should be further assessed.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients.

ObjectiveTo estimate the impacts of federal policy changes on PrEP coverage, new HIV infections and costs associated with new HIV infections

DesignEstimation of excess HIV infections under different policy impacts were conducted using parameters from a previously published ecological model of the relationship between PrEP coverage and new HIV infections. Costs were estimated for the treatment of infections not averted under different scenarios.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsThere was no individual participation in research activities; population-based data sources were used to describe the population-level PrEP use and new diagnoses under different hypothetical changes in PrEP coverage.

ExposuresPercent of people with indications for PrEP who are taking PrEP

Main Outcome and MeasuresEstimated change in new HIV infections under different assumptions of change in PrEP coverage; costs of treatment for avoidable HIV infections and net costs of avoidable infections after accounting for costs of PrEP medications.

ResultsEven modest reductions in PrEP coverage would result in thousands of avoidable HIV infections. An absolute 3.3% annual reduction in PrEP coverage over the next decade would result in 8,618 avoidable HIV infections, with lifetime medical costs of over $3.6 billion (discounted) for treatment of the unaverted HIV infections.

Conclusions and RelevanceChanges in policy that reduce PrEP uptake would result in avoidable HIV infections and increased costs for HIV treatment. Maintaining policies and programs that support PrEP uptake offers benefits for health and is estimated to result in net cost savings.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the likely impacts on HIV transmissions and healthcare costs if policy changes result in decreased PrEP utilization in the United States?

FindingsUnder assumptions of even modest reductions in PrEP use, we estimated thousands of HIV infections would fail to be averted over the next decade, and billions of dollars of additional treatment costs would accrue to the healthcare system.

Results of the studyWe used historical descriptive data on the US HIV epidemic to quantify the relationship between PrEP coverage and trends in HIV diagnoses and to estimate future trends in HIV infections if PrEP coverage were to be rolled back. If PrEP use declines modestly - about 3% annually - we estimate that 8,618 new infections would fail to be averted in a decade because of lowered PrEP uptake, and the estimated lifetime medical costs of these unaverted infections would be $3.6 billion (discounted) and $9.3 billion (undiscounted).

MeaningChanges in healthcare priorities and policies, especially those that increase out of pocket costs of PrEP or reduce the convenience of engaging in PrEP care, risk rolling back our progress in ending the HIV epidemic, accruing avertable HIV infections, and incurring increased costs for medical care of people whose HIV infections were avoidable.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

South Africa is unique in the region because its HIV programme is largely domestically funded, although donor funds and partnerships support key components. We estimated the epidemiological impact of ceased PEPFAR support for specific services and the costs and cost-effectiveness of the South African government (SAG) potentially taking over these services.

MethodsWe used a costed version of Thembisa, a South African HIV transmission model, to simulate four scenarios: a minimum scenario assuming intervention coverage reducing proportional to PEPFARs funding share of specific activities in 2023; a maximum scenario assuming additional health system impacts; and sub-scenarios either with 3-year recovery (2029-2031) or no recovery to previous coverage. HIV programme costs were estimated from the provider perspective (SAG) in 2024/25 US dollars.

ResultsOver 2025-2028, discontinuing PEPFAR funding in South Africa without replacement by SAG would result in 150,000-296,000 additional new HIV infections (29-56% increase) and 56,000-65,000 additional AIDS-related deaths (33-38%). Permanent discontinuation of currently PEPFAR-supported services over the next 20 years increases this to 1.1-2.1 million additional new HIV infections and 519,000-712,000 additional AIDS deaths. To sustain services, SAG needs to spend an additional $710 million to $1.5 billion between 2025 and 2028. Under a reduced budget, the most cost-effective interventions to preserve are ART and PrEP.

Symptoms of sympathetic dysfunction are prevalent in diabetes, affecting up to 90% of patients. The molecular and cellular composition of the human SCG and its alteration in diabetes remains poorly defined. To address this gap, we performed spatial transcriptomic profiling of lumbar SCGs from diabetic and non-diabetic organ donors. We identified 3 three distinct neuronal populations, two noradrenergic (NA1 and NA2) and one cholinergic (CHO), based on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and SLC18A3 expression, respectively. We also characterized 9 non-neuronal populations consisting of Schwann cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, adipocytes, and endothelial cells. In diabetic SCGs, we observed a significant loss of myelinating Schwann cells and a phenotypic shift of cholinergic neurons toward a noradrenergic identity. Additionally, diabetes was associated with a significant reduction in the transcripts of vasodilatory neuropeptides, such as VIP and CALCA, suggesting a mechanism for impaired vascular control. Upstream regulator analysis highlighted altered neurotrophic signaling in diabetes, with enhanced NGF/TRKA and diminished BDNF/TRKB activity, potentially driven by target-derived cues. Comparison between SCG and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons revealed ganglia-specific genes, like SCN3A and NPY (SCG) versus SCN10A and GPX1 (DRG), offering specific therapeutic targets for autonomic dysfunction or pain. Our findings provide a transcriptomic characterization of human SCG, revealing molecular signatures that underlie diabetic autonomic dysfunction. This work lays a foundation for the development of therapies to restore sympathetic function and avoid unintended autonomic effects in the development of analgesics.

Significance StatementAutonomic dysfunction affects up to 90% of people with diabetes, yet the human sympathetic nervous system remains poorly molecularly defined. To address this gap, we present a spatial transcriptomic profile of the human sympathetic chain ganglia (SCG), revealing how diabetes affects the human autonomic nervous system. We show that diabetes shifts the cholinergic neuronal population to a noradrenergic phenotype and reduces vasodilation neuropeptide expression, potentially explaining impaired vascular control and thermoregulation. Comparative analysis of sympathetic and sensory ganglia reveals distinct gene profiles that may inform novel therapeutic strategies. These findings offer critical insight into the molecular drivers of diabetic autonomic neuropathy and lay the groundwork for safer, more precise treatments that selectively modulate autonomic or sensory function in chronic disease.","NA","biorxiv",1751234969790

Here, we investigated this question using EEG and computational modelling based on deep neural networks (DNNs). Participants viewed object images whose identity was probabilistically predicted by preceding cues. We then quantified trial-by-trial surprise at both low-level (early DNN layers) and high-level (late DNN layers) visual feature representations. Results showed that stimulus-evoked responses around 200ms post-stimulus onset over parieto-occipital electrodes were increased by high-level, but not by low-level visual surprise. These findings demonstrate that high-level visual predictions are rapidly integrated into perceptual inference, suggesting that the brains predictive machinery is finely tuned to utilize expectations abstracted away from low-level sensory details to facilitate perception.","NA","biorxiv",1751234969790

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

Many organisms with symbiotic microorganisms have developed elaborate vertical transmission mechanisms, which are thought to be important for the evolution of intimate symbiotic relationships with microorganisms. One such case is the cockroach-Blattabacterium endosymbiosis, in which the symbiotic bacteria have been evolutionarily conserved and co-speciated with the host insects with stable vertical symbiont transmission via ovarial passage. While classical histological descriptions and recent electron microscopic observations have reported the vertical symbiont transmission processes in some cockroach-Blattabacterium associations, the full picture of the infection dynamics has not been fully understood. In this study, we conducted detailed histological and cytological observations of the localization of the bacteriocytes and the symbiotic bacteria during the postembryonic development of the German cockroach Blattella germanica. We found that the symbiont-filled bacteriocytes migrate into and associate with nymphal ovaries and are subsequently eliminated from adult ovaries, suggesting that symbiont infection to the ovaries may only occur during nymphal stages. We also found that the symbiotic bacteria are localized in the space between each oocyte and surrounding follicle cells, the symbiont-localized space is interconnected between neighboring oocytes, and therefore the symbiotic bacteria can move across oocytes within the same ovariole, suggesting the possibility that the symbiont-infected oocytes may serve as the source of symbiont supply to developing young oocytes upstream in the same ovariole. Based on these observations, we provide a hypothesis as to how the postembryonic developmental dynamics of the bacteriocytes are integrated into the vertical symbiont transmission and functioning in the cockroach-Blattabacterium endosymbiosis.","NA","biorxiv",1751234969790

Understanding how the Healthy Eating Index-2020 (HEI-2020) can be used as a measure of diet quality to create benchmarks for national nutrition monitoring can assist in surveillance and improve the design of nutrition programs and policies.

ObjectiveTo examine the utility of the HEI-2020 to create benchmarks for national diet quality monitoring.

MethodsThis serial cross-sectional study used data from the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Nationally representative data for 22,168 US adults ([&ge;]20 years) who completed two 24-hour recalls were analyzed. We derived HEI-2020 scores (0-100) from participants two 24-hour dietary recalls. Diet quality categories were established: high diet quality (>70-100), marginal (>60-70), low (>50-60), and very low (0-50).

ResultsOnly 13% of US adults had high diet quality while nearly two-thirds had low or very low diet quality. Diet quality was higher for older adults, female, ""Other"" race or ethnicity, born outside of the US, have higher education attainment, higher income, and food security. Compared to adults with high diet quality, adults with very low diet quality had lower intakes of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and seafood and the highest intakes of ultra-processed foods, refined grains, and red and processed meats (all P-trends <0.01). Adults with very low diet quality were more likely to have elevated adiposity, lower HDL cholesterol, and higher triglycerides, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c (all P-trends [&le;]0.01).

ConclusionsThe HEI-2020 is a robust measure of diet quality that can be directly linked to biological measures associated with chronic disease risk. Using evidence-based HEI categories could allow policymakers, public health practitioners, and nutrition professionals to set benchmarks and nationwide targets for achieving improved diet quality.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

Rationally predicting individual-specific success or failure of probiotic and prebiotic interventions remains an outstanding challenge. In this study, we leverage microbial community-scale metabolic models (MCMMs) to predict probiotic engraftment and shifts in microbiota-mediated short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in response to a synbiotic intervention. Using data from a placebo-controlled synbiotic intervention trial, involving a cocktail of five probiotic strains and the prebiotic inulin, we validate model engraftment predictions with quantitative PCR (qPCR), demonstrating that MCMMs accurately predict probiotic engraftment outcomes in the treatment group with over 85% accuracy. Engraftment varied by species, with Akkermansia muciniphila and Bifidobacterium infantis displaying higher engraftment rates than Clostridium beijerinckii, Anaerobutyricum hallii, and Clostridium butyricum. Furthermore, MCMMs predicted significant increases in butyrate and propionate production following synbiotic treatment. MCMM-predicted changes in propionate production in the treatment group were negatively associated with changes in C-reactive protein (CRP), a blood marker of systemic inflammation, from baseline to 12 weeks after the synbiotic intervention. Finally, we explore MCMM-predicted responses to a wider range of synbiotic combinations in a larger observational cohort, suggesting that personalized prebiotic selection can augment probiotic efficacy. These findings highlight the potential of metabolic modeling to inform precision microbiome therapeutics.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

Recently, a novel approach for the fast and efficient differentiation of ovarian support cells (OSCs) to generate a versatile platform for basic research and clinical applications was demonstrated. This study details the clinical process development and application of an OSC product, known as Fertilo, to improve the in vitro maturation (IVM) of human oocytes, a method referred to as OSC-IVM. First, transcription factor (TF) mediated OSC differentiation using research-grade raw materials was shown to produce granulosa-like cells that improve the MII maturation rate of human oocytes. To support clinical application, several raw material upgrades were initiated, including substitution of the differentiation matrix with a higher-quality alternative, laminin-521, and the generation of a clinically suitable hiPSC seed bank and master cell bank. Single cell RNA sequencing of OSCs generated using the updated protocol for clinical translation demonstrated the consistency and reproducibility of cellular outcomes. Next, analytical release testing of the clinical product was performed and a murine oocyte maturation assay was developed to establish the potency of OSCs for use in OSC-IVM. Finally, the qualified Fertilo product was applied in a two-phase longitudinal cohort analysis, with the results showing improvement in key outcomes compared to traditional IVM treatment. Our findings demonstrate the first-time clinical development and application of an hiPSC-derived product to improve reproductive outcomes after IVM and advance womens health.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

This qualitative study explores the lived experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) following the implementation of Covid-19 vaccine mandates in Albertas health sector. It draws on 80 responses to a single open-ended question from a survey of 190 HCWs in the province across vaccination statuses. We performed a manual sentiment analysis, classifying entries as positive, neutral, or negative - depending on their normative orientation towards vaccination mandates - using Weberian ideal types as a conceptual framework.

Most respondents (82.5%) expressed negative sentiments, with close to one fifth (17.5%) offering positive views; no entries were coded as neutral. Themes within negative responses included coercion, ethical conflict, professional exclusion, institutional betrayal, and suppression of dissent. Many vaccinated HCWs described complying under duress, challenging the assumption that uptake signals endorsement. The most salient theme was that of moral injury - defined as the distress caused by acting against ones conscience, witnessing perceived harm, or remaining silent under institutional pressure. In contrast, positive responses emphasized professional duty and public safety, often rejecting the legitimacy of dissenting perspectives.

Our findings underscore the deeply polarizing nature of vaccination mandates and complicate dominant narratives that equate compliance with consent. Further, in contrast to clinical conceptions rooted in combat or bedside trauma, our analysis situates moral injury in the structural conditions created by public health policies, offering a lens for assessing their implications for the wellbeing of HCWs, quality care, and ethical healthcare practice and policy. We conclude that future public health policies, especially those justified under claims of emergency, must include built-in safeguards for ethical integrity and democratic participation.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1751234969790
