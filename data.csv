Processing pipelines commonly used to achieve this mapping produce meshes with uneven vertex spacing, with closer neighbours in sulci compared to gyri. Consequently, correlations between the fMRI time series of neighbouring sulcal vertices are stronger than expected. However, the causes, extent, and impacts of this bias are not well understood or widely appreciated. We explain the origins of these biases, and using in-silico models of fMRI data, illustrate how they lead to spurious results. The bias leads to leakage of anatomical cortical folding information into fMRI time series. We show that many common analyses can be affected by this ""gyral bias"", including test-retest reliability, fingerprinting, functional parcellations, regional homogeneity, and brain-behaviour associations. Finally, we provide recommendations to avoid or remedy this spatial bias.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720030

Using smLiveFISH, we tracked individual endogenous NOTCH2 and MAP1B mRNA transcripts in living cells and identified two distinct localization mechanisms: co-translational translocation of NOTCH2 mRNA at the endoplasmic reticulum, and directional transport of MAP1B mRNA toward the cell periphery. This method has the potential to unlock principles governing the spatiotemporal organization of native transcripts in health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720030

In addition to impacting poultry, these HPAI viruses caused mortality events in wild bird species and wild mammals. Transmission in multiple host species raises the concern for mammalian adaptation. On March 25, 2024, HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was confirmed in a dairy cow in Texas in response to a multi-state investigation into milk production losses. Over one hundred positive herds were rapidly identified in Texas and eleven other U.S. states. The case description included reduced feed intake and rumen motility in lactating cows, decreased milk production, and thick yellow milk. The diagnostic investigation revealed detections of viral RNA in milk and mammary tissue with alveolar epithelial degeneration and necrosis, and positive immunoreactivity of glandular epithelium by immunohistochemistry. A single transmission event, likely from avian species to dairy cattle, followed by limited local transmission preceded the onward lateral transmission of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13. We sought to experimentally reproduce infection with genotype B3.13 in Holstein yearling heifers and lactating cows. The heifers were inoculated by an aerosol respiratory route and the cows by an intramammary route. Clinical disease was mild in the heifers, but infection was confirmed by virus detection, lesions, and seroconversion. Clinical disease in lactating cows included decreased rumen motility, changes to milk appearance, and production losses consistent with field reports of viral mastitis. Infection was confirmed by high levels of viral RNA detected in milk, virus isolation, lesions in mammary tissue, and seroconversion. This study provides the foundation to investigate additional routes of infection, transmission, and intervention strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720030

Traditionally, it relies on small molecules that induce proximity between a target protein and an E3 ubiquitin ligase to prompt target ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Sporadic reports indicated that ligands designed to inhibit a target can also induce its destabilization. Among others, this has repeatedly been observed for kinase inhibitors. However, we lack an understanding of frequency, generalizability, and mechanistic underpinnings of these phenomena. To address this knowledge gap, we established dynamic abundance profiles of 98 kinases after cellular perturbations with 1570 kinase inhibitors, revealing 160 selective instances of inhibitor-induced kinase destabilization. Kinases prone to degradation are frequently annotated as HSP90 clients, thus affirming chaperone deprivation as an important route of destabilization. However, detailed investigation of inhibitor-induced degradation of LYN, BLK and RIPK2 revealed a differentiated, common mechanistic logic where inhibitors function by inducing a kinase state that is more efficiently cleared by endogenous degradation mechanisms. Mechanistically, effects can manifest by ligand-induced changes in cellular activity, localization, or multimerization and can be prompted by direct target engagement or network effects. In sum, our data indicates that inhibitor-induced kinase degradation is a frequent event and positions supercharging of endogenous degradation circuits as an alternative to classical proximity-inducing degraders.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720030

However, how exactly the PT invades the receptive synergid is unknown as the spatial relationship between these two cells is unclear. To better understand this process we performed 3D live imaging of PT reception in Arabidopsis thaliana. Upon arrival at the filiform apparatus (FA), a region rich in membrane folds at the micropylar pole of the synergids, the PT gradually deforms the FA before it rapidly grows into the receptive synergid. Upon penetration, the membrane of the receptive synergid invaginates and envelopes the PT. We termed this newly discovered structure the peri-tubular membrane (PRM). We show that, in feronia mutants disrupting PT reception, the PT still enters the receptive synergid, forming a normal PRM. This results in extensive invagination of the synergid membrane without sperm release. We show that PRM formation is associated with a cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) spike of high amplitude in the PT and flooding of [Ca2+]cyt in the synergids. In PTs lacking AUTOINHIBITED Ca2+ ATPASE9 activity, PTs have lower amplitude [Ca2+]cyt spiking and the PTs frequently fail to penetrate the synergid. Our findings suggest that synergid penetration and the non-cell autonomous control of PT rupture are distinct regulated processes required for fertilization in flowering plants.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720030

Much less is known about the evolutionary processes that shape the relationship between these two levels of gene expression. To disentangle the contributions of mutational and selective processes, we derive a novel phylogenetic model and fit it to multi-species data from mammalian skin tissue. We find that over macroevolutionary time: 1) there has been strong stabilizing selection on protein abundances; 2) mutations impacting mRNA abundances have minimal influence on protein abundances; 3) mRNA abundances are under selection to track protein abundances, and 4) mRNA abundances adapt more quickly than protein abundances due to increased mutational opportunity. We find additional support for these findings by comparing gene-specific parameter estimates from our model to human functional genomic data. More broadly, our new phylogenetic approach provides a foundation for testing hypotheses about the processes that led to divergence in gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720030

Non-adhering cells do not display tension gradients. We further show that branched actin increases tension, while membrane-to-cortex attachments facilitate its propagation. Tension is the lowest at the edge of adhesion sites and highest at protrusions, setting the boundaries of the tension gradients.

At the heart of gene regulation are promoters, yet their regulatory logic is still incompletely understood. Here, we report PARM, a cell-type specific deep learning model trained on specially designed massively parallel reporter assays that query human promoter sequences. PARM requires ~1,000 times less computational power than state-of-the-art technology, and reliably predicts autonomous promoter activity throughout the genome from DNA sequence alone, in multiple cell types. PARM can even design purely synthetic strong promoters. We leveraged PARM to systematically identify binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) that are likely to contribute to the activity of each natural human promoter. We uncovered and experimentally confirmed striking positional preferences of TFs that differ between activating and repressive regulatory functions, as well as a complex grammar of motif-motif interactions. For example, many, but not all, TFs act as repressors when their binding motif is located near or just downstream of the transcription start site. Our approach lays the foundation towards a deep understanding of the regulation of human promoters by TFs.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720030

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1721167720031

We can generalize by ignoring task-irrelevant features, report different features of a stimulus, and use different actions to report a perceptual judgment. These forms of flexible behavior are associated with small modulations of the responses of sensory neurons. While the existence of these response modulations is indisputable, efforts to understand their function have been largely relegated to theory, where they have been posited to change information coding or enable downstream neurons to read out different visual and cognitive information using flexible weights. Here, we tested these ideas using a rich, flexible behavioral paradigm, multi-neuron, multi-area recordings in primary visual cortex (V1) and mid-level visual area V4. We discovered that those response modulations in V4 (but not V1) contain the ingredients necessary to enable flexible behavior, but not via those previously hypothesized mechanisms. Instead, we demonstrated that these response modulations are precisely coordinated across the population such that downstream neurons have ready access to the correct information to flexibly guide behavior without making changes to information coding or synapses. Our results suggest a novel computational role for task-dependent response modulations: they enable flexible behavior by changing the information that gets out of a sensory area, not by changing information coding within it.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Fusion is mediated by the binding of the viral Spike protein to its receptor ACE2. Lipid rafts are dynamic nanodomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Rafts can act as platforms for entry of different viruses by localizing virus receptors, and attachment factors to the same membrane microdomains. Here, we first demonstrate that cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin inhibits Spike mediated fusion and entry. To further study the role of ACE2 lipid raft localization in SARS-CoV-2 fusion and entry, we design a GPI-anchored ACE2 construct. Both ACE2 and ACE2-GPI proteins are similarly expressed at the plasma membrane. Through membrane flotation assays, we show that in different cell lines, ACE2-GPI localises predominantly to raft domains of the plasma membrane while ACE2 is non-raft associated. We then compare the ability of ACE2 and ACE2-GPI to permit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry and syncytia formation and replication of different viral variants. We find little difference in the two proteins. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 entry and fusion are a cholesterol dependent and raft-independent process.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Contrary to this, we show that both regions appear to be indistinguishable in their encoding/decoding of accumulator value and communicate this information bidirectionally. Consistent with a role for FOF in accumulation, silencing FOF to ADS projections impacted behavior throughout the accumulation period, even while nonselective FOF silencing did not. We synthesize these findings into a multi-region recurrent neural network trained with a novel approach. In-silico experiments reveal that multiple scales of recurrence in the cortico-striatal circuit rescue computation upon nonselective FOF perturbations. These results suggest that ADS and FOF accumulate evidence in a recurrent and distributed manner, yielding redundant representations and robustness to certain perturbations.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry. Absolute risks of incident post-acute COVID-19 sequelae were reported. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by contrasting COVID-19-positive with COVID-19-negative groups using a Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through propensity scoring stratification.

ResultsA total of 1,213,322 individuals under 21 years old (mean[SD] age, 7.75[6.11] years; 623,806 male [51.4%]) were included. The absolute rate of any post-acute cardiovascular outcome in this study was 2.32% in COVID-19 positive and 1.38% in negative groups. Patients with CHD post-SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks of any cardiovascular outcome (RR, 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-1.80), including increased risks of 11 of 18 post-acute sequelae in hypertension, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias), myocarditis, other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest), thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain and palpitations). Those without CHDs also experienced heightened cardiovascular risks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57-1.69), covering 14 of 18 conditions in hypertension, arrhythmias (ventricular arrhythmias and premature atrial or ventricular contractions), inflammatory heart disease (pericarditis and myocarditis), other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock), thrombotic disorders (pulmonary embolism and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and syncope).

ConclusionsBoth children with and without CHDs showed increased risks for a variety of cardiovascular outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the need for targeted monitoring and management in the post-acute phase.

Clinical Perspective sectionO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIWe investigated the risks of 18 post-acute COVID-19 cardiovascular outcomes in the pediatric population without Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in over 1 million patients, stratified by congenital heart defects (CHD) status.
C_LIO_LIWe extended the follow-up period beyond previous pediatric studies, ensuring every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry.
C_LIO_LIWe included a comprehensive cross-section of the US pediatric population across various healthcare settings including primary, specialty, and emergency care, as well as testing and inpatient facilities.
C_LI

What are the clinical implications?O_LIWithin the post-acute phase, children and adolescents previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at statistically significant increased risk of incident cardiovascular outcomes, including hypertension, ventricular arrhythmias, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, thromboembolism, chest pain, and palpitations. These findings are consistent among patients with and without CHDs.
C_LIO_LIAwareness of the heightened risk of cardiovascular disorders after COVID-19 can lead to a timely referral, investigations, and management of these conditions in children and adolescents.

Five large structural variants on three chromosomes exist as standing genetic variation within the native range, and exhibit strong signatures of parallel climate-associated adaptation across continents. Common gardens in the native and introduced ranges demonstrate that three structural variants exhibit patterns of selection consistent with local adaptation across each range. Our results provide strong evidence that rapid and parallel adaptation during invasion is caused by large-effect structural variants introduced throughout the world.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

They can learn to vocalize on command and the activity of single neurons from the crows associative telencephalic structure nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) is correlated with the execution of this vocal and many non-vocal skilled behaviors. However, it remains unknown if specific anatomical adaptations that directly link the crow NCL to any of the nuclei of the crows ""song system"" exist. To address this issue, we used fluorescent tracers along with histological staining methods (Nissl-, myelin-, and anti tyrosine hydroxylase) to characterize the connectivity of the crows NCL in relation to its song system nuclei. We found that the NCL sends dense projections into the dorsal intermediate arcopallium (AID) directly adjacent to and engulfing the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), which is the telencephalic motor output of the song system. Similarly, we demonstrate dense NCL projections into the striatum surrounding the basal ganglia song nucleus ""area X"". Both of these descending projections mirror the projections of the nidopallial song nucleus HVC (proper name) into RA and area X, with extremely sparse NCL fibers extending into area X. Furthermore, we characterized the distribution of cells projecting from the lateral part of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (MAN) to NCL. Notably, a separate medial population of MAN cells projects to HVC. These two sets of connections--MAN to NCL and MAN to HVC--run in parallel but do not overlap. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that the NCL is part of a ""general motor system"" that parallels the song system but exhibits only minimal monosynaptic interconnections with it.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Typical MINFLUX microscopes localize the target molecule by scanning a zero-intensity focus around the molecule in a circular trajectory, with smaller trajectory diameters yielding lower localization uncertainties for a given number of photons. Since this approach requires the molecule to be within the scanned trajectory, MINFLUX typically relies on a photon-demanding iterative scheme with decreasing trajectory diameters. Although the iterative procedure does not substantially reduce the photon efficiency of MINFLUX, this approach is prone to misplacements of the trajectory and increases the systems complexity. In this work, we introduce ISM-FLUX, a novel implementation of MINFLUX using image-scanning microscopy (ISM) with a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array detector. ISM-FLUX provides precise MINFLUX localization within the trajectory while maintaining conventional photon-limited uncertainty outside it. The robustness of ISM-FLUX localization results in a larger localization range and greatly simplifies the architecture, which may facilitate broader adoption of MIN-FLUX.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Existing RNA sequencing methods have significant limitations: short-read (SR) sequencing provides high depth but struggles with isoform deconvolution, whereas long-read (LR) sequencing offers isoform resolution at the cost of lower depth, higher noise, and technical biases. Addressing this gap, we introduce Multi-Platform Aggregation and Quantification of Transcripts (MPAQT), a generative model that combines the complementary strengths of different sequencing platforms to achieve state-of-the-art isoform-resolved transcript quantification, as demonstrated by extensive simulations and experimental benchmarks. By applying MPAQT to an in vitro model of human embryonic stem cell differentiation into cortical neurons, followed by machine learning-based modeling of transcript abundances, we show that untranslated regions (UTRs) are major determinants of isoform proportion and exon usage; this effect is mediated through isoform-specific sequence features embedded in UTRs, which likely interact with RNA-binding proteins that modulate mRNA stability. These findings highlight MPAQT's potential to enhance our understanding of transcriptomic complexity and underline the role of splicing-independent post-transcriptional mechanisms in shaping the isoform and exon usage landscape of the cell.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

However, previous studies examining the mode in which species diversified, how diversification rates varied, and how ecological specialization affected these processes have found few different results across different taxa and geographic and ecological systems, showing how complex this process is. To gain a more complete picture of how species evolve, additional model systems that encompass alternative ecological requirements are needed. Here, we present the results of a study aimed to unravel the diversification mode and evolutionary drivers of the spider genus Dysdera, the red devil spiders, endemic to the Canary Islands. These species exhibit remarkable phenotypic variability in their mouthparts, which has been related to different levels of specialization in the predation of isopods. We explored patterns of linage diversification and assessed the role of trophic specialization as a driver of species diversification. Additionally, we used climatic variables, occurrence data and morphological information to unravel the underlying mode of speciation by means of joint species distribution models and age-range correlation methods. Our results reveal that red devil spiders underwent an early burst of diversification, followed by a slowdown of diversification rates, which is a hallmark of adaptive radiation. We also found evidence that the trophic morphology shaped diversification, with specialist species exhibiting higher rates of diversification. Finally, our analyses suggest that speciation occurred mostly in allopatry, with subsequent secondary sympatry following range expansion.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

This study aimed to examine FSH receptor (FSHR) expression in human pancreatic islets and the direct effects of FSH on insulin secretion, as well as explore FSHs metabolic role during puberty, focusing on enhanced insulin secretion during this critical period. FSHR gene and protein expression were detected in isolated human pancreatic islets and co-localized with insulin-producing beta-cells. Additionally, FSH at prepubertal (0.1 IU/L) and pubertal concentrations (10 IU/L) significantly enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and increased intracellular cAMP concentrations in intact human pancreatic islets. In children with obesity from the Beta-JUDO cohort (n=608), plasma FSH levels were positively associated with several insulin secretion indices, particularly in pubertal children. These findings suggest that FSH has significant metabolic roles beyond reproduction, involving insulin secretion and potentially contributing to puberty-related hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

As bacterial chromosomes are heavily supercoiled due to the continuous action of RNA polymerases, gyrases, and nucleoid-associated proteins, it is important to study the impact of DNA supercoiling on the ParB-DNA partition complex formation. Here, we use an in vitro single- molecule assay to visualize ParB on supercoiled DNA. Unlike most DNA-binding proteins, individual ParB proteins are found to not pin plectonemes on supercoiled DNA, but freely diffuse along supercoiled DNA. We find that DNA supercoiling enhances ParB-DNA condensation which initiates at lower ParB concentrations than on DNA that is torsionally relaxed. ParB proteins induce a DNA- protein condensate that strikingly absorbs all supercoiling writhe.

Here, we demonstrate a technique called 3D micropatterned traction force microscopy (3D-TFM) to confine cells in three-dimensional wells of defined shape, while simultaneously measuring the forces transmitted between cells and their microenvironment.

With 3D-TFM, we show that MCF10A breast epithelial cells exert defined, reproducible patterns of forces on their microenvironment, which can be both contractile and extensile. We further show that cells switch from a global contractile to extensile behaviour as their volume is reduced. Our technique enables the quantitative study of cell mechanobiology with full access to 3D cellular forces while having accurate control over cell morphology and the mechanical conditions of the microenvironment.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

They impose a huge health burden on human populations spreading parasites as disparate as protozoans (malaria), viruses (yellow fever and more), and nematodes (filariasis), which cause life-threatening conditions. In recent years, mating has been proposed as a putative target for population control. Mosquitoes mate mid-air in swarms initiated by males and triggered by a combination of internal and external stimuli. As the number of females in a swarm is limited, there is intense competition among males. Indeed, males  retune their physiology for this demanding behaviour but the underlying genetic changes are largely unknown. Interestingly, recent evidence indicates that the upregulation of circadian clock genes may be involved in the swarming of malaria mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. Here, we use whole-head RNA-seq to identify gene expression changes in Aedes aegypti males who are engaged in swarming in a laboratory setting. Our results suggest that swarming males tend to lower some housekeeping functions while increasing the remodelling of the cytoskeleton and neuronal connectivity; the transcription of circadian clock genes is unaffected.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Notably, certain choanoflagellate species can engage in facultative multicellular development resembling the early stages of embryogenesis. In the past few years, Salpingoeca rosetta has emerged as a tractable model for choanoflagellate cell biology and multicellular development, notably through mutant screens and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout (KO). However, existing KO pipelines have variable and sometimes low efficiency, frequently requiring isolation and genotyping of hundreds of clones without guarantee to obtain a KO strain. Here, we present a robust method for gene inactivation in S. rosetta that relies on insertion by CRISPR/Cas9 of a single 1.9 kb cassette encoding both a premature termination sequence and an antibiotic resistance gene. We show that this approach allows robust, fast and efficient isolation of KO clones after antibiotic selection. As a proof of principle, we first knocked out all three genes previously proposed to regulate S. rosetta multicellular development in a published mutant screen (rosetteless, couscous and jumble), and confirmed all three KOs abolished multicellular development. Whole genome sequencing revealed a unique specific insertion of the termination/resistance cassette in KO strains. To showcase the potential of this method for de novo characterization of candidate developmental genes, we then inactivated three genes encoding homologs of components of the Hippo pathway, which controls cell proliferation and multicellular size in animals: hippo, warts and yorkie. Interestingly, warts KO rosettes were consistently about twice larger than their wild-type counterparts, indicating that our KO pipeline has the potential to rapidly reveal novel loss-of-function phenotypes of biological interest. We propose that this method has the potential to accelerate choanoflagellate functional genetics.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Here we describe the rational conceptual design and test-case practical implementation of a photopharmacological paradigm to empower high-performance photomodulation studies in vivo. TRPC4/5 ion channels are involved in many spatiotemporally resolved circuits, from pain and anxiety, to reproductive signaling, digestion, and obesity. To unpick their biology requires spatiotemporally precise tools, which were lacking. We developed ""ideal efficacy photoswitch"" ligands to control their diverse functions in situ. These E{leftrightarrows}Z-photoswitchable ligands bias TRPC[4]/5 channel activity with exquisite photocontrol, from strong agonism under 360 nm, to low agonism at 385 nm, to strong antagonism at 410-460 nm. Cryo-EM structures of both TRPC4 and TRPC5 with both Z-agonists and E-antagonists support the rationale for efficacy switching through competitive E/Z isomer binding. Crucially, since the E/Z ratio is exclusively determined by the light wavelength applied, their channel photocontrol is exclusively wavelength-dependent, yet drug-concentration-independent: so is reproducible from cell culture to >millimetre-depth tissues. Indeed, we were able to photocontrol both direct and downstream TRPC4/5 biology in cell lines or primary cells in culture, from calcium flux, to primary neuron excitability and adrenaline release; and even in tissues, photoswitching small intestine motility and peristalsis. The TRPC4/5 ligands we develop will thus unlock a range of high-precision investigations in TRP biology. More broadly, we propose that the success of this efficacy photoswitch program, from concept to tissue level translation, is mainly a consequence of how biology has evolved proteins for efficacy control. We therefore foresee that a variety of functionally responsive protein targets, not only sensory and signaling ion channels and receptors, will be amenable to similarly high-performance photocontrol even in vivo, if a new generation of reagent development adopts this paradigm of ideal efficacy photoswitching.

Studies of how Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (S.Tm) bacteria enter transformed cell lines have shaped the paradigm for swift type-three-secretion-system-1 (TTSS-1)-driven IEC invasion, fueled by expansive membrane ruffles. However, comparative studies suggest that non-transformed IECs in the intact gut context comprise a much more challenging target for the attack. The molecular and cellular features that explain these discrepancies remain undefined. By live-cell imaging in human enteroid-and colonoid-derived IEC layers, we demonstrate that the maturation state of gut epithelia dramatically impacts permissiveness to S.Tm invasion. IEC layers kept under immature progenitor-cell-promoting conditions are permissive to the bacterial invasion, whereas maturation towards an enterocyte/colonocyte fate reduces the frequency of S.Tm-induced epithelial entry structures, and lowers the invasion efficiency by up to tenfold. This phenotypic shift during IEC maturation couples to an altered expression of actin regulatory proteins implicated in the invasion process, and an increased dependence on the S.Tm TTSS-1 effector SipA for successful entry. In addition, IEC maturation involves upregulation of cell surface mucins, e.g. MUC13, and shifts in glycocalyx composition, as revealed by multiple lectin stainings. Enzymatic treatment of the apical surface with the StcE mucinase converts maturing IEC layers back to the S.Tm-invasion-permissive state of their immature counterparts. Taken together, these results showcase how the maturation state of human IECs dictates the susceptibility to invasion by a prototype enterobacterium.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

However, freezer malfunctions can jeopardize data integrity. In this study, we investigated the effects of an unforeseen short-term thaw event (~1 week) resulting from a freezer malfunction on soil samples stored at -80{o}C and extracted uncompromised DNA stored long-term at -20{o}C. We compared these samples against previously sequenced Illumina MiSeq data to assess whether the process of thawing soil or multi-year extracted DNA storage affected the resilience of bacterial or fungal richness or community composition, thereby impacting our ability to accurately determine treatment effects. Our results reveal substantial resilience in fungal richness and both bacterial and fungal beta-diversity to soil sample thawing and extended frozen DNA storage. This resilience facilitated biological inferences that closely mirrored those observed in the original study. Notably, fungi exhibited greater resilience to short-term thawing compared to bacteria, which showed sensitivity to both thawing and long-term freezing. Moreover, taxonomic composition analysis revealed the persistence of dominant microbial taxa under thawing and prolonged freezing, suggesting that dominant microbes remain viable for tracking across temporal studies. In conclusion, our study highlights that beta-diversity is more robust than alpha-diversity and fungi are more resilient than bacteria. Furthermore, our findings underscore the effectiveness of soil storage at -80{o}C compared to storage of extracted DNA at -20{o}C, despite potential freezer failures, as the most robust method for long-term storage in microbiome studies.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

This study aimed to investigate if novel FD-derived bacterial isolates elicited immune responses in FD and the capacity of an immune-stimulating isolate, AGIRA0003 to breach the duodenal epithelial barrier. Methods: Bacterial lysates were investigated for immune reactivity using immunoblotting of patient plasma. Immunoblots were probed with plasma from FD patients (n=44, 46.6{+/-}17.5 years, 79.6% female) or controls (n=30, 48.9{+/-}15.7 years, 63.3% female). Peripheral gut-homing T cells were quantified by flow cytometry and histological analysis used to investigate duodenal biopsies. Polarised Caco-2 cells and FD duodenal spheroids (n=4 lines) were exposed to Streptococcus salivarius AGIRA0003 at a multiplicity of infection of 10 bacterial cells to 1 mammalian cell for 6 hours. Results: The presence of plasma IgG antibodies against S. salivarius AGIRA0003 was significantly associated with FD ({chi}2 15.7, 1, p<0.0001).

Mitochondrial dysfunction is widely considered a key contributing mechanism to muscle aging.

To disentangle aging from physical activity-related mitochondrial adaptations, we functionally profiled skeletal muscle mitochondria in 51 inactive and 88 active men aged 20-93. Physical activity status conferred partial protection against age-related decline in physical performance. A trend for reduced muscle mitochondrial respiration with aging was observed in inactive but not in active participants, indicating that aging per se does not alter mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was unaffected by aging and active participants displayed higher ROS production. In contrast, mitochondrial calcium retention capacity decreased with aging regardless of physical activity status and correlated with muscle mass, performance and the stress-responsive metabokine GDF15. Targeting mitochondrial calcium handling may hold promise for treating aging-related muscle impairments.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Generative models designed to address data scarcity often face similar limitations due to their reliance on pre-training, inadvertently perpetuating a cycle of data inadequacy.

Even with broad-scale efforts to characterize the effects of molecular perturbations and interpret gene coexpression, it remains challenging to infer the architecture of gene regulation in a precise and efficient manner. Key properties of GRNs, like hierarchical structure, modular organization, and sparsity, provide both challenges and opportunities for this objective. Here, we seek to better understand properties of GRNs using a new approach to simulate their structure and model their function. We produce realistic network structures with a novel generating algorithm based on insights from small-world network theory, and we model gene expression regulation using stochastic differential equations formulated to accommodate modeling molecular perturbations. With these tools, we systematically describe the effects of gene knockouts within and across GRNs, finding a subset of networks that recapitulate features of a recent genome-scale perturbation study. With deeper analysis of these exemplar networks, we consider future avenues to map the architecture of gene expression regulation using data from cells in perturbed and unperturbed states, finding that while perturbation data are critical to discover specific regulatory interactions, data from unperturbed cells may be sufficient to reveal regulatory programs.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Curiously, most colorectal tumours carry biallelic mutations that result in only partial loss of APC function, suggesting that a  just-right level of APC inactivation, and hence Wnt signalling, provides the optimal conditions for tumorigenesis. Mutational processes act variably across the APC gene, which could contribute to the bias against complete APC inactivation. Thus the selective consequences of partial APC loss are unclear. Here we propose a mathematical model to quantify the tumorigenic effect of biallelic APC genotypes, controlling for somatic mutational processes. Analysing sequence data from >2500 colorectal cancers, we find that APC genotypes resulting in partial protein function confer about 50 times higher probability of progressing to cancer compared to complete APC inactivation. The optimal inactivation level varies with anatomical location and additional mutations of Wnt pathway regulators. We use this context dependency to assess the regulatory effect of secondary Wnt drivers in combination with APC in vivo, and provide evidence that mutant AMER1 combines with APC genotypes that lead to relatively low Wnt. The fitness landscape of APC inactivation is consistent across microsatellite unstable and POLE-deficient colorectal cancers and tumours in patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, suggesting a general  just-right optimum, and pointing to Wnt hyperactivation as a potential cancer vulnerability.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Serial sarcomere number (SSN) influences muscle mechanical function including the force length and force-velocity-power relationships, and the age-related loss of SSN contributes to declining performance. Resistance training biased to active lengthening (eccentric) contractions increases SSN in young muscle, however, we showed maximal eccentric training in old rats did not alter SSN and further worsened performance. A submaximal eccentric training stimulus may be more conducive to adaptation for aged muscle. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess whether submaximal eccentric training can increase SSN and improve mechanical function in old rats. Twelve 32-month-old male F344/BN rats completed 4 weeks of submaximal (60% maximum) isokinetic eccentric plantar-flexion training 3 days/week. Pre- and post training, we assessed in-vivo maximum isometric torque at a stretched and neutral ankle angle, the passive torque-angle relationship, and the isotonic torque-angular velocity-power relationship. The soleus and MG were harvested for SSN measurements via laser diffraction, with the untrained leg as a control. SSN increased 11% and 8%, and muscle wet weight increased 14% and 13% in the soleus and MG, respectively.

The veins and the cells that surround them are derived from the middle ground meristem (mGM) through processes that are as yet undefined. Here we distinguished the active zone of vascular development within early leaf primordia, and used comparative transcriptomics of sub-sectioned maize and rice primordia to identify cohorts of genes likely involved in early Kranz development. Leveraging single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) we then explored the cell heterogeneity and developmental trajectories within single maize leaf primordia. Assisted by in situ hybridization, cell clusters of mGM and procambium were identified, with candidate marker genes showing different yet inter-related expression patterns. Localization of the vascular marker ZmSHR1 was preceded by that of ZmEREB161 and ZmEREB114 in terms of procambium initiation. Potential subclusters of bundle sheath cells and different layer of mesophyll cells were depicted from developing cells toward the tip of sub-sectioned maize primordia.

Knockout (KO) alleles for 9 HD GWAS modifiers/MMR genes were crossed to the Q140 Huntingtin (mHtt) knock-in mice to probe such mechanisms. Four KO mice strongly (Msh3 and Pms1) or moderately (Msh2 and Mlh1) rescue a triad of adult-onset, striatal medium-spiny-neuron (MSN)-selective phenotypes: somatic Htt DNA CAG-repeat expansion, transcriptionopathy, and mHtt protein aggregation. Comparatively, Q140 cortex also exhibits an analogous, but later-onset, pathogenic triad that is Msh3-dependent. Remarkably, Q140/homozygous Msh3-KO lacks mHtt aggregates in the brain, even at advanced ages (20-months). Moreover, Msh3-deficiency prevents striatal synaptic marker loss, astrogliosis, and locomotor impairment in HD mice. Purified Q140 MSN nuclei exhibit highly linear age-dependent mHtt DNA repeat expansion (i.e. repeat migration), with modal-CAG increasing at +8.8 repeats/month (R2=0.98). This linear rate is reduced to 2.3 and 0.3 repeats/month in Q140 with Msh3 heterozygous and homozygous alleles, respectively. Our study defines somatic Htt CAG-repeat thresholds below which there are no mHtt nuclear (at 150-CAG) or neuropil aggregates (at 192-CAG). Mild transcriptionopathy can still occur in Q140 mice with stabilized Htt 140-CAG repeats, but the majority of transcriptomic changes are due to somatic repeat expansion. Our analysis reveals 479 genes with expression levels highly correlated with modal-CAG length in MSNs. Thus, our study mechanistically connects HD GWAS genes to selective neuronal vulnerability in HD, in which Msh3 and Pms1 set the linear rate of neuronal mHtt CAG-repeat migration to drive repeat-length dependent pathogenesis; and provides a preclinical platform for targeting these genes for HD suppression across brain regions.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Some photosynthetic cyanobacteria can acclimate to growth in longer wavelength light by replacing five chlorophylls for long wavelength pigments in specific locations, including one in the reaction center (RC). However, the exact location and the nature of this long wavelength pigment still remain uncertain. Here we have addressed the color-tuning mechanism of the farred light PSII (FRL-PSII) by excited state calculations at both the ab initio correlated (ADC2) and linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) levels in combination with large-scale hybrid quantum/classical (QM/MM) simulations and atomistic molecular dynamics. We show that substitution of a single chlorophyll pigment (ChlD1) at the RC by chlorophyll d leads to a spectral shift beyond the far-red light limit, as a result of the protein electrostatic, polarization and electronic coupling effects that reproduce key structural and spectroscopic observations. Pigment substitution at the ChlD1 site further results in a low site energy within the RC that could function as a sink for the excitation energy and initiate the primary charge separation reaction, driving the water oxidation. Our findings provide a basis for understanding color-tuning mechanisms and bioenergetic principles of oxygenic photosynthesis at the far-red light limit.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

We found that the FDA-approved BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is a potent and rapid inducer of p16High immune subsets both in mice and humans. In turn, p16High immune cells were indispensable for counteracting different lethal conditions, including LPS-induced sepsis, acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and ionizing irradiation.

Furthermore, containing these signals within a beneficial range by deleting MDA5 that appeared sufficient to maintain a low activity of STING, induces p16High immune cells and delays organ deterioration upon aging with improved healthspan.

While all immature and mature human NK cells co-express SYK and ZAP70, clonally driven memory or adaptive NK cells can methylate SYK genes and signaling is mediated exclusively using ZAP70. Here, we examined the role of SYK and ZAP70 in a clonal human NK cell line KHYG1 by CRISPR-based deletion using a combination of experiments and mechanistic computational modeling. Elimination of SYK resulted in more robust Ca++ influx after cross-linking of the CD16 and NKp30 receptors and enhanced phosphorylation of downstream proteins, whereas ZAP70 deletion diminished these responses. By contrast, ZAP70 depletion increased proliferation of the NK cells. As immature T cells express both SYK and ZAP70 but mature T cells often express only ZAP70, we transduced the human Jurkat cell line with SYK and found that expression of SYK increased proliferation but diminished TCR-induced Ca2+ flux and activation. We performed transcriptional analysis of the matched sets of variant Jurkat and KHYG1 cells and observed profound alterations caused by SYK expression. As depletion of SYK in NK cells increased their activation, primary human NK cells were transduced with a CD19-targeting CAR and were CRISPR edited to ablate SYK or ZAP70. Deletion of SYK resulted in more robust cytotoxic activity and cytokine production, providing a new therapeutic strategy of NK cell engineering for cancer immunotherapy.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Mimicking bursts of IS copies in host-restricted endosymbionts and pathogens, we evolved the bacteria under relaxed neutral conditions. Within ten weeks, we observed a median of 24.5 IS insertions per genome, comparable to a decade of wild-type evolution. Long-read sequencing revealed extensive IS-mediated genome rearrangements, resulting in novel IS variants and genome size changes exceeding {+/-}5%. By achieving such drastic genome evolution under relaxed selection, our study establishes a baseline for assessing the fitness effects of IS insertions, genome size changes, and rearrangements.

The precise origins of such insights are unknown. Some evidence has shown that sleep facilitates insights, while other work has not found such a relationship. One recent suggestion that could explain this mixed evidence is that different sleep stages have differential effects on insight. In addition, computational work has suggested that neural variability and regularisation play a role in increasing the likelihood of insight. To investigate the link between insight and different sleep stages as well as regularisation, we conducted a preregistered study in which N=90 participants performed a perceptual insight task before and after a 20 minute daytime. Sleep EEG data showed that N2 sleep, but not N1 sleep, increases the likelihood of insight after a nap, suggesting a specific role of deeper sleep. Exploratory analyses of EEG power spectra showed that spectral slopes could predict insight beyond sleep stages, which is broadly in line with theoretical suggestions of a link between insight and regularisation. In combination, our findings point towards a role of N2 sleep and aperiodic, but not oscillatory, neural activity for insight.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Here, we demonstrate that long- read chromatin fiber sequencing (Fiber-seq) permits the comprehensive annotation of the regulatory potential of maize TEs. We uncover that only 94 LTR retrotransposons contain the functional epigenetic architecture required for mobilization within maize leaves. This epigenetic architecture degenerates with evolutionary age, resulting in solo TE enhancers being preferentially marked by simultaneous hyper-CpG methylation and chromatin accessibility, an architecture markedly divergent from canonical enhancers. We find that TEs shape maize gene regulation by creating novel promoters within the TE itself as well as through TE-mediated gene amplification. Lastly, we uncover a pervasive epigenetic code directing TEs to specific loci, including that locus that sparked McClintocks discovery of TEs.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

In this study, we explored these interactions using a delayed match-to-sample task, where participants (6 Male, 16 Female) encountered the same target object across six consecutive trials, facilitating the transition from WM to LTM. During half of these target repetitions, the background color changed. We measured the WM storage of the target using the contralateral delay activity (CDA) in electroencephalography (EEG). Our results reveal that task-irrelevant context changes trigger the reactivation of long-term memories in WM. This reactivation may be attributed to content-context binding in WM and hippocampal pattern separation.

Significance StatementUnderstanding the mechanisms of memory updating in response to changing contexts is vital because context plays a pivotal role in shaping long-term memories. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that an irrelevant context change triggers the reactivation of learned memories in visual working memory. This observation underscores the importance of multi-memory interactions during context updating. Challenging traditional memory models that postulate mandatory reactivation of long-term memories upon each use, our results instead reveal a selective reactivation process, especially during transitions to new environments. This finding elucidates the adaptive nature of memories and enhances our understanding of memory storage and retrieval processes.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Here, we report the discovery of a novel pathway in aminosugar metabolism that governs GlcNAc sensing. GlcNAc-6P is converted into a toxic metabolite via two new enzyme functions, namely dehydration of N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate by NagS to form 6P-Chromogen I, a reaction that has not yet been described in the textbooks, and its subsequent deacetylation by NagA producing a cytotoxic structural analogue of ribose. The latter reveals an unexpected promiscuous activity for GlcNAc-6P deacetylase NagA.

However, some trypanosome lineages have simplified their lifecycle by escaping dependence on tsetse allowing an expanded geographical range, with direct transmission between hosts achieved via biting flies and vampire bats (Trypanosoma brucei evansi, causing the disease  surra) or through sexual transmission (Trypanosoma brucei equiperdum, causing  dourine). Concomitantly, stumpy formation is reduced or lost, and the isolates are described as monomorphic, with infections spread widely in Africa, Asia, South America and parts of Europe. Here, using genomic analysis of distinct field isolates, we identified and functionally confirmed molecular changes that accompany the loss of the stumpy transmission stage in monomorphic clades. Further, using laboratory selection for resistance to the parasites quorum-sensing signal, we identified reversible steps in the initial development of monomorphism. This study identifies a trajectory of events that simplify the life cycle in emergent and established monomorphic trypanosomes, with impact on disease spread, vector control strategies, geographical range and virulence.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Although biochemical and cellular assays provide valuable insights on functional characterization, they offer limited understanding on molecular details of selectivity, particularly for targets within large families of structurally and functionally similar proteins. In such situations, carefully designed computational studies can complement experimental approaches, bridging gaps and deepening our understanding of drug selectivity mechanisms. In this study, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations along with structural bioinformatics methods have been used to examine the selectivity of Siponimod, an FDA-approved drug, towards sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) to treat Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Specifically, we investigated why Siponimod activates S1PR1 but not S1PR2, even though both receptors belong to the same sub-family of G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). Contrary to the previous hypothesis based on molecular docking, MD simulations showed that Siponimod can bind to S1PR2 with an in silico-determined affinity comparable to that of S1PR1. Comparing the dynamics of Siponimod-bound S1PR2 with S1P-bound S1PR2 revealed that the transmission switches necessary for downstream biological activity are activated by S1P but not by Siponimod. Whereas, both S1P and Siponimod activate those transmission switches in S1PR1.

As organisms age, the ability of neurons to maintain their axons declines; hence aged axons are more susceptible to damage or dysfunction. Understanding what causes axonal vulnerability is crucial for developing strategies to enhance overall resilience of neurons, and to prevent their deterioration during ageing or in age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes oxidative stress, a hallmark of ageing and age-related diseases. Despite this association, a causal relationship between oxidative stress and neuronal ageing remains unclear, particularly how subcellular physiology is affected by ROS.

By using Drosophila-derived primary neuronal cultures and a recently developed in vivo neuronal model of ageing, which involves the visualisation of Drosophila medulla neurons, we investigated the interplay between oxidative stress, neuronal ageing and the microtubule cytoskeleton. We find that oxidative stress as a key driver of axonal and synaptic decay, including the appearance of axonal swellings, microtubule alterations in both axons and synapses and the morphological transformation of axonal terminals during ageing. We demonstrate that increased ROS sensitises the microtubule plus end binding factor, end-binding protein 1 (EB1), leading to microtubule defects, affecting neuronal integrity. Furthermore, manipulating EB1 proved to be a valuable therapeutic strategy to prevent ageing hallmarks observed in conditions of elevated ROS. In summary, we demonstrate a mechanistic pathway linking cellular oxidative stress, the microtubule cytoskeleton and axonal deterioration during ageing and provide evidence of the therapeutic potential of enhancing microtubule plus end physiology to improve the resilience of axons.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Here we find that the emergence of a nematic liquid crystal phase occurs in cells during gastrulation in the development of embryos of fish, frogs, and fruit flies. Moreover, the spatial correlations in all three organisms are long-ranged and follow a similar power-law decay (y~x^{-) with  less than unity for the nematic order parameter, suggesting a common underlying physical mechanism unifies events in these distantly related species. All three species exhibit similar propagation of the nematic phase, reminiscent of nucleation and growth phenomena. Finally, we use a theoretical model along with disruptions of cell adhesion and cell specification to characterize the minimal features required for formation of the nematic phase. Our results provide a framework for understanding a potentially universal features of metazoan embryogenesis and shed light on the advent of ordered structures during animal development.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Retinal vascular complexity obtained from retinal fundus photographs, and evaluated as fractal dimension (ie, Df), a measure of the geometric pattern of the retinal vasculature, has recently emerged as a valuable indicator of diseases and aging processes. The purpose of our study was to elucidate possible mechanisms underlying those relationships. By integrating retinal Dfwith genomic and plasma proteome biomarkers, we uncovered novel pathways involved in determining Df and its links with cardiometabolic diseases and longevity. First, we performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) of retinal vascular Df by meta-analysing signals from 74,434 participants from three large epidemiological cohorts, the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging (CLSA), the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland (GoDARTS), and the UK Biobank (UKBB). We replicated four known loci associated with Df, and identified one novel locus within or near DAAM1, as well as found seven suggestive associations within or near CSNK1A1L, MAST4, HIVEP1, LOC283038, FNDC3A, SP100, and SUGP1 genes. GWAS summary statistics confirmed a negative correlation between Df and cardiovascular disease, stroke, and inflammation, but a positive correlation with longevity. Next, employing Mendelian randomization which combined genetic determinants of Df, and cis-protein Quantitative Trait Loci from 1,159 circulating proteins from the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological (PURE) cohort (n=12,066), we identified eight causal mediators for Df, namely IgG Fc receptorIIb, BST1, LILRB2, IL16, MMP12, PON2, ALPP, and PDL2. Notably, MMP12 and IgG Fc receptorIIb have been suggested to connect Df to cardiometabolic outcomes (i.e., coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, and type 2 diabetes) and longevity, respectively. Pathway enrichment analyses highlighted the role of IgG Fc receptorIIb in immune and inflammatory responses to aging processes, referred to as inflammaging. This multi-pronged approach unveils IgG Fc recIIb and MMP12 as key mediators in immune and inflammation pathways, linking lower Df to a higher risk of cardiometabolic diseases and a shorter lifespan. Therefore, retinal Df may be a convenient way to estimate inflammaging, such that lower retinal Df, may indicate a higher inflammaging status. Targeting MMP12 and IgG Fc ReceptorIIb may promote healthy aging and mitigating the occurrence of cardiometabolic diseases in the elderly population.

Antibiotic treatment alters several aspects of bacterial physiology, including increased ATP utilization, carbon metabolism, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. However, how the ""bioenergetic stress"" induced by increased ATP utilization affects treatment outcomes is unknown. Here we utilized a synthetic biology approach to study the direct effects of bioenergetic stress on antibiotic efficacy. We engineered a genetic system that constitutively hydrolyzes ATP or NADH in Escherichia coli. We found that bioenergetic stress potentiates AMR evolution via enhanced ROS production, mutagenic break repair, and transcription-coupled repair. We also find that bioenergetic stress potentiates antimicrobial persistence via potentiated stringent response activation. We propose a unifying model that antibiotic-induced antimicrobial resistance and persistence is caused by antibiotic-induced. This has important implications for preventing or curbing the spread of AMR infections.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Given a collection of reference sequences, a c-dBG can be essentially regarded as a map from k-mers to their color sets. The color set of a k-mer is the set of all identifiers, or colors, of the references that contain the k-mer. While these maps find countless applications in computational biology (e.g., basic query, reading mapping, abundance estimation, etc.), their memory usage represents a serious challenge for large-scale sequence indexing. Our solutions leverage on the intrinsic repetitiveness of the color sets when indexing large collections of related genomes. Hence, the described algorithms factorize the color sets into patterns that repeat across the entire collection and represent these patterns once, instead of redundantly replicating their representation as would happen if the sets were encoded as atomic lists of integers. Experimental results across a range of datasets and query workloads show that these representations substantially improve over the space effectiveness of the best previous solutions (sometimes, even dramatically, yielding indexes that are smaller by an order of magnitude). Despite the space reduction, these indexes only moderately impact the efficiency of the queries compared to the fastest indexes.

Here, we report that inhibition of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), which metabolizes tryptophan to kynurenine (KYN) in the first step of the kynurenine pathway, rescues hippocampal memory function and plasticity in preclinical models of amyloid and tau pathology by restoring astrocytic metabolic support of neurons. Activation of IDO1 in astrocytes by amyloid-beta42 and tau oligomers, two major pathological effectors in AD, increases KYN and suppresses glycolysis in an AhR-dependent manner. Conversely, pharmacological IDO1 inhibition restores glycolysis and lactate production. In amyloid-producing APPSwe-PS1{Delta}E9 and 5XFAD mice and in tau-producing P301S mice, IDO1 inhibition restores spatial memory and improves hippocampal glucose metabolism by metabolomic and MALDI-MS analyses. IDO1 blockade also rescues hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in a monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)-dependent manner, suggesting that IDO1 activity disrupts astrocytic metabolic support of neurons. Indeed, in vitro mass-labeling of human astrocytes demonstrates that IDO1 regulates astrocyte generation of lactate that is then taken up by human neurons. In co-cultures of astrocytes and neurons derived from AD subjects, deficient astrocyte lactate transfer to neurons was corrected by IDO1 inhibition, resulting in improved neuronal glucose metabolism. Thus, IDO1 activity disrupts astrocytic metabolic support of neurons across both amyloid and tau pathologies and in a model of AD iPSC-derived neurons. These findings also suggest that IDO1 inhibitors developed for adjunctive therapy in cancer could be repurposed for treatment of amyloid- and tau-mediated neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Hydrothermal viruses were largely endemic. However, some viruses were shared between geographically separated vents, predominantly between the Lau Basin and Brothers Volcano in the Pacific Ocean. Geographically distant viruses often shared proteins related to core functions such as structural proteins, and rarely, proteins of auxiliary functions. Common microbial hosts of viruses included members of Campylobacterota, Alpha-, and Gammaproteobacteria in deposits, and Gammaproteobacteria in plumes. Campylobacterota- and Gammaproteobacteria-infecting viruses reflected variations in hydrothermal chemistry and functional redundancy in their predicted microbial hosts, suggesting that hydrothermal geology is a driver of viral ecology and coevolution of viruses and hosts.

Previously, we identified the nuclear envelope (NE) protein Msc1 as important for late-M DSB repair.

Adaptor protein complexes (APs), which are recruited to membranes by the small GTPase ARF1, facilitate cargo selection and incorporation into trafficking intermediates. According to the classical model, small vesicles would facilitate bi-directional long-range transport between the Golgi, endosomes and plasma membrane. Here we revisit the intracellular organization of the vesicular transport machinery using a combination of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, live-cell high temporal (fast-confocal) or spatial (stimulated emission depletion (STED)) microscopy as well as correlative light and electron microscopy. We characterize novel tubulo-vesicular ARF1 compartments that harbor clathrin and different APs. Our findings reveal two functionally different classes of ARF1 compartments, each decorated by a different combination of APs. Perinuclear ARF1 compartments facilitate Golgi export of secretory cargo, while peripheral ARF1 compartments are involved in endocytic recycling downstream of early endosomes. Contrary to the classical model of long-range vesicle shuttling, we observe that ARF1 compartments shed ARF1 and mature into recycling endosomes. This maturation process is impaired in the absence of AP-1 and results in trafficking defects. Collectively, these data highlight a crucial role for ARF1 compartments in post-Golgi sorting.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

However, biologically contaminated pipette tips must undergo several washing and sterilization steps before being reused or recycled. Grenova Solutions provides such a decontamination station called TipNovus, which has been implemented by academic and government research labs to reuse pipette tips in sensitive biological assays. Despite this success, the high initial purchasing cost of these washing stations deter many laboratories from incorporating it into their workflow. Additionally, researchers are reluctant to reuse pipette tips due to concerns that the washing process may not thoroughly remove all contaminants. To mitigate these concerns, considering the University of Texas at Austin as an example, we performed a cost-benefit analysis of employing a university-wide washing station. We estimated that only single-time reuse of the pipette tips could result in a 100% return on investment from the equipment purchase cost within 3 months. Then, with our pilot experiments, we confirmed the TipNovus washing steps to be 100% efficient in sterilizing pipette tips contaminated with T7 bacteriophage, enabling their reuse in bacteriophage functionality assays. Finally, we proposed an alternative and more convenient autoclave-based sterilization method to decontaminate pipette tips.

This has permitted the early detection of outbreaks but has been insufficient for single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-level analysis due to lower read accuracy than Illumina sequencing. This study aimed to determine whether Haplotype-aware ERRor cOrrection (HERRO) of ONT data could permit high-resolution comparison of outbreak isolates.

MethodsWe used ONT simplex reads from isolates involved in a recent outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in our neonatal unit. The raw sequence data were re-basecalled and adapter-trimmed using Dorado v0.7.0. The simplex reads then underwent HERRO correction. The resulting genome assemblies and phylogenies were compared with previous analyses (using Dorado v0.3.4, no HERRO correction and data generated by Illumina sequencing).

ResultsFive of nine outbreak isolates were included in the analysis. The remaining four isolates had insufficient read lengths (N50 values <10,000 bp) and did not provide complete chromosome coverage after HERRO correction. The average chromosome sequencing depth for nanopore data was 147x (range: 44-220x) with an average read N50 of 12,215 bp (interquartile range (IQR): 11,439-12,711 bp). The median pairwise SNV distance between outbreak isolates from the original investigation was 51 SNVs (range: 40-68), which decreased to 3 SNVs (range: 1-15) with HERRO correction. Illumina sequencing generated a median SNV distance of 2 (range: 0-13). The resulting standalone ONT HERRO-corrected phylogeny was almost indistinguishable from the standalone Illumina-generated phylogeny.

ConclusionsThe addition of HERRO correction meant isolates from this MRSA outbreak could be resolved to a level on par with Illumina sequencing. ONT data following HERRO correction represents a viable standalone option for high-resolution genomic analysis of hospital outbreaks, provided sufficient read lengths can be generated.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

In this study, we employed metagenomics to examine the ecological roles of the atmospheric microbiome, including the dispersal of potential pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes, and its response to temperature fluctuations and dust storms intensified by climate change. We analyzed air samples from non-dusty conditions and Middle Eastern dust storms, identifying several facultative pathogens like Klebsiella pneumoniae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Aspergillus fumigatus, linked to human respiratory diseases, and others like Zymoseptoria tritici, Fusarium poae, and Puccinia striiformis, harmful to wheat, associated with dust storms and rising temperatures. We observed increased functions related to antibiotic resistance, including beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, and virulence factors during dust storms. Our findings suggest that dust storms may spread these traits. Continuous monitoring is crucial to understand the broader implications of dust storms and temperature increases on the atmospheric microbiome amid climate change, emphasizing the need for a One Health approach to global climate challenges.

Here, we report the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle herds across several states in the U.S. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory distress, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state.

SARS-CoV-2 internalization occurs via S-protein-mediated cell binding followed either by direct fusion with the plasma membrane or endocytosis and subsequent fusion with the endosomal membrane. Despite the crucial role of virus internalization, the precise kinetics of the processes involved remains elusive. We developed a pipeline, which combines live-cell microscopy and advanced image analysis, for measuring the rates of multiple internalization-associated molecular events of single SARS-CoV-2-virus-like particles (VLPs), including endosome ingression, pH change, and nucleocapsid release. Our live-cell imaging experiments demonstrate that only a few minutes after binding to the plasma membrane, VLPs ingress into Rab5-negative endosomes via Dynamin-dependent scission. Less than two minutes later, the pH of VLPs drops below 5 followed by an increase in VLP speed, yet these two events are not interrelated. Nucleocapsid release from the VLPs occurs with similar kinetics to the pH drop, suggesting that VLP fusion occurs during endosome acidification. Neither Omicron mutations nor abrogation of the S protein polybasic cleavage site altered the rate of VLP internalization events, indicating that they do not affect these processes. Finally, we observe that VLP internalization occurs two to three times faster in VeroE6 than in A549 cells, which may contribute to the greater susceptibility of the former cell line to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, our precise measurements of the kinetics of VLP internalization-associated processes shed light on their contribution to the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cells. Time-lapse videos of the studied internalization events can be accessed in the dedicated COVIDynamics database.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

These assemblies often include novel species that are poorly represented in reference databases creating a need for a tool that can annotate both well-described and novel taxa, and can run at scale. Here, we present mettannotator - a comprehensive Nextflow pipeline for prokaryotic genome annotation that identifies coding and non-coding regions, predicts protein functions, including antimicrobial resistance, and delineates gene clusters. The pipeline summarises the results of these tools in a GFF (General Feature Format) file that can be easily utilised in downstream analysis or visualised using common genome browsers. Mettannotator has been tested on both novel and known taxa, and used across Ensembl Bacteria and MGnify. Here, we show how it works on 29 prokaryotic phyla, both isolate and metagenome-assembled genomes, and present metrics on its performance in comparison to other tools.

We crowd-sourced ball python shed skin from commercial breeders and applied a case-control study design. Using whole-genome pool sequencing (pool-seq) and variant annotation, we found a premature stop codon in GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (gch1) associated with the axanthic phenotype.

But even in sensory brain areas, the relationship between input signals and neuronal spiking activity is complex and non-linear. Fast subsecond fluctuations in neuronal population responses dominate the temporal dynamics of neural circuits. Traditional approaches have treated this activity as ""noise"" that can be averaged away by taking the mean spiking rate over wide time bins or over multiple trial repetitions, but this ignores much of the temporal dynamics that naturally occur in neural systems. We find that subsecond flares of increased population activity are layer- and cell-type specific, and large-scale computational modelling suggests they may serve as an inter-areal gating mechanism. Moreover, we find that most of the neural variability is restricted to a population-gain axis. This observation explains why neural systems can function in the presence of excessive variability: population-level spiking dynamics generate invariance to the majority of neural noise.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

However, central metabolism corresponds to only a small fraction of the biosynthetic potential of microbes: metabolites such as antimicrobial compounds, signaling molecules, and co-factors are underexplored forces shaping microbial communities. Here, we focus on B vitamin exchange in coastal marine bacterial communities that degrade particulate organic matter and find that natural seawater communities are vitamin limited. While almost a third of bacterial isolates from these communities are B vitamin auxotrophs, the pioneering degraders that first arrive on particles are vitamin producers that likely support auxotrophs through cross-feeding. However, combining experiments and a resource-explicit model, we show that auxotroph growth is often not restored by coculture with vitamin producers, but rather requires lysis and subsequent vitamin recycling. Our results highlight the importance of vitamin auxotrophies and lysis-mediated cross-feeding as important factors controlling microbial community assembly and succession on marine particles.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

However, reproducibility has not been systematically assessed within the context of electrophysiological recordings during cognitive behaviors. To address this, we formed a multi-lab collaboration using a shared, open-source behavioral task and experimental apparatus. Experimenters in ten laboratories repeatedly targeted Neuropixels probes to the same location (spanning secondary visual areas, hippocampus, and thalamus) in mice making decisions; this generated a total of 121 experimental replicates, a unique dataset for evaluating reproducibility of electrophysiology experiments. Despite standardizing both behavioral and electrophysiological procedures, some experimental outcomes were highly variable. A closer analysis uncovered that variability in electrode targeting hindered reproducibility, as did the limited statistical power of some routinely used electrophysiological analyses, such as single-neuron tests of modulation by task parameters. Reproducibility was enhanced by histological and electrophysiological quality-control criteria.

We have recently shown associations for CHIP with acute kidney injury and with kidney function decline in the general population, with stronger associations for CHIP driven by mutations in genes other than DNMT3A (non-DNMT3A CHIP). Longitudinal kidney function endpoints in individuals with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CHIP have been examined in two previous studies, which reported conflicting findings and were limited by small sample sizes.

MethodsIn this study, we examined the prospective associations between CHIP and CKD progression events in four cohorts of CKD patients (total N = 5,772). The primary outcome was a composite of 50% kidney function decline or kidney failure. The slope of eGFR decline was examined as a secondary outcome. Mendelian randomization techniques were then used to investigate potential causal effects of CHIP on eGFR decline. Finally, kidney function was assessed in adenine-fed CKD model mice having received a bone marrow transplant recapitulatingTet2-CHIP compared to controls transplanted wild-type bone marrow.

ResultsAcross all cohorts, the average age was 66.4 years, the average baseline eGFR was 42.6 ml/min/1.73m2, and 24% had CHIP. Upon meta-analysis, non-DNMT3A CHIP was associated with a 59% higher relative risk of incident CKD progression (HR 1.59, 95% CI: 1.02-2.47). This association was more pronounced among individuals with diabetes (HR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.03-1.62) and with baseline eGFR [&ge;] 30 ml/min/1.73m (HR 1.80, 95% CI: 1.11-2.90).

Mendelian randomization analyses suggested a causal role for CHIP in eGFR decline among individuals with diabetes. In a dietary adenine mouse model of CKD, Tet2-CHIP was associated with lower GFR as well as greater kidney inflammation, tubular injury, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.

ConclusionNon-DNMT3A CHIP is a potentially targetable novel risk factor for CKD progression.","NA","medrxiv",1721167720031

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3, which convergently acquired S protein substitutions such as S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Furthermore, JN.1 subvariants such as LB.1 and KP.2.3, which convergently acquired S:S31del in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. Here we investigated the virological properties of KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1721167720031
"PAM: Predictive attention mechanism for neural decoding of visual perception","10.1101/2024.06.04.596589","biorxiv",84.08,0,0,5.08,80.58,"Dado, T.; Le, L.; van Gerven, M.; Gucluturk, Y.; Guclu, U.","Thirza Dado","Radboud University","2024-06-08","1","new results","cc_by","neuroscience","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/06/08/2024.06.04.596589.source.xml","Attention mechanisms enhance deep learning models by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input data. We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

They form superhelical structures around which DNA is wrapped. Recent studies have shown that some archaea and bacteria contain alternative histones that exhibit different DNA binding properties, in addition to highly divergent sequences. However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1721167720031
