Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise in drug discovery, but existing models often fail to propose compounds that are both effective and synthetically tractable. To address these challenges, we introduce SyntheMol-RL, a reinforcement learning-based generative model that can rapidly design synthetically accessible small molecule drug candidates from a massive chemical space of 46 billion compounds. SyntheMol-RL improves upon our prior Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based SyntheMol model by generalizing across chemically similar building blocks and enabling multi-parameter optimization. We applied SyntheMol-RL to generate candidate antibiotics against S. aureus by optimizing for both antibacterial activity and aqueous solubility, and we found that SyntheMol-RL generated molecules with improved predicted properties compared to both the previous MCTS version of SyntheMol as well as an AI-based virtual screening baseline. We synthesized 79 SyntheMol-RL compounds that were unique relative to the training dataset and found that 13 showed potent in vitro activity, of which seven were structurally novel after detailed literature searches. Furthermore, one hit compound, synthecin, demonstrated efficacy in a murine wound infection model of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). These results validate SyntheMol-RL's ability to generate novel and synthetically accessible candidate antibiotics and position SyntheMol-RL as a powerful tool for drug design across therapeutic domains.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

We assemble data from 46 cohorts including 611K-1.14M participants with European-like and African-like genomes for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience), and data from 51K participants for within-family GWAS. We identify 1,257 lead genetic variants associated with personality, including 823 novel variants. Common genetic variants explain 4.8%-9.3% of the variance in each trait, and 10.5%-16.2% accounting for measurement unreliability. Genetic effects on personality are highly consistent across geography, reporter (self vs. close other), age group, and measurement instrument, and we find minimal spousal assortment for personality in recent history. In stark contrast to many other social and behavioral traits, within-family GWAS and polygenic index analyses indicate little to no shared environmental confounding in genetic associations with personality. Polygenic prediction, genetic correlation, and Mendelian randomization analyses indicate that personality genetics have widespread, potentially causal associations with a wide range of consequential behaviors and life outcomes. The genetic architecture of personality is robust and fundamental to being a human.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo-Dropout CNN (MCD-CNN), as well as a few-shot learning approach to address dataset size limitations. Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1747778972813

For example, people tend to remember items as occurring farther apart in time if they spanned a change in context, or 'event boundary,' compared to the same context. While these distortions can sacrifice precise timing, they may serve to help separate temporally adjacent memories. However, the neural bases of this phenomenon are poorly understood. Here, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; n = 32) with eye-tracking (n = 28) to test whether the dopaminergic system, known to influence encoding and time perception, predicts time dilation between adjacent events in memory. Participants encoded item sequences while listening to tones that mostly repeated over time, forming a stable auditory context, but occasionally switched, creating an event boundary. We found that boundaries predicted greater retrospective estimates of time between item pairs. Critically, tone switches significantly activated the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key midbrain dopaminergic region, and these responses in turn predicted greater time dilation between item pairs spanning those switches. Boundaries furthermore predicted a momentary increase in blinks. VTA activation also predicted blinking in general, consistent with the idea that blink behavior is a potential marker of dopaminergic activity. On a larger timescale, higher blink rates predicted greater time dilation in memory, but only for boundary-spanning pairs. Together, these findings suggest that dopaminergic processes are sensitive to event structure and may drive temporal distortions that help disjoin memories of distinct events.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

This question has been challenged by the observation of emergent coexistence, where microbial communities contain species that cannot coexist in pairs, suggesting the presence of non-pairwise mechanisms. Instead, we show that emergent coexistence arises naturally in species-rich models with pairwise interactions. Strikingly, this phenomenon does not require additional mechanisms like intransitive or higher-order interactions; rather, coexistence arises from dense networks of indirect effects. As diversity increases, we show that indirect effects become so intricate that pairwise interactions no longer predict community composition, revealing a fundamental limit to reductionist explanations of coexistence. Like chaos emerging from simple rules, our findings provide theoretical foundations to understand how unexpected species coexistence can emerge from pairwise interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

Since plant cells are encased in cell walls and thus immotile, their individual fate-specification program is dependent on their relative position within the organism. It is assumed that the cell wall and its mechanical properties are under surveillance, linking cell wall state to intracellular gene-regulatory networks. However, the role of these cell wall signalling pathways in plant development and the contribution of cell wall properties to cell behaviour and identity are unclear. Here, we show that control of cell wall properties is essential for the perpetuation of stem cell populations and pattering in the shoot apical meristems. The expression of pectin methylesterases (PMEs), which modify homogalacturonan methylesterification and thereby modulate cell wall mechanics, is maintained at low levels in stem cells by the stem cell specifying transcription factor WUS. Low PME expression is required for stemness, auxin patterning and stem cell-specific mechanical properties. Conversely, WUS depletion reduces wall stiffness in the meristem centre, reinforcing its role in maintaining mechanical homeostasis. Together, our findings show that WUS-mediated control of cell wall-modifying enzymes is essential for sustaining stem cell identity and SAM organization. These results demonstrat that the plant cell wall is not only involved in cell differentiation, but also exerts feedback control on developmental transitions, contributing to our understanding how the immediate physical environment is able to guide cell fate decisions in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

This is characterized by difficulties in executive functions, planning, decision-making, working memory, impairments in complex attention, loss of ability to learn new skills and perform sophisticated brain tasks. No effective treatment options currently exist for LC-related cognitive dysfunction. Here, we use the IntelliCage, which is an automated tracking system of cognitive functions, following SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice, measuring the ability of each mouse within a group to perform tasks that mimic complex human behaviors, such as planning, decision-making, cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Artificial intelligence and machine learning analyses of the tracking data classified LC mice into distinct behavioral categories from non-infected control mice, permitting precise identification and quantification of complex cognitive dysfunction in a controlled, replicable manner. Importantly, we find that brains from LC mice with cognitive dysfunction exhibit transcriptomic alterations similar to those observed in humans suffering from LC-related cognitive impairments, including altered expression of genes involved in learning, executive functions, synaptic functions, neurotransmitters and memory. Together, our findings establish a validated murine model and an automated unbiased approach to study LC-related cognitive dysfunction for the first time, and providing a valuable tool for screening potential treatments and therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

This is typically done by generating an assembly from the sequencing reads of a bacterial isolate and running AMR gene detection tools on the assembly. However, despite advances in long-read sequencing that have greatly improved the quality and completeness of bacterial genome assemblies, assembly tools remain prone to large-scale errors caused by repeats in the genome, leading to inaccurate detection of AMR gene content and consequent impact on resistance prediction. In this work we present Amira, a tool to detect AMR genes directly from unassembled long-read sequencing data. Amira leverages the fact that multiple consecutive genes lie within a single read to construct gene-space de Bruijn graphs where the k-mer alphabet is the set of genes in the pan-genome of the species under study. Through this approach, the reads corresponding to different copies of AMR genes can be effectively separated based on the genomic context of the AMR genes, and used to infer the nucleotide sequence of each copy. Amira achieves significant improvements in genomic copy number recall and nucleotide accuracy, demonstrated through objective simulations and comparison with alternative read and assembly-based methods on samples with manually curated truth assemblies. Applied to a dataset of 32 Escherichia coli samples with diverse AMR gene content, Amira achieves a mean genomic-copy-number recall of 98.4% with precision 97.9% and nucleotide accuracy 99.9%. Finally, we compare the number of fully (>90%) present genes with good read support by Amira and Flye with AMRFinderPlus across all E. coli, K. pneumoniae and E. faecium nanopore datasets from the ENA (n=8593, 2469 and 420 respectively), quantifying the improvement in recall when handling heterogeneous data.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

Yet how they estimate the distance to an odour source remains unclear. The spatiotemporal dynamics of natural odour plumes, shaped by airflow turbulence, offer valuable cues for locating odour sources. Here, we show that mice can discriminate odour sources placed at different distances by extracting information from the sub-sniff temporal structure of naturalistic odour plumes. Using a wind tunnel and an olfactory virtual reality system, we generated dynamic plumes and demonstrated, through high-throughput automated behaviour, that mice distinguish near from far sources based on odour fluctuations operating faster than their respiratory cycle. Two-photon calcium imaging of olfactory bulb projection neurons revealed that distance-dependent responses are present in a small subset of mitral and tufted cells, and that population activity encodes source distance. Critically, neural responses correlated more strongly with high-frequency plume features than with mean odour concentration. Our results identify a neural basis for distance estimation from odour dynamics and highlight the importance of rapid temporal processing in mammalian olfaction.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

Existing state-of-the-art models for both modeling and designing protein-DNA interactions primarily rely on structural information, facing limitations in scalability and efficiency for large-scale applications. Notable methods like AlphaFold 3 and RosettaTTAFold All-Atom exist, but they are inefficient and inherently struggle at modeling conformationally unstable proteins, such as transcription factors, which arguably represent the most important class of DNA-binding proteins. Here, we present DPAC (DNA-Protein binding Alignment via Contrastive learning), which leverages pre-trained protein and DNA language models via a contrastive loss to align the two modalities in a high-dimensional shared latent space. DPAC not only significantly accelerates the design process compared to current structure-based methods but also demonstrates a strong ability to differentiate real binders from non-binders. Our model achieves an AUC score of 0.591 on a low identity set, outperforming state-of-the-art structure-based methods. Additionally, DPAC integrates simulated annealing for the design of new protein sequences with optimized DNA binding affinity, successfully recovering binding affinity in engineered sequences by up to 20% in in silico tests. Our results highlight DPAC's potential for facilitating the design and discovery of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, paving the way for advancements in genomic research and biotechnology applications.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

We then created a novel, gene-specific, transcriptional aging clock, which demonstrated that sulforaphane-treated individuals exhibited a ""transcriptional age"" that was approximately four days younger than age-matched controls, representing a nearly 20% reduction in biological age. The clearest transcriptional responses were detoxification pathways, which, together with the shape of the dose-response curve, indicates a likely hormetic response to sulforaphane. These results support the idea that robust longevity-extending interventions can act via global effects across the organism, as revealed by systems level changes in gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

Using calcium imaging in behaving flies, we find that a hair plate on the fly coxa (CxHP8) detects the limits of anterior leg movement. Reconstructing CxHP8 axons in the connectome, we found that they are wired to excite posterior leg movement and inhibit anterior leg movement. Consistent with this connectivity, optogenetic activation of CxHP8 neurons elicited posterior postural reflexes, while silencing altered the swing-to-stance transition during walking. Finally, we use comprehensive reconstruction of peripheral morphology and downstream connectivity to predict the function of other hair plates distributed across the fly leg. Our results suggest that each hair plate is specialized to control specific sensorimotor reflexes that are matched to the joint limit it detects. They also illustrate the feasibility of predicting sensorimotor reflexes from a connectome with identified proprioceptive inputs and motor outputs.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells.

MARV16 and previously identified RBS-directed antibodies can bind MARV GP simultaneously, paving the way for a MARV therapeutic antibody cocktail. MARV GP stabilization along with the discovery of a potent neutralizing antibody will advance treatment and prevention options for MARV.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

Among the available methods, enzymatic post-translational modification of short protein tags offers precision, stability, and modularity. However, broader application is often limited by complex substrate syntheses, the requirement of long or rigid recognition tags, and limited reaction efficiencies. Here, we present ADDing, a straightforward enzymatic method for functionalizing proteins with click chemistry handles using the flavin transferase ApbE. We discovered that, given a dedicated adenine diphosphate derivative (ADD) substrate, the enzyme attaches a phosphoribosyl moiety bearing bioorthogonal handles to proteins featuring a DxxxGAT amino acid motif. As the substrates can easily be enzymatically synthesized from NAD and inexpensive precursors, ADDing click handles can be performed in a streamlined, one-pot workflow combining substrate synthesis and protein conjugation. ADDing allows rapid, high-yield functionalization of proteins featuring the recognition tag at either terminus or internal loops and is compatible with copper and copper free azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions. To demonstrate its broad applicability, we performed a wide variety of protein functionalizations, including fluorescent labeling, protein-protein, protein-DNA conjugation, and protein immobilization. This versatile technology thus holds great potential for chemical biology and the production of biological therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

Cryo-EM analysis of this construct allowed us to determine the prefusion structure of EBV gB, providing insights into the structural transitions required to adopt the postfusion conformation. Murine immunizations and depletion studies with human sera suggested a trend toward improved functional immunogenicity of D2C3 compared to postfusion gB.

Single-molecule footprinting (SMF) and long-read chromatin accessibility assays such as Fiber-seq now capture these interactions at nucleotide resolution on individual DNA molecules. However, existing computational tools remain insufficient to decode complex binding events from sparse methylation data. Here, we introduce HiddenFoot, a probabilistic modeling framework based on statistical mechanics that quantitatively infers TF, nucleosome, and Pol II occupancy profiles on single DNA molecules by systematically evaluating all thermodynamically plausible binding configurations. Applying HiddenFoot to SMF and Fiber-seq data from mouse, Drosophila, and human cells, we recovered known TF footprints, precisely resolved Pol II pausing, and identified extensive heterogeneity in nucleosome positioning driven by TF binding. HiddenFoot further distinguishes direct TF--TF cooperativity from nucleosome-mediated co-dependency by estimating pairwise interaction energies and comparing to null models under equilibrium. By integrating biophysical modeling with high-resolution single-molecule data, HiddenFoot offers a general, interpretable framework for dissecting regulatory logic in native chromatin with base-pair precision.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

We took advantage of high-density Neuropixels electrodes to record large populations of neurons across layers of macaque V1 and used a state-of-the-art non-linear dimensionality reduction approach on waveform shape to delineate nine putative cell classes, 4 narrow-spiking (NS), 4 broad-spiking (BS) and 1 tri-phasic (TP). Then, we performed targeted analyses of laminar organization, spike amplitude, multichannel spatial features, functional properties, and network connectivity of these cell classes, to discover four fundamental aspects of the V1 microcircuit predicted by anatomical studies, but never fully demonstrated before in vivo: First, NS neurons were most concentrated in layer 4 and more numerous than parvalbumin positive neurons, consistent with studies of potassium channel expression in excitatory neurons in V1. Second, a large amplitude NS cell class in layer 4B was strongly direction selective, with multichannel waveforms consistent with a stellate morphology, which is a likely functional correlate of anatomical descriptions of neurons that project between V1 and MT. Third, an NS cell class in layer 4B showed robust bursting activity and strong orientation selectivity. Finally, cross-correlation analysis of neuron pairs revealed distinct functional interactions between cell classes. These results demonstrate that high-resolution electrophysiology enables discovery of novel relationships between structural organization and in vivo functional responses of neurons, and can inform biologically realistic microcircuit models of primate V1, perhaps even extending to all of neocortex.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

As deforming membranes is energetically costly, biology has developed various protein systems to accomplish this task. The mechanisms providing the force to deform bacterial membranes to initiate division remain unknown. In vivo studies have shown the condensation of FtsZ filaments into a sharp ring is required to initiate cell division, an observation mirrored in vitro with FtsZ filaments encapsulated inside liposomes. Similarly, the force for membrane deformation in many eukaryotic deforming systems arises from the local crowding of proteins on the membrane surface. As any membrane deforming system works against the membrane tension, here we modulated the amount of lipid synthesis and thus membrane tension in Bacillus subtilis to examine: 1) if the condensation of FtsZ filaments by FtsZ bundling proteins serves to overcome the cellular membrane tension to deform the membrane inward and 2) how changes to the membrane tension affect the subsequent invagination of the septum. First, we developed methods to simultaneously measure and modulate membrane tension in live cells. Next, we determined how altering the membrane tension affected the cells ability to initiate division with reduced levels of FtsZ bundling proteins. While cells depleted of 2 FtsZ bundling proteins were unable to divide, reducing membrane tension to a given threshold restored their ability to initiate division. Likewise, cells with intermediate levels of FtsZ bundling proteins required a lesser decrease in membrane tension to initiate division. We also found that reductions in membrane tension increase the rate of Z ring constriction, with the constriction rate scaling linearly with the membrane tension. Interestingly, while the constriction rate in wild-type B. subtilis is limited by FtsZ treadmilling, the rate of constriction becomes independent of FtsZs treadmilling rate when membrane tension is reduced. These experiments give two major insights: First, the filament condensation caused by FtsZ bundling proteins works to overcome membrane tension and deform the membrane inward to initiate division. Second, the rate of septal constriction is limited by membrane tension, suggesting that membrane fluctuations at the tip of the growing septa limit the rate of cell wall synthesis. Finally, our measurements allow the estimation of several physical values of cell division, such as the force required to bend the membrane, but also that the cell membrane provides only 0.1%, a small amount of surface tension relative to the entire cell envelope, indicating 99.9% of the pressure drop occurs across the cell wall. These calculations also indicate that cell division occurs via comparatively very small membrane tension fluctuations relative to the high turgor pressure that exists across the entire cell envelope.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

In addition, Vaultrc5 knockdown at the synapse shifts the RNA cargo toward transcripts associated with immune surveillance, and Vaultrc5 knockdown, in vivo, leads to impaired fear learning.

In Arabidopsis, the RNA-binding protein RBP47b is a canonical SG marker, yet its functional contribution to thermotolerance remains unresolved. Here, we combined mTurboID proximity labeling with multi-omics profiling to define the RBP47b interactome and its physiological impact. mTurboID identified a stress-specific enrichment of 40S ribosomal subunits within RBP47b SGs, implicating these condensates in translational control. Surprisingly, quadruple mutant plants lacking all four RBP47 paralogues (rbp47abcc') displayed enhanced survival, attenuated growth delay, and faster recovery of photosynthetic efficiency after severe heat stress. Integrated transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome analyses revealed that this gain of thermotolerance is associated with (i) accelerated re-initiation of translation, (ii) constitutively elevated jasmonate and oxylipin pools, and (iii) reduced ROS accumulation during heat and recovery. We conclude that the RBP47 family acts as a negative regulator of heat tolerance by sequestering 40S subunits and limiting translational restart; loss of these SG scaffolds pre-primes jasmonate-dependent detoxification pathways and expedites proteome rebuilding, thereby conferring superior thermotolerance.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

KRAB zinc finger proteins (KZFPs), a large family of transcription factors specialized in TE recognition, are known repressors of TE-derived regulatory activity through TRIM28-mediated H3K9me3 deposition. Here, we expand this paradigm by uncovering noncanonical relationships between TEs and KZFPs. By generating a comprehensive epigenomic map of KZFP-bound TEs, we find that the regulatory activity of ancient mammalian L2/MIR elements is broadly delineated by KZFP binding patterns, despite low H3K9me3 enrichment. We further dissect this relationship by investigating the function of ZNF436, a non-canonical KZFP, highly expressed during in vivo human fetal heart development. Using loss-of-function approaches, we show that ZNF436 preserves cardiomyocyte function by promoting cardiac gene expression while restricting the activation of alternative lineage programs. Mechanistically, ZNF436 recruits specialized SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes to limit the accessibility of L2/MIR-derived enhancers, many of which are active in non-cardiac tissues. These findings reveal a noncanonical, TRIM28-independent role for KZFPs in shaping cell-type-specific regulatory landscapes and emphasize the importance of repressing alternative regulatory programs alongside activating lineage-specific ones to safeguard cell identity.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

This view is reminiscent of learning in large language artificial neural networks (ANNs), where training involves statistical associations between symbolic inputs and outputs. Based on this parallel, we hypothesized that brain activity during arithmetic problem-solving should be increasingly similar to ANN-derived representations with learning and development. We used fMRI to investigate the relation between brain activity during single-digit addition problem-solving and ANN features in 104 participants across four age groups (8-, 11-, 14-year-olds, and adults). Vertex-wise encoding models were used to predict brain activity using latent features extracted from pre-trained ANNs. Results revealed that the ANN-based model better predicted arithmetic-related activity in older than younger participants in a specific region of the left precentral sulcus. Prediction accuracy was higher for smaller than larger problems, consistent with the idea that associations between problems may decrease in strength with problem size. Furthermore, ANN prediction patterns aligned with a model in which each addition problem was increasingly represented separately with age. On the one hand, these findings may support the idea that, with learning and development, some neural representations of arithmetic problems become discretely organized in memory and increasingly resemble ANN-like processing. On the other hand, the lack of relation between the ANN-based model and activity in other brain regions suggests some degree of dissimilarity between arithmetic processing in humans and ANNs, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms for simple arithmetic learning in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1747778972813

We introduce BehaveAgent, an autonomous multimodal AI agent designed to automate behavior analysis from video input without retraining or manual intervention. Unlike conventional methods that require manual behavior annotation, video segmentation, task-specific model training, BehaveAgent leverages the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLM) to generalize across novel behavioral domains without need for additional training. It integrates LLMs, vision-language models (VLMs), and large-scale visual grounding modules, orchestrated through a multimodal context memory and goal-directed attention mechanism, to enable robust zero-shot visual reasoning across species and experimental paradigms, including plants, insects, rodents, primates, and humans. Upon receiving a video input, BehaveAgent autonomously identifies the correct analysis strategy and performs end-to-end behavior analysis and interpretation without human supervision. Leveraging vision-language representations, it performs general-purpose tracking, pose estimation and segmentation. We demonstrate BehaveAgent's universal applicability to autonomously (1) identify the behavioral paradigm and develop an action plan specialized for the identified paradigm, (2) identify relevant subjects and objects, (3) track those features, (4) identify behavioral sequences with explicit reasoning, (5) generate and execute code for targeted analysis and (6) generate comprehensive research reports that integrate behavioral findings with relevant scientific literature. Through interpretable agentic reasoning, BehaveAgent makes its internal decision-making process transparent, clarifying why particular features are tracked or behaviors inferred. By reducing the time and expertise required for behavior analysis, BehaveAgent introduces a scalable, generalizable, and explainable paradigm for advancing biological and behavioral research.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

Proteins are often optimized for single functions during design and engineering, without considering the countless other functionalities that may contribute to or interfere with the intended outcome. In this work, we apply deep learning to understand and design the multifunctional host-targeting landscape of the T7 bacteriophage receptor binding protein for enhanced infectivity, pre-defined specificity, and high generality in virulence toward unseen strains. We compare several different model architectures and design approaches and experimentally characterize designed phages optimized for 26 diverse tasks. We demonstrate that with multiobjective machine learning, it is possible to design complex specificities at success rates that can enable low-throughput validation of predicted hits. Our results show that the targeting capabilities of T7 are highly plastic, with opposite specificities often separated by only a few mutations. This level of tunability underscores how models trained on multifunctional data can uncover key principles of phage biology and specificity. The same modeling framework can be applied to guide the multiobjective design of other proteins or mutable biological systems, offering a general strategy for navigating multifunctional landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

One of the most common forms is waste-product cross-feeding, a unidirectional interaction in which the waste products of one microbe support the growth of another. Despite its ubiquity, it is not well-understood why waste-product cross-feeding persists when a single organism could in principle perform both the producer and consumer role. To address this question, we first analyze cross-feeding evolution in a minimal model of microbial metabolism. The model describes multi-step extraction of energy from a substrate in a simple but thermodynamically correct formulation. Surprisingly, we find that cross-feeding is never evolutionarily stable in this model. By analyzing models with more complex growth functions, we identify a novel mechanism for the evolutionary stability of waste-product cross-feeding, namely, generalized intracellular metabolite toxicity. Such toxicity arises because, in excess, the same intracellular metabolites that cells require for metabolism can be detrimental to growth (e.g., due to osmotic stress). We show that some but not all forms of such toxicity can lead to evolutionarily stable consortia of microbes that cross-feed waste products. This stability results from the potential of such consortia to divide the burden of toxic metabolites among a larger population, allowing them to perform their collective metabolism more efficiently than non-cross-feeders. More generally, we predict that growth penalties that scale nonlinearly with intracellular metabolite levels promote cross-feeding. We find that this mechanism for cross-feeding evolutionary stability implies nontrivial population dynamics, such as a discontinuity in population biomass at the onset of cross-feeding.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

Our approach requires no software or hardware modifications and hides the additional ion accumulation steps during the time it takes to make other Orbitrap measurements, producing precursor spectra with nearly 2x dynamic range and essentially no consequences. We collected data using both data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods to evaluate a range of approaches. With DDA, MAP-MS precursor quantification improves with higher quality measurements. At the same time, DIA detection is enhanced by up to 11% when combining precursor and tandem mass spectra for peptide detection.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

While the biological roles of ribonucleoprotein-condensates are better understood in eukaryotic systems, the knowledge of metabolic processes that govern their formation and their contribution to stress adaptation remains at a nascent stage in bacterial RNA biology. Hfq is an RNA-chaperone conserved in many bacteria that undergoes condensation in response to diverse stresses. Using nitrogen (N) starvation in Escherichia coli as a model stress condition, we show that Hfq condensation occurs independently of any extracellular cues, cytoplasmic shrinkage that cells undergo during N starvation or the canonical NtrBC-dependent adaptive response to N starvation. However, we demonstrate that Hfq condensation is coupled to the inhibition of carbon assimilation in N-starved E. coli. Further, by comparing the transcriptomes of wild-type bacteria and bacteria unable to form Hfq-condensates, we reveal that Hfq-condensates contribute to the stabilisation of Hfq-associated non-coding regulatory RNAs. We propose that coordination of carbon and N metabolism during N starvation, critical for metabolic adaptation, is accompanied by preservation of non-coding regulatory RNAs via Hfq condensation.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

The bacteria releases effector proteins some of which remodel the host autophagic-lysosomal pathways. One effector is RavZ, which delipidates ATG8 proteins, making Legionella-infected cells deficient in autophagy. Here we show that SidE effectors mediate the phosphoribosyl ubiquitination (PR-Ub) of autophagic SNARE proteins STX17 and SNAP29. STX17 modification induces recruitment of STX17+ membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum to Legionella-containing phagosomes to form replicative vacuoles. Using proximity labeling, biochemistry and Legionella infection studies, we have discovered a mechanism by which autophagy is hijacked by bacteria to recruit ER membranes to the bacterial vacuole which has autophagy markers but do not fuse with lysosomes. Mass spectrometric identification of PR-Ub sites and mutational studies show that PR-Ub modification of STX17 alters its interaction with ATG14L, which drives the recruitment of ER membranes to the bacterial vacuole in a PI3K dependent manner. On the other hand, PR-Ub of SNAP29 inhibits the formation of the autophagosomal SNARE complex (STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8) by steric hindrance, thereby preventing the fusion of bacterial vacuoles with lysosomes.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

However, despite dozens of tools to identify signatures in cancer samples, there is not an established metric for statistically comparing mutational signature results and quantifying the overall significance of differences among complex mixtures of signatures. To close this methodological gap, we demonstrate that a signature-agnostic metric for measuring differences in mutation spectra - the aggregate mutation spectrum distance permutation method (AMSD) - can discover differences overlooked by signature analysis. First, we reanalyzed a study of carcinogen exposure in mice, identifying statistically significant shifts in mutation spectra caused by eleven of twenty tested carcinogens. Only three carcinogens were previously reported to induce distinct mutation signatures, suggesting that many carcinogens perturb mutagenesis by altering the composition of endogenous signatures rather than introducing unique signatures. Next, we used human tumor data to determine whether patient ancestry has a measurable impact on tumor mutation spectra, finding significant ancestry-associated differences across ten cancer types: for example, Africans have elevated SBS4 in lung adenocarcinomas, East Asians have elevated SBS16 in esophageal and liver cancers plus elevated SBS10a/b in uterine and colorectal cancers, and Europeans have elevated SBS17b in esophageal cancers plus elevated SBS2/13 in bladder cancers. These examples suggest that AMSD is a robust tool for detecting differences among tumor mutation spectra, complementing signature-based approaches and enabling the discovery of environmental and genetic influences on mutagenesis in large datasets.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.

Here, we present a scalable workflow for the discovery and validation of AI-designed protein binders. Leveraging the RFdiffusion protein design pipeline with a custom filter for stable alpha-helical bundle folds, we construct libraries of thousands of AI-binders against cancer-associated surface proteins. Mammalian cell-surface and phage display screening yield multiple high-affinity PD-L1 binders but fewer hits for CD276 (B7-H3) and VTCN1 (B7-H4), reflecting the target-dependent efficiency of RFdiffusion in generating high-quality designs. Using our experimentally validated AI-designed binder libraries, we benchmark freely available structure prediction models. We find that interface predicted template modelling (ipTM) scores by Chai-1 with ESM embedding correlate well with experimental success and even predict deleterious effects of binding interface mutations. To demonstrate the versatility of AI-binders as research tools, we deploy them in CAR-T cells and also assemble them with fluorophore-labeled streptavidin into tetravalent quattrobinders, which achieve antibody-comparable staining of endogenous PD-L1 by flow cytometry. With high production yields and accessible structural models, AI-designed quattrobinders are versatile and cost-effective research tools amenable to community-driven validation and optimization.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

However, the limited availability of versatile genetic tools and secretion assays constrain both fundamental studies and bioengineering of B. bacteriovorus. Here, we developed a molecular toolbox for B. bacteriovorus by systematically tuning gene expression and secretion of a reporter protein. We investigated functional native and synthetic promoters from the Anderson library with varying expression levels and demonstrated their efficacy in driving expression of the fluorescent reporter protein mScarletI3 at both the population and single-cell level. Additionally, we evaluated different ribosomal binding sites (RBS) to fine-tune gene expression. To examine secretion, we established a novel protocol to quantify extracellular release of a Nanoluc luciferase reporter protein in B. bacteriovorus using different native Sec-dependent signal sequences. We anticipate that the newly developed genetic toolkit and techniques will advance research on this fundamental predator-prey system, laying the foundation for its broader application and future bioengineering efforts.

In contrast, maintaining a stem-like state correlates with better expansion, persistence, and anti-tumor activity of infused T-cell products. IL-2 is extensively used in ACT protocols given its ability to expand T-cell populations. Yet, IL-2 drives more differentiated and exhausted states, diminishing the quality of T-cell products. Understanding how cytokines of the IL2R family drive T-cell differentiation is essential to ultimately design optimal ACT protocols, safeguarding stem-like programs while ensuring sufficient T-cell expansion. Here, we show that cytokine signaling through IL2R{beta} supports more differentiated exhausted T cells in chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis infection. Similarly, high levels of IL-2 and IL-15 in vitro foster heightened differentiation and exhaustion of cells for adoptive cell therapy. In contrast, absence of IL2R{beta} in vivo or transient inhibition of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) or signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) in vitro favors features of T-cell stemness. Transcriptional analyses of in vitro expanded T cells further reveal that inhibition of STAT5 sustains a stemness program, which correlates with better antitumor activity in a mouse melanoma model. When applied to a human CAR T expansion model, inhibition of STAT5 supports memory progenitor differentiation and limit inhibitory receptor expression. These results demonstrate that continuous exposure to high levels of cytokines, such as IL-2 and IL-15, constrain CD8+ T cells towards more advanced states of exhaustion. In contrast, limiting cytokine signaling using specific kinase inhibitors preserves stem-like T-cell programs and enhance the quality of ACT products.

Although the anterior movement of the murine visceral endo-derm is well documented, the dynamics of the avian hypoblast remain poorly understood. Here, using live imaging and quantitative image analysis, we find that the hypoblast is mechanically coupled to the epiblast and does not migrate away from its posterior end. Instead, the hypoblast moves and deforms passively, in response to the forces transmitted from the epiblast that shape the primitive streak, after its induction. Furthermore, we show that the posterior hypoblast does not exert an inhibitory effect on the epiblast but instead expresses NODAL, which activates primitive streak formation. NODAL concomitantly regulates gene expression in the hypoblast, patterning it along the anteroposterior axis. Our results thus redefine how the primary axis is established in avians, demonstrating that the displacement of the hypoblast and its con-comitant anteroposterior patterning are consequences - rather than drivers - of primitive streak induction, downstream of NODAL signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

We combined these layer-specific fMRI responses with electroencephalography (EEG) responses for the same images to segregate feedforward and feedback signals in both time and space. Feedforward signals emerge early in the middle layers of EVC and LOC, followed by feedback signals in the superficial layer of both regions, and the deep layer of EVC. Comparing the identified dynamics in LOC to a visual deep neural network (DNN), revealed that early feedforward signals in LOC encode medium complexity features, whereas later feedback signals increase the representational format to high complexity features.

It is presently not well understood whether the fever response to IAV infection impacts subsequent viral replication and innate immune activation. Here we show that IAV infection at temperatures that simulate fever leads to increased mvRNA synthesis and antiviral signaling. Mathematical modeling and experimental analyses reveal that differential IAV nucleoprotein and RNA polymerase production underlies the increased mvRNA level. Moreover, at the higher infection temperature mvRNAs with dysregulating t-loops contribute most to the innate immune activation.

In extreme cases, like for photosynthetic organisms, their energy source, light, can fluctuate dramatically in intensity over timescales of seconds to hours. While various photosynthetic electron flows (EF) are crucial for maintaining bioenergetic homeostasis, how EFs are modulated to respond to dynamic energy intake remains unclear. Here, we show in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that each EF is best suited to a specific domain of energetic fluctuation periodicity for which it can support the cells energetic needs, which we term bandwidth. By systematically exposing cells to a range of light periodicities, we show that while cyclic EF has a large bandwidth, pseudo-cyclic EF (PCEF) can only sustain the cells energetic needs for fast light fluctuations, and that the interplay between the chloroplast and the mitochondria (CMEF) has a limited bandwidth. We further show that the bandwidths of PCEF and CMEF, specialized for dynamic lights, are related to their capacity to generate ATP and protect the photosynthetic apparatus. Finally, we show that in wild-type cells, the activity level of PCEF and CMEF matches their bandwidth, and we propose that cells tune the relative activity of each AEF depending on the light fluctuation frequency. Our work opens an avenue of research to characterize the molecular mechanisms required for phototrophic growth in complex and dynamic energetic landscapes. It further provides a generalizable framework for understanding the physiological importance of molecular mechanisms in a dynamic environment.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

Recent work has shown that virus-associated immune responses in the CNS may contribute to neuronal injury and long-term outcomes such as neurocognitive decline. However, the fundamental mechanisms that regulate acute infiltration of immune cells from vascular compartments into the CNS are not well defined. Using an attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus TC83 (referred to as TC83) to inoculate using olfactory and intracranial injections, we show that infection in the CNS and olfactory pathways results in rapid infiltration of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells as early as 3- and 5-days post-infection. CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells exhibit a bystander, memory phenotype (CD49d+, Tbet+, NKG2D+, Eomes+), are cytotoxic, and are recruited independent of antigen specific responses. We show that infiltration of CD8+ bystander T-cells is supported by microglia and infiltrating macrophage expression of IL-15 and interferon expression in the CNS. These innate antiviral immune signals support activation of bystander CD8+ T-cells in the CNS that contribute to tissue injury independent of virus replication at early time points post-infection. These data support a mechanism by IL-15 stimulates bystander memory CD8+ T-cells to enter the CNS and contribute to injury independent of antigen-specific stimulation.

ImportancePrior studies have shown that virus infections in the respiratory and olfactory nerve pathways can result in long term injury in the brain. However, the mechanisms that link virus infection in the olfactory neurons and brain injury are not understood. We show that virus infection of olfactory neurons results in immune stimulation in the brain of resident immune cells to release a cytokine called IL-15 and interferon. This results in infiltration and activation of non-specific T-cells that cause injury of neurons in the brain. This may be an important mechanism by which respiratory viruses and other viruses cause inflammation and injury in the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

ResultsWe present Autocycler, a command-line tool for generating accurate bacterial genome assemblies by combining multiple alternative long-read assemblies of the same genome. Without requiring user input, Autocycler builds a compacted De Bruijn graph from the input assemblies, clusters and filters contigs, trims overlaps and resolves consensus sequences by selecting the most common variant at each locus. It also supports manual curation when desired, allowing users to refine assemblies in challenging or important cases.

While there are compelling reasons to expect polygenic adaptation to be common, direct evidence for it is still lacking. In turn, there are hundreds of examples of large effect adaptations across species, but it is unclear whether they are a common occurrence in any given species. Synthesizing the different lines of evidence is further complicated by differences in study designs, limitations and biases. Here, we reframe this long-standing question in terms of the trait under selection and ask how the genetic basis of adaptation is expected to depend on key properties of the genetic variation in the trait (i.e., the trait genetics) and on the changes in selection pressures that act on it (i.e., the ""trait ecology""). To study this question, we consider a quantitative trait subject to stabilizing selection and model the response to selection when a population at mutation-selection-drift balance experiences a sudden shift in the optimal value. Using this model, we delimit how the contributions of large effect and polygenic changes to adaptation depend on the genetics and ecology of the trait, as well as other salient factors. This theory allows us to formulate testable predictions about when different modes of adaptation are expected and to outline a framework within which to interpret disparate sources of evidence about the genetic basis of adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1747778972813

To address this, we mapped chromatin accessibility in corticospinal neurons across postnatal development and found two distinct waves of restriction, an early, partial closure between P0 to P4, followed by a stronger, more widespread restriction from P7 into adulthood. We also asked whether the distance of injury influences chromatin remodeling and found that distal (thoracic) injuries triggered only modest changes, while proximal (intracortical) injuries led to much broader accessibility shifts, pointing to injury proximity as a key factor in epigenetic responsiveness. We then tested whether this restricted chromatin could be reopened by introducing PATZ1, a transcription factor normally expressed during early postnatal growth. AAV based delivery of PATZ1 after injury caused marked chromatin remodeling, including an 11.6 fold increase in H3K27ac at growth-relevant sites and large-scale reorganization of 3D genome structure, with compartment shifts toward active states and altered TAD boundaries. These changes were accompanied by reactivation of gene networks linked to developmental growth. Our results help define when and how chromatin becomes restrictive in CNS neurons and show that it can be reopened using targeted interventions like PATZ1 to support regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

Small modifications to Ub such as phosphorylation, acetylation, or ADP-ribosylation have varying impacts on signaling. The Deltex family of E3 ligases was previously implicated in the ubiquitylation of ADP-ribose (ADPr) and ADPr-containing macromolecules. Our previous work found ester-linked mono-ADPr ubiquitylation (MARUbylation) on PARP7 and PARP10 in cells and that this mark is extended with K11 polyUb. We previously screened for E3 ligases that interact with PARP7 through three different approaches and identified six candidates, including the Deltex family member DTX2. One of these hits, RNF114, interacts with various other PARPs, leading us to hypothesize that RNF114 binds to sites of MARUbylation and extends K11 polyUb. Here, we show that DTX2 generates the initial MARUbe on PARP7 in cells, which depends on PARP7 catalytic activity. The MARUbe on PARP7 is extended with K11 polyUb by RNF114. To investigate the mechanism of RNF114 reader/writer function, we developed a click chemistry-inspired chemoenzymatic approach to create a novel fluorescent Ub-ADPr probe for studying its interaction with RNF114. Strikingly, we found that RNF114 has a weak affinity for ADPr and Ub separately but explicitly recognizes the linkage between Ub and ADPr present in MARUbylated species. We used AlphaFold3 modeling to examine the mechanisms of Ub-ADPr recognition and K11-linked polyUb extension by RNF114. We identified a tandem Di19-UIM module in RNF114 as a MARUbe-binding domain (MUBD), thus providing a reader function that interfaces with K11-specific writer activity. Finally, we described a small family of MUBD-containing E3 ligases that demonstrate preference for Ub-ADPr, which we call MARUbe-Targeted Ligases (MUTLs).","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

However, some lineages remain recalcitrant to assembly despite recent advances in sequencing technologies and assembly tools. Birds present a substantial genome assembly challenge due to the presence of tiny, hard to assemble microchromosomes that are often highly fragmented or even missing in draft genome assemblies. As such, bird genomes require a large amount of expert manual curation effort via manipulation of genome-wide Hi-C contact maps and many current chromosome-level bird genome assemblies do not resolve the known karyotype. Microchromosomes have distinct genetic and epigenetic features. They are GC-biased, gene-rich, highly methylated, and have distinct spatial organisation in the centre of the nucleus. Importantly, they are conserved across avian evolution. Here, using a reference set of expert curated bird genomes, we have identified a set of conserved microchromosome genes and developed MicroFinder, a pipeline that uses this gene set to find small microchromosome fragments in draft genome assemblies to act as anchors for manual curation of microchromosomes. We demonstrate how MicroFinder can be used to improve the speed and accuracy of bird genome curation. Furthermore, we highlight the usefulness of MicroFinder by carrying out MicroFinder-enabled re-curation of 12 previously released chromosome-scale bird genome assemblies, increasing the sequence content of microchromosome models.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

This mutation-selection-drift-balance (MSDB) shapes the prevalence of a disease and its genetic architecture. To date, however, MSDB has only been modeled for monogenic (Mendelian) diseases. Here, we develop a MSDB model for complex disease susceptibility: we assume that genotype relates to disease risk according to the canonical liability threshold model and that selection on variants affecting risk derives from the fitness cost of the disease, and focus on diseases that are highly polygenic, entail a substantial fitness cost, and are neither extremely common in the population nor exceedingly rare. Contrasting model predictions with GWAS and other findings in humans suggests that directional selection plays little role in shaping common genetic variation affecting complex disease susceptibility but might substantially affect rare, large effect variation. In turn, common variation affecting complex disease susceptibility appears to be dominated by pleiotropic stabilizing selection on other traits. Our results further suggest that current estimates of disease heritability are likely biased. More generally, our model provides a better understanding of the evolutionary processes that shape the architecture and prevalence of complex diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

Preserving locomotive capacity was likely essential for survival during the human hunter-gatherer period but surprisingly little is known about the molecular effects of energy deficit on human skeletal muscle, which is a key tissue for locomotion and metabolic health. Here we show that a 5-day 78% reduction in energy availability with concomitant aerobic exercise in healthy men leads to a profound modulation of skeletal muscle phenotype alongside increases in fat oxidation at rest and during exercise and a 2.1 {+/-} 0.8 kg loss of fat free mass and 0.8 {+/-} 0.6 kg of fat mass. We used stable isotope (D2O) labelling and peptide mass spectrometry to investigate the abundance and turnover rates of individual proteins. Abundance (1469 proteins) and synthesis rate (736 proteins) data discovered a shift toward a more oxidative phenotype and reorganisation of cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix structure during energy deficit. Mitochondrial components: TCA, electron transport chain and beta-oxidation, were prominently represented amongst proteins that increased in abundance and synthesis rate, as well as proteins related to mitochondrial proteostasis, remodelling and quality-control such as BDH1 and LONP1. Changes in muscle metabolic pathways occurred alongside a reduction in extracellular matrix proteins, which may counteract the age-related muscle fibrosis.

This view stems from findings linking trait anxiety and transdiagnostic internalizing symptoms to learning impairments in laboratory tasks often used as proxies for real-world behavioral flexibility. These tasks typically require learners to adjust learning rates dynamically in response to uncertainty, for instance, increasing learning from prediction errors in volatile environments. However, prior studies have produced inconsistent and sometimes contradictory findings regarding the nature and extent of learning impairments in populations with internalizing disorders. To address this, we conducted eight experiments (N = 820) using predictive inference and reversal learning tasks, and applied a bi-factor analysis to capture internalizing symptom variance shared across and differentiated between anxiety and depression. While we observed robust evidence for adaptive learning-rate modulation across participants, we found no convincing evidence of a systematic relationship between internalizing symptoms and either learning rates or task performance. These findings challenge prominent claims that learning difficulties are a hallmark feature of internalizing psychopathology and suggest that the relationship between these traits and adaptive behavior under uncertainty may be more subtle than previously thought.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

While long-read sequencing technologies promise to resolve complex genomic regions and improve variant detection, their application in polyploid and complex genomes remains challenging. Here, we systematically investigate the factors influencing variant calling accuracy using long reads. Using human trio data with known variants to simulate variable ploidy levels (diploid, tetraploid, hexaploid), we demonstrate that while variant sites can often be identified accurately, genotyping accuracy significantly decreases with increasing ploidy due to allelic dosage uncertainty. This highlights a specific challenge in assigning correct allele counts in polyploids even with high depth, separate from the initial variant discovery. We then assessed variant detection performance in genomes with varying complexity: the relatively simple diploid Fragaria vesca, the tetraploid Solanum tuberosum, and the highly repetitive diploid Zea mays. Our results reveal that overall variant calling accuracy correlates more strongly with inherent genome complexity (e.g., repeat content) than with ploidy level alone. Furthermore, we identify a critical mechanism impacting variant discovery: structural variations between the reference and sample genomes, particularly those containing repetitive elements, induce spurious read mapping. This leads to false variant calls, constituting a distinct and more dominant source of error than allelic-dosage uncertainty. Our findings underscore the multifaceted challenges in long-read variant analysis and highlight the need for ploidy-aware genotypers, complexity-informed variant callers, and bias-aware mapping strategies to fully realize the potential of long reads in diverse organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

We mapped the neural time-courses of 12 choice-relevant food attributes. Participants (N = 110) viewed food images while we recorded brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG). A separate group of participants (N = 421) rated the same images on nutritive properties (healthiness, calorie content, edibility, and level of transformation), hedonic properties (tastiness, willingness to eat, negative and positive valence, and arousal), and familiarity (previous exposure, recognisability, and typicality). Using representational similarity analysis, we quantified differences in patterns of multivariate EEG signals across foods and assessed whether the structure of these differences was correlated with differences in attribute ratings. We observed similar correlation time-courses for many attributes. There was an early window of correlations ([~]200 ms from image onset), followed by sustained windows of correlation from [~]400-650 ms. Using principal components analysis, we identified a set of broader constructs that accounted for variance in ratings across multiple attributes, and also correlated with the EEG data.

The use of ExM has revealed several novel insights into the nanoscale architectures of cellular protein complexes, especially the microtubule cytoskeleton in model and non-model systems. Despite tremendous progress in expansion microscopy protocols that preserve cellular ultrastructure (U-ExM), compatible probes for imaging actin isoforms with U-ExM are still lacking and have hindered the study of diverse actin isoforms and networks across model systems. Here, we use IntAct, an internally tagged actin that incorporates into cellular actin networks, to develop and optimize U-ExM of diverse actin network types in both yeast and mammalian cells. Using expression of ALFA-tagged IntAct variants in yeast and mammalian cells, we show robust visualization of actin patches, cables, and rings in yeast and diverse actin networks such as actin cortex, stress fibers, filopodia, lamellipodium in mammalian cells at improved resolution. We also detect transient nuclear actin filaments using IntAct-U-ExM underscoring the advantages offered by our approach to image understudied actin structures. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of IntAct-U-ExM for performing super-resolution imaging of various actin structures in an isoform-specific manner and highlight the potential of IntAct to study the nanoscale organization of diverse actin cytoskeletal networks across species.

In 2023, external funding accounted for 21% of total TB expenditures, with the U.S. contributing over 55% of these funds. The withdrawal of U.S. support threatens essential TB services, including diagnostics, treatment, TB-HIV co-infection interventions, and research initiatives critical to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for TB eradication.

MethodsThis study analyses the dependency of 26 high-burden TB countries (HBCs) on U.S. funding and models the potential impact of funding cuts on TB incidence and mortality. Countries were classified into low (0-22%), moderate (23-37%), and high (>37%) dependency groups based on three-year expenditure data. A deterministic compartmental model simulated service disruptions under three recovery scenarios: (1) minimal impact (services recover within three months), (2) moderate impact (recovery within one year), and (3) worst-case scenario (permanent service reduction). Extrapolations were made for all 26 HBCs based on representative countries from each dependency category.

FindingsFunding cuts are projected to result in substantial increases in TB cases and deaths across the three scenarios. In a high-dependency country, cumulative TB cases could rise by 2.1% (CI 1.5 - 2.5), 5.4% (CI4 - 6.5), or 36% (CI 25 - 47), and TB deaths by 2.9%(CI 2.2 - 3.5), 7.8%(CI 5.9 - 9.2), 68%(CI 45 - 86), depending on the severity of service disruptions. Across all 26 HBCs, additional TB cases are estimated at 0.63 million (CI 0.45 - 0.81) (minimal impact), 1.66 million (CI 1.2 - 2.1) (moderate impact), and 10.67 million (CI 7.85 - 13.19) (worst-case). Corresponding TB deaths are projected to increase by 99,800 (CI 65,200-130,000), 268,600 (CI 185,800-337,900), and 2,243,700 (CI 1,570,800-2,807,300), respectively. The findings underscore the catastrophic consequences of the funding cut, particularly in countries highly reliant on U.S. support.

InterpretationThe loss of U.S. funding endangers global TB control, jeopardizing End TB and SDG targets. While some nations may adapt, short-term disruptions will severely impact vulnerable populations. Urgent alternative funding is needed to sustain TB prevention and treatment efforts and mitigate the effects of aid withdrawal.

Then, we model an ASD mutation impacting CHD8, showing both granule cell and oligodendrocyte lineages prominently affected, resulting in altered network activity in more mature organoids. Lastly, using CRISPR/Cas9 editing, we also model an evolution-relevant mutation in a regulatory region of the CADPS2 gene. We investigate the effect of the derived allele exclusive to Homo sapiens, identifying a rerouting of the CADPS2-expression in rhombic lip cells, coupled with a different sensitivity to hypoxia which in turn lead to a differential timing of granule cell differentiation.

However, efficient and lossless indexing of such structures remains challenging due to the scale and complexity of pangenomic data. We present a practical and scalable indexing framework based on tag arrays, which annotate positions in the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) with graph coordinates. Our method extends the FM-index with a run-length compressed tag structure that enables efficient retrieval of all unique graph locations where a query pattern appears. We introduce a novel construction algorithm that combines unique k-mers, graph-based extensions, and haplotype traversal to compute the tag array in a memory-efficient manner. To support large genomes, we process each chromosome independently and then merge the results into a unified index using properties of the multi-string BWT and r-index. Our evaluation on the HPRC graphs demonstrates that the tag array structure compresses effectively, scales well with added haplotypes, and preserves accurate mapping information across diverse regions of the genome. This indexing method enables lossless and haplotype-aware querying in complex pangenomes and offers a practical indexing layer to develop scalable aligners and downstream graph-based analysis tools.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

It has been proposed that targeting {beta}- oxidation could shorten treatment duration by killing non-replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis within granulomas in the lungs. Here we show that Mycobacterium smegmatis, a fast growing and nonpathogenic model for energy metabolism in M. tuberculosis, relies on EtfD for extracting energy from {beta}-oxidation. Electron cryomicroscopy allowed structure determination of M. smegmatis EtfD, revealing an unusual linear [3Fe-4S] cluster that has not been seen in other protein structures, but which resembles the catalytic noncubane [4Fe-4S] clusters in heterodisulfide reductases. The structure suggests how EtfD transfers electrons from {beta}-oxidation to the electron transport chain.

While data-dependent acquisition (DDA) has been the standard for navigating through the complexity associated with non-enzymatic immunopeptide database searches, data-independent acquisition (DIA) is increasingly adopted in immunopeptidomics research. In this work, we compare diaPASEF to conventional ddaPASEF in terms of global immunopeptidome profiling and bacterial epitope discovery of the model intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. We show that DIA spectrum-centric workflows that search pseudo-MS/MS spectra complement DDA analysis by uncovering additional human and bacterial immunopeptides. Furthermore, we leveraged DIA-NN for generating and searching proteome-wide predicted HLA class I peptide spectral libraries, scoring approximately 150 million immunopeptide peptide precursors. This approach outperformed other spectrum-based methods in identification of MHC class I peptides and recovered low-abundant peptide precursors missed by other methods.

While exteroceptive stimuli, such as food and drugs of abuse, are well-established activators of DA-neuron activity, growing evidence indicates that interoceptive signals also play a critical role in modulating reward. Among these, the gut-brain vagal axis has emerged as a key pathway, yet its precise contribution to mesolimbic DA-dependent signaling, dynamics and behaviors remains poorly defined.

Here, we combine complementary ex vivo and in vivo approaches across multiple scales to investigate how the gut-brain vagal axis regulates DA dynamics and reward-related behaviors. We show that gut-brain vagal tone is essential for gating mesolimbic DA system activity and functions, modulating DA-dependent molecular and cellular processes, and scaling both food- and drugs-induced reinforcement.

These findings challenge the traditional brain-centric view of reward processing, supporting a more unified and integrated model in which gut-derived and vagus-mediated interoceptive signals are pivotal in intrinsically shaping motivation and reinforcement. By uncovering the influence of gut-brain vagal communication on mesolimbic DA functions, this work offers new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying both adaptive and maladaptive reward processes, with broad implications for eating disorders and addiction.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

Several recent studies have demonstrated performance gains from pretraining neural foundation models on multi-session datasets, seemingly overcoming this challenge. However, these studies typically lack fine-grained data scaling analyses. It remains unclear how different sources of heterogeneity influence model performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, and whether all sessions contribute equally to downstream performance gains. In this work, we systematically investigate how data heterogeneity impacts the scaling behavior of neural data transformers (NDTs) in neural activity prediction. We found that explicit sources of heterogeneity, such as brain region mismatches among sessions, reduced scaling benefits of neuronand region-level activity prediction performances. For tasks that do exhibit consistent scaling, we identified implicit data heterogeneity arising from cross-session variability. Through our proposed session-selection procedure, models pretrained on as few as five selected sessions outperformed those pretrained on the entire dataset of 84 sessions. Our findings challenge the direct applicability of traditional scaling laws to neural data and suggest that prior claims of multi-session scaling benefits may be premature. This work both highlights the importance of incremental data scaling analyses and suggests new avenues toward optimally selecting pretraining data when developing foundation models on large-scale neuroscience datasets.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

However, the evolution of the cichlid axial skeleton has been largely overlooked, despite its high variation and functional significance for locomotion. Here, we present the first macroevolutionary study of axial morphology in African cichlids, based on phylogenetic comparative analyses of 4861 individuals from 583 species. Adaptation to demersal, pelagic, and piscivorous niches has led to the evolution of elongate bodies with high vertebral counts in lacustrine cichlids, emphasising the role of the fusiform body shape in ecological adaptation. However, riverine species occupy a broader axial morphospace than lacustrine species, which is partly explained by a higher stochastic rate of vertebral count evolution in riverine lineages. In addition, the occupied axial morphospace broadly correlates with the estimated age of the lacustrine radiations, suggesting that exploration of axial morphospace is a function of divergence time. However, rates of vertebral count evolution are not the same across the lake radiations. Therefore, accumulated variation in vertebral counts (and more broadly axial morphospace) is not solely a function of divergence time. Finally, we show that the common ancestor of African cichlids possessed a distinctly riverine axial morphology, indicating that the exploration of axial morphospace radiated outward from this ancestral riverine form. These findings highlight the importance of a comparative approach to studying cichlid evolution and underscore the value of African cichlids as a model for investigating the evolutionary and developmental dynamics of the teleostean vertebral column.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

The vast majority of the degrons are dependent on the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme and the proteasome but independent of autophagy. The results reveal both known and novel degron motifs, both internal as well as at the C-terminus. Mapping the degrons onto protein structures, predicted by AlphaFold2, revealed that most of the degrons are located in buried regions, indicating that they only become active upon unfolding or misfolding. Training of a machine learning model allowed us to probe the degron properties further and predict the cellular abundance of missense variants that operate by forming degrons in exposed and disordered protein regions, thus providing a mechanism of pathogenicity for germline coding variants at such positions.","NA","biorxiv",1747778972813

A major unresolved question concerns whether these changes are driven by the illness itself or represent iatrogenic effects of antipsychotic medication.

MethodsWe report findings from a triple-blind randomised placebo-controlled MRI study where 62 antipsychotic- naive people with first episode psychosis (FEP) received either an atypical antipsychotic or a placebo pill over a treatment period of 6 months. A healthy control group (n=27) was also recruited. Anatomical T1-weighed scans were collected at baseline, 3-months, and 12-months. Linear mixed effects models were fitted to >160,000 cortical surface loci to examine illness- and antipsychotic-related changes in cortical thickness. We also examined whether cortical changes were enriched within canonical functional networks or cytoarchitectonic types of laminar differentiation, and whether these changes spatially correlated with normative in vivo receptor/transporter densities via PET imaging and ex vivo transcriptomically-imputed cell densities.

ResultsWe found widespread cortical thinning over 12 months (p<.05FDR) in people with FEP who received placebo compared to healthy controls, with the largest effects occurring in frontal, cingulate, and occipital areas. No significant difference was detected in antipsychotic-treated people with FEP compared to healthy controls. Thickness differences in placebo group were not preferentially concentrated within any specific functional networks, although highly differentiated koniocortical areas were relatively protected from cortical thinning (pspin<.05FDR). Thinning in the placebo group spatially aligned with normative distributions of GABAA/BZ, 5HT1B, 5HT2A, and H3 receptors (.17 < r < .28; pspin<.05FDR). No significant associations between cortical thinning and symptom changes were identified.

ConclusionsWidespread thinning of cortical grey matter occurs over the first year of FEP in people who do not receive antipsychotic treatment. No such thinning is evident in patients receiving antipsychotics during the study intervention phase. These findings suggest that cortical thinning in the early stages of psychosis is an illness-related phenomenon that may be mitigated by early antipsychotic exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1747778972813

Ireland launched a RSV immunisation pathfinder programme for newborns and other clinically vulnerable infants in September of 2024. While a comprehensive evaluation of the programme is underway, we aimed to rapidly analyse the impact of the programme on infant RSV hospitalisations. Based on an analysis of notified RSV hospitalisations spanning this and four previous seasons using generalised additive models, we estimated that there was a 75% reduction in the incidence rate for nirsevimab eligible infants born this season, conditional on the age-group and season effects adjusted for in the model (incidence rate ratio 0.25; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.33). This corresponded to an estimated 532 RSV hospitalisations averted (95%CI 369 to 695) for this group, in this season.","NA","medrxiv",1747778972813
