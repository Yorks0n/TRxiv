In 2025, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) was dismantled, and other countries also announced cuts to overseas development assistance. We quantified potential epidemiological impacts attributable to these reductions in international donor funding. Methods We calibrated a deterministic tuberculosis model to epidemiological indicators in low- and middle-income countries. We projected three future scenarios assuming: a) levels of funding in 2024 continue through 2035, b) termination of USAID funding from 2025, and c) additional reductions in funding through The Global Fund in line with current donor announcements from 2025. We assumed a reduction in tuberculosis treatment initiation rates proportional to budget reductions for each scenario, estimating cumulative excess incident episodes of symptomatic tuberculosis and tuberculosis deaths. Findings We modelled 79 countries, representing 91% of global tuberculosis incidence and 90% of global tuberculosis mortality in 2023. Our modelling suggested that the termination of USAID funding may lead to 420 500 excess tuberculosis deaths by 2035. Further reductions in funding in line with current announcements by the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and Germany may lead to an additional 699 200, 63 100, 50 500, and 30 500 TB deaths, respectively. Impacts would be greatest in low-income countries. Interpretation We estimate substantial potential impacts on tuberculosis morbidity and mortality due to reductions in international donor funding. Expanded support from domestic and international donors is essential to address immediate gaps in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Funding This work was unfunded.","NA","medrxiv",1745791689559

In this study, we performed comprehensive cellular and transcriptional immunometabolic profiling within a cohort that included SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (NC, N=30) and individuals with prior COVID-19 ([~]4-months) who fully recovered (RC, N=38) or went on to experience Long COVID symptoms (N=58). Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing. Our findings support a profound and persistent immunometabolic dysfunction that follows SARS-CoV-2 which may form the pathophysiologic substrate for LC. Our findings suggest that trials of therapeutics that help restore immune and metabolic homeostasis may be warranted to prevent, reduce, or resolve LC symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1745791689559

Notably, in the past two decades, the incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer, affecting individuals under the age of 50 years, has doubled in many countries. The reasons for this increase are unknown. Here, we investigate whether mutational processes contribute to geographic and age-related differences by examining 981 colorectal cancer genomes from 11 countries. No major differences were found in microsatellite unstable cancers, but variations in mutation burden and signatures were observed in the 802 microsatellite-stable cases. Multiple signatures, most with unknown etiologies, exhibited varying prevalence in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Russia, and Thailand, indicating geographically diverse levels of mutagenic exposure. Signatures SBS88 and ID18, caused by the bacteria-produced mutagen colibactin, had higher mutation loads in countries with higher colorectal cancer incidence rates. SBS88 and ID18 were also enriched in early-onset colorectal cancers, being 3.3 times more common in individuals diagnosed before age 40 than in those over 70, and were imprinted early during colorectal cancer development. Colibactin exposure was further linked to APC driver mutations, with ID18 responsible for about 25% of APC driver indels in colibactin-positive cases. This study reveals geographic and age-related variations in colorectal cancer mutational processes, and suggests that early-life mutagenic exposure to colibactin-producing bacteria may contribute to the rising incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer.","NA","medrxiv",1745791689559

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are effective anti-glycemic and weight-loss medications with a strong safety record. There is substantial preclinical evidence and mounting retrospective and prospective randomized controlled trial evidence that GLP-1RAs could be effective for reducing alcohol consumption. However, the mechanism by which GLP-1RAs reduce alcohol intake remains unclear. While medications that reduce alcohol intake such as naltrexone and acamprosate have central nervous system action, disulfiram reduces alcohol intake through peripheral mechanisms. Here, we test whether GLP-1RAs alter alcohol's peripheral pharmacokinetics as a potential mechanism of action for their alcohol intake suppressive effects. In this pilot study, twenty participants with obesity in the GLP-1RA or control group consumed a challenge dose of alcohol and we measured breath alcohol (BrAC) and the subjective effects of alcohol. We observed a delayed rise in BrAC and subjective effects in the GLP-1RA group as compared to controls, that was not explained by nausea.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1745791689559

Yet, multiplexing samples and target assays is difficult and the dependence of NAATs on enzymes increases false negative rates with inhibitor-rich environmental samples. The Nanostring nCounter system (NNS) is a nucleic acid hybridization platform with a capability for high multiplexing (upwards of 800 probes) that directly counts RNA or DNA biomarkers without reverse transcription or amplification. This study determines the feasibility of direct detection and quantification of genetic markers of public health significance in wastewater samples using NNS and compares the performance with gold-standard NAAT assays targeting antimicrobial resistance (AMR) DNA loci, 16S DNA, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and the fecal content markers, Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) RNA and crAssphage DNA. We demonstrate that the direct detection and quantification of high- and medium-copy markers, including PMMoV RNA, beta-lactamase, and carbapenemase DNA, in wastewater extracts is both feasible and accurate when benchmarked against gold-standard NAATs. Low-copy detection and monitoring daily trends of SARS-CoV-2 N RNA was achievable but was not as robust as NAATs. Due to the lower analytical sensitivity of NNS compared to NAATs and the requirement of a 18h hybridization step, NNS may not be suitable to provide early warning of incident cases to public health. However, as the scope of wastewater surveillance expands to monitor a broad range of nucleic acid-based biomarkers, the target and sample multiplexing capability of NNS, combined with reduced hands-on time and ease-of-analysis, are distinct advantages. Thus, NNS has a role to play in wastewater and environmental monitoring applications, especially for AMR surveillance.","NA","medrxiv",1745791689559

We analyzed multimodal MRI data on 298 healthy controls, 282 TLE patients, and 45 disease controls with extratemporal epilepsy. Cortical function was profiled at local, regional, and global scales using brain signal variability, regional homogeneity, and node strength. We estimated patient-specific W-score maps to index deviations from normative metrics. Compared to healthy controls, patients with TLE showed considerable variations in patterns of functional alterations across the cortex, with the highest overlap in the ipsilateral mesiotemporal regions. Connectome-based simulation revealed the paralimbic and medial default mode regions as key disease epicenters. Functional changes were primarily underpinned by superficial white matter anomalies. Supervised pattern learning achieved classification AUCs of 0.76 for TLE versus disease controls, 0.74 for left versus right TLE, and 0.63 for seizure-free versus non-seizure-free TLE, with greater contralateral temporal functional deviations correlating with unfavorable postsurgical seizure outcome.

High-quality genomes were assessed for genetic relatedness using [&le;]3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) cut-off, except for rhinovirus (10 SNPs). Patient health records were reviewed for genetically related clusters to identify epidemiological connections. Results We collected 436 viral specimens from 359 patients: rhinovirus (n=291), influenza (n=50), HMPV (n=47), and RSV (n=48). Of these, 55% (197/359 patients) were from pediatric hospital and 45% from adult hospitals. Patients ranged in age from 14 days to 93 years, 61% were male, and 74% were white.

Although physiotherapists (PTs) often use reassurance strategies, the perception of the different reassuring messages remains unclear.

ObjectiveTo investigate perceptions of confidence of different reassurance messages delivered by PTs to people with LBP.

MethodsA survey was conducted among 544 participants with LBP. The survey included 21 reassuring messages divided into six themes  Prevalence and statistics,  Red flag,  Natural healing,  Imaging,  Treatment strategies, and  Pain physiology. Participants had to rate the extent to which each message increased their confidence using a 5-point Likert scale. Messages were categorized into four levels of perceived confidence based on participants responses: high ([&ge;]80% rated the message as  provide confidence or  significantly provide confidence), moderate (60-79%), low (40-59%) and very low ([&le;]40%). Correlation and non-parametric analyses examined the relationships between confidence ratings, demographic variables and personality traits.

ResultsMessages that emphasized patient autonomy and the absence of red flags were perceived as particularly reassuring and received the highest ratings ([&ge;]80%). In contrast, messages that referred to natural healing and the neurophysiology of pain were perceived as less effective in providing confidence. Personality traits and background characteristics had minimal effects on perceived reassurance.

ConclusionsReassuring communication that emphasizes patient autonomy and the low likelihood of serious pathology can boost confidence in individuals with LBP and may be more impactful than patient-specific characteristics. These findings may help PTs refine their communication strategies and strengthen therapeutic relationships, potentially leading to better treatment outcomes. Future research should explore the implications of these findings in clinical settings in real-life interactions.","NA","medrxiv",1745791689559

To achieve the high rates of temporally precise synaptic transmission over long periods of time, IHCs employ sophisticated ribbon-type active zones (AZ). In order for us to understand synaptic sound encoding, we need to decipher the underpinning molecular topography of these synapse which had remained challenging due to technological limitations. Here we applied 3-dimensional minimal flux optical nanoscopy to mouse IHC synapses to chart the position of key pre- and postsynaptic proteins with single digit nanometre resolution of imaging. We demonstrate that nanoclusters of channels and interacting proteins govern the topography of AZs and postsynaptic densities (PSDs). We count synaptic proteins, their nanoclusters and determine their spatial organization feeding into computational modelling of AZ function.

However, the precise mechanisms driving transmission between poultry premises and the impact of potential control measures in Great Britain, such as vaccination, are not fully understood. We have developed a spatial transmission model for the spread of HPAI in poultry premises calibrated to infected premises data for the 2022--23 season using Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Diagnostic short-read RNA-Sequencing identified aberrant expression of TCOF1 and optical genome mapping detected a large genomic insertion therein. Long-read genome sequencing (LR-GS) resolved a deep intronic 3.5 kb SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion in intron 17 of TCOF1. Long read RNA-Seq demonstrated that the insertion was partially exonized inducing isoform switch to the shorter non-canonical TCOF1 isoform c. SVA-insertion was confirmed in both half-siblings and we detected mosaicism in the father. This is the first description of a retrotransposon causing TCS, and the first intronic SVA causing isoform switch as a disease mechanism.

Molecular diagnosis for FSHD following clinical description currently involves complex, multi-step and low resolution assays, aiming at identifying contractions on permissive haplotypes (FSHD type 1) or epigenetic reactivation (FSHD type 2) due to pathogenic variants in the epigenetic machinery (most often in SMCHD1).Here we leverage ultra-long whole-genome and Cas9-targeted sequencing to develop a fast and accurate workflow, D4Z4End2End, to comprehensively charactere the genetics and methylation of D4Z4 alleles. We apply it to samples from patients affected by FSHD1, FSHD2, and another disease caused by SMCHD1 variants, Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome (BAMS), as well as publicly-available data from the 1000 Genomes Project and Human Pangenome Reference Consortium. We attain high read depth sequencing of full-length D4Z4 arrays of up to 40 repeat units (~132 kb), accurately capture contracted arrays, genetic mosaicism, and pathogenic SMCHD1 variants, and generate accurate consensus sequences of the full set of D4Z4 alleles for variant analysis. Moreover, we identify new allelic variants, analyse complex D4Z4 rearrangements including in-cis duplications, and reveal striking length- and SMCHD1 status-dependent methylation patterns across the D4Z4 array.

Identifying distinct subphenotypes and understanding potential personalized modifications remain critical unmet needs. Methods: We applied unsupervised learning techniques to electronic medical records from UCSF to identify distinct Alzheimer's disease subphenotypes based on comorbidity profiles. We conducted enrichment analyses to determine cluster-specific comorbidities. Based on the observed sex-based differences, we subsequently conducted sex-stratified analyses to assess differences in disease manifestations between males and females. Findings were validated using an independent UC-Wide dataset. Results: Among 8,363 patients, we identified five Alzheimer's disease subphenotypes, characterized by comorbidities related to cardiovascular conditions, gastrointestinal disorders, and frailty-related conditions such as pneumonia and pressure ulcers. Sex-stratified analyses revealed significant differences in comorbidity distributions across clusters. Notably, in Cluster 2, circulatory diseases were more prevalent among males, whereas in Cluster 3, bladder stones were more common among females. Key results were consistent across the UCSF and UC-Wide datasets. Conclusions: Our study identifies clinically meaningful Alzheimer's disease subphenotypes and highlights sex-specific variations, suggesting potential underlying biological factors such as Apolipoprotein E and gut microbiome alterations contributing to Alzheimer's disease heterogeneity.

Non-invasive electrophysiological biomarkers like phase amplitude coupling (PAC) hold promise for understanding and managing PD. This study aims to investigate the modulations of levodopa and locomotion in cortical and cortico-muscular beta-gamma PAC by monitoring central EEG (cEEG) and gastrocnemius EMG (gEMG) and discuss their potential utility as biomarkers for monitoring motor impairments. Methods The cEEGs and gEMGs were recorded in 30 PD patients during sitting, standing, and free walking under OFF and ON dopaminergic medication. Spectral features, cEEG and cEEG-gEMG PAC were analyzed to assess the effects of levodopa, locomotion, and their correlations with PD symptoms. Results Longer gait cycle intervals and shorter step lengths were observed OFF levodopa, correlating with UPDRS-III. The cEEG beta-gamma PAC during sitting and standing, and cEEG-gEMG beta-gamma PAC during walking, positively correlated with UPDRS-III OFF levodopa. The cEEG alpha/low beta-gamma and cEEG-gEMG low beta-gamma PAC increased during levodopa withdrawal while walking, with the latter correlating with reduced step length. Step event-related PAC analysis unveiled the enhancement of alpha/beta cEEG-gamma gEMG PAC around heel strikes in ON levodopa compared to OFF. Conclusions Elevated cEEG and cEEG-gEMG beta-gamma PAC in various locomotion are associated with Parkinsonian motor impairments, whereas cEEG-gEMG low beta-gamma PAC is linked specifically to gait dysfunction. Levodopa administration enhances the dynamic fluctuations of alpha/beta oscillations during free walking. These findings demonstrated that the cortical and cortico-muscular couplings are significantly impacted by both levodopa and locomotion status, hinting the context-dependent nature of PAC and its potential utility in the development of gait phase-locked aDBS strategies for PD patients.","NA","medrxiv",1745791689559

Understanding their longitudinal trajectory in the untreated state is key to their use as potential markers of pharmacodynamic response. To this end, we undertook a large-scale proteomic study in well-phenotyped cohorts to identify biomarker candidates of ALS disease state and disease progression. Methods: Clinical phenotypic data and biofluid samples, collected from patients with ALS and healthy controls through multiple longitudinal natural history studies, were used to identify biomarker candidates. SOMAmer (Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer)-based relatively quantitative measurement of ~7,000 proteins was performed in plasma and CSF, with immunoassay validation of candidates of interest. Results: We identified 329 plasma proteins significantly differentially regulated between ALS and controls (adjusted p-value <0.05), with 25 showing >40% relative abundance. PDLIM3, TNNT2, and MYL11 had the greatest log-fold elevation, while ANTXR2 and ART3 had the greatest log-fold reduction. A similar set of plasma proteins was found to increase (e.g. PDLIM3, TNNT2, MYL11) or decrease (e.g. ANTXR2, ART3, MSTN) with disease progression. CSF proteins with the greatest log-fold elevation included NEFL, NEFH, CHIT1, CA3, MYL11 and GPNMB. These results were confirmed in an independent replication cohort. Moreover, tissue-specific signature enrichment suggests a significant contribution of muscle as a source of these biomarkers.

However, the causal role of robotic assistance in sensorimotor recovery, an underlying core mechanistic feature, remains unclear. Objective: This study systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on upper-limb rehabilitation that isolated the effect of robotic assistance by comparing similar interventions differing only in presence, level, or mode of robotic assistance. Method: Three electronic bibliographic databases- PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched. Twelve RCTs were included in the qualitative synthesis, and data from eight studies (all involving stroke survivors) were meta-analysed with the Fugl-Meyer Assessment score (measure of impairment) as the primary outcome. The main analysis was done to assess the overall effect of robotic assistance, regardless of disease stage, assistance level and targeted limb area, whereas subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of robot-assisted therapy on chronic stroke survivors and to compare therapies focused on the shoulder-elbow versus the hand (wrist/fingers). Results: The main analyses yielded a significant positive effect size (0.462) favouring robotic assistance in impairment recovery, however with a significant heterogeneity between the studies. Subgroup analyses suggested potential benefits in chronic phase (moderate significant effect size 0.588), and similar therapy gain for shoulder-elbow and hand-specific training. Conclusion: Limited available RCTs with small sample sizes and moderate heterogeneity prevented any firm conclusion to be drawn, and highlighted the need for systematic, controlled studies with large sample sizes to better understand the direct role (mechanistic feature) of robotic assistance in sensorimotor recovery.","NA","medrxiv",1745791689559

We sought to determine trends in the use of fomepizole for acetaminophen poisoning. Methods: This is a cross-sectional analysis of hospitalized patients with acetaminophen poisoning from January 2013 through December 2024, using Epic Cosmos, a research database of 298 million patients nationally. We identified encounters involving acetaminophen poisoning by International Classification of Diseases, version 10 (ICD-10-CM) code. Data extracted included administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and fomepizole, demographic data, and outcomes of death and liver transplantation. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to identify trends and multivariable logistic regression to determine associations with death or liver transplant. Results: There were 114,111 hospital encounters involving acetaminophen poisoning with 64,957 (56.92%) receiving NAC, and 1,552 (1.36%) receiving fomepizole. In 2013, 0.44% of NAC-treated acetaminophen poisoning cases also received fomepizole. This rose to 6.27% in 2024. From 2013 to 2019, the proportion of NAC-treated acetaminophen cases receiving fomepizole was stable, but from 2019-2024, there was a 1029.64% increase in fomepizole use. Regression modeling indicated increased odds for death (OR=5.88, aOR=5.32 [95% CI: 4.52, 6.27]) and liver transplantation (OR=4.99, aOR=4.91 [95% CI: 2.10, 11.48]) among those who received fomepizole in addition to NAC, indicating increased fomepizole use in patients with severe toxicity.

IAV infections trigger inflammation and tissue damage, promoting lung fibrosis. Unraveling these mechanisms is key to preventing and treating viral-induced pulmonary fibrosis and its lasting impact on respiratory health. Despite available antivirals and vaccines, there is a lack of FDA-approved therapeutics for severe or prolonged IAV pathogenesis. We modeled infection with a recombinant highly pathogenic human A/Texas/37/2024 H5N1 (rHPh-TX H5N1) strain using human airway organoids (HAO) to investigate viral replication, innate immune response, infection-induced fibrogenesis, and therapeutic approaches. The rHPh-TX H5N1 replicated efficiently, triggering a potent interferon (IFN) response and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in HAO. Prolonged infection led to increased fibroblast-like cells surrounding infected areas, characterized by increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (-SMA) expression and upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-{beta}), which caused fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix remodeling. Fibrosis-associated markers (FN, COL1A, COL3A, MMP2, MMP9) were significantly higher than in HAO infected with a pandemic recombinant A/California/04/09 H1N1 (pH1N1). Notably, Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein kinase (ROCK) pathway inhibition reduced fibrogenesis, with ROCK1 inhibition proving more effective than ROCK2 inhibition.

However, cost and invasiveness preclude EGD in those who have no prior GERD symptoms, despite having other risk factors, representing missed opportunities for BE screening in individuals who account for approximately 40% of the patients who eventually develop esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).

AimThe aim of this study was to evaluate if non-endoscopic methods can enable BE detection in an at-risk population without GERD symptoms.

MethodsPatients presenting for colonoscopy who had not undergone previous EGD plus had [&ge;]3 BE risk factors (from among age >50 years, male sex, white race, smoking history, family history of BE/EAC, or central obesity) without chronic GERD symptoms were prospectively recruited for non-endoscopic screening. Trained nurses administered the EsoCheck (Lucid Diagnostics) encapsulated balloon. Samples were assayed with the EsoGuard BE detection methylated DNA marker panel (Lucid Diagnostics). Patients with a positive result were offered standard-of-care EGD, while patients with a negative EG result were offered free of cost research EGD. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and BE prevalence were calculated.

ResultsThe mean age of the 132 study subjects was 60.7 years, 129 (98%) were white, 124 (94%) were male, 71 (54%) had a prior smoking history, 46 (35%) were centrally obese, and 5 (4%) reported a family history. EsoCheck was successfully administered in 124 (94%) and the EsoGuard methylated DNA marker panel could be assayed in 120 (97%) of the samples. Thirty-four assays were positive of which 27 underwent a follow-up EGD and BE was identified in 9, PPV = 33% [17%, 54%] subjects. EGD was also performed in 22 of the 86 subjects whose assays were negative and none of them had BE, NPV = 100% [85%, 100%]. A logistic regression model fitted to impute the presence of BE estimated the PPV as 27% [13%, 44%], NPV as 98% [92%, 100%], and BE prevalence as 8.4% [4.5%, 14.3%].

ConclusionPatients without chronic GERD who have [&ge;]3 BE risk factors have a moderately high prevalence of BE. Non-endoscopic detection can effectively identify BE, enabling expansion of screening to this larger at-risk population. Those with a negative EG assay have a low likelihood of BE.","NA","medrxiv",1745791689559

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1745791689559

Species with greater habitat generalism are proposed to behave more boldly (e.g., touching and ingesting novel food). Species with greater dietary generalism are proposed to behave more innovatively (e.g., novel problem-solving to access food). Support for both hypotheses exists but remains largely restricted to broad comparisons between generalists and specialists. Further comparative data are needed to understand the extent to which these behavioural patterns might shape more nuanced ecological variation between species, such as species with finer-scale niche differences. We compared bold and innovative behaviour in two wild sympatric generalists, the Northern raccoon (Procyon lotor) and Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), using a pull-string task with strings and wires attached to vertical cups containing high-value food. Although both species are broadly classified as generalists, raccoons show relatively greater habitat and dietary flexibility than opossums. Because they live sympatrically, it offers a unique opportunity to test - at the same time and locations - whether these finer-scale niche differences are reflective of differences in their bold and innovative behaviour. We predicted that raccoons would display bolder behaviour (in terms of touching our novel task) and more innovative behaviour (in terms of solving it). We found that both species were equally likely to acknowledge and touch the task, but raccoons were more likely to display innovation to access the food. Raccoons' propensity for using innovation to solve novel foraging challenges may contribute to their greater ecological flexibility compared to opossums. More broadly, our findings may help explain differences in how each species adapts to environmental changes.","NA","biorxiv",1745791689559

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1745791689559

Many recent studies have quantified their adverse events with a focus on gastrointestinal adverse events. However, no large epidemiologic study has investigated the risk of hair loss with these medications. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of hair loss. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone. The adjusted hazard ratio for hair loss for all patients using semaglutide, for men, and for women compared to bupropion-naltrexone were 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.86-2.69), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.05-14.49), and 2.08 (95% CI: 1.17-3.72) respectively. Our results demonstrate an increased risk of hair loss with semaglutide in women. Future studies are required to ascertain the association between semaglutide and hair loss.","NA","medrxiv",1745791689559

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1745791689559

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1745791689559
