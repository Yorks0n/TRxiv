Several experimental techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can, in principle, determine conformational states, binding configurations and their probabilities, but suffer from low throughput. Here we develop a Biomolecular Emulator (BioEmu), a generative deep learning system that can generate thousands of statistically independent samples from the protein structure ensemble per hour on a single graphical processing unit. By leveraging novel training methods and vast data of protein structures, over 200 milliseconds of MD simulation, and experimental protein stabilities, BioEmu's protein ensembles represent equilibrium in a range of challenging and practically relevant metrics. Qualitatively, BioEmu samples many functionally relevant conformational changes, ranging from formation of cryptic pockets, over unfolding of specific protein regions, to large-scale domain rearrangements. Quantitatively, BioEmu samples protein conformations with relative free energy errors around 1 kcal/mol, as validated against millisecond-timescale MD simulation and experimentally-measured protein stabilities. By simultaneously emulating structural ensembles and thermodynamic properties, BioEmu reveals mechanistic insights, such as the causes for fold destabilization of mutants, and can efficiently provide experimentally-testable hypotheses.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331358

Such fibrinaloid microclots are also relatively resistant to fibrinolysis. The proteins that the amyloid microclots contained differed markedly both from the soluble proteome of typical plasma and that of normal clots, and also between the disease studies (an acute syndrome in the form of sepsis in an ITU and a chronic disease represented by Long COVID). Many proteins in the amyloid microclots were low in concentration in plasma and were effectively accumulated into the fibres, whereas many other abundant plasma proteins were excluded. The proteins found in the microclots associated with the diseases also tended to be themselves amyloidogenic. We here ask effectively the inverse question. This is: can the clot proteome tell us whether the clots associated with a particular disease contained proteins that are observed uniquely (or are highly over-represented) in known amyloid clots relative to normal clots, and thus were in fact amyloid in nature? The answer is in the affirmative in a variety of major coagulopathies, viz. venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, various cardiac issues, and ischaemic stroke. Galectin-3-binding protein and thrombospondin-1 seem to be especially widely associated with amyloid-type clots, and the latter has indeed been shown to be incorporated into growing fibrin fibres. These may consequently provide useful biomarkers with a mechanistic basis.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331358

Methods Using a population-based panel study of 9,820 adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large, integrated healthcare system, we compared survey-defined ME/CFS-like illness with presence of an ME/CFS diagnosis in the electronic health record (EHR) to evaluate ME/CFS underdiagnosis. Results Of those with survey-defined ME/CFS-like illness, an estimated 97.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 97.1%-98.4%) did not have an ME/CFS diagnosis in the EHR. The group without EHR diagnosis was younger, less likely to identify as white non-Hispanic, and more likely to have developed fatigue in the past three years than the EHR diagnosed group. Both diagnosed and undiagnosed ME/CFS-like illness groups had significantly impaired physical, cognitive, and social functioning, and significantly worse mental health and anxiety than those without ME/CFS-like illness. Conclusion ME/CFS is underdiagnosed in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California healthcare system. Enhanced syndromic surveillance that characterizes patients with ME/CFS who have not been diagnosed has the potential to increase timely recognition of ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1733609331358

Cryptosporidium is an intracellular parasite of intestinal epithelial cells, and a leading cause of diarrheal death and disease in infants worldwide. Despite this, very little is known about the cell biology of infection of this eukaryotic pathogen. Here, we designed and implemented a unique microscopy-based arrayed CRISPR-Cas9 screen to interrogate the effects of the loss of every protein-coding human gene on a Cryptosporidium infection. As the experimental readout is image-based, we extracted multiple phenotypic features of infection, including parasite growth, progression of the parasite to its sexual life stage, and recruitment of host actin to  pedestals beneath the parasite vacuole. Using this dataset, we discovered a tipping point in the host cholesterol biosynthesis pathway that controls Cryptosporidium infection. Parasite growth can either be inhibited or promoted by the intermediary metabolite squalene. A build-up of squalene in epithelial cells creates a reducing environment, with more reduced host glutathione available for uptake by the parasite. Because Cryptosporidium has lost the ability to synthesise glutathione, this uptake from the host cell is required for growth and progression through its life cycle. We demonstrate that this dependency can be leveraged for treatment with the abandoned drug lapaquistat, an inhibitor of host squalene synthase that has efficacy against Cryptosporidium in vitro and in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331358

Unexpectedly, this long-standing reference was shown to be incomplete in 2019 by a genome assembly from the N2-derived strain VC2010. Moreover, genetically divergent versions of N2 have arisen over decades of research and hindered reproducibility of C. elegans genetics and genomics. Here we provide a 106.4 Mb gap-free, telomere-to-telomere genome assembly of C. elegans, generated from CGC1, an isogenic derivative of the N2 strain. We used improved long-read sequencing and manual assembly of 43 recalcitrant genomic regions to overcome deficiencies of prior N2 and VC2010 assemblies, and to assemble tandem repeat loci including a 772-kb sequence for the 45S rRNA genes. While many differences from earlier assemblies came from repeat regions, unique additions to the genome were also found. Of 19,972 protein-coding genes in the N2 assembly, 19,790 (99.1%) encode products that are unchanged in the CGC1 assembly. The CGC1 assembly also may encode 183 new protein-coding and 163 new ncRNA genes. CGC1 thus provides both a completely defined reference genome and corresponding isogenic wild-type strain for C. elegans, allowing unique opportunities for model and systems biology.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331358

In Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, male gametogenesis mitosis is exceptionally rapid and divergent. Within 8 minutes, the haploid male gametocyte genome undergoes three replication cycles (1N to 8N), while maintaining an intact NE. Axonemes assemble in the cytoplasm and connect to a bipartite MTOC-containing nuclear pole and cytoplasmic basal body, producing eight flagellated gametes. The mechanisms coordinating NE remodelling, MTOC dynamics, and flagellum assembly remain poorly understood.

Here, we identify the SUN1-ALLAN complex as a novel mediator of NE remodelling and bipartite MTOC coordination during Plasmodium male gametogenesis. SUN1, a conserved NE protein, localizes to dynamic loops and focal points near nuclear spindle poles. ALLAN, a divergent Allantoicase-like protein, has a location like that of SUN1 at nuclear MTOCs. SUN1 and ALLAN form a unique complex, detected by live-cell imaging, ultrastructural expansion microscopy, and interactomics. Deletion of either SUN1 or ALLAN gene disrupts nuclear MTOC organization, leading to basal body mis-segregation, defective spindle assembly, and impaired kinetochore attachment, but axoneme formation remains intact. Ultrastructural analysis revealed nuclear and cytoplasmic MTOC miscoordination, producing aberrant flagellated gametes lacking nuclear material. Sun1 deletion also alters parasite lipid composition, underscoring its role in NE homeostasis. These defects block parasite development in the mosquito and transmission, highlighting the essential functions of this complex.

This study reveals a bipartite MTOC and a highly divergent mechanism of NE remodelling during Plasmodium male gametogenesis. The SUN1-ALLAN complex is an unusual adaptation of the LINC complex, in absence of canonical KASH-domain proteins in Plasmodium, providing new insights into the evolution of closed mitosis and highlighting potential targets for blocking malaria transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331358

Here, we showed that R. rhizogenes A4 outperformed all other tested agrobacterial strains in agroinfiltration experiments on leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana and other solanaceous plants. By conducting an agroinfiltration screening in N. benthamiana leaves using various agrobacterial strains carrying the RUBY reporter gene cassette, we discovered that A4 mediates the strongest and fastest transient expression. Utilizing the genomic information, we developed a collection of disarmed and modified strains derived from A4. By performing vacuum infiltration assays, we demonstrated that these A4-derived strains efficiently transiently transform 6-week-old N. benthamiana leaves, showing less sensitivity to the age of plants compared to the laboratory strain GV3101. Furthermore, we performed agroinfiltration using AS109, an A4-derived disarmed strain, on the leaves of tomato, pepper, and eggplant. Remarkably, AS109 mediated transient gene expression on tested solanaceous plants more effectively than all the tested commonly used agrobacterial strains.

C. elegans possesses an expanded repertoire of at least 19 AGOs functioning in an intricate gene regulatory network. Despite their crucial roles, little is known about the regulation of AGOs, and whether their expression levels, tissue specificity, and functions change in response to genetic perturbations or environmental triggers. Here, we report that PALS-22, a member of an unusually expanded protein family in C. elegans, acts as a negative regulator of antiviral RNAi involving the RIG-I homolog. The loss of pals-22 leads to enhanced silencing of transgenes and endogenous dsRNAs. We found that PALS-22 normally suppresses the expression of two AGOs, VSRA-1 and SAGO-2, which are activated by bZIP transcription factor ZIP-1. When pals-22 is eliminated, vsra-1 and sago-2 are upregulated. These AGOs in turn play key roles in defense against foreign genetic elements and intracellular pathogens, respectively. Surprisingly, while in pals-22 mutants immune genes functioning in the intracellular pathogen response (IPR) are upregulated, removing SAGO-2 or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RRF-3 in these mutants leads to the downregulation of these genes. This observation contrasts with the typical gene-silencing role of siRNAs. Finally, by analyzing C. elegans wild isolates and lab reference strains, we demonstrate that PALS-22 regulates the expression of several germline AGOs, affecting germline mortality and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In summary, PALS-22 is a key genetic node that balances the trade-off between immunity and germline health by modulating the functions of different AGOs, thereby shaping the outputs of the RNAi machinery and the dynamics of epigenetic inheritance.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331358

Traditionally linked to genomic imprinting, these effects are believed to have evolved from parental conflict over resource allocation to offspring, which results in opposing parental genetic influences. Despite their potential importance, POEs remain heavily understudied in complex traits, largely due to the lack of parental genomes.

Here, we present a multi-step approach to infer the parent-of-origin of alleles without parental genomes, leveraging inter-chromosomal phasing, mitochondrial and chromosome X data, and sibling-based crossover inference. Applied to the UK Biobank (discovery cohort) and Estonian Biobank (replication cohort), this scalable approach enabled parent-of-origin inference for up to 221,062 individuals, representing the largest dataset of its kind.

GWAS scans for more than 60 complex traits and over 2,400 protein levels contrasting maternal and paternal effects identified over 30 novel POEs and confirmed more than 50% of testable known associations. Notably, approximately half of our POEs exhibited a bipolar pattern, where maternal and paternal alleles exert conflicting effects. These effects were particularly prevalent for traits related to growth (e.g., IGF-1, height, fat-free mass) and metabolism (e.g., type 2 diabetes, triglycerides, glucose). Replication in the Estonian Biobank validated over 70% of testable associations.

Overall, our findings shed new light on the influence of POEs on diverse complex traits and align with the parental conflict hypothesis, providing compelling evidence for this understudied evolutionary phenomenon.","NA","medrxiv",1733609331358

The reliability of these forecasts hinges on detailed knowledge of disease transmission across different population segments, which may be inferred from within-community transmission rates via proxy data, such as contact surveys and mobility data. However, these approaches are indirect, making it difficult to accurately estimate rare transmissions between socially or geographically distant communities. We show that the steep ramp up of genome sequencing surveillance during the pandemic can be leveraged to directly identify transmission patterns between communities. Specifically, our approach uses a hidden Markov model to infer the fraction of infections a community imports from other communities based on how rapidly the allele frequencies in the focal community converge to those in the donor communities. Applying this method to SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data from England and the U.S., we uncover networks of inter-community disease transmission that, while broadly reflecting geographical relationships, also expose epidemiologically significant long-range interactions. We provide evidence that transmission between regions can substantially change between waves of variants of concern, both in magnitude and direction, and analyze how the inferred plasticity and heterogeneity in inter-community transmission impact evolutionary forecasts.

Likewise, human sera collected during the pre-Omicron era from persons immunized with original Wuhan-based vaccines were found to contain abundant neutralizing activity targeted against the RBDs of modern Omicron variants. However, this unexpected neutralization sensitivity was observed only when these RBDs were incorporated into a mismatched spike protein backbone, whereas the corresponding native Omicron spike proteins were highly resistant against the same panel of antibodies and human sera. We conclude that changes occurring outside of the RBD and leading to altered conformational dynamics of the spike protein have played a key part in the viral evolution enabling SARS-CoV-2 to escape from neutralizing antibodies that target highly conserved cryptic RBD epitopes.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331358

It is commonly assumed that cells respond to these gradients by migrating directionally towards the regions of highest ligand density. In contrast with this view, here we show that cells exposed to micropatterned fibronectin gradients exhibit a complex repertoire of trajectories, including directed haptotactic migration up the gradient but also linear oscillations and circles with extended periods of migration down the gradient. To explain this behavior, we developed a biophysical model of haptotactic cell migration based on a coarse-grained molecular clutch model coupled to persistent stochastic polarity dynamics. While initial haptotactic migration is explained by the differential friction at the front and back of the cell, the observed complex trajectories over longer time scales arise from the interplay between differential friction, persistence, and physical confinement. Overall, our study reveals that confinement and persistence modulate the ability of cells to sense and respond to haptotactic cues and provides a framework to understand how cells navigate complex environments.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331358

However, little is known about what causes macrophages to choose trogocytosis versus phagocytosis. Here, we report that cortical tension of target cells is a key regulator of macrophage trogocytosis. At low tension, macrophages will preferentially trogocytose antibody-opsonized cells, while at high tension they tend towards phagocytosis. Using model vesicles, we demonstrate that macrophages will rapidly switch from trogocytosis to phagocytosis when membrane tension is increased. Stiffening the cortex of target cells also biases macrophages to phagocytose them, a trend that can be countered by increasing antibody surface density and is captured in a mechanical model of trogocytosis. This work suggests that a distinct molecular pathway for trogocytosis is not required to explain differences in trogocytosis among target cell types and points to a mechanism for target cells to modulate trogocytosis.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331358

These models aggregate individuals into compartments, often stratified by characteristics to represent groups that might be intervention targets or otherwise of particular concern. Ideally, model calculation could occur at the most demanding resolution for the overall analysis, but this may be infeasible due to availability of computational resources or empirical data. Instead, detailed population age-structure might be consolidated into broad categories such as children, working-age adults, and seniors. Researchers must then discretise key epidemic parameters, like the infection-fatality ratio, for these lower resolution groups. After estimating outcomes for those crude groups, follow on analyses, such as calculating years of life lost (YLLs), may need to distribute or weight those low-resolution outcomes back to the high resolution. The specific calculation for these aggregation and disaggregation steps can substantially influence outcomes.

To assist researchers with these tasks, we developed paramix, an R package which simplifies the transformations between high and low resolution. We demonstrate applying paramix to a common discretisation analysis: using age structured models for health economic calculations comparing YLLs. We compare how estimates vary between paramix and several alternatives for an archetypal model, including comparison to a high resolution benchmark. We consistently found that paramix yielded the most similar estimates to the high-resolution model, for the same computational burden of low-resolution models. In our illustrative analysis, the non-paramix methods estimated up to twice as many YLLs averted as the paramix approach, which would likely lead to a similarly large impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios used in economic evaluations.

Author summaryResearchers use infectious disease models to understand trends in disease spread, including predicting future infections under different interventions. Constraints like data availability and numerical complexity drive researchers to group individuals into broad categories; for example, all working age adults might be represented as a single set of model compartments. Key epidemic parameters can vary widely across such groups. Additionally, model outcomes calculated using these broad categories often need to be disaggregated to a high resolution, for example a precise age at death for calculating years life lost, a key measure when estimating the cost-effectiveness of interventions. To satisfy these needs, we present a software package, paramix, which provides tools to move between high and low resolution data. In this paper, we demonstrate the capabilities of paramix by comparing various methods of calculating deaths and years of life lost across broad age groups. For an analysis of an archetypal model, we find paramix best matches a high-resolution model, while the alternatives are substantially different.","NA","medrxiv",1733609331358

In PDAC, both cell types stimulate macropinocytosis as an adaptive response to glutamine depletion. CAFs play a critical role in sculpting the tumor microenvironment, yet how adaptations to metabolic stress impact the stromal architecture remains elusive. In this study, we find that macropinocytosis functions to control CAF subtype identity when glutamine is limiting. Our data demonstrate that metabolic stress leads to an intrinsic inflammatory CAF (iCAF) program driven by MEK/ERK signaling. Utilizing in vivo models, we find that blocking macropinocytosis alters CAF subtypes and reorganizes the tumor stroma. Importantly, these changes in stromal architecture can be exploited to sensitize PDAC to immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Our findings demonstrate that metabolic stress plays a role in shaping the tumor microenvironment, and that this attribute can be harnessed for therapeutic impact.

Post-transcriptional Q/R editing of GluA2 renders AMPARs nearly impermeable to calcium ions, which is crucial for their normal function. Although previous studies have characterized conductivity and selectivity differences between edited and unedited GluA2 variants and heteromeric receptors incorporating GluA2, the atomistic mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigate ion permeation in the context of multiple Ca2+ binding sites along the pore predicted from MD simulations, considering both mutations and co-permeating monovalent ions. Patch clamp electrophysiology recordings confirmed a binding site at the intracellular mouth of the selectivity filter that confers selectivity for calcium over monovalent ions. A patient mutation at the same site has been previously shown to cause neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Furthermore, MD simulations of GluA2 with different arginine copy number at the Q/R site show that Ca2+ conduction is blocked in the presence of two arginines, whereas K+ is only blocked by four arginines, in explaining the results from decades of electrophysiological work. Finally, MD simulations revealed that Ca2+ reduces K+ conduction by preferentially occupying the intracellular SF binding site, whereas Na+ does not. This result is consistent with electrophysiological results from the D590 mutants, and suggests that divalent binding in the selectivity filter is a major determinant of AMPAR conductance.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331358

To identify densely packed molecules within the condensate, we integrated deep learning-based segmentation with novel context-aware template matching.

Regrettably, this was accomplished only for individual, tissue-dissociated cells. High-plex spatial biology has begun to recover the x, y, and z-coordinates of single-cells, but typically at the expense of far less than whole transcriptome coverage. To solve this problem, Bruker Spatial Biology has accomplished a commercial-grade panel (CosMx(R) Spatial Molecular Imager Whole Transcriptome Panel (WTx)), using 37,872 imaging barcodes, capable of sub-cellular imaging of the entire human protein-coding transcriptome. The imaging barcodes are encoded with 156 bits of information (4 on-cycles and 35 dark-cycles per code), at a Hamming Distance of 4 from each other to achieve a very low false-code detection. Key to achieving this high-plex capability was the ability to manufacture imaging barcodes that require no in-tissue amplification (every barcode is manufactured under GMP to contain exactly 30 fluorescent dyes) and uniform, size-exclusion purified, extremely small imaging barcodes ([~] 20 nm). A detailed study of six different human FFPE tissue types was performed (Colon, Pancreas, Hippocampus, Skin, Breast, Kidney), yielding over 5.4 billion transcripts from 2.7 million cells. We counted over 1,550 transcripts-per-cell on average and observed 900 unique genes per cell (measured as the median). Single fixed-cells containing well over 10,000 subcellularly imaged transcripts were accomplished. Advancing single-cell imaging to the whole transcriptome level opens a single unified approach to accomplish essentially all single-cell experiments, both imaging and non-imaging. Depending upon the sample type (e.g. fixed-cells, organoids, tissue sections, etc.), the transcripts per cell and genes per cell measured using the whole transcriptome panel often exceeds that obtained by the highest-resolution single-cell RNA-seq, can be performed on a single 5 {micro}m FFPE tissue section, with no dissociation bias (every cell is counted). Pathway analysis within the tumor bed of a colon adenocarcinoma sample found evidence of enrichment in pathways suggestive of an aggressive tumor type, and localized ligand-receptor analysis showed spatially restricted patterns related to adhesion, migration, and proliferation. The high-dimensional whole transcriptome data is streamed directly to a cloud-based Spatial Informatics Platform, allowing for the scalable processing of millions-of-single-cells and billions-of-transcripts per operation. The WTx data are combined with high-resolution antibody-based cell-morphology imaging and data-driven machine-learning cell segmentation algorithms, to generate the most complete view of single cell and sub-cellular spatial biology that has ever been obtained.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

We find that in mice and humans, intratumoral lymphatic vessel density negatively correlates with productive cytotoxic immune responses and identify IFN{gamma} as an intrinsic inhibitor of lymphangiogenesis. Specific deletion of the Ifngr1 in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) greatly expanded the intratumoral lymphatic network and drove the emergence of a tip-like endothelial state, promoting lymph node metastasis but not dendritic cell migration.

The result is a genomic network that describes the conditionally independent genetic associations between traits that remain when controlling for shared signal with the broader network of traits.

We utilized this framework to assess the energy of functional brain networks under cognitive control and to understand how energy is allocated across canonical functional networks during various cognitive control tasks. We extracted network energy from functional connectivity patterns of subjects who underwent fMRI scans during cognitive tasks involving working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility, in addition to task-free scans. We found that the energy of the whole-brain network increases when exposed to cognitive control tasks compared to the task-free resting state, which serves as a reference point. The brain selectively allocates this elevated energy to canonical functional networks; sensory networks receive more energy to support flexibility for processing sensory stimuli, while cognitive networks relevant to the task, functioning efficiently, require less energy. Furthermore, employing network energy, as a global network measure, improves the performance of predictive modeling, particularly in classifying cognitive control tasks and predicting chronological age. Our results highlight the robustness of this framework and the utility of network energy in understanding brain and cognitive mechanisms, including its promising potential as a biomarker for mental conditions and neurological disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

In eukaryotes, building whole custom genomes is still many years away, but work in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast is closing-in on the first synthetic eukaryotic genome with genome-wide design changes. A key design change throughout the synthetic yeast genome is the introduction of LoxPsym site sequences. These enable inducible genomic rearrangements in vivo via expression of Cre recombinase via SCRaMbLE (Synthetic Chromosome Recombination and Modification by LoxPsym-mediated Evolution). When paired with selection, SCRaMbLE can quickly generate strains with phenotype improvements by diversifying gene arrangement and content in LoxPsym-containing regions. Here, we demonstrate how iterative cycles of SCRaMbLE can be used to reorganise synthetic genome modules and synthetic chromosomes for improved functional performance under selection. To achieve this, we developed SCOUT (SCRaMbLE Continuous Output and Universal Tracker), a reporter system that allows SCRaMbLEd cells to be sorted into a high diversity pool. When coupled with long-read sequencing, SCOUT enables high-throughput mapping of genotype abundance and correlation of gene content and arrangement with growth-related phenotypes. Iterative SCRaMbLE was applied here to yeast strains with a full synthetic chromosome, and to strains with synthetic genome modules encoding the gene set for histidine biosynthesis. Five synthetic designs for HIS modules were constructed and tested, and we investigated how SCRaMbLE reorganised the poorest performing design to give improved growth under selection. The results of iterative SCRaMbLE serve as a quick route to identify genome module designs with optimised function in a selected condition and offer a powerful tool to generate datasets that can inform the design of modular genomes in the future.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

ObjectiveTo explore the diagnostic and prognostic value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) a-syn SAA status and seeding kinetics in PD.

DesignA longitudinal cohort study of: participants in the Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort, recruited from 2010-2022 and followed up over 2-5 years; participants in the UK parkinsonism cohort, recruited from 2015-2022 and followed up over 2 years.

SettingCohort study.

ParticipantsSporadic and monogenic PD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and controls.

ExposureCSF a-syn SAA status (positive or negative) and seeding kinetics (maximum Thioflavin T fluorescence, time to threshold (TTT), and area under the curve).

Main outcomes and measuresSensitivity and specificity of a-syn SAA in clinically-defined PD and controls; comparison of a-syn SAA positive vs. negative PD; baseline a-syn SAA seeding kinetic predictors of clinical decline in PD.

ResultsWe studied 1,402 participants: publicly available data from the PPMI cohort, n=1275 (sporadic PD n=764, monogenic PD n=272, controls n=239); newly generated data from the UK parkinsonism cohort, n=127 (sporadic PD n=66, PSP n=52, controls n=9). Over 2-5 years of follow-up, the sensitivity of a-syn SAA in clinically-defined PD was 87.7% and the specificity in controls was 91.9%. In the UK parkinsonism cohort, a-syn SAA was positive in 8/52 (15.4%) PSP samples with distinct  low and slow kinetics. In the comparison of a-syn SAA positive (n=110) vs. negative (n=57) LRRK2-PD, we found that SAA negative participants had an older mean (standard deviation) age at symptom onset (63.0 (7.6) vs. 55.4 (9.9) years) and higher mean (standard deviation) baseline serum neurofilament light chain levels (20.4 (13.2) vs. 13.8 (8.6) pg/ml), p<0.05. In a combined analysis of sporadic and monogenic PD, fast vs. slow TTT at baseline predicted cognitive decline, defined as MoCA [&le;]21 (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.50-4.20, p=0.001).

Conclusions and relevanceThis study has highlighted the diagnostic value of a-syn SAA status in clinically-defined PD, and suggests the presence of pathological heterogeneity in LRRK2-PD. Furthermore, time to threshold may have a potential role as a prognostic biomarker in PD.

Key PointsQuestion: What is the diagnostic and prognostic value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay (a-syn SAA) in Parkinsons disease (PD)?

Findings: In this observational cohort study of 1,402 participants, the sensitivity of CSF a-syn SAA in clinically defined PD over 2-5 years of follow-up was 87.7% and the specificity in controls was 91.9%. Time to threshold was a seeding kinetic measure that predicted cognitive decline in both sporadic and monogenic PD.

Meaning: In a large well-characterised PD cohort, we have highlighted the diagnostic value of CSF a-syn SAA status and show that seeding kinetics can predict cognitive decline.","NA","medrxiv",1733609331359

However, rapid parameter scaling has been essential to the success of large language models in text and images, while similar scaling has not been attempted with Transformer architectures for cellular modeling. To produce accurate, transferable, and biologically meaningful representations of cellular systems, we develop AIDO.Cell, a pretrained module for representing gene expression and cellular systems in an AI-driven Digital Organism [1]. AIDO.Cell contains a series of 3M, 10M, 100M, and 650M parameter encoder-only dense Transformer models pre-trained on 50 million human cells from diverse tissues using a read-depth-aware masked gene expression pretraining objective. Unlike previous models, AIDO.Cell is capable of handling the entire human transcriptome as input without truncation or sampling tricks, thus learning accurate and general representations of the human cells entire transcriptional context. This pretraining with a longer context was enabled through FlashAttention-2, mixed precision, and large-scale distributed systems training. AIDO.Cell (100M) achieves state-of-the-art results in tasks such as zero-shot clustering, cell-type classification, and perturbation modeling. Our findings reveal interesting loss scaling behaviors as we increase AIDO.Cells parameters from 3M to 650M, providing insights for future directions in single-cell modeling.

Herein, we investigated the etiology of this outbreak.

MethodsOcular swabs were obtained from 13 individuals presenting with AHC at a Mombasa clinic in early February 2024. Ten of these were analyzed using bacterial cultures, and all 13 using a pan-adenovirus quantitative PCR (qPCR) and metagenomic sequencing. Potential viral etiology was confirmed by a specific qPCR, amplicon sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.

ResultsBacterial cultures yielded no growth except in three samples where non-pathogenic bacteria were detected. All 13 samples were adenovirus qPCR negative.

Metagenomic sequencing detected coxsackievirus A24 variant (CA24v) in three of the 13 samples. CA24v detections were confirmed by both CA24v specific qPCR and amplicon sequencing of an approximately 450 nucleotide long VP4/2 junction genomic region. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP4/2 sequences showed that they were closely related to CA24v genotype IV.

ConclusionThe AHC epidemic in coastal Kenya in early 2024 was likely caused by CA24v. Metagenomic sequencing is a powerful tool for identifying potential causative agents of new disease outbreaks.","NA","medrxiv",1733609331359

However, current methods often rely on PCR amplification for enrichment of marker genes. PCR can introduce significant biases that affect quantification and is typically restricted to one target loci at a time, limiting the diversity that can be captured in a single reaction. Here, we address these issues by using Cas9 to enrich marker genes for long-read nanopore sequencing directly from a DNA sample, removing the need for PCR. We show that this approach can effectively isolate a 4.5 kb region covering partial 18S and 28S rRNA genes and the ITS region in a mixed nematode community, and further adapt our approach for characterising a diverse microbial community. We demonstrate the ability for Cas9-based enrichment to support multiplexed targeting of several different DNA regions simultaneously, enabling optimal marker gene selection for different clades of interest within a sample. We also find a strong correlation between input DNA concentrations and output read proportions for mixed-species samples, demonstrating the ability for quantification of relative species abundance. This study lays a foundation for targeted long-read sequencing to more fully capture the diversity of organisms present in complex environments.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

This mechanism is distinct from previously described mechanisms involving motor-driven transport and defines ordered and adjacent linear domains where secretory events are higher and lower than expected, effectively redistributing exocytosis over most of the cell membrane. In addition, analysis of KEULE kinetics revealed distinct phases of assembly/disassembly that are differentially sensitive to experimental treatments that reduce exocytosis, revealing SEC/MUNC dynamics as a versatile and information rich read-out of exocytosis in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

They develop either from embryonic precursors or from circulating monocytes, and their functions are in part dictated by their origin. We previously observed robust monocyte recruitment and contribution to the macrophage pool in brown adipose tissue. In particular, monocytes were predicted to give rise to two phenotypically distinct macrophage subsets identifiable by CD206 or CD226 expression. In the present study, we investigated monocyte differentiation pathways in brown adipose tissue and the function of monocyte-derived macrophages. We found that bone marrow monocytes highly contributed to the CD226+ macrophage population while the CD206+ population contained mainly yolk sac-derived cells. Fate mapping analysis revealed a low contribution of GMP- and a high contribution of MDP-derived monocytes to the CD226+ macrophage subset. Importantly, adoptive transfer experiments demonstrate that MDP- but not GMP-derived monocytes are pre-conditioned to give rise to CD226+ macrophages. Using meta-analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing data, we found that MDP-derived CD226+ macrophages were present in several tissues including peritoneal cavity, adrenal glands and all adipose depots, with a particular enrichment in beige and brown fat. A similar macrophage subset was identified in humans. Functionally, while depletion of CD206+ macrophages using anti-CD115 blocking antibodies led to decreased adipose triglyceride content, genetic depletion of CD226+ macrophages caused the opposite phenotype. We thus identify CD226+ MDP-derived macrophages as a new myeloid cell type conserved across tissues and tied to lipid metabolism homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

In contrast to a majority of species in the phylum Basidiomycota that have tetrapolar mating-type systems, the opportunistic human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans employs a bipolar mating-type system, with two mating types (a and ) determined by a single MAT locus that is unusually large ([~]120 kb) and contains more than 20 genes. While several MAT genes are associated with mating and sexual development, others control conserved cellular processes (e.g. cargo transport and protein synthesis), of which five (MYO2, PRT1, RPL22, RPL39, and RPO41) have been hypothesized to be essential. In this study, through genetic analysis involving sporulation of heterozygous diploid deletion mutants, as well as in some cases construction and analyses of conditional expression alleles of these genes, we confirmed that with the exception of MYO2, both alleles of the other four MAT genes are indeed essential for cell viability. We further showed that while MYO2 is not essential, its function is critical for infectious spore production, faithful cytokinesis, adaptation for growth at high temperature, and pathogenicity in vivo. Our results demonstrate the presence of essential genes in the MAT locus that are divergent between cells of opposite mating types. We discuss possible mechanisms to maintain functional alleles of these essential genes in a rapidly-evolving genomic region in the context of fungal sexual reproduction and mating-type evolution.

IMPORTANCESexual reproduction is essential for long-term evolutionary success. Fungal cell type identity is governed by the MAT locus, which is typically rapidly evolving and highly divergent between different mating types. In this study, we show that the a and  alleles of four genes encoded in the MAT locus of the opportunistic human fungal pathogen C. neoformans are essential. We demonstrate that a fifth gene, MYO2, which had been predicted to be essential, is in fact dispensable for cell viability. However, a functional MYO2 allele is important for cytokinesis and fungal pathogenicity. Our study highlights the need for careful genetic analyses in determining essential genes, which is complementary to high-throughput approaches. Additionally, the presence of essential genes in the MAT locus of C. neoformans provides insights into the function, maintenance, and evolution of these fast-evolving genomic regions.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

Current vaccines have limitations, including an increased risk of severe dengue in seronegative individuals and moderate efficacy, highlighting the need for more effective solutions. Our study aimed to design a multi-serotype Dengue virus vaccine using a computational approach to achieve broad-spectrum immunity. We employed advanced computational tools and algorithms to predict B-cell and T-cell epitopes, ensuring the selection of antigenic targets that provide comprehensive protection against all four serotypes. The methodology included tools for B-cell epitope prediction, tools for MHC class II and I peptide predictions, and tools for toxicity and allergenicity screening to ensure the safety of the vaccine candidates. Our results identified 21 B-cell epitopes, 15 CTL peptides, and 12 HTL peptides, validated for safety regarding toxicity and allergenic potential. The vaccine construct incorporated the adjuvant {beta}-defensin-3 and specific linkers to enhance immunogenicity and stability. Tertiary structure prediction, Ramachandran plot analysis, and stereochemical examination confirmed the stability and quality of the vaccine model.

These findings demonstrate the potential of computational methods in addressing the complex challenges of Dengue virus vaccine development.

A 3.16 [A] global resolution cryo-EM reconstruction reveals that distortion of the siRNA-target duplex at position 6 allows target RNA entry into the catalytic cleft and shifts Lysine-709, a previously unrecognized catalytic residue, into the active site. A pyrimidine at target nucleotide t10 positions another unrecognized catalytic residue, Arginine-710, for optimal cleavage. Expansion of the guide-target duplex major groove docks the scissile phosphate for hydrolysis and subsequent groove compression after position 16 permits target RNAs to exit the catalytic cleft. These findings reveal how hAgo2 catalyzes siRNA target hydrolysis, providing a high-resolution model for therapeutic design.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

In this study, we present a high-resolution structure of the CP in the ciliary tip of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila and identify several tip proteins that bind and form unique patterns on both microtubules of the tip CP. Two of those proteins that contain tubulin polymerization-promoting protein (TPPP)-like domains, TLP1 and TLP2, bind to high curvature regions of the microtubule. TLP2, which contains two TPPP-like domains, is an unusually long protein that wraps laterally around half a microtubule and forms the bridge between the two microtubules. Moreover, we found that the conserved protein SPEF1 binds to both microtubule seams. In vitro, human SPEF1 not only binds to the microtubule seam but also crosslinks two parallel microtubules. Single-molecule microtubule dynamics assays indicate that SPEF1 stabilizes microtubules in vitro. Together, these data show that the proteins in the tip CP maintain stable microtubule structure and probably play important roles in maintaining the integrity of the axoneme.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to multisystem deficits, including those affecting the nervous system. Here, we investigated whether a SARS-CoV-2 infection alone increases the susceptibility to develop parkinsonian phenotypes in C57BL/6J mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor, or in addition to two well-known toxin exposures, MPTP and paraquat. Additionally, we examined mice carrying a G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene. We also examined if vaccination with either an mRNA- or protein-based vaccine can alter any observed neuropathology. We find that the infection with the WA-1/2020 (alpha) or omicron B1.1.529 strains in ACE2 and G2019S LRRK2 mice both synergize with a subtoxic exposure to the mitochondrial toxin MPTP to induce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra. This synergy appears toxin-dependent since we do not observe this following exposure to the direct redox-inducing compound paraquat. This synergistic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is rescued in WT mice that were vaccinated using either mRNA- and protein- based vaccines directed against the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, in the G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice, we find that only the protein-based vaccine but not the mRNA- based vaccine resulted in a rescue of the SARS-CoV-2 mediated neuropathology.

ITCH enhances the ubiquitination of viral envelope and membrane proteins and mutual interactions of structural proteins, thereby aiding in virion assembly. ITCH-mediated ubiquitination also enhances the interaction of viral proteins to the autophagosome receptor p62, promoting their autophagosome-dependent secretion.

However, researchers commonly misconceive the relationship between mating success (MS) and reproductive success (RS) as always being causal, leading to a misinterpretation of the BG. The BG is phenomenological and therefore uninformative about the mechanisms leading to correlations between MS and RS. Here, we simulate sequential matings in males from biological systems with varying levels of anisogamy and sperm competition, to better understand the underlying processes that modulate male BGs. We show that the BG does not solely reflect the causal influence of MS on RS as is typically interpreted, but is also a consequence of covariances between male MS and male ejaculate traits, female fecundity, or female post-mating decisions. For example, we show that the BG is substantially shallower when the ejaculate size of males negatively co-varies with their MS, such as in species with alternative male reproductive tactics. Such covariances can lead to a misinterpretation of the measured BG, because here, it does not merely represent the strength of selection on intra-sexual competition for mates. We suggest how such covariances can be visually assessed, and accounted for using partial Bateman gradients, to better interpret the influence of MS on RS, thus the strength of pre-copulatory sexual selection. Among other simplifications, our simulations have a male-only focus, but they provide insights into the mechanisms driving inter- and intra-specific variation in the BG, clarify its meaning, and improve our understand of sexual selection.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

Herein, we devise a live-cell microscopy-based approach to follow hydroxyurea-induced fork stalling and subsequent restart at 30-s resolution. We measure two distinct processes during fork stalling. One is rapid PCNA removal, which reflects the drop in DNA synthesis. The other is gradual RPA1 accumulation on up to 2400 nt of ssDNA per fork despite an active intra-S checkpoint. Restoring the nucleotide pool enables prompt restart without post-replicative ssDNA and a smooth cell cycle progression. ATR, but not ATM inhibition, accelerates hydroxyurea-induced RPA1 accumulation nine-fold, leading to RPA1 exhaustion within 20 min. Fork restart under ATR inhibition led to the persistence of [~]600 nt ssDNA per fork after S-phase, which reached 2500 nt under ATR/ATM co-inhibition, with both scenarios leading to mitotic catastrophe. MRE11 inhibition had no effect on PCNA/RPA1 dynamics regardless of ATR activity. E3 ligase RAD18 was recruited at stalled replication forks in parallel to PCNA removal. Our results shed light on fork dynamics during nucleotide depletion and provide a valuable tool for interrogating the effects of replication stress-inducing anti-cancer agents.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

While some types of floral traits, such as flower color, are well-characterized, other types of complex morphologies remain understudied. One example is occluded personate flowers, dorso-ventrally compressed flowers with obstructed floral passageways, which have evolved in multiple genera, but have only been characterized from snapdragon.

MethodsOur study examined the morphological basis and evolutionary history of personate flowers in a clade of Penstemon species that includes three personate-flowered species. We characterized floral morphology and inferred phylogenomic relationships for 13 species in this group in order to examine the evolutionary history of personate flowers. We used phylogenomic tests for introgression to examine whether personate-flowered lineages have a history of introgression.

ResultsUnlike the personate flowers of snapdragon, personate flowers in Penstemon are produced by deep pleats in the ventral petal tissue that curve the ventral petal surface upwards, obstructing the floral tube opening. Our phylogenetic tree suggests that personate flowers evolved in two separate lineages. Phylogenomic analyses indicate incomplete lineage sorting and introgression between certain taxa have contributed to phylogenomic discordance, however we found little evidence of recent introgression between the two personate-flowered lineages.

ConclusionsThe evolution of personate flowers in Penstemon involves a distinct morphological basis than snapdragon. Personate flowers have evolved multiple times in Penstemon on a rapid evolutionary timescale. The source of genetic variation for repeated shifts may be de novo mutations or pre-existing variants.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

However, the underlying cis-regulatory genetic factors that contribute to heterogeneity in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and their impact on clinical phenotypes remain enigmatic. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to quantify genetic contributions to cis-regulatory variation in 361,119 peripheral blood mononuclear cells across 63 COVID-19 patients during acute infection, 39 samples collected in the convalescent phase, and 106 healthy controls. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping across cell types within each disease state group revealed thousands of cis-associated variants, of which hundreds were detected exclusively in immune cells derived from acute COVID-19 patients. Patient-specific genetic effects dissipated as infection resolved, suggesting that distinct gene regulatory networks are at play in the active infection state. Further, 17.2% of tested loci demonstrated significant cell state interactions with genotype, with pathways related to interferon responses and oxidative phosphorylation showing pronounced cell state-dependent variation, predominantly in CD14+ monocytes. Overall, we estimate that 25.6% of tested genes exhibit gene-environment interaction effects, highlighting the importance of environmental modifiers in the transcriptional regulation of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings underscore the importance of expanding the study of regulatory variation to relevant cell types and disease contexts and argue for the existence of extensive gene-environment effects among patients responding to an infection.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

However, there has been little work developing new AI methods for neonatal populations.

ObjectiveTo develop a novel, deep contrastive learning model to predict a comprehensive set of pathologies from radiographs relevant to neonatal intensive care.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe identified a retrospective cohort of infants who obtained a radiograph while admitted to a large neonatal intensive care unit in Boston, MA from January 2008 to December 2023. After collecting radiographs with corresponding reports and relevant demographics for all subjects, we randomized the cohort into three sets: training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%).

InterventionsWe developed a deep learning model, NeoCLIP, to identify 15 unique pathologies and 5 medical devices relevant to neonatal intensive care on plain film radiographs. The pathologies were automatically extracted from radiology reports using a custom pipeline based on large language models.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresWe compared the performance of our model, as defined by AUROC, against various baseline methods.

ResultsWe identified 4,629 infants which were randomized into the training (3,731 infants), validation (419 infants), and test (479 infants) sets. In total, we collected 20,154 radiographs with a corresponding 15,795 reports. The AUROC of our model was greater than all baseline methods for every radiographic finding other than portal venous gas. The addition of demographics improved the AUROC of our model for all findings, but the difference was not statistically significant.

Conclusions and RelevanceNeoCLIP successfully identified a broad set of pathologies and medical devices on neonatal radiographs, outperforming similar models developed for adult populations. This represents the first such application of advanced AI methodologies to interpret neonatal radiographs.","NA","medrxiv",1733609331359

One challenge for the field is that rs-fMRI signals are contaminated by multiple sources of noise that can contaminate these rs-fMRI signals, affecting the reliability and validity of any derivative phenotypes and attenuating their correlations with behaviour. Here, we investigate the efficacy of different noise mitigation pipelines, including white-matter and cerebrospinal fluid regression, independent component analysis (ICA) - based artefact removal, volume censoring, global signal regression (GSR), and diffuse cluster estimation and regression (DiCER), in simultaneously achieving two objectives: mitigating motion-related artifacts and augmenting brain-behaviour associations. Our analysis, which employed three distinct quality control metrics to evaluate motion influence and a kernel ridge regression for behavioural predictions of 81 different behavioural variables across two independent datasets, revealed that no single pipeline universally excels at achieving both objectives consistently across different cohorts. Pipelines combining ICA-FIX and GSR demonstrate a reasonable trade-off between motion reduction and behavioural prediction performance, but inter-pipeline variations in predictive performance are modest.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

Targeting female fertility genes in a gene drive can be an efficient strategy for population suppression. In this study, we investigated nine female fertility genes in Drosophila melanogaster using CRISPR-based homing gene drives. Employing a multiplexed gRNA approach to prevent formation of functional resistance alleles, we aimed to maintain high drive conversion efficiency with low fitness costs in female drive carriers. Drive efficiency was assessed in individual crosses and had varied performance across different target genes. Notably, drives targeting the octopamine beta2 receptor (oct) and stall (stl) genes exhibited the highest drive conversion rates and were further tested in cages. A drive targeting stl successfully suppressed a cage population with a high release frequency, though suppression failed in another replicate cage with lower initial release frequency. Fitness costs in female drive carriers were observed in test cages, impacting the overall efficiency of population suppression. Further tests on the fertility of these lines using individual crosses indicated that some fitness costs were possibly due to the maternal deposition of Cas9 combined with new gRNA expression, which would only occur in progeny of drive males when testing split drives with separate Cas9 (when mimicking cages with complete drives) but not for complete drive systems. This could enable success in complete drives with higher maternal Cas9 deposition, even if cage experiments in split drives fail. Our findings underscore the potential and challenges of assessing gene drives for population control, providing valuable insights for optimizing and testing suppression gene drive designs.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

Previously, we found that Chd1 occupancy on gene bodies depends on the Rtf1 subunit of the Paf1 complex in yeast. Here, we identify an N-terminal region of Rtf1 and the CHCT domain of Chd1 as sufficient for their interaction and demonstrate that this interaction is direct. Mutations that disrupt the Rtf1-Chd1 interaction result in an accumulation of Chd1 at the 5-prime ends of Chd1-occupied genes, increased cryptic transcription, altered nucleosome positioning, and concordant shifts in histone modification profiles. We show that a homologous region within mouse RTF1 interacts with the CHCT domains of mouse CHD1 and CHD2. This work supports a conserved mechanism for coupling Chd1 family proteins to the transcription elongation complex and identifies a cellular function for a domain within Chd1 about which little is known.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

Here, we describe an additional layer to this process, essential when pathogen-derived signals alone cannot directly achieve full DC activation. Immunisation with sporozoites from Plasmodium leads to CD8 T cell priming in a complex response that is initiated by conventional type 1 DC (cDC1). We unveil a pivotal initiating role for Vgamma1+ gammadelta T cells, as they directly supply IL-4 to DC and CD8 T cells. IL-4 synergises with a CD4 T cell-derived CD40L signal to induce IL-12 production by cDC1. Both IL-12 and IL-4 then directly signal CD8 T cells, with synergy between these cytokines then driving enhanced IL-12 receptor expression and expansion of responding CD8 T cells. This study reveals a key role for Vgamma1+ gammadelta T cells in initiating CD8 T cell immunity to Plasmodium. More broadly, it shows that responses to some pathogens require help from innate-like T cells to pass the initiation threshold and further amplify the response in a process underscored by IL-4 production.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

Chief amongst these multidrug resistant infections (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant infections (XDR) is Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is known to sometimes harbor genetic elements that render it incredibly difficult to treat with conventional antibiotics. Treatments like bacteriophages have not had much success against such pathogens because resistance to the phages used often develops rapidly. We adapted a co-evolutionary technique to develop K. pneumoniae phages to be highly active longitudinally against K. pneumoniae clinical isolates. In as few as 30 days, we were able to vastly expand the host ranges of K. pneumoniae phages against MDR and XDR clinical isolates and that maintain their infectivity over clinically relevant time periods. By adapting these established techniques to clinical MDR and XDR K. pneumoniae isolates, we believe we can establish similar techniques for expanding phage host ranges against most antibiotic-resistant bacteria. As such, phages can be viable alternatives to antibiotics when antibiotic resistance exists in hospitals and communities.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

Insects are a good model for examining the latter impacts as, although most are diplodiploids (DD), some lineages reproduce by haplodiploidy (HD) or thelytoky. In this study, we ask if breeding system influences patterns of evolution in the mitogenome using the 658 bp barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene as a sentinel. Specifically, we ask if the incidence of amino acid substitutions and indels is linked to breeding system. We investigated this matter by examining COI sequences from specimens assigned to 1332 BINs, a species proxy. Belonging to 513 families and 26 orders, these BINs included representatives of roughly half of all insect families. Most are DD, but ten lineages, varying in rank from tribe to order, are HD. Our analysis reveals that HD lineages show higher rates of amino acid substitution than DD. In addition, indels are frequent in HD lineages but are absent in DD taxa with one exception. Among DD, the Strepsiptera is an outlier; its COI shows very rapid amino acid evolution and frequent indels. The accelerated rates of mitogenome evolution in HD lineages suggest that this breeding system facilitates coevolution between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

Our work highlights P. viridiflava as an effective broad host pathogen that relies on conserved virulence factors to manipulate evolutionarily divergent host plants.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

While the evolution of feeding structures has been studied extensively in this context, the nature of dietary adaptations in the digestive tract remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the cellular and molecular basis of dietary adaptations in the massive radiation of cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika using comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic data derived from the intestines of 24 endemic cichlid species with distinct habitats and diets. We show that, at the cellular level, dietary adaptations are primarily driven by anterior enterocytes, and that both the relative abundance and gene expression profiles of these cells have evolved in response to rapid dietary specializations. These dietary adaptations are driven by rapidly evolving cell population-specific genes, suggesting that alterations in epithelial cell specification programs and molecular makeup promote ecological diversification.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359
"Transient transcription factor depletions explain diverse single-cell responses of LexA target promoters to mild DNA damage","10.1101/2024.11.28.625836","biorxiv",19.15,3.7,19.15,19.15,19.15,"Galbusera, L.; Bellement, G.; Julou, T.; van Nimwegen, E.","Erik van Nimwegen","Biozentrum, University of Basel","2024-12-03","1","new results","cc_by_nc","systems biology","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/12/03/2024.11.28.625836.source.xml","In bacteria, the effects of transcription factors (TFs) on the expression of their target genes are highly stochastic at the single-cell level. Not only do TF concentrations fluctuate in time and from cell to cell, in each cell the actual binding and unbinding of TFs to promoters is also stochastic. However, how this  noise propagation from TFs to their targets determines the expression fluctuations in target genes of the same TF has so far not been quantitatively characterized. Here we use fluorescence time-lapse microscopy in combination with microfluidics and automated image analysis to quantitatively track the single-cell growth and gene expression dynamics of different target promoters of the LexA SOS response regulator in E. coli under mild DNA damage induced by the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP).

We find that, at the single-cell level, LexA target promoters exhibit stochastic bursts in protein production with specific quantitative characteristics. First, the durations of protein production bursts are short, identical for all promoters, and independent of CIP levels. Second, the heights of the production peaks are exponentially distributed for each promoter, and independent of CIP level, but with different average heights for different promoters. Third, the frequency of the production bursts increases with CIP level for all promoters, but differs across promoters.

Importantly, we show that these observations are inconsistent with popular  equilibrium models of bacterial gene regulation that assume that the dynamics of binding and unbinding of TFs is fast relative to the time-scale of TF concentration fluctuations. Instead, all observations can be quantitatively fit by a relatively simple model in which DNA damage events lead to short transient dips in LexA concentration, and an expression burst occurs in a cell whenever LexA unbinds from the target promoter during such a short dip in LexA concentration. Moreover, because these transient dips in LexA concentration occur on the same time-scale as the stochastic unbinding of LexA from promoters, the response of a target promoter to an individual DNA damage event is stochastic and depends in a complex manner on the strengths of its LexA binding sites and the duration of the event. Consequently, the expression levels of different LexA target genes in a given cell reflect distinct statistics of the frequency and durations of DNA damage events in the recent history of that cell.

Our results show that, even in the simple scenario where a single TF is induced, different target promoters can exhibit distinct stochastic responses that depend on the precise kinetics of the induction events.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

Here, using experimental evolution, we show that the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae can adapt to freeze-thaw stress in a stereotyped manner, with survival increasing nearly two orders of magnitude from {approx}2% to {approx}70% in about 25 cycles of stress exposure. Adapted cells exhibit reduced membrane damage, smaller sizes, higher mass densities, and a lower prevalence of budding. Rheological measurements show that the adapted cells are stiffer and exhibit lower particle mobilities within the cytoplasm. Whole genome sequencing indicates that increased survival is not accompanied by specific (unique) genetic changes, but rather is associated with multiple, distinct genotypes. Concomitant with mechanical changes in the adapted cells, the basal intracellular level of trehalose, a sugar speculated to play a physical role in maintaining membrane and cytoplasmic integrity, exhibits a three-fold increase. Together, these cellular attributes strongly correlate with the entry of cells into a quiescence-like state. A quantitative model that incorporates selection based on cellular quiescence recapitulates the adaptation dynamics, i.e. increase in survival and trehalose levels, seen in experiments. Finally, we find that the evolved mechano-chemical phenotypes are similar even when we use qualitatively different freeze-thaw selection protocols for the evolution, hinting at a convergent adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

To counteract this, cells deploy dedicated silencing factors, such as the E3 ligase SIFI that terminates the mitochondrial stress response. How a single enzyme can sense stress across cells and elicit timely stress response inactivation is poorly understood. Here, we report the structure of human SIFI, which revealed how this 1.3MDa complex can target hundreds of proteins for accurate stress response silencing. SIFI attaches the first ubiquitin to substrates using flexible domains within an easily accessible scaffold, yet builds linkage-specific ubiquitin chains at distinct, sterically restricted elongation modules in its periphery. Ubiquitin handover via a ubiquitin-like domain couples versatile substrate modification to precise chain elongation. Stress response silencing therefore exploits a catalytic mechanism that is geared to process many diverse proteins and hence allows a single enzyme to monitor and, if appropriate, modulate a complex cellular state.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

With no known effective FDA-approved treatments for either condition, patient-reported outcomes of treatments are invaluable for guiding management strategies in patient care and generating new avenues for research. Here, we present the results of an ME/CFS and Long COVID treatment survey with responses from 3,925 patients. We assessed the experiences of these patients with more than 150 treatments, as well as their demographics, symptoms, and comorbidities. Patients with each condition who participated in the study shared similar symptom profiles, including all the core symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g., 89.7% of ME/CFS and 79.4% of Long COVID reported post-exertional malaise (PEM). Treatments with the greatest perceived benefits were identified, which had varied effects on different core symptoms. In addition, treatment responses were significantly correlated (R{superscript 2} = 0.68) between the two patient groups. Patient subgroups with distinct profiles of symptoms and comorbidities showed varied responses to treatments, e.g., a POTS-dominant cluster benefiting from autonomic modulators and a cognitive-dysfunction cluster from CNS stimulants. This study underscores the symptomatic and therapeutic similarities between ME/CFS and Long COVID and highlights the commonalities and nuanced complexities of infection-associated chronic diseases and related conditions. Insights from patient-reported experiences, in the absence of approved treatments, provide urgently needed real-world evidence for targeted therapies in patient care and for developing future clinical trials.

Our high-resolution cryoEM structure reveals that PITHD1 simultaneously blocks three crucial functional sites on the 19S regulatory particle which are required for ubiquitin recognition, processing, and substrate translocation. This triple-lock mechanism effectively prevents protein degradation in dormant cells. Given PITHD1s evolutionary conservation across species, this mechanism likely represents a general strategy for reversible proteasome regulation during cellular dormancy. Our findings establish a new paradigm for controlling proteostasis in quiescent states.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

We present LRGE, a novel tool that uses read-to-read overlap information to estimate genome size in a reference-free manner. LRGE calculates per-read genome size estimates by analysing the expected number of overlaps for each read, considering read lengths and a minimum overlap threshold. The final size is taken as the median of these estimates, ensuring robustness to outliers such as reads with no overlaps. Additionally, LRGE provides an expected confidence range for the estimate. LRGE outperforms k-mer-based methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency and produces genome size estimates comparable to those from assembly-based approaches, like Raven, while using significantly less computational resources. We validate LRGE on a large, diverse bacterial dataset and confirm it generalises to eukaryotic datasets.

Availability and implementationOur method, LRGE (Long Read-based Genome size Estimation from overlaps), is implemented in Rust and is available as a precompiled binary for most architectures, a Bioconda package, a prebuilt container image, and a crates.io package as a binary (lrge) or library (liblrge).

Here, we focused on the contribution of the viral ""internal"" genomic segments of H5N1 B3.13 to bovine cells adaptation. We generated 45 reassortant viruses harbouring the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 and internal gene constellations from several influenza A viruses (IAV) or carrying segment swaps between distinct H5N1 strains. The recombinant B3.13 viruses displayed faster replication kinetics in bovine cells compared to other IAV.

Admixture between populations produces correlated expression between genes experiencing linkage disequilibrium. This correlated expression does not reflect functional relationships between genes, but rather depends on migration rates and physical linkage on chromosomes. Given the prevalence of gene flow between divergent populations in nature, these introgression effects likely represent a significant force in network evolution, even in populations where hybridization is historical rather than contemporary.

In the evolutionary transition from C3 to the more efficient C4 photosynthesis, restricting the glycine decarboxylase reaction to bundle sheath cells initiates a carbon concentrating mechanism via the photorespiratory glycine shuttle. This evolutionary step is generally thought to play an essential role in the progression from ancestral C3 to C4 photosynthesis. Plants operating this shuttle are often referred to as C3-C4 intermediates or C2 species. Within the Brassicaceae family, which includes model plants and crops, such species have evolved independently at least five times. However, research on the biochemistry of C3-C4 intermediates in the Brassicaceae has been limited to a few case studies of differentially localized proteins between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. Here, we leveraged recent advances in single-cell transcriptome sequencing to better understand how new cellular specialization affects interconnected pathways. We generated a single-nuclei RNA sequencing dataset for Moricandia arvensis, a Brassicaceae with C3-C4 intermediate characteristics, and compared it to a publicly available single-cell transcriptome of leaf tissue of the C3 Arabidopsis thaliana. We independently confirmed the localization of selected photorespiratory proteins by electron microscopy of immunogold-labelled leaf sections. Our analysis revealed the shift in expression of genes directly associated with the photorespiratory glycine decarboxylase reaction, but also of related pathways, such as ammonium assimilation, synthesis of specific amino acids, redox regulation, and transport to the M. arvensis bundle sheath. In contrast, the expression of these genes was not restricted to this cell type in the C3 plant.

HighlightSingle-nucleus RNA sequencing of Moricandia arvensis reveals bundle sheath cell-specific expression of photorespiration genes and associated pathways beyond glycine decarboxylase, including ammonium assimilation and redox regulation. This highlights the key role of metabolic compartmentalization in supporting C3-C4 intermediate photosynthesis.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

They are an important tool for understanding both the spread of epidemics as well as long-term macroevolutionary trends in speciation and extinction. In particular, phylodynamic methods based on multi-type birth-death models have been used to infer the evolution of discrete traits, the movement of individuals or pathogens between geographic locations or host types, and the transition of infected individuals between disease stages. In these models, population heterogeneity is treated by assigning individuals to different discrete types. Typically, methods which allow inference of parameters under multi-type birth-death models integrate over the possible birth-death trajectories (i.e. the type-specific population size functions) to reduce the computational demands of the inference. As a result, it has not been possible to use these methods to directly infer the dynamics of trait-specific population sizes, infected host counts or other such demographic quantities. In this paper we present a method which infers these multi-type trajectories with almost no additional computational cost beyond that of existing methods. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach by applying it to a previously-published set of MERS-CoV genomes, inferring the numbers of human and camel cases through time, together with the number and timing of spillovers from the camel reservoir. This application highlights the multi-type population trajectorys ability to elucidate properties of the population which are not directly ancestral to its sampled members.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

However, whether these genome-nuclear subcompartment interactions are encoded in the underlying DNA sequence remains poorly understood. The mechanisms for gene regulation are primarily encoded in noncoding DNA sequences, but deciphering how these sequence features control gene expression remains a significant challenge in genomics. Here, we present Nucleotide GPT, a transformer-based model that predicts genomic associations with spatially distinct, physical nuclear subcompartments from DNA sequence alone. Pre-trained on a diverse set of multi-species genomes, we demonstrate Nucleotide GPTs genomic understanding through evaluation on diverse prediction tasks, including histone modifications, promoter detection, and transcription factor binding sites. When finetuned to predict genome interactions with two separate nuclear subcompartments - the lamina of the inner nuclear membrane and nuclear speckles that lie more interior - Nucleotide GPT achieves an average accuracy of 73.6% for lamina-associated domains (LADs) and 79.4% accuracy for speckle-associated domains (SPADs), averaged across three cortical development cell types. Analysis of the models learned representations through Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) reveals that Nucleotide GPT develops internal embeddings that effectively distinguish LADs from inter-LADs, with predicted probabilities closely corresponding to experimentally determined LAD classifications. When examining these representations in the context of cell type-invariant constitutive LADs (cLADs) compared to cell type-specific LADs, the model assigns lower confidence scores to cell type-specific LADs compared to cLADs that are conserved across neuronal differentiation, suggesting sequence features may play a stronger role in maintaining cLAD associations. Examination of the models attention patterns at correctly classified regions suggests that specific sequence elements govern model decision making about nuclear subcompartment associations. Our results demonstrate the utility of transformer architectures for studying three-dimensional (3D) genome organization and substantiate a role for DNA sequence in determining nuclear subcompartment associations.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

The relative importance of standing genetic variation vs. de novo mutations in adaptation remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. Selection during domestication has been long used as a model to understand evolutionary processes, providing information not only on the phenotypes selected but also, in many cases, an understanding of the causal loci. Of the multiple causal loci that have been identified in maize, the selected allele can be found segregating in natural populations, consistent with their origin as standing genetic variation. The sole exception to this pattern is the well-characterized domestication locus tga1, which has long been thought to be an example of selection on a de novo mutation. Here, we use a large dataset of maize and teosinte genomes to reconstruct the origin and evolutionary history of tga1. We first estimated the age of tga1-maize using a genealogy-based method, finding that the allele arose approximately 41,000-49,000 years ago, predating the beginning of maize domestication. We also identify, for the first time, tga1-maize in teosinte populations, indicating the allele can survive in the wild. Finally, we compare observed patterns of haplotype structure and mutational age distributions near tga1 with simulations, finding that patterns near tga1 in maize better resemble those generated under simulated selective sweeps on standing variation. These multiple lines of evidence suggest that maize domestication likely drew upon standing genetic variation at tga1 and cement the importance of standing variation in driving adaptation during domestication.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

However, snRNA-seq poses high costs and technical limitations, often requiring the pooling of independent biological samples and loss of individual sample-level data. Deconvolution of sample identity using inherent features would enable the incorporation of pooled barcoding and sequencing protocols, thereby increasing data throughput and analytical sample size without requiring increases in experimental sample size and sequencing costs. In this study, we demonstrate a proof of concept that sex-dependent gene expression patterns can be leveraged for the deconvolution of pooled snRNA-seq data. Using previously published snRNA-seq data from the rat ventral tegmental area, we trained a range of machine learning models to classify cell sex using genes differentially expressed in cells from male and female rats. Models that used sex-dependent gene expression predicted cell sex with high accuracy (90-92%) and outperformed simple classification models using only sex chromosome gene expression (69-89%). The generalizability of these models to other brain regions was assessed using an additional published data set from the rat nucleus accumbens. Within this data set, model performance remained highly accurate in cell sex classification (89-90% accuracy) with no additional re-training. This work provides a model for future snRNA-seq studies to perform sample deconvolution using a two-sex pooled sample sequencing design and benchmarks the performance of various machine learning approaches to deconvolve sample identification from inherent sample features.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

It is widely accepted that the spread of this language family across Europe from the 5th millennium BP correlates with the expansion and diversification of steppe-related genetic ancestry from the onset of the Bronze Age6,7. However, multiple steppe-derived populations co-existed in Europe during this period, and it remains unclear how these populations diverged and which provided the demographic channels for the ancestral forms of the Italic, Celtic, Greek, and Armenian languages8,9. To investigate the ancestral histories of Indo-European-speaking groups in Southern Europe, we sequenced genomes from 314 ancient individuals from the Mediterranean and surrounding regions, spanning from 5,200 BP to 2,100 BP, and co-analysed these with published genome data. We additionally conducted strontium isotope analyses on 224 of these individuals. We find a deep east-west divide of steppe ancestry in Southern Europe during the Bronze Age. Specifically, we show that the arrival of steppe ancestry in Spain, France, and Italy was mediated by Bell Beaker (BB) populations of Western Europe, likely contributing to the emergence of the Italic and Celtic languages. In contrast, Armenian and Greek populations acquired steppe ancestry directly from Yamnaya groups of Eastern Europe. These results are consistent with the linguistic Italo-Celtic10,11 and Graeco-Armenian1,12,13 hypotheses accounting for the origins of most Mediterranean Indo-European languages of Classical Antiquity. Our findings thus align with specific linguistic divergence models for the Indo-European language family while contradicting others.

This chaperone function is critically important to proteostasis, conserved across all kingdoms of life, and associated with various protein misfolding diseases in humans4,5. Mechanistic insights into how sHSPs sequester destabilized clients have been limited due to the extreme molecular plasticity and client-induced polydispersity of sHSP/client complexes6-8. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the sHSP from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (mjHSP16.5) in both the apo-state and in an ensemble of client-bound states. The ensemble not only reveals key molecular mechanisms by which sHSPs respond to and sequester client proteins, but also provides insights into the cooperative nature of chaperone-client interactions. Engagement with destabilized client induces a polarization of stability across the mjHSP16.5 scaffold, proposed to facilitate higher-order assembly and enhance client sequestration capacity. Some higher-order sHSP oligomers appear to form through simple insertion of dimeric subunits into new geometrical features, while other higher-order states suggest multiple sHSP/client assembly pathways. Together, these results provide long-sought insights into the chaperone function of sHSPs and highlight the relationship between polydispersity and client sequestration under stress conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

Deep learning protein design approaches like ProteinMPNN have shown strong performance both in creating novel proteins or stabilizing existing ones. However, it is unlikely that the stability of the designs will significantly exceed that of the natural proteins in the training set, which are biophysically only marginally stable. Therefore, we collected predicted protein structures from hyperthermophiles, which differ substantially in their amino acid composition from mesophiles. Notably, ProteinMPNN fails to recover their unique amino acid composition. Here we show that a retrained network on predicted proteins from hyperthermophiles, termed HyperMPNN, not only recovers this unique amino acid composition but can also be applied to proteins from non-hyperthermophiles. Using this novel approach on a protein nanoparticle with a melting temperature of 65{degrees}C resulted in designs remaining stable at 95{degrees}C. In conclusion, we created a new way to design highly thermostable proteins through self-supervised learning on data from hyperthermophiles.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

To help us identify shared versus derived features that could be responsible for the evolution of these different regulatory architectures in animals, we studied the evolution and organization of the regulatory genome of echinoderms, a lineage whose phylogenetic position and relatively slow molecular evolution has proven particularly useful for evolutionary studies. First, using PacBio and HiC data, we generated new reference genome assemblies for two species belonging to two different echinoderm classes: the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the bat sea star Patiria miniata. Second, we characterized their 3D chromatin architecture, identifying TAD-like domains in echinoderms that, like in flies, do not seem to be associated with CTCF motif orientation. Third, we systematically profiled CREs during sea star and sea urchin development using ATAC-seq, comparing their regulatory logic and dynamics over multiple developmental stages. Finally, we investigated sea urchin and sea star CRE evolution across multiple evolutionary distances and timescales, from closely related species to other echinoderm classes and deuterostome lineages. This showed the presence of several thousand elements conserved for hundreds of millions of years, revealing a vertebrate-like pattern of CRE evolution that probably constitutes an ancestral property of the regulatory evolution of animals.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

Early-life adversity (ELA) is a risk for human affective disorders involving dysregulated reward behaviors. In mice, ELA causes anhedonia-like behaviors in males and augmented reward motivation in females, indicating sex-dependent disruption of reward circuit operations. We recently identified a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expressing GABAergic projection from basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) that governs reward-seeking deficits in adult ELA males--but not females.

MethodsTo probe the sex-specific role of this projection in reward behaviors, adult male and female CRH-Cre mice raised in control or ELA conditions received excitatory or inhibitory Cre-dependent DREADDs in BLA, and then clozapine N-oxide or vehicle to NAc medial shell during reward behaviors. We determined the cell identity of the projection using immunostaining and electrophysiology. Using tissue clearing, light sheet fluorescence microscopy and deep learning pipelines, we mapped brain-wide BLA CRH+ axonal projections to uncover sex differences in innervation.

ResultsChemogenetic manipulations in male mice demonstrated inhibitory effects of the CRH+ BLA-NAc projection on reward behaviors, whereas neither excitation nor inhibition influenced female behaviors. Molecular and electrophysiological cell-identities of the projection did not vary by sex. By contrast, comprehensive whole-brain mapping uncovered significant differences in NAc innervation patterns that were both sex and ELA-dependent, as well as selective changes of innervation of other brain regions.

ConclusionsThe CRH/GABA BLA-NAc projection that influences reward behaviors in males differs structurally and functionally in females, uncovering potential mechanisms for the profound sex-specific impacts of ELA on reward behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

These three loci, Teosinte crossing barrier 1 (Tcb1), Gametophytic factor 1 (Ga1), and Ga2, each play a key role in preventing hybridization between populations and are proposed to maintain the barrier between domesticated and wild subspecies. Each locus encodes a matching pair of silk- and pollen-active pectin methylesterases (PMEs). To investigate the diversity and molecular evolution of these gametophytic factor loci, we identified existing and improved models of the responsible genes in a new genome assembly which contains active versions of all three loci. We then examined fifty-two assembled genomes from seventeen species to classify haplotype diversity and identify sites under diversifying selection during the evolution of the causal genes. We show that Ga2, the oldest of these three loci, was duplicated to form Ga1 at least 12 million years ago. Tcb1, the youngest locus, arose as a duplicate of Ga1 before or around the time of diversification of the Zea genus. We find evidence of positive selection during evolution of the functional genes at an active site in the pollen-expressed PME and predicted surface sites in both the silk- and pollen-expressed PMEs. The most common allele at the Ga1 locus is a conserved ga1 allele (ga1-O), which is non-coding due to conserved stop codons in full-length gene copies that are between 610 thousand and 1.5 million years old. We show that the ga1-O allele is associated with and likely generates 24-nt siRNAs in developing pollen-producing tissue, and these siRNAs map to functional Ga1 alleles. In previously-published crosses, the ga1-O allele associates with reduced function of the typically dominant functional alleles for the Ga1 and Tcb1 barriers. Taken together, this seems to be an example of a type of epigenetic trans-homolog silencing known as paramutation functioning at a locus controlling a reproductive barrier.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

Here, we collect cryo-EM images over a range of agonist concentrations to define structures of the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in unliganded, mono-liganded, and di-liganded states. We show that agonist binding to a single agonist site stabilizes an intermediate state where an entire principal agonist-binding subunit has transitioned to an active-like conformation, while the other unoccupied principal subunit remains inactive, albeit poised for activation. Binding of agonist to the second agonist site fully activates the remaining subunits leading to hydration of the ion pore. Uniting this cryo-EM derived intermediate structure with single-channel recordings leads to a model where individual acetylcholine receptor subunits asynchronously undergo conformational transitions, and thus a sequential activation mechanism that has implications for the entire superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

With the advance of population genomics, studies in diverse organisms revealed supergenes associated with a myriad of complex traits, ranging from morphology to sexual behavior, from butterfly wing patterns to floral morphs. Two supergenes have been described on non-homologous ""social chromosomes"" in two ant lineages, Solenopsis and Formica, that diverged more than 90 million years ago. In both lineages, the supergene is associated with social polymorphism, where some colonies are headed by a single queen (monogyne) while others harbor multiple queens (polygyne). We discovered a new supergene associated with similar social polymorphism in the desert ant Cataglyphis niger. Although Cataglyphis is more closely related to Formica than to Solenopsis, the social chromosome in C. niger is homologous to the Solenopsis social chromosome, with conservation of synteny in gene content as well as gene order. Therefore, this is an ancient chromosome dating back to the common ancestor of Solenopsis and Cataglyphis, at least 90 million years ago. Previous work dated the Solenopsis supergene to be only one million years old, therefore, we propose that the two supergenes have evolved independently in the two diverged lineages on this ancient social chromosome. We surveyed hymenopteran genomes to discover a bee chromosome homologous to the ants social chromosome. The conservation of the gene set on these homologous chromosomes in ants and bees suggests that this chromosome plays an important role in social behavior across social Hymenoptera. We hypothesize that the conserved gene set in the social chromosome was repeatedly used as a pre-adapted toolkit for the evolution of social traits in general and specifically in the evolution of polygyne social structure in ants.","NA","biorxiv",1733609331359

Current light-sheet stabilization methods rely on fluorescence emission from the sample, which may interrupt the scientific imaging and add to sample photobleaching. Here we show that for oblique plane microscopes (OPM), a subset of LSFM where a single primary objective is used for illumination and detection, light-sheet stabilization can be achieved without expending sample fluorescence. Our method achieves ~43nm axial precision and maintains the light-sheet well within the depth of focus of the detection system for hour-long acquisition runs in a lab environment that would otherwise detune the system.

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty. We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit. Based on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still undeniably demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1733609331359

PREVENT-19 (NCT04611802/2019nCoV-301), a pivotal phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated robust efficacy of a primary, 2-dose series of NVX-CoV2373 against COVID-19.

MethodsProtocol expansions to PREVENT-19 included enrollment of adolescents (aged 12 to <18 years) and administration of 3rd and 4th doses of NVX-CoV2373 to adults and adolescents. Participants randomized 2:1 received NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 21 days apart; 3rd and 4th doses were administered [&ge;]6 months after the preceding dose. Secondary and additional assessments included post-3rd- and 4th-dose immune responses (neutralizing antibody [nAb], anti-rS IgG, human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-receptor binding inhibition [hACE2-RBI]) and response durability (post-3rd dose) to ancestral virus; cross-reactivity to Omicron subvariants; safety; and reactogenicity.

ResultsImmune responses were observed against ancestral virus after two doses of NVX-CoV2373 but not after placebo. In both adults and adolescents, additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 increased nAb titers, anti-rS IgG levels, and hACE2-RBI; durable responses were recorded 8 months post 3rd dose. nAb responses post 3rd dose were noninferior to those post primary series. Cross-reactivity to BA.5 and BQ.1.1 variants was also observed, with anti-rS IgG levels post 3rd or 4th dose exceeding previously reported correlates of protection. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated, with no new safety signals.

ConclusionsNVX-CoV2373 elicited robust and durable humoral immune responses to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 as a 3rd and 4th dose after the primary series in adults and adolescents. Cross-reactivity to relevant variants provides insight into potential protection against antigenically related, but shifted, viral strains. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated with no new safety signals. These results support the utility of this vaccine platform and continued updates, based on currently circulating strains, to help effectively combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsThis phase 3, open-label study (2019nCoV-312/NCT05875701) enrolled participants who received one dose of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 protein-based vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) in an earlier study (2019nCoV-307/NCT05463068) after a primary series and possibly one additional dose of mRNA vaccine. In the current study, participants received an additional dose of protein-based vaccine (ancestral [n=104] or Omicron BA.5 [n=40]) at least 180 days after their previous study dose. The primary objective was demonstration of noninferiority of neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers induced by the dose in this study versus the first dose of NVX-CoV-2373 in the earlier study. Safety was also evaluated.

ResultsA total of 144 participants were enrolled. The ratio of anti-Wuhan nAbs (GMT, IU/mL [95% CI]) at Day 28 after this study dose (ancestral 393.2 [318.0-468.2]) versus previous study dose (396.6 [328.7-478.6]) was 1.0 (0.8, 1.2), meeting noninferiority. The seroresponse rate difference between doses was 7.4% (95% CI = -1.2%-16.5%), also meeting noninferiority. Omicron BA.5 nAb titers suggest cross-protection against emerging variants. The nAb ratio at Day 28 between Omicron dose in this study (835.0 [597.1-1167.6]) versus previous study ancestral dose (436.0 [305.6-622.2]) was 1.9 (1.5-2.5), exceeding superiority criterion. Local and systemic reactions were similar between doses and strains in both studies.

ConclusionsA heterologous regimen of two adjuvanted recombinant spike protein-based vaccine doses after mRNA vaccination produced robust immune responses, exhibiting cross-reactivity to newer variants.","NA","medrxiv",1733609331359

From 2022, the national vaccination programme has been run twice per year, prioritising older age groups or those classified as clinically vulnerable. Here we assess the trends in COVID-19 outcomes between September 2023 and April 2024, using national-level data held by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

MethodsData linkage of national-level COVID-19 episode data, NHS emergency and hospital attendance data, and death registrations were used to analyse COVID-19 outcomes. Outcomes were defined as COVID-19 associated A&E attendances, hospital admissions, severe hospitalisations, and deaths.

The number and rate of each COVID-19 outcome category between September 2023 and April 2024 was calculated, stratified by clinical risk status and age and sex.

ResultsThe most common COVID-19 outcomes during this time-period were A&E attendance and hospital admission, with the rates highest among those aged 75 and over. Among this age group, all outcomes disproportionately affect those who have been identified as at clinical risk and those who were immunosuppressed.

High rates of A&E attendance and hospital admission were also observed among infants (under 6 months old) but were lower for more severe outcomes.

DiscussionGroups that were most affected by COVID-19 outcomes were currently prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination in England, which will help protect against more severe outcomes including admission to intensive care and death.

Routine national levels surveillance of COVID-19 outcomes is essential to monitor populations most of severe disease and informing vaccination policy.","NA","medrxiv",1733609331359

Immunity has been acquired through natural infection, primary and booster vaccination, while protection has been lost through waning immunity and viral mutation. During the height of the pandemic in England, the main aim was to rapidly protect the population and large supplies of vaccine were pre-purchased, eliminating the need for cost-effective calculations. As we move to an era where for the majority of the population SARS-CoV-2 infections cause relatively mild disease, and vaccine stocks need to be re-purchased, it is important we consider the cost-effectiveness and economic value of COVID-19 vaccination programmes.

MethodsHere using data from 2023 and 2024 in England on COVID-19 hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths, coupled with bespoke health economic costs, we consider the willingness to pay threshold for COVID-19 vaccines in different age and risk groups. We partition the population into sixteen 5-year age-groups and three risk groups (no-risk, at-risk and immunosuppressed) and calculate the health savings, in terms of costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), per vaccine dose. We adopt three different methodological approaches to estimate the level of vaccine protection leading to five different estimates of efficacy.

FindingsWillingness to pay thresholds vary from less than {pound}1 for younger age-groups without any risk factors, to over {pound}100 for older age-groups with comorbidities that place them at risk. This extreme non-linear dependence on age, means that despite the different method of estimating vaccine efficacy, there is considerable qualitative agreement on the willingness to pay threshold, and therefore which ages it is cost-effective to vaccinate. For pre-purchased vaccine, where the only cost is administration ({approx}{pound}10), a twice-yearly universal booster offer to all those aged 70 and over is cost-effective (the benefits outweigh the administration costs), while for the at-risk group this could be extended to those over 65. When the vaccine cost is included, the cost-effective ages reduce, such that at a total cost of {pound}30 (for vaccine and administration) universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 75; while at {pound}60 universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 80.

InterpretationThe historic offer of COVID-19 vaccination to those 65 and over for the autumn 2023 programme and those over 75 for the spring 2023 programme, aligns with our cost-effective threshold for pre-purchased vaccine when the only cost was administration. However, for future programmes, when vaccine costs are included, the age-thresholds slowly increase thereby demonstrating the continued importance of protecting the eldest and most vulnerable in the population.","NA","medrxiv",1733609331359

Genomic analysis has identified a lineage with limited internal diversity most closely related to a genome sequence from a sporadic case sampled in 2014 in Uganda, though the lineages have diverged from a common ancestor that was circulating for decades in the animal reservoir.

Notably, the data also provide evidence that the outbreak resulted from a single zoonotic transmission event with limited human-to-human transmission, rather than multiple independent zoonotic transmission events. The Rwandan MVD outbreak prompted a thorough investigation that included contact tracing, clinical assessment, travel history, sequencing, and serology testing, to trace the viruss origin. Results of investigations linked the index case to a mining cave inhabited by Rousettus aegyptiacus (the Egyptian fruit bat), where three individuals tested seropositive for IgG and IgM, further supporting the zoonotic origin of the outbreak through human-animal interactions.","NA","medrxiv",1733609331359
