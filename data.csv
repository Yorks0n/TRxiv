We measured COVID-19 VE against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic infection in HCWs in the country of Georgia from January - June 2022, during a period of Omicron circulation.

MethodsWe conducted a cohort study of HCWs in six hospitals in Georgia. HCWs were enrolled in early 2021. Participants completed weekly symptom questionnaires. Symptomatic HCWs were tested by RT-PCR and/or rapid antigen test (RAT). Participants were also routinely tested, at varying frequencies during the study period, for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or RAT, regardless of symptoms. Serology was collected quarterly throughout the study and tested by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We estimated absolute and relative VE of a first booster dose compared to a primary vaccine series as (1-hazard ratio)*100 using Cox proportional hazards models.

ResultsAmong 1253 HCWs, 141 (11%) received a primary vaccine series (PVS) and a first booster, 855 (68%) received PVS only, and 248 (20%) were unvaccinated. Most boosters were BNT162b2 (Comirnaty original monovalent) vaccine (90%) and BIBP-CorV vaccine (Sinopharm) (9%). Most PVS were BNT162b2 vaccine (68%) and BIBP-CorV vaccine (24%). Absolute VE for a first booster was 40% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -56 - 77) at 7- 29 days following vaccination, -9% (95% CI -104 - 42) at 30 - 59 days, and - 46% (95% CI -156 - 17) at [&ge;] 60 days. Relative VE of first booster dose compared to PVS was 58% (95% CI 1 - 82) at 7- 29 days following vaccination, 21% (95% CI -33 - 54) at 30 - 59 days, and -9% (95% CI -82 - 34) at [&ge;] 60 days.

ConclusionIn Georgia, first booster dose VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs was moderately effective but waned very quickly during Omicron. Increased efforts to vaccinate priority groups in Georgia, such as healthcare workers, prior to periods of anticipated high COVID-19 incidence are essential.","NA","medrxiv",1727734169080

We describe this burden and compare it to the burden of influenza in the first two post-pandemic years in Denmark. Methods: A cohort study including residents in Denmark from May 16, 2022, to June 7, 2024. Data were obtained from national registries, including information on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-positive COVID-19 and influenza admissions, mortality within 30 days of admission, sex, age, COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, comorbidity, and living in long-term care facility for elderly. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to compare rates of admissions between COVID-19 and influenza. To assess severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 30-day mortality between COVID-19 and influenza. Results: Among 5,899,170 individuals, admissions with COVID-19 (n=24,687) were more frequent than admissions with influenza (n=8,682; aIRR 2.01, 95%CI 1.37-2.95), in particular during the first year (p=0.01), in the summer (p<0.001) and among people above 65 years of age (p<0.001). The number of deaths were also higher (COVID-19, n=2,393; influenza, n=522). Among patients, the risk of mortality of COVID-19 was higher than influenza in the 12-30 days following admission (0-11 days, aHR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.25; 12-30 days, aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.21-1.84), in particular among non-vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza (aHR 1.81, 95%CI 1.25-2.62), while it was similar to influenza among patients without comorbidities (aHR 1.07, 95%CI 0.63-1.80). Conclusion: COVID-19 represented a greater disease burden than influenza, with more hospitalisations and deaths, and more severe disease primarily among non-vaccinated and comorbid patients. These results highlight the continued need for attention and public health efforts to mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2.","NA","medrxiv",1727734169080

However, they are threatened by climate change and even face the risk of local or global extinction. The responses of these species to climate change have received little attention. In this study, we examine the effects of climate change on state flowers and insects in the United States by employing correlative species distribution models (SDMs). We select a variety of commonly used SDM algorithms to construct an ensemble forecasting framework aimed at predicting the potential habitats for each species under both historical and future climate scenarios, and how these changes might influence the distributions of state flower and insect species. Our results show that more than half of the state flowers ([~] 66%) and insects ([~] 51%) are predicted to experience a substantial decrease in regions with favorable climates within the states they represent. Conversely, only a small number (Flowers: [~] 2%; Insects: [~] 10%) are projected to see an increase in habitat suitability in the future. Certain states may no longer possess suitable habitats for their state-designated species. Our findings indicate that cultural heritage might be at risk due to reduced habitat suitability and local extinctions driven by climate change. These findings can provide guidance regarding the protection or replacement of state species to preserve cultural heritage.

Significance StatementWe have known for decades that climate change may lead to species local or global extinction. However, the vast majority of such research has focused on species of ecological or economic importance. Only recently have researchers begun to seriously consider the impacts of climate change on our cultural heritage, and that research has mainly focused on tangible cultural assests such as buildings and anthropological sites. Here, we consider the impacts of climate change on species of cultural significance, namely U.S. state flowers and insects. We find that the majority of these species are threatened with local extinction from climate change, and the loss of these species will take with them important aspects of our history and culture.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

In 2021, Jesse Bloom reported on the recovery of a dataset of raw sequencing reads that had been removed from the NCBI SRA database at the request of the data generators, a scientific team at Wuhan University (Wang et al., 2020b). Bloom concluded that the data deletion had obfuscated the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and suggested that deletion may have been requested to comply with a government order; further, he questioned reported sample collection dates on and after January 30, 2020. Here, we show that sample collection dates were published in 2020 by Wang et al. together with the sequencing reads, and match the dates given by the authors in 2021. Collection dates of January 30, 2020 were manually removed by Bloom during his analysis of the data. We examine mutations in these sequences and confirm that they are entirely consistent with the previously known genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 of late January 2020. Finally, we explain how an apparent phylogenetic rooting paradox described by Bloom was resolved by subsequent analysis. Our reanalysis demonstrates that there was no basis to question the sample collection dates published by Wang et al..

The main crossover pathway relies on ZMM proteins, including ZIP4 and HEI10, and is typically resolved by the MLH1/MLH3 heterodimer, MutL{gamma}. Our analysis of plant fertility and bivalent formation revealed that the MUS81 endonuclease can partially compensate for the MutL{gamma} loss. Comparing genome-wide crossover maps of the mlh1 mutant with ZMM-deficient mutants and lines with varying HEI10 levels reveals that while crossover interference persists in mlh1, it is weakened. Additionally, mlh1 show reduced crossover assurance, leading to a higher incidence of aneuploidy in offspring. This is likely due to MUS81 resolving intermediates without the crossover bias seen in MutL{gamma}. Comparing mlh1 mlh3 mus81 and zip4 mus81 mutants suggests that additional crossover pathways emerge in the absence of both MutL{gamma} and MUS81. The loss of MutL{gamma} can also be suppressed by eliminating the FANCM helicase. Elevated expression of MLH1 or MLH3 increases crossover frequency, while their overexpression significantly reduces crossover numbers and plant fertility, highlighting the importance for tight control of MLH1/MLH3 levels. By contrast, PMS1, a component of the MutL endonuclease, appears not to be involved in crossing-over. Together, these findings demonstrate the unique role of MutL{gamma} in ZMM-dependent crossover regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

Plasticity of excitatory projection neurons has been considered to be the primary neuronal substrate for the acquisition and storage of memories. However, a wide range of inhibitory interneurons controls the activity of projection neurons in a spatially and temporally precise manner, yet their contribution to memory acquisition, storage and expression remains poorly understood. Here, we employ a miniature microscope imaging approach to monitor the activity of large amygdala interneuron populations in freely moving mice during fear learning and extinction at the single cell level. We find that amygdala interneurons display mixed-selectivity and show complex plastic responses at both the ensemble and single neuron level across the acquisition, expression and extinction of aversive memories. In contrast to bidirectional single cell plasticity across distinct fear states, learning-induced changes at the population level occur transiently during conditioning and do not consolidate across days. Examining molecular interneuron subpopulations revealed that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing cells are predominantly activated by high fear states. In contrast, somatostatin (SST) interneurons display a preference for safety cues and thereby suppress excitatory neuron responsiveness. However, responses of individual neurons within the SST and VIP populations are non-uniform, indicating the presence of functional subtypes within classical molecularly-defined interneuron populations. Taken together, we identify complex neuronal plasticity within amygdala interneuron ensembles that goes beyond a passive processing function, suggesting a critical role of inhibitory microcircuit elements for memory selectivity and stability.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

Gram-negatives encode a type VI secretion system (T6SS) that delivers toxins into eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Previous studies highlighted the importance of Salmonella T6SSs in bacterial antagonism and host cell infection, but few antibacterial effectors have been described. Here, we used bioinformatic strategies to identify the T6SS effectors in 10,000 Salmonella genomes. As a result, we identified and manually curated 128 candidates. Specific Salmonella serovars harbor unique effectors that are target-specific (antibacterial or anti-eukaryotic), depending on the T6SS subtype (e.g. i1 or i3). In addition, 45 previously uncharacterized toxin domains were identified and designated STox (Salmonella toxins). STox15 was among the most frequent candidates and was selected for in-depth characterization. STox15 is an antibacterial effector belonging to the NlpC/P60 papain-like fold superfamily with a permuted catalytic core typical of lipid-targeting versions rather than peptidases or amidases. Biochemical analysis with recombinant protein and lipidomics of intoxicated Escherichia coli revealed that STox15 displays phospholipase activity cleaving off acyl groups from phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. This work improves our understanding of the Salmonella T6SS effector repertoire and provides the first direct characterization of a lipid-targeting NlpC/P60 domain in biological conflicts.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

While epigenetic aging clocks have shown accuracy in predicting biological age, they typically provide single estimates for the samples and lack mechanistic insights. In this study, we challenge the paradigm that aging can be sufficiently described with a single biological age estimate. We describe Ageome, a computational framework for measuring the epigenetic age of thousands of molecular pathways simultaneously in mice and humans. Ageome is based on the premise that an organisms overall biological age can be approximated by the collective ages of its functional modules, which may age at different rates and have different biological ages. We show that, unlike conventional clocks, Ageome provides a high-dimensional representation of biological aging across cellular functions, enabling comprehensive assessment of aging dynamics within an individual, in a population, and across species. Application of Ageome to longevity intervention models revealed distinct patterns of pathway-specific age deceleration. Notably, cell reprogramming, while rejuvenating cells, also accelerated aging of some functional modules. When applied to human cohorts, Ageome demonstrated heterogeneity in predictive power for mortality risk, and some modules showed better performance in predicting the onset of age-related diseases, especially cancer, compared to existing clocks. Together, the Ageome framework offers a comprehensive and interpretable approach for assessing aging, providing insights into mechanisms and targets for intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

As the most prominent nuclear condensate in eukaryotes, the nucleolus is a layered multiphase liquid-like structure and the site of ribosome biogenesis. In the nucleolus, ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are transcribed and processed, undergoing multiple maturation steps that ultimately result in formation of the ribosomal small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU). However, how rRNA processing is coupled to the layered nucleolar organization is poorly understood due to a lack of tools to precisely monitor and perturb nucleolar rRNA processing dynamics. Here, we developed two complementary approaches to spatiotemporally map rRNA processing and engineer de novo nucleoli. Using sequencing in parallel with imaging, we found that rRNA processing steps are spatially segregated, with sequential maturation of rRNA required for its outward movement through nucleolar phases. Furthermore, by generating synthetic de novo nucleoli through an engineered rDNA plasmid system in cells, we show that defects in SSU processing can alter the ordering of nucleolar phases, resulting in inside-out nucleoli and preventing rRNA outflux, while LSU precursors are necessary to build the outermost layer of the nucleolus. These findings demonstrate how rRNA is both a scaffold and substrate for the nucleolus, with rRNA acting as a programmable blueprint for the multiphase architecture that facilitates assembly of an essential molecular machine.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

Here, we show that one such protein, BLTP3A/UHRF1BP1, associates with VAMP7-positive vesicles via its C-terminal region and anchors them to lysosomes via the binding of its chorein domain containing N-terminal region to Rab7. Upon damage of lysosomal membranes and resulting mATG8 recruitment to their surface by CASM, BLTP3A first dissociates from lysosomes but then reassociates with them via an interaction of its LIR motif with mATG8. Such interaction is mutually exclusive to the binding of BLTP3A to vesicles and leaves its N-terminal chorein domain, i.e. the proposed entry site of lipids into this family of proteins, available for binding to another membrane, possibly the ER. Our findings reveal that BLTP3A is an effector CASM, potentially as part of a mechanism to help repair or minimize lysosome damage by delivering lipids.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

Our previous work has detailed the timeline of BBB functional maturation in zebrafish, revealing a conserved mechanism of BBB induction through the suppression of endothelial transcytosis. Yet, as opposed to extensive research on glial-vascular interactions in rodents, such interactions remain largely overlooked in the zebrafish model system. Here, we focus on glial-vascular development in the zebrafish brain, leveraging three glial gene promoters: gfap (glial fibrillary acidic protein), glast (an astrocyte-specific glutamate transporter), and glastini (a new, shortened, equally effective version of the Glast promoter). Using these glial promoters, sparse labeling revealed fewer glial-vascular interactions during early larval stages, with both glial coverage and contact area increasing as the zebrafish brain matured. We then generated stable transgenic lines for both the Glast and Glastini promoters and observed similar increases in glial coverage during larval development, starting at ~30% coverage at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) and peaking at ~60% at 10 dpf. Ultrastructural assessment of glial-vascular interactions using electron microscopy (EM) confirmed a progressive increase in glial coverage over larval development, with maximal coverage reaching ~70% in adult zebrafish, significantly lower than the nearly 100% coverage observed in mammals. Finally, immunogold-EM labeling confirmed that cells identified as glia in aforementioned morphological analyses were indeed Glast-positive.

The causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), possesses a complex cell envelope that determines many of the key physiologic and virulence properties that facilitate infection, which comprises multiple classes of unique lipids. The macrophage phagosome is a key reservoir of infection in pulmonary TB and multiple studies have shown that inorganic phosphate (Pi) is limiting in this environment. The ability of Mtb to sense and respond to phosphate starvation is required for virulence in animal models and replication in human macrophages in vitro. Here, we show that during Pi restriction the Mtb lipidome is markedly remodelled such that phospholipids are replaced with multiple classes of phosphorus-free lipids, some of which have not been documented before. Further, we discover that Mtb can metabolise phospholipid polar heads derived from host pulmonary surfactant as an alternative phosphate source, which sustains cell division for several generations during Pi restriction. These dual manipulations of phospholipid metabolism provide Mtb with an escape from phosphate restriction specific to the infection of alveolar macrophages, one of the earliest steps in establishing pulmonary tuberculosis. The changes in envelope lipidome remodelling, akin to that observed in some marine and terrestrial bacteria suggests that standard Mtb culture conditions that use media with high concentrations of Pi do not reflect the physiologic environment during infection, thereby potentially undermining vaccine and drug development for tuberculosis. Moreover, the distinct Mtb phosphate-free lipids and the metabolic pathways that generate them could provide new antibiotic targets.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

It has been demonstrated previously that many such sequences show high similarity to genes from RNA viruses, either due to viral infection of the original sample, contamination or endogenous viral elements (EVEs) integrated into the genome of the sample species. Many proteins from RNA virus discovery research are also deposited into these repositories but, for various reasons, can only be labelled as uncharacterised and classified taxonomically at a superkingdom or realm level. Sequences from protein repositories not labelled specifically as being derived from the RNA viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein are often used as negative controls when looking to identify viral RdRp sequences, so the presence of unlabelled viruses amongst these datasets is problematic.

In this study, we screened uncharacterised proteins from two large public protein repositories - NCBI Protein and UniProt - to identify sequences likely to be derived from RNA viral RdRp. 3,560 such sequences were identified, many derived from EVEs. Many previously unknown EVEs were identified and led to characterisation of additional, related sequences. For example, a group of orbivirus-like viruses infecting nematodes was uncovered which appears to have both ancient endogenous and circulating exogenous members. Many recent integrations of mito-like viruses into plant genomes were identified, indicative of current or recent RNA viral activity. In several taxonomic groups, the first example of an EVE, and in some cases the first example of any RNA virus, was uncovered. The large number of EVEs uncovered by this relatively small-scale search suggests that only a fraction of the true diversity of EVEs is currently known.

We also explore uncharacterised proteins further by providing provisional taxonomic annotations for RdRps which are currently only listed as members of the Riboviria realm. A number of sequences are identified which are indistinguishable from known, pathogenic viruses but are labelled as bacteria, seemingly as a result of mislabelling or contamination. Sequences which are not RNA viral but show some similarity to RdRp are also analysed, as a potential source of false positives in virus discovery research. Finally, recommendations are made for generating useful negative controls.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae worldwide exhibit introgressions from the sister species S. paradoxus, despite the average sequence identity between these species being lower than 90%. While S. cerevisiae isolates from the Neotropics are known for their high levels of introgression, the evolutionary events leading to the unusually high prevalence of them remain unclear. Here, we sequenced 216 S. cerevisiae isolates living in open agave fermentation across Mexico, a habitat at the interface of natural and industrial environments. The genomes of these strains revealed considerable genetic diversity and population structure linked to geographic distribution, which had been overlooked due to undersampling of this megadiverse region. These strains, along with those from French Guiana, Ecuador, and Brazil, form a broader Neotropical phylogenetic cluster that is notably enriched with introgressions. Surprisingly, the origins and conservation patterns of introgressions indicate multiple hybridization events, suggesting an unprecedented scenario of flexible species barriers in this region. Our findings underscore concurrent evolutionary processes--geographical stratification and multiple introgressions--that shape the genomes of a diverse lineage of S. cerevisiae. Yeasts from the Neotropics thus provide a natural laboratory for exploring the mechanisms and adaptive significance of introgressive hybridization in eukaryotic genome evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

Two essential technologies underpin this achievement: the ability to clone entire genomes in host organisms, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the successful transplant of these genomes into recipient cells to generate living organisms. In all previous work the recipient cell in genome transplantation experiments has been Mycoplasma capricolum. In this study, we explored the potential of using Mycoplasma mycoides strains as recipient cells for genome transplantation. By increasing polyethylene glycol (PEG) concentration from 5% to 10%, we successfully transplanted various M. mycoides strains using several M. mycoides recipient cells. Additionally, we demonstrated the ability to transplant M. capricolum genomes into M. mycoides recipient cells; although with lower efficiency compared to M. mycoides strains. These findings provide a modified transplantation protocol and likely get us closer to expanding genome transplantation to other bacterial species.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

To evaluate existing models of neurocognitive ageing such as compensation, maintenance, or reserve, we explore how various known brain-based and cardiorespiratory fitness factors intersect to better understand cognitive decline. We tested 73 (Mage = 65.51) neurologically healthy older adults and collected neuroimaging (functional, structural, and perfusion MRI), cardiorespiratory fitness, and behavioural performance data to investigate a well-documented, prominent cognitive challenge for older adults: word-finding failures. We aimed to uncover associations between predictors, which have previously been theoretically-implicated, in explaining age-related tip-of-the-tongue rates. Commonality analyses revealed that functional activation of language networks associated with tip-of-the-tongue states is in part linked with age and, interestingly, cardiorespiratory fitness levels. Age-associated atrophy and perfusion in regions other than those showing functional differences accounted for variance in tip-of-the-tongue states. Our findings can be interpreted in the context of the classic models of neurocognitive ageing suggesting compensation.

Here, we studied the association between MHC-variant binding and risk of clonal haematopoiesis (CH), a pre-cancer state in the blood driven by expansions of mutant haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We predicted MHC binding affinity towards 40 known CH hotspot variants in 380,000 UK Biobank participants, and examined the relationship between predicted binding to each variant and risk of its expansion in the blood. Despite being well powered to detect subtle differences in selective pressure, we did not find associations between predicted MHC binding and CH prevalence for any of the hotspot variants. In individuals in whom we identified CH, there was no relationship between predicted binding affinity to the variant and size of the clone. Overall, we do not find evidence for the MHC genotype to be a factor that affects which somatic variants expand in CH, suggesting a limited role for immunosurveillance in shaping the genetic diversity of the blood.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

Beyond moving to a new server and the creation of a computational mirror, we have expanded the database with the addition of 33 invertebrate species, including representatives of 5 previously unsampled phyla, and 6 mammal species. MirGeneDB now contains entries for 21,822 microRNA genes (5,160 of these from the new species) belonging to 1743 microRNA families. The inclusion of these new species allowed us to refine both the evolutionary node of appearance of a number of microRNA genes/families, as well as MirGeneDBs phylogenetically informed nomenclature system. Updated covariance models of all microRNA families, along with all smallRNA read data are now downloadable. These enhanced annotations will allow researchers to analyze microRNA properties such as secondary structure and features of their biogenesis within a robust phylogenetic context and without the database plagued with numerous false positives and false negatives. In light of these improvements, MirGeneDB 3.0 will assume the responsibility for naming conserved novel metazoan microRNAs.

They are implicated in multiple neurological disorders including stroke, epilepsy and neurodegeneration and can regulate neuronal excitability through interactions with ion channels2. Polyamines have been linked to pain showing altered levels in human persistent pain states and modulation of pain behaviour in animal models3. However, the systems governing polyamine transport within the nervous system remain unclear. In undertaking a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) of chronic pain intensity in the UK-Biobank we found significant association with variants mapping to the SLC45A4 gene locus. In the mouse nervous system SLC45A4 expression is enriched in all sensory neuron sub-types within the dorsal root ganglion including nociceptors. Cell-based assays show that SLC45A4 is a selective plasma membrane polyamine transporter, whilst the cryo-EM structure reveals a novel regulatory domain and basis for polyamine recognition. Mice lacking SLC45A4 show normal mechanosensitivity but reduced sensitivity to noxious heat and algogen induced tonic pain that is associated with reduced excitability of peptidergic nociceptors. Our findings thus establish a role for neuronal polyamine transport in pain perception and identify a new target for therapeutic intervention in pain treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

As G4s modulate gene expression and genomic stability, genome-wide mapping of G4s has generated strong research interest. Recently, the Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) method was performed with the G4-specific BG4 antibody to target Tn5 transposase to G4s. While this method generated a novel high-resolution map of G4s, we unexpectedly observed a strong correlation between the genome-wide signal distribution of BG4 CUT&Tag and accessible chromatin. To examine whether untargeted Tn5 cutting at accessible chromatin contributes to BG4 CUT&Tag signal, we examined the genome-wide distribution of signal from untargeted (i.e. negative control) CUT&Tag datasets. We observed that untargeted CUT&Tag signal distribution was highly similar to both that of accessible chromatin and of BG4 CUT&Tag. We also observed that BG4 CUT&Tag signal increased at mapped G4s, but this increase was accompanied by a concomitant increase in untargeted CUT&Tag at the same loci. Consequently, enrichment of BG4 CUT&Tag over untargeted CUT&Tag was not increased at mapped G4s. These results imply that either the vast majority of accessible chromatin regions contain mappable G4s or that the presence of G4s within accessible chromatin cannot reliably be determined using BG4 CUT&Tag alone.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

Of the over 1,200 known representatives, many possess potent biological activities, but their drug potential has not been fully realised up until now. A central obstacle is the limited availability of minor withanolides, caused by a lack of knowledge about the underlying biosynthetic pathways. Here, we combine phylogenomics with metabolic engineering to overcome this limitation. By sequencing the genome of the medicinal plant and archetypical withanolide producer ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) and comparing the genome sequences of nine Solanaceae species, we discovered a conserved gene cluster for withanolide biosynthesis, consisting of two sub-gene clusters which differ in their expression patterns. To investigate the functions of the encoded enzymes, we established metabolic engineering platforms in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana. This allowed us to reconstitute the first three oxidative steps of withanolide biosynthesis, catalysed by the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases CYP87G1, CYP88C7, and CYP749B2, leading to the aglycone of the known compound withanoside V. Our work sets the basis for the biotechnological production of withanolides in heterologous hosts and will therefore help to fully harness the drug potential of these plant steroids in the future.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

Central to GCE is the development of orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA pairs wherein engineered aaRSs recognize chosen ncAAs and charge them onto tRNAs that decode blank codons (e.g., the amber stop codon). Many orthogonal aaRS/tRNA pairs covering a wide range of ncAAs have been generated by directed evolution, yet the evolution of new aaRS/tRNA pairs by standard strategies remains a labor-intensive process that often produces aaRS/tRNA pairs with suboptimal ncAA incorporation efficiencies. In this study, we present a strategy for evolving aaRSs that leverages OrthoRep to drive their continuous hypermutation in yeast. We demonstrate our strategy in 8 independent aaRS evolution campaigns starting from 4 different aaRS/tRNA parents targeting 7 distinct ncAAs. We observed the rapid evolution of multiple novel aaRSs capable of incorporating an overall range of 13 ncAAs tested into proteins in response to the amber codon. Some evolved systems reached efficiencies for amber codon-specified ncAA-dependent translation comparable to translation with natural amino acids specified by sense codons in yeast. Additionally, we discovered a surprising aaRS that evolved to self-regulate its own expression for greater dependency on ncAAs for translation. These findings demonstrate the potential of OrthoRep-driven aaRS evolution platforms in supporting the continued growth of GCE technologies.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

They vocally advertise and reinforce their pair-bonds by singing complex duets, in which both the male and female perform a predetermined sex-specific set of song phrases, including the loud and elongated great-calls. Only females and sub-adult male gibbons have been previously observed performing great-calls. Once a male gibbon matures, he normally stops great-call production completely but continues singing other and less high-pitched song phrases. This case study describes a fully adult, castrated male lar gibbon (Hylobates lar, 32 years old, zoo-housed) who performs both male phrases of the duet, including the female great-call. The male regularly produced great-calls despite being in a, relatively weak, pair bond with a female conspecific. His great-calls adhered to the general structure of typical female great-calls but were shorter and had a lower maximum frequency. Notably, he produced these great-calls predominantly when the female was absent, especially when she was in their inside enclosure whilst he was outside. Behavioural observations indicate that the occurrence of great-calls by the male cannot be predicted based on pre-song behaviour or his interaction with the female. The recurrence of sub-adult singing behaviour in a fully grown adult is most likely due to his reduced testosterone levels. This study sheds light on the intricate dynamics of duetting and the unique occurrence of cross-sex song production in gibbons, emphasizing the complexity of pair-bond communication in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

All four proteins are associated with increased tumor size in ILC, but not IDC/NST, with SLC3A2 also specifically linked to shorter overall survival and the presence of comorbidities in ILC. Notably, GLUD1/2 expression is associated with ER expression in ILC, and is most strongly associated with increased tumor size and stage in Black women with ILC from our cohort and TCGA. We further explore the effects of GLUD1 inhibition in endocrine therapy-resistant ILC cells using the small-molecule inhibitor R162, which reduces ER protein levels, increases reactive oxygen species, and inhibits oxidative phosphorylation.

How the resultant spatial heterogeneity shapes within-host genetic diversity and viral evolutionary pathways is poorly understood. Here we show that dispersal within and between the nasal cavity and trachea maintains diversity and is therefore conducive to adaptive evolution, whereas dispersal to the lungs is stochastic and gives rise to population heterogeneity. We infected ferrets either intranasally or by aerosol with a barcoded influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus. At 1, 2 or 4 days post infection, dispersal was assessed by collecting 52 samples from throughout the respiratory tract of each animal. Irrespective of inoculation route, barcode compositions across the nasal turbinates and trachea were similar and highly diverse, revealing little constraint on the establishment of infection in the nasal cavity and descent through the trachea. By comparison, infection of the lungs produced genetically distinct viral populations. Lung populations were pauci-clonal, suggesting that each seeded location received relatively few viral genotypes. While aerosol inoculation gave distinct populations at every lung site sampled, within-host dispersal after intranasal inoculation produced larger patches, indicative of local expansion following seeding of the lungs. Throughout the respiratory tract, barcode diversity declined over time, but new diversity was generated through mutation. De novo variants were often unique to a given location, indicating that localized replication following dispersal resulted in population divergence. In summary, dispersal within the respiratory tract operates differently between regions and contributes to the potential for viral evolution to proceed independently in multiple within-host subpopulations.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

An interesting result of such membrane-lipid interplay is the reorganization of lipid domains together with membrane-bound proteins at the onset of cell division, suggesting a functional significance of membrane compartments in the cell cycle. Here, by adopting the key bacterial division proteins MinCDE and FtsZ as an archetypal spatial patterning system, we present a simple vesicle-based in vitro model to explore the mutual dependence of protein pattern formation and membrane heterogeneity. Like many other peripheral membrane proteins, MinDE exhibit preferential binding and macro-scale pattern formation at Ld domains, which leads to altered oscillation mode selection in phase-separated membrane compartments (GUVs). Moreover, incorporating bacterial division proteins within phase-separated GUVs leads to blebbing-like membrane deformations followed by the reorganization of Lo domains aligning at the neck region of the bleb, which agrees well with the domain rearrangement in bacterial membranes immediately preceding the radial constriction process. Overall, the presented in vitro model system showcases a basic framework to better comprehend the cellular division mechanism in consideration of complex cellular lipid environments.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

Our findings challenge this conventional view. Using single-bouton optical measurements of dopamine release, we discovered that dopamine is predominantly released from varicosities that are juxtaposed against the processes of their target neurons. Dopamine axons specifically target neurons expressing dopamine receptors, forming synapses to release dopamine. Interestingly, varicosities that were not directly apposed to dopamine receptor-expressing processes or associated with neurons lacking dopamine receptors did not release dopamine, regardless of their vesicle content. The ultrastructure of dopamine release sites share common features of classical synapses. We further show that the dopamine released at these contact sites induces a precise, dopamine-gated biochemical response in the target processes. Our results indicate that dopamine release sites share key characteristics of conventional synapses that enable relatively precise and efficient neuromodulation of their targets.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

Our method uses multiple objectives to reproduce various aspects of neuronal activity patterns as well as biology-based inductive biases like structured connectivity and separation of neurons into dominant excitatory and inhibitory cell types. We show that theses biological inductive biases are crucial to predict responses to optogenetic perturbations. Furthermore, once a model is fitted to experimental data, gradient evaluations in the extracted model network can, in principle, be used to design a minimal low-power optogenetic stimulus that causes a maximal effect by stimulating a limited subset of neurons.

In wheat, the NLR PM3b recognizes the wheat powdery mildew effector AVRPM3b2/c2 and we examined the molecular mechanism underlying this recognition.

Additionally, we found that PM3b interacts in planta with AVRPM3b2/c2 through its LRR domain. We further demonstrate that full length PM3b interaction with AVRPM3b2/c2 is considerably weaker than for the isolated PM3b LRR domain or the susceptible PM3 variant PM3CS, indicating that activation of PM3b leads to dissociation of the complex. In line with this: We observed a strong interaction between PM3b and AVRPM3b2/c2 in a P-loop mutant of PM3b which was unable to initiate a cell death response, or when an inactive variant of AVRPM3b2/c2 was used. We propose that PM3b transiently interacts with AVRPM3b2/c2 through residues in the LRR which are conserved among PM3 variants while the amino acids necessary for full activation and cell death signaling are unique to PM3b. Our data suggests that PM3b localization and interaction with AVRPM3b2/c2 differs from other well studied NLRs and further highlights the mechanistic diversity in NLR-mediated responses against pathogens in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

Despite their growing application, a significant challenge remains in ensuring the reproducibility of GEMs, primarily due to inconsistent reporting and inadequate model documentation of model results. Addressing this gap, we introduce FROG analysis, a community driven initiative aimed at standardizing reproducibility assessments of CBMs and GEMs. The FROG framework encompasses four key analyses including Flux variability, Reaction deletion, Objective function, and Gene deletion to produce standardized, numerically reproducible FROG reports. These reports serve as reference datasets, enabling model evaluators, curators, and independent researchers to verify the reproducibility of GEMs systematically. BioModels, a leading repository of systems biology models, has integrated FROG analysis into its curation workflow, enhancing the reproducibility and reusability of submitted GEMs. In our study evaluating 65 GEM submissions from the community, approximately 40% reproduced without intervention, 28% requiring minor adjustments, and 32% needing input from authors. The standardization introduced by FROG analysis facilitated the detection and resolution of issues, ultimately leading to the successful reproduction of all models. By establishing a standardized and comprehensive approach to evaluating GEM reproducibility, FROG analysis significantly contributes to making CBMs and GEMs more transparent, reusable, and reliable for the broader scientific community.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

Each sleep stage, such as NREM and REM, has distinct rhythms, making it even harder for models trained on awake tasks to generalise and decode memory replay during sleep. To overcome this, we developed the Sleep Interpreter (SI), an artificial neural network. We first collected a large EEG dataset from 135 participants, recording brain activity during both awake tasks and overnight sleep. Using a Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) technique with 15 pairs of auditory cues and visual images, we tracked when specific memories were reactivated during sleep. The SI model was then trained separately for NREM and REM stages, using contrastive learning to align neural patterns between wakefulness and sleep while filtering out the background rhythms that previously hindered decoding. We also examined how specific sleep rhythms, such as slow oscillations and their coupling with spindles, influenced decoding performance. In a 15-way classification task during sleep, our model achieved a Top-1 accuracy of up to 40.05% on unseen subjects, surpassing all other available decoding models. Finally, we developed a real-time sleep decoding system by integrating an online automatic sleep staging process with the SI model for each sleep stage. This ability to decode brain activity during sleep opens new avenues for exploring the functional roles of sleep. By making our dataset and decoding system publicly available, we provide a valuable resource for advancing research into sleep, memory, and related disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

To address this, we integrated high-plex imaging and spatial transcriptomics to analyze human tissue samples at different stages of HGSOC development, including p53 signatures, serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STIC), and invasive HGSOC. Our findings reveal immune modulating mechanisms within precursor epithelium, characterized by chromosomal instability, persistent interferon (IFN) signaling, and dysregulated innate and adaptive immunity. FT precursors display elevated expression of MHC-class I, including HLA-E, and IFN-stimulated genes, typically linked to later-stage tumorigenesis. These molecular alterations coincide with progressive shifts in the tumor microenvironment, transitioning from immune surveillance in early STICs to immune suppression in advanced STICs and cancer. These insights identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HGSOC interception and clarify the molecular transitions from precancer to cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

In breast cancer, disrupted regulation of TE sequences may facilitate tumor-specific transcriptomic alterations. We examine 142,514 full-length isoforms derived from long-read RNA sequencing (LR-seq) of 30 breast samples to investigate the effects of TEs on the breast cancer transcriptome. Approximately half of these isoforms contain TE sequences, and these contribute to half of the novel annotated splice junctions. We quantify splicing of these LR-seq derived isoforms in 1,135 breast tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 1,329 healthy tissue samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and find 300 TE-overlapping tumor-specific splicing events. Some splicing events are enriched in specific breast cancer subtypes - for example, a TE-driven transcription start site upstream of ERBB2 in HER2+ tumors, and several TE-mediated splicing events are associated with patient survival and poor prognosis. The full-length sequences we capture with LR-seq reveal thousands of isoforms with signatures of RNA editing, including a novel isoform belonging to RHOA; a gene previously implicated in tumor progression. We utilize our full-length isoforms to discover polymorphic TE insertions that alter splicing and validate one of these events in breast cancer cell lines. Together, our results demonstrate the widespread effects of dysregulated TEs on breast cancer transcriptomes and highlight the advantages of long-read isoform sequencing for understanding TE biology. TE-derived isoforms may alter the expression of genes important in cancer and can potentially be used as novel, disease-specific therapeutic targets or biomarkers.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

We analyzed gene expression for changes in gene families that correlated with the periods of NEC susceptibility or resistance. We highlight that increased expression of DNA processing genes and vacuolar structure genes, tissue development and morphogenesis genes, and cell migration genes all correlated with NEC susceptibility, while increases in immunity gene sets, intracellular transport genes, ATP production, and intracellular metabolism genes correlated with NEC resistance.

Alterations in the function of cortical inhibitory GABAergic interneurons, along with dysregulations of epigenetic signatures and key regulators such as DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), have been implicated in these conditions. Through its role in catalyzing DNA methylation, DNMT1 modulates the synaptic activity of parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons, which are essential for cortical inhibition. However, the functional consequences of DNMT1 activity in cortical interneurons at the network level and its impact on behavior remain unknown and must be explored to fully understand the disease implications of dysregulated DNMT1 expression and function. To address this, we utilized a conditional knockout mouse model with Dnmt1 deletion in PV interneurons. Our findings reveal that a Dnmt1 deficiency leads to increased spontaneous firing rates of cortical neurons, reduced cortical gamma oscillations, and altered visually evoked neural responses. Despite intact sensory perception, Dnmt1-deficient mice exhibited reduced physical activity, heightened anxiety-like behavior, and signs of anhedonia and apathy, which represent core features of MDD. These results underscore the critical role of DNMT1 in PV interneuron function and identify it as a potential target for MDD research.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

Symptoms usually manifest in the first year of life and include prolonged severe seizures, developmental delay and severe intellectual disability. DS patients have an increased mortality rate, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Approximately 90% of patients carry a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the SCN1A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium ion channel, NaV1.1. The NaV1.1 channel is expressed in the brain and at a lower level, in the heart. Previous studies have identified a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) which specifically downregulates SCN1A gene expression. This natural antisense transcript (NAT) can be modulated by AntagoNATs, small synthetic oligonucleotides developed to inhibit NAT function. In a DS mouse model, AntagoNATs were shown to modulate Scn1a expression by targeting the Scn1a NAT, improving seizure frequency after repeated administration. Here, we have developed novel AntagoNATs and incorporated these into a clinically relevant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) gene therapy vector, to test in a DS mouse model (Scn1a+/-) and provide a one-off treatment approach. Eighteen AntagoNATs were tested in vitro; from the best performing candidates, we selected two AntagoNAT sequences (K & H) for in vivo testing as they had the highest homology (90%) to human SCN1A NAT. We administered both vectors to newborn Scn1a+/- mice via intracerebroventricular (ICV) and intravenous (IV) injection to target the brain and heart. AAV9-AntagoNAT-H significantly increased survival, decreased febrile seizures and reduced spontaneous seizure frequency compared to the PBS control group. When administered at P14 by ICV and IV injection, AAV9-AntagoNAT-H increased survival. In this proof-of-concept study, we have demonstrated for the first time the delivery of AntagoNAT technology via an AAV9 vector and thus offering the possibility of a one-time treatment for DS patients.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169080

Such reactivation can be triggered by targeted memory reactivation (TMR), a technique in which a tone previously associated with a memory during wake is re-presented during subsequent sleep. Prior work has shown that TMR in REM reduces arousal responses to negative stimuli. The present study builds on this by measuring autonomic responses and brain activity as well as behaviour. Participants rated the arousal of 48 affective images, paired with semantically matching sounds. Half of these sounds were cued during REM in the subsequent overnight sleep cycle. Participants rated the images in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner with pulse oximetry 48 hours after encoding, and again after two weeks. Results showed that TMR during REM was also associated with reduced brain activity in the two primary nodes of the Salience Network (SN): the Anterior Insula and dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC), as well as the orbitofrontal cortex, subgenual cingulate, and left amygdala, all of which are known to be important for emotional processing. TMR markedly reduced the emotional heart rate deceleration (HRD) response, and also reduced subjective arousal ratings for highly arousing images, while increasing ratings for less arousing images. We conclude that REM TMR can facilitate a decrease in physiological and neurological responses to arousal. These findings have potential implications for the use of TMR in treatment of depression and anxiety disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

Genetic effects on gene expression have been extensively characterized by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies, yet data from non-European populations is limited. This restricts our understanding of disease to genes whose regulatory variants are common in European populations. While previous work has leveraged data from multiple populations to improve GWAS power and polygenic risk score (PRS) accuracy, multi-ancestry data has not yet been used to better estimate cis-genetic effects on gene expression. Here, we present a new method, Multi-Ancestry Gene Expression Prediction Regularized Optimization (MAGEPRO), which constructs robust genetic models of gene expression in understudied populations or cell types by fitting a regularized linear combination of eQTL summary data across diverse cohorts. In simulations, our tool generates more accurate models of gene expression than widely-used LASSO and the state-of-the-art multi-ancestry PRS method, PRS-CSx, adapted to gene expression prediction. We attribute this improvement to MAGEPROs ability to more accurately estimate causal eQTL effect sizes (p < 3.98 x 10-4, two-sided paired t-test). With real data, we applied MAGEPRO to 8 eQTL cohorts representing 3 ancestries (average n = 355) and consistently outperformed each of 6 competing methods in gene expression prediction tasks. Integration with GWAS summary statistics across 66 complex traits (representing 22 phenotypes and 3 ancestries) resulted in 2,331 new gene-trait associations, many of which replicate across multiple ancestries, including PHTF1 linked to white blood cell count, a gene which is overexpressed in leukemia patients. MAGEPRO also identified biologically plausible novel findings, such as PIGB, an essential component of GPI biosynthesis, associated with heart failure, which has been previously evidenced by clinical outcome data. Overall, MAGEPRO is a powerful tool to enhance inference of gene regulatory effects in underpowered datasets and has improved our understanding of population-specific and shared genetic effects on complex traits.","NA","medrxiv",1727734169081

Within the immune system, key features of physiological hematopoietic cell aging include increased fat deposition in the bone marrow, impaired hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) function, and a propensity towards myeloid differentiation. This shift in lineage bias can lead to pre-malignant bone marrow conditions such as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) or clonal cytopenias of undetermined significance (CCUS), frequently setting the stage for subsequent development of age-related cancers in myeloid or lymphoid lineages. At the systemic as well as sub-cellular level, human aging has also been associated with diverse lipid alterations, such as decreased phospholipid membrane fluidity that arises as a result of increased saturated fatty acid (FA) accumulation and a decay in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) species by the age of 80 years, however the extent to which impaired FA metabolism contributes to hematopoietic aging is less clear. Here, we performed comprehensive multi-omics analyses and uncovered a role for a key PUFA biosynthesis gene, ELOVL2, in mouse and human immune cell aging. Whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing studies of bone marrow from aged Elovl2 mutant (enzyme-deficient) mice compared with age-matched controls revealed global down-regulation in lymphoid cell markers and expression of genes involved specifically in B cell development. Flow cytometric analyses of immune cell markers confirmed an aging-associated loss of B cell markers that was exacerbated in the bone marrow of Elovl2 mutant mice and unveiled CD79B, a vital molecular regulator of lymphoid progenitor development from the pro-B to pre-B cell stage, as a putative surface biomarker of accelerated immune aging. Complementary lipidomic studies extended these findings to reveal select alterations in lipid species in aged and Elovl2 mutant mouse bone marrow samples, suggesting significant changes in the biophysical properties of cellular membranes. Furthermore, single cell RNA-seq analysis of human HSPCs across the spectrum of human development and aging uncovered a rare subpopulation (<7%) of CD34+ HSPCs that expresses ELOVL2 in healthy adult bone marrow. This HSPC subset, along with CD79B-expressing lymphoid-committed cells, were almost completely absent in CD34+ cells isolated from elderly (>60 years old) bone marrow samples. Together, these findings uncover new roles for lipid metabolism enzymes in the molecular regulation of cellular aging and immune cell function in mouse and human hematopoiesis. In addition, because systemic loss of ELOVL2 enzymatic activity resulted in down-regulation of B cell genes that are also associated with lymphoproliferative neoplasms, this study sheds light on an intriguing metabolic pathway that could be leveraged in future studies as a novel therapeutic modality to target blood cancers or other age-related conditions involving the B cell lineage.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

Based on re-analysis of three pre-existing perceptual choice datasets, the authors claim that application of a deconvolution method designed to account for the overlap of stimulus- and response-aligned components, eliminates key signatures of evidence accumulation from the CPP measured in response-aligned average waveforms. From this the authors conclude that these apparent signatures were an artifact of component overlap and that the CPP may not trace evidence accumulation. Here, we argue that the analysis and interpretation of these perceptual choice data are critically flawed. First, we demonstrate with simple simulations that the deconvolution method used by the authors is categorically not designed to correctly capture evidence accumulation signals and, consequently, cannot reliably determine their presence or absence. Second, even within the parameters of their approach, we highlight that the results presented do not in fact support their claim that deconvolution eliminates evidence accumulation signatures from the CPP. Lastly, we list numerous signatures of evidence accumulation identified in the CPP in previous research, other than the response-aligned average waveform criteria on which the present work narrowly focused.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

Here, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is thought to play an important role. BDNF, a member of the neurotrophin family, is implicated in processes such as synaptogenesis and long-term potentiation. Post-stroke, reduced BDNF levels are observed compared to the healthy population. An intervention that has been shown to elevate BDNF is Aerobic exercise. Yet, the impact of aerobic exercise in stroke patients remains unclear. This sub-analysis of the multicenter, randomized, controlled Physical Fitness Training in Patients with Subacute Stroke trial aimed to investigate serum BDNF dynamics and the effects of a four-week aerobic exercise intervention on long- term BDNF levels.

Data from 200 patients, with missing data imputed, revealed a modest increase in serum BDNF levels up to three months post-stroke (22.6 ng/ml, 95% CI 19.2 to 26) which plateaued until six months (24.3 ng/ml, 95% CI 20.6 to 27.9). Despite higher baseline BDNF levels in the exercise group, no treatment effect was observed until six months (training 24.6 ng/ml, 95% CI 20.2 to 29 vs relaxation: 24.3 ng/ml, 95% CI 19.8 to 28.8, p = 0.95). A sex-related interaction was identified in the relaxation group, with female patients exhibiting higher BDNF increases until end of follow up (20.9 ng/ml, 95% CI 15.7 to 26.2 (males) vs 31.0 ng/ml, 95% CI 22.9 to 39.0 (females), p = 0.039). Dose-response analyses and associations with recurrent events yielded no substantial differences.

While serum BDNF levels increased early after stroke in the first three months, aerobic exercise did not demonstrate a significant impact on BDNF levels within this dataset. Further investigations with more measurements during the early subacute phase are warranted to elucidate the interplay between exercise, BDNF, and recovery.","NA","medrxiv",1727734169081

Accordingly, the production and use of malonyl-CoA is finely tuned by the cellular energy status. Most studies of malonyl-CoA dynamics rely on bulk approaches that take only a snapshot of the average metabolic state of a population of cells, missing out on dynamic changes in malonyl-CoA and fatty acid biosynthesis that could be occurring within a single cell. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a genetically encoded fluorescent protein-based biosensor for malonyl-CoA that can be used to capture malonyl-CoA dynamics in single cells. This biosensor, termed Malibu (malonyl-CoA intracellular biosensor to understand dynamics), exhibits an excitation-ratiometric change in response to malonyl-CoA binding. We first used Malibu to monitor malonyl-CoA dynamics during inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis using cerulenin in E. coli, observing an increase in Malibu response in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In HeLa cells, we used Malibu to monitor the impact of fatty acid biosynthesis inhibition on malonyl-CoA dynamics in single cells, finding that two inhibitors of fatty acid biosynthesis, cerulenin and orlistat, which inhibit different steps of fatty acid biosynthesis, increase malonyl-CoA levels. Altogether, we have developed a new genetically encoded biosensor for malonyl-CoA, which can be used to sensitively study malonyl-CoA dynamics in single cells, providing an unparalleled view into fatty acid biosynthesis.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

In the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, HU is the only identified NAP, and its role in chromosome conformation and other essential processes has not yet been investigated. Here, we use a multi-scale approach to explore the role of HU in chromosome conformation and segregation dynamics. By combining superresolution microscopy and whole-genome binding analysis, we describe the nucleoid as a dynamic structure where HU binds transiently across the entire nucleoid, with a preference for the origin of replication over the terminus. Reducing cellular HU levels impacts nucleoid maintenance and disrupts robust nucleoid scaling with cell size. This effect is similar to the distortion caused by fluoroquinolone-antibiotics, supporting earlier observations that HU is essential for maintaining DNA supercoiling. Furthermore, in cells lacking HU, the replication machinery is misplaced, and cells are unable to initiate and proceed with on-going replication. Chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments revealed that HU is required to maintain cohesion between the two chromosomal arms, in a similar way to the structural maintenance of the chromosome complex SMC. Together, we show that by promoting long-range chromosome interactions and supporting the architecture of the domain encompassing the origin, HU is fundamental for chromosome integrity and the intimately related processes of chromosome replication and segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

As such, the endolysosomal system plays a critical role in determining the abundance of proteins on the cell surface, influencing cellular identity and function. Highly polarized cells, like neurons, rely on the endolysosomal system for axonal and dendritic specialization and synaptic compartmentalization. The importance of this system to neuronal function is reflected by the prevalence of risk variants in components of the system in several neurodegenerative diseases, ranging from Parkinsons to Alzheimers disease. Nevertheless, our understanding of endocytic cargo and core endolysosomal machinery in neurons is limited, in part due to technical limitations. Here, we developed a toolkit for capturing EEA1-postive endosomes (Endo-IP) and TMEM192-positive lysosomes (Lyso-IP) in stem cell-derived induced neurons (iNeurons). We demonstrated its utility by revealing the endolysosomal protein landscapes for cortical-like iNeurons and stem cells. This allowed us to globally profile endocytic cargo, identifying hundreds of transmembrane proteins, including neurogenesis and synaptic proteins, as well as endocytic cargo with predicted SNX17 or SNX27 recognition motifs. By contrast, parallel lysosome profiling reveals a simpler protein repertoire, reflecting in part temporally controlled recycling or degradation for many endocytic targets. This system will facilitate mechanistic interrogation of endolysosomal components found as risk factors in neurodegenerative disease.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

We find that extracellular acidification occurs in flies during aging and correlates to mortality rate. With age, flies also become more susceptible to die from acidotic stress, which can be prevented by alkalotic treatment. Acidification is caused by insufficient acid elimination, linked to downregulation of genes in the fly excretory tract that control pH and ATP production, essential for active secretion initiation. In mice, we show that lymph-drained interstitial fluids acidify with age. Expression of genes, whose pathogenic loss-of-function variants cause tubular acidosis in humans, is decreased in the kidneys of aging mice.

Duplicated genes expanded uniquely in the human lineage likely contributed to brain evolution, including the increased complexity of synaptic connections between neurons and the dramatic expansion of the neocortex. Discovering duplicate genes is challenging because the similarity of paralogs makes them prone to sequence-assembly errors. To mitigate this issue, we analyzed a complete telomere-to-telomere human genome sequence (T2T-CHM13) and identified 213 duplicated gene families likely containing human-specific paralogs (>98% identity). Positing that genes important in universal human brain features should exist with at least one copy in all modern humans and exhibit expression in the brain, we narrowed in on 362 paralogs with at least one copy across thousands of ancestrally diverse genomes and present in human brain transcriptomes. Of these, 38 paralogs co-express in gene modules enriched for autism-associated genes and potentially contribute to human language and cognition. We narrowed in on 13 duplicate gene families with human-specific paralogs that are fixed among modern humans and show convincing brain expression patterns. Using long-read DNA sequencing revealed hidden variation across 200 modern humans of diverse ancestries, uncovering signatures of selection not previously identified, including possible balancing selection of CD8B. To understand the roles of duplicated genes in brain development, we generated zebrafish CRISPR ""knockout"" models of nine orthologs and transiently introduced mRNA-encoding paralogs, effectively ""humanizing"" the larvae. Morphometric, behavioral, and single-cell RNA-seq screening highlighted, for the first time, a possible role for GPR89B in dosage-mediated brain expansion and FRMPD2B function in altered synaptic signaling, both hallmark features of the human brain.

The functionality of these anchors is influenced by the residence time of CTCF on chromatin, which is determined by its binding affinity and its interactions with nucleosomes and other chromatin-associated factors. In this study, we demonstrate that CTCF occupancy is driven by CTCF motifs strategically positioned at the entry sites of a well-positioned nucleosome, such that, upon binding, the N-terminus of CTCF is oriented towards the nucleosome. We refer to this nucleosome as the CTCF priming nucleosome (CpN). CTCF recognizes its binding sites if they are not methylated. It can then displace the CpN, provided the nucleosome is not marked by CpG methylation or repressive histone modifications. Under these permissive conditions, the N-terminus of CTCF recruits SMARCA5 to reposition the CpN downstream, thereby creating nucleosome-free regions that enhance CTCF occupancy and cohesin stalling. In contrast, when CpNs carry repressive epigenetic marks, CTCF binding is transient, without nucleosome displacement or chromatin opening. In such cases, cohesin is not effectively retained at CTCF binding sites. We propose that the epigenetic status of CpNs governs cell-specific CTCF binding patterns, ensuring the maintenance of chromatin architecture throughout the cell cycle.

Here, we investigated how the low-dimensional organization of intrinsic functional connectivity patterns based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging relates to brain energy expenditure measured by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. By incrementally adding more dimensions of brain organization (via functional gradients), we were able to show that increasing amounts of variance in the map of brain energy expenditure could be accounted for. In particular, the brain organization dimensions that explained a large amount of the variance in intrinsic brain function also explained a large amount of the regional variance in the energy expenditure maps. This was particularly true for brain organization maps based on the strongest connections, suggesting that ""weak"" connections may not explain as much energy variance. Notably, our topological model was more effective than random brain organization configurations, suggesting that brain organization may be specifically associated with energy optimization. Finally, using brain asymmetry as a model for metabolic efficiency, we found that optimizing energy expenditure independently in each hemisphere outperformed non-independent optimization. This supports the concept of hemispheric competition rather than lateralization in energy allocation. Our results demonstrate how the spatial organization of functional connections is systematically linked to optimized energy expenditure in the human brain, providing new insights into the metabolic basis of brain function.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

However, the ever-growing volume and diversity of scientific literature make it increasingly challenging to stay current with the latest advances in gene function studies. Here, we tackle the challenge by deploying the text-mining capacities of large language models to process over 71,000 plant biology abstracts. Our approach unveiled nearly 5 million functional relationships between a wide array of biological entities--genes, metabolites, tissues, and others--with a high accuracy of over 85%. We encapsulated these findings in PlantConnectome, a user-friendly database, and demonstrated its diverse utility by providing insights into gene regulatory networks, protein-protein interactions, and stress responses. We believe this innovative use of AI in the life sciences will allow plant scientists to keep up to date with the rapidly growing corpus of scientific literature.

We have designed and constructed a microfluidic device in which each nanowell contained a single, infected cell (donor) and a single, uninfected cell (recipient). Using a GFP-expressing poliovirus as our model, we observed both lytic and non-lytic spread. Donor cells supporting lytic spread established infection earlier than those supporting non-lytic spread. However, non-lytic spread established infections in recipient cells substantially faster than lytic spread and yielded higher rates of genome replication. While lytic spread was sensitive to the presence of capsid entry/uncoating inhibitors, non-lytic spread was not. Consistent with emerging models for non-lytic spread of enteroviruses using autophagy, reduction of LC3 levels in cells impaired non-lytic spread and elevated the fraction of virus in donor cells spreading lytically. The ability to distinguish lytic and non-lytic spread unambiguously will enable discovery of viral and host factors and host pathways used for non-lytic spread of enteroviruses and other viruses as well.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

Many biological and psychological studies have shown that human sweat does indeed contain chemical information related to gender, sex, emotion, etc., but there is no convincing answer to its chemical components. We conducted a GC-MS analysis of the chemical composition of adult and child sweat of Han Chinese, and found that the main components were squalene and fatty acids, and there were sex differences in adults, but not in children. Based on our long-term research on the coding rules of pheromones in a variety of animals, especially rodents, as well as men having more sweat glands and sebaceous glands, we speculate that squalene and many common fatty acids are likely to encode olfactory information such as sex and emotion in one component or a mix of components or in a dose-dependent manner. We also discussed that the main olfactory system and olfactory learning in social interactions should play an important role in human pheromone perception.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

Their significance is highlighted by peroxisome biogenesis disorders; severe childhood diseases marked by disrupted lipid metabolism. One mechanism regulating peroxisome abundance is through selective ubiquitylation of peroxisomal membrane proteins that triggers peroxisome degradation via selective autophagy (pexophagy). However, the mechanisms regulating pexophagy remain poorly understood in mammalian cells. Here we show that the evolutionarily conserved AAA-ATPase p97 and its membrane embedded adaptor UBXD8 are essential for maintaining peroxisome abundance. From quantitative proteomic studies we reveal that loss of UBXD8 affects many peroxisomal proteins. We find depletion of UBXD8 results in a loss of peroxisomes in a manner that is independent of the known role of UBXD8 in ER associated degradation (ERAD). Loss of UBXD8 or inhibition of p97 increases peroxisomal turnover through autophagy and can be rescued by depleting key autophagy proteins or overexpressing the deubiquitylating enzyme USP30. Furthermore, we find increased ubiquitylation of the peroxisomal membrane protein PMP70 in cells lacking UBXD8 or p97. Collectively, our findings identify a new role for the p97-UBXD8 complex in regulating peroxisome abundance by suppressing pexophagy.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

Honeybees, with their specialized gut microbiota and well-known ecology, offer an ideal system to study this evolution. Using shotgun metagenomics on 200 honeybee workers from five species, we recovered thousands of metagenome-assembled genomes, identifying several novel bacterial species. While microbial communities were mostly host-specific, we found both specialist and generalist bacteria, even among closely related species, with notable variation between host species. Some generalists emerged host-specific only at the strain level, suggesting recent host switches. Unexpectedly, we found no evidence of codiversification between hosts and symbionts. Instead, symbiont gains, losses, and replacements led to functional differences, such as the ability to degrade pollen-derived pectin. Our results provide new insights into gut microbiota evolution and uncover the functional potential of the previously underexplored gut microbiota of these important pollinators.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

Previous evaluations have shown that pre-trained gLMs can be leveraged to improve predictive performance across a broad range of regulatory genomics tasks, albeit using relatively simple benchmark datasets and baseline models. Since the gLMs in these studies were tested upon fine-tuning their weights for each downstream task, determining whether gLM representations embody a foundational understanding of cis-regulatory biology remains an open question. Here we evaluate the representational power of pre-trained gLMs to predict and interpret cell-type-specific functional genomics data that span DNA and RNA regulation. Our findings suggest that probing the representations of pre-trained gLMs do not offer substantial advantages over conventional machine learning approaches that use one-hot encoded sequences. This work highlights a major gap with current gLMs, raising potential issues in conventional pre-training strategies for the non-coding genome.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

ME/CFS diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME/CFS patients low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME/CFS cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME/CFS status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME/CFS cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME/CFS status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME/CFS status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME/CFS diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1727734169081

Recent reports have drawn conflicting conclusions about whether these histone modifications depend on transcription. We used triptolide to inhibit transcription initiation and degrade RNA Polymerase II and interrogated the effect on histone modifications. Transcription initiation was dispensable for de novo and steady-state histone acetylation at transcription start sites (TSSs) and enhancers. However, at steady state, blocking transcription initiation increased the levels of histone acetylation and H2AZ incorporation at active TSSs. These results demonstrate that deposition of specific histone modifications at TSSs is not dependent on transcription and that transcription limits the maintenance of these marks.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

Here, we describe expansion in situ genome sequencing (ExIGS), a technology that enables sequencing of genomic DNA and superresolution localization of nuclear proteins in single cells. We applied ExIGS to fibroblast cells derived from an individual with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome to characterize how variation in nuclear morphology affects spatial chromatin organization. Using this data, we discovered that lamin abnormalities are linked to hotspots of aberrant euchromatin repression that may erode cell identity. Further, we show that lamin abnormalities heterogeneously increase the repressive environment of the nucleus in tissues and aged cells. These results demonstrate that ExIGS may serve as a generalizable platform for connecting nuclear abnormalities to changes in gene regulation across disease contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

However, most existing analyses rely on bulk data or cultured cell lines, which may fail to identify cell-type-specific enhancers and target genes. Recently, single-cell multimodal data measuring both gene expression and chromatin accessibility within the same cells have enabled the inference of enhancer-gene pairs in a cell-type-specific and context-specific manner. However, this task is challenged by the data's high sparsity, sequencing depth variation, and the computational burden of analyzing a large number of enhancer-gene pairs. To address these challenges, we propose scMultiMap, a statistical method that infers enhancer-gene association from sparse multimodal counts using a joint latent-variable model. It adjusts for technical confounding, permits fast moment-based estimation and provides analytically derived p-values. In systematic analyses of blood and brain data, scMultiMap shows appropriate type I error control, high statistical power with greater reproducibility across independent datasets and stronger consistency with orthogonal data modalities. Meanwhile, its computational cost is less than 1% of existing methods. When applied to single-cell multimodal data from postmortem brain samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and controls, scMultiMap gave the highest heritability enrichment in microglia and revealed new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of AD GWAS variants in microglia.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects.

Moreover, microtubule-accumulated structures like swarming microtubule assemblies are attractive components for dynamic materials, such as active matter and molecular robots. Thus, dynamic control of microtubule superstructures is an important topic. However, implementing stimulus-dependent control of superstructures remains challenging. This challenge can be resolved by developing designer protein approaches. We have previously developed a Tau-derived peptide (TP), which binds to the inner or outer surface of microtubules depending on the timing of the incubation. In this report, we designed the TP-fused photo-switchable protein Dronpa (TP-Dronpa) that reversibly photoconverts between monomeric and tetrameric states to photocontrol microtubule assemblies. The formation of microtubule superstructures, including bundles and doublets, was induced by tetrameric TP-Dronpa, whereas monomeric TP-Dronpa ensured that microtubules remained dispersed. Tetrameric TP-Dronpa also induced motile aster-like structures and swarming movement of microtubules on a kinesin-coated substrate. The formation/dissociation of these microtubule superstructures can be controlled by light irradiation. This system can generate and photocontrol various microtubule superstructures and provides an approach to facilitate the assembly of dynamic materials for various applications.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar.

MethodsTwo matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024.

ResultsThe adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.07) in the three-dose analysis. In the first six months of follow-up in the two-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.27-0.46); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.19-1.94). In the first six months of follow-up in the three-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.20-0.50); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02-1.85). The overall effectiveness of the primary series and third-dose vaccinations against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 95.9% (95% CI: 94.0-97.1) and 34.1% (95% CI: -46.4-76.7), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

ConclusionA strong healthy vaccinee effect was observed in the first six months following vaccination. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations.","NA","medrxiv",1727734169081

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

However, these dances have attracted little scientific attention and their structure and meaning remain largely obscure. Here we analyse close-range video recordings of captive crested gibbons, extracting descriptions of dance in four Nomascus species (N. annamensis, N. gabriellae, N. leucogenys, and N. siki). Additionally, we report results from a survey amongst relevant professionals clarifying behavioural contexts of dance in captive and wild crested gibbons. Our results demonstrate that dances in Nomascus represent a common and intentional form of visual communication restricted to sexually mature females. While primarily used as a proceptive signal to solicit copulation, dances occur in a wide range of contexts related to arousal and/or frustration in captivity. A linguistically informed view of this sequential behaviour demonstrates that dances follow a grouping organisation and isochronous rhythm - patterns not described for visual displays in other non-human primates. We argue that applying the concept of dance to gibbons allows us to expand our understanding of the communicative behaviours of non-human apes and develop hypotheses on the rules and regularities characterizing this behaviour. We propose that gibbons dances likely evolved from less elaborate rhythmic proceptive signals, similar to those found in siamangs. Although dance displays in humans and crested gibbons share a number of key characteristics, they cannot be assumed to be homologous. Nevertheless, gibbon dances represent a model behaviour whose investigation could be extended to the study of complex gestural signals in hominoid primates.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

In cell culture this can occur by the induction of intercellular membrane connections known as tunnelling nanotube-like structures (TLSs), which are capable of trafficking the viral genome between cells. Here, we showed that TLSs are present at the site of IAV infections in vivo, and then used in vitro models to ask how IAVs induce their formation. We found that TLS induction cannot be induced by cytokine signalling from infected to uninfected cells, but requires IAV replication within cells. IAV replication can form filamentous virions with structural similarities to TLSs, but we found that TLS induction is independent of virion morphology. We therefore looked at the intracellular responses to infection. Using a pan-caspase inhibitor, we found that TLS induction by IAVs requires the onset of apoptosis. Our results, which suggest that IAVs control their ability to spread directly from cell to cell by driving infected cells into apoptosis, identifies a new way in which a virus can manipulate its host to evade antiviral immune responses.

Author SummaryInfluenza A viruses (IAVs) spread efficiently through the respiratory tract in the form of extracellular virus particles, but can be restricted by neutralising antibodies and antiviral drugs. IAVs can avoid this restriction by transporting viral genomes directly from one cell to the next. They can do this by inducing the formation of long, thin intercellular connections known as tunnelling nanotube-like structures, which are capable of trafficking viral genomes. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that tunnelling-nanotube like structures form within IAV infected lungs. We then asked how IAVs induce these structures. We found that cell death pathways triggered by IAV replication induce the formation of tunnelling nanotube-like structures, thereby establishing routes of infection spread to other cells. In this way, the virus exploits the cell death response of its host to ensure that its infection can continue to spread even within the restrictive environment of the respiratory tract.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

Compared to other helper NLRs, NRG1 and closely related RPW8-like NLRs (CCR-NLRs) possess extended N-termini with distinctive sequence signatures, enabling their assembly into longer structures than canonical coiled coil NLR (CC-NLR) resistosomes. Activated NRG1 associates with single- and double-membrane organelles via its N-terminal RPW8-like domain.

Skin contains diverse immune cell types and is critically dependent on calcium signaling for homeostasis and repair, yet the dynamics and functions of calcium in skin immune cells remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize calcium activity in Langerhans cells, skin-resident macrophages responsible for surveillance and clearance of cellular debris after tissue damage. Langerhans cells reside in the epidermis and extend dynamic dendrites in close proximity to adjacent keratinocytes and somatosensory peripheral axons. We find that homeostatic Langerhans cells exhibit spontaneous and transient changes in calcium activity, with calcium flux occurring primarily in the cell body and rarely in the dendrites. Triggering somatosensory axon degeneration increases the frequency of calcium activity in Langerhans cell dendrites. By contrast, we show that Langerhans cells exhibit a sustained increase in intracellular calcium following engulfment of damaged keratinocytes. Altering intracellular calcium activity leads to a decrease in engulfment efficiency of keratinocyte debris. Our findings demonstrate that Langerhans cells exhibit context-specific changes in calcium activity and highlight the utility of skin as an accessible model for imaging calcium dynamics in tissue-resident macrophages.

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

Explosive growth of targeted protein degradation (TPD) drug development has spurred renewed interest in proximity-inducing molecules and especially Molecular Glue Degraders (MGDs). These compounds catalyze destruction of disease-causing proteins by reshaping protein surfaces and promoting cooperative binding between ubiquitylating enzymes and target proteins. MGD discovery for pre-defined targets is a major challenge in contemporary drug discovery. The field is limited by a lack of approaches that can exploit charged ligand-binding pockets, thus excluding a major fraction of ubiquitin ligases (E3s) that evolved to recognize exceedingly common acidic and basic degrons. Here we solve these important chemical challenges through ""chemocentric"" MGD discovery of ZZ1, a BET-family protein degrader and a prodrug of a negatively charged glue (c-Glue). ZZ1 activation unmasks a sulfinic acid moiety that binds the modular GID/CTLH ubiquitin ligase complex via a basic pocket in its YPEL5 subunit. YPEL5 is a CRBN structural homolog and an essential non-Cullin ubiquitin ligase cofactor expressed in cancers of the bone marrow. These findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized capacity of YPEL5 to recruit GID/CTLH substrates, and they provide a powerful strategy to discover c-Glues that induce proximity to ubiquitin ligases with similarly desirable properties.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

Downstream effectors activated by cOAs are typically non-specific proteins that induce damage to essential cellular components, thereby preventing phage epidemics. Due to these toxic effects, it is crucial that the production and concentration of cOAs remain under tight regulatory control during infection-free periods or when deactivating the immune response after clearing an infection. Type III CRISPR loci often encode enzymes known as ring nucleases (RNs) that bind and degrade specific cOAs, while some effectors are auto-deactivating. Despite the discovery of several classes of RNs, a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of type III CRISPR-Cas loci in this context is lacking. Here, we examined 38,742 prokaryotic genomes to provide a global overview of type III CRISPR loci, focussing on the known and predicted RNs. The candidate RNs Csx16 and Csx20 are confirmed as active enzymes, joining Crn1-3. Distributions and patterns of co-occurrence of RNs and associated effectors are explored, allowing the conclusion that a sizeable majority of type III CRISPR systems regulate cOA levels by degrading the signalling molecules, which has implications for cell fate following viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

The fossil, known on the basis of two specimens, has been historically assigned to seamoths (Pegasidae), then to oarfish and relatives (Lampriformes). We describe its enigmatic skeletal anatomy in detail, and provide a new genus name. ""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

Active modifications to the spatial environment could thus be a potent tool to mitigate epidemic risk. We tested whether Lasius niger ants modify their nest architecture in response to pathogens by introducing controlor pathogen-treated individuals into nest-digging groups, and monitoring three-dimensional nest morphogenesis over time. Pathogen exposure led to an array of architectural changes including faster nest growth, increased spacing between entrances, transmission-inhibitory changes in overall nest network topology, and reduced chamber centrality. Simulations confirmed that these changes reduced disease spread. These results provide evidence for architectural immunity in a social animal and offer insights into how spatial organisation can be leveraged to decrease epidemic susceptibility.","NA","biorxiv",1727734169081

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1727734169081

We investigated whether a diverse refugee committee could utilize participatory methods to identify health priorities and a research agenda to address them.

MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study with focus groups of current and former refugees, asylum claimants and evacuees from a specialized refugee clinic over a year. We collected sociodemographic data using standardized instruments, then utilized a four-step nominal group technique process (idea generation, recording, discussion, and voting) to identify and rank participants health and research priorities. Participants ranked their top five priorities across three time periods: Pre-migration/early arrival (0-3 months), post-migration (3 months-2 years), and long-term health (>2 years). Participants created overarching priorities and corroborated findings via a member checking step.

FindingsTwenty-three participants (median age 35 years) attended one or more of five focus groups. Twenty-one completed sociodemographic surveys: 16/21 (76%) were women, representing 8 countries of origin. Participants identified ""more family physicians"" and ""improving health system navigation"" (11/60 votes each) as top health and research priorities respectively across all resettlement periods. Participants also prioritized pre-departure healthcare system orientation and improved post-arrival and long-term mental health services. Twelve participants completed the member checking process, affirming the results with minor clarifications.

InterpretationThis proof-of-concept study illustrates how refugees can use a rigorous consensus process without external influence to prioritize their healthcare needs, direct a health research agenda to address those needs, and co-produce research. These low-cost participatory methods should be replicated elsewhere.
