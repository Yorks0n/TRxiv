An outstanding question is whether SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences can directly induce inflammatory responses. In this study, we identify a region in the SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein with sequence homology to bacterial super-antigens (termed P3). Computational modeling predicts P3 binding to sites on MHC class I/II and the TCR that partially overlap with sites for the binding of staphylococcal enterotoxins B and H. Like SEB and SEH peptides, P3 stimulated 25-40% of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, increasing IFN-{gamma} and granzyme B production. viSNE and SPADE profiling identified overlapping and distinct IFN-{gamma} and GZMB subsets. The super-antigenic properties of P3 were further evident by its selective expansion of T cells expressing specific TCR V and V{beta} chain repertoires. In vivo experiments in mice revealed that the administration of P3 led to a significant upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1{beta}, IL-6, and TNF-. While the clinical significance of P3 in COVID-19 remains unclear, its homology to other mammalian proteins suggests a potential role for this peptide family in human inflammation and autoimmunity.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Previously, we used in situ cryo- electron tomography (cryo-ET) to reveal the native thylakoid architecture of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [1] and then map the molecular organization of these thylakoids with single-molecule precision [2]. However, it remains to be shown how generalizable this green algal blueprint is to the thylakoids of vascular plants, which possess distinct membrane architecture subdivided into grana stacks interconnected by non-stacked stromal lamellae. Here, we continue our cryo-ET investigation to reveal the molecular architecture of thylakoids within intact chloroplasts isolated from spinach (Spinacia oleracea). We visualize the fine ultrastructural details of grana membranes, as well as interactions between thylakoids and plastoglobules. We apply and further develop AI-based computational approaches for automated membrane segmentation and membrane protein picking [3], enabling us to quantify the organization of photosynthetic complexes within the plane of the thylakoid membrane and across adjacent stacked membranes. Our analysis reveals that, despite different 3D architecture, the molecular organization of thylakoid membranes in vascular plants and green algae is strikingly similar. In contrast to isolated plant thylakoids, where semi- crystalline arrays of photosystem II (PSII) appear to hold some membranes together, we find in intact chloroplasts that PSII is non-crystalline and has uniform concentration both within the membrane plane and across stacked grana membranes. Similar to C. reinhardtii, we observe strict lateral heterogeneity of PSII and PSI at the boundary between appressed and non-appressed thylakoid domains, with no evidence for a distinct grana margin region where these complexes have been proposed to intermix. Based on these measurements, we support a simple two-domain model for the molecular organization of thylakoid membranes in both green algae and plants.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Simultaneously, quantum sensing is emerging as a cutting-edge technology for precision biosensing. However, biological based candidates for quantum-sensors have thus far been limited to in vitro systems, are prone to light induced degradation, and require sophisticated experimental setups making high-throughput studies prohibitively complex. We recently created a new class of magneto-sensitive fluorescent proteins (MFPs) [1], which we now show overcome these challenges and represent the first biological quantum-based sensor that functions at physiological conditions and in living cells. Through directed evolution, we demonstrate the possibility of engineering these proteins to alter properties of their response to magnetic fields and radio frequencies. These effects are explained in terms of the spin correlated radical pair (SCRP) mechanism, involving the protein backbone and a bound flavin cofactor. Using this engineered system we demonstrate the first observation of a fluorescent protein exhibiting Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) in living bacterial cells at room temperature, at sufficiently high signal-to-noise to be detected in a single cell, paving the way for development of a new class of in vivo biosensors. Magnetic resonance measurements using fluorescent proteins enable unprecedented technologies, for instance 3D spatial localisation of the fluorescence using gradient fields (i.e. Magnetic Resonance Imaging using an endogenous probe). We further demonstrate the use of multiple variants of MFPs for multiplexing or lock-in amplification of fluorescence signals, opening a new approach to combining or extracting multiple signals from a biological measurement. Taken together, our results represent a new intersection of imaging and perhaps actuation modalities for engineered biological systems, based on and designed around understanding the quantum mechanical properties of MFPs.

However, the prevalence and mechanisms of such intergenerational epigenetic inheritance (IEI) in mammals remain poorly defined. Moreover, the interplay between paternal exposure, genetics, and age on emergent offspring features is unexplored. Here, we measure the quantitative impact of three paternal environments on early embryogenesis across genetic backgrounds. Using in vitro fertilisation (IVF) at scale, we capture batch-robust transcriptomic signatures of IEI with single-blastocyst resolution. Amongst these, paternal gut microbiota dysbiosis is linked with aberrant expression of lineage regulators in blastocysts, particularly affecting extra-embryonic tissues. Conversely, paternal low-protein high-sugar diet associates with subtle preimplantation developmental delay. We further identify gene expression variability as a paternally-induced F1 phenotype, and highlight confounding issues for IEI such as batch-effects and under-sampling. Finally, paternal genetic background and age exert a dominant influence over the inherited environmental signature. This study systematically characterises how paternal conditioning programmes subtle but detectable molecular responses in early embryos, and suggests guiding principles to dissect intergenerational phenomenology.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

We analyzed DNA sequence data, derived from the blood cells of >700,000 participants in UK Biobank and the All of Us Research Program, and developed new computational approaches to recognize, measure and learn from DNA-repeat instability at 15 highly polymorphic CAG-repeat loci. We found that expansion and contraction rates varied widely across these 15 loci, even for alleles of the same length; repeats at different loci also exhibited widely variable relative propensities to mutate in the germline versus the blood. The high somatic instability of TCF4 repeats enabled a genome-wide association analysis that identified seven loci at which inherited variants modulate TCF4 repeat instability in blood cells. Three of the implicated loci contained genes (MSH3, FAN1, and PMS2) that also modulate Huntington's disease age-at-onset as well as somatic instability of the HTT repeat in blood; however, the specific genetic variants and their effects (instability-increasing or -decreasing) appeared to be tissue-specific and repeat-specific, suggesting that somatic mutation in different tissues - or of different repeats in the same tissue - proceeds independently and under the control of substantially different genetic variation. Additional modifier loci included DNA damage response genes ATAD5 and GADD45A. Analyzing DNA repeat expansions together with clinical data showed that inherited repeats in the 5' UTR of the glutaminase (GLS) gene are associated with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (OR=14.0 [5.7-34.3]) and liver diseases (OR=3.0 [1.5-5.9]). These and other results point to the dynamics of DNA repeats in human populations and across the human lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Previous work focused mainly on Tibetans, establishing their genetic relatedness to East Asians and their genetic adaptation to high altitude, especially at EPAS1. Here, we present 87 new whole-genome sequences from 16 Himalayan populations and the insight they provide into the genomic history of the region. We show that population structure in the Himalayas began to emerge as early as 10,000 years ago, predating archaeological evidence of permanent habitation above 2,500 meters by approximately 6,000 years. The high prevalence of the introgressed adaptive EPAS1 haplotype in all high-altitude populations today supports a shared genetic origin and its importance for survival in this region. We also identify additional selection signals in genes associated with hypoxia, physical activity, immunity and metabolism which could have facilitated adaptation to the harsh environment. Over time, increasing genetic structure led to the diverse and strongly differentiated ethnic groups observed today, most of which maintained small population sizes throughout their history or experienced severe bottlenecks. Between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago, a few uniparental lineages became predominant, likely coinciding with the advent of agriculture, although significant population growth was not observed in the Himalayas except in the Tibetans. In more recent times, we detect bidirectional gene flow between high-altitude and lowland groups, occurring on both sides of the Himalayan range. The timing of this admixture aligns with the rise and expansion of historical regional powers, particularly during the Tibetan Empire and the northern Indian Gupta Empire. In the past few centuries, migrations to the Himalayas seem to have occurred alongside conflicts and population displacements in nearby regions and show some sex bias.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

However, methods to categorize paired NLRs remain limited, primarily relying on the presence of non-canonical domains in some sensor NLRs. Here, we propose that the AI system AlphaFold 3 can classify paired NLR proteins into sensor or helper categories based on predicted structural characteristics. Helper NLRs showed higher AlphaFold 3 confidence scores than sensors when modelled in oligomeric configurations. Furthermore, funnel-shaped structures--essential for activating immune responses--were reliably predicted in helpers but not in sensors. Applying this method to uncharacterized NLR pairs from rice, we found that AlphaFold 3 can differentiate between putative sensors and helpers even when both proteins lack non-canonical domain annotations. These findings suggest that AlphaFold 3 offers a new approach to categorize NLRs and enhances our understanding of the functional configurations in plant immune systems, even in the absence of non-canonical domain annotations.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Here we reveal a novel interaction between eosinophils and monocytes in the bone marrow, indirectly controlled by the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2. We demonstrate that ACKR2 maintains eosinophil levels within the bone marrow by scavenging CCL11. In the absence of ACKR2, elevated CCL11 leads to increased egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. As a result, eosinophil and monocyte interactions are reduced within the bone marrow niche, leading to changes in monocyte gene expression. Monocytes from ACKR2-/- mice are recruited to the tissues but are fundamentally altered in their ability to differentiate into macrophages, in the lung, peritoneal cavity and cavity wall. Bacterial elimination is impaired in ACKR2-/- mice during peritoneal infection. ACKR2 is therefore a key regulator of eosinophil-driven monocyte education in the bone marrow, required for full monocyte differentiation and macrophage function within the tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on wild type and aneuploid mouse embryos, we show that sex chromosomes significantly shape the preimplantation embryo transcriptional landscape. A hierarchy of effects are identified, distinctly mediated by the Y chromosome, the dosage of X chromosomes, X-chromosome imprinting, and by Xist, the non-coding RNA that initiates X-inactivation. The sex chromosomes have strong trans effects on autosomal gene expression throughout preimplantation development. The Y chromosome has an unexpectedly pronounced impact on the trophectoderm, the precursor of the placenta, and this property is shared with genes expressed from the inactive X chromosome. The paternal and maternal X chromosomes differentially promote preimplantation growth, and we identify multiple novel candidate X-linked imprinted genes mediating this effect.

Contrary to this view, we show that single-unit activation functions confer inductive biases that influence the geometry of neural population trajectories, single-unit selectivity, and fixed point configurations. Using a model distillation approach, we find that differences in neural representations and dynamics reflect qualitatively distinct circuit solutions to cognitive tasks emerging in RNNs with different activation functions, leading to disparate generalization behavior on out-of-distribution inputs.

While the functions and underlying neural circuitry of individual neocortical areas are well studied, it is unclear how these regions operate collectively to form percepts and implement cognitive processes. In particular, it remains unknown how distributed, potentially conflicting computations can be reconciled. Here we show that the reciprocal excitatory connections between cortical areas orchestrate neural dynamics to facilitate the gradual emergence of a 'consensus' across areas. We investigated the joint neural dynamics of primary (V1) and higher-order lateromedial (LM) visual areas in mice, using simultaneous multi-area electrophysiological recordings along with focal optogenetic perturbations to causally manipulate neural activity. We combined mechanistic circuit modeling with state-of-the-art data-driven nonlinear system identification, to construct biologically-constrained latent circuit models of the data that we could further interrogate. This approach revealed that long-range, reciprocal excitatory connections between V1 and LM implement an approximate line attractor in their joint dynamics, which promotes activity patterns encoding the presence of the stimulus consistently across the two areas. Further theoretical analyses revealed that the emergence of line attractor dynamics is a signature of a more general principle governing multi-area network dynamics: reciprocal inter-area excitatory connections reshape the dynamical landscape of the network, specifically slowing down the decay of activity patterns that encode stimulus features congruently across areas, while accelerating the decay of inconsistent patterns. This selective dynamic amplification leads to the emergence of multi-dimensional consensus between cortical areas about various stimulus features. Our analytical framework further predicted the timescales of specific activity patterns across areas, which we directly verified in our data. Therefore, by linking the anatomical organization of inter-area connections to the features they reconcile across areas, our work introduces a general theory of multi-area computation.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

In this study, we performed unsupervised subtyping of longitudinal multi-omics immunophenotyping in over 1,000 hospitalized patients, identifying two critical subtypes linked to mortality or mechanical ventilation with prolonged hospital stay and three severe subtypes associated with timely acute recovery. We confirmed that unresolved systemic inflammation and T-cell dysfunctions were hallmarks of increased severity and further distinguished patients with similar acute respiratory severity by their distinct immune profiles, which correlated with differences in demographic and clinical complications. Notably, one critical subtype (SubF) was uniquely characterized by early excessive inflammation, insufficient anticoagulation, and fatty acid dysregulation, alongside higher incidences of hematologic, cardiac, and renal complications, and an elevated risk of long COVID. Among the severe subtypes, significant differences in viral clearance and early antiviral responses were observed, with one subtype (SubC) showing strong early T-cell cytotoxicity but a poor humoral response, slower viral clearance, and greater risks of chronic organ dysfunction and long COVID.

In particular, yeasts have been reported as part of the core microbiome of seeds using next generation sequencing methods, but their diversity and functional roles remain largely undescribed. This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by characterizing the diversity of seed-associated yeasts across nine plant species (crops and non-cultivated species) using culturomics, microscopy, and metabarcoding. Our results show that seed-associated yeasts largely belong to Basidiomycota phylum and more particularly to the Tremellomycetes class. This yeast collection covers 15 genera (2 of Ascomycota and 13 of Basidiomycota). Out of the 219 isolates described, the most frequently isolated yeasts were Holtermaniella, Vishniacozyma, Filobasidium, Naganishia and Sporobolomyces. The yeasts from these dominant genera were isolated from multiple plant species (4 to 8), except for Naganishia which only originated from Solanum lycopersicum L. These results are also consistent with the fact that these dominant taxa were recently identified as members of the core seed microbiome, indicating their high prevalence and abundance across diverse plant hosts and environments.

Altogether, these results suggest that yeasts are generally well-adapted to the aboveground habitats of plants, but seeds represent a specific habitat that diverse Basidiomycota yeasts can colonize.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Autonomous flower cooling could help to alleviate exposure of pollen and ovules to harmful temperatures, yet investigations on the thermal ecology of flowers in hot environments are still needed to evaluate the frequency, magnitude and ecological significance of floral thermoregulatory cooling. This paper reports a study on the thermal ecology of flower heads (=capitula) of 15 species of summer-blooming Asteraceae, tribe Cardueae, from hot-dry habitats in the southern Iberian Peninsula. Temperature inside (Tin) and outside (Tout) capitula were assessed under natural field conditions by two complementary sampling and measurement procedures, which provided information on the relationships between the two temperatures at the levels of individual capitula (""continuous recording"") and local plant populations (""instantaneous measurements""). Baselines for the Tin-Tout relationship in absence of physiological activity were obtained by exposing dehydrated capitula to variable ambient temperatures. To assess whether the co-flowering capitula of summer-blooming Asteraceae collectively defined a distinct thermal layer, the vertical distribution of capitula relative to the ground was quantified. Bees visiting capitula were watched and the temperature of the air beside the visited capitulum was measured. Capitula of all species were exposed to high ambient temperatures during long periods, yet their interior was cooler than the air for most of the time, with temperature differentials ({Delta}T=Tin-Tout) quite often approaching, and sometimes exceeding -10{degrees}C. The relationship between Tin and Tout was best described by a composite of steep and shallow linear relationships separated by a breakpoint ({Psi}, interspecific range=25{degrees}C-35{degrees}C). Capitula were weakly or not thermoregulated for Tout < {Psi}, but switched to intense, thermoregulated cooling when Tout > {Psi}. Narrow vertical distribution of capitula above ground and similar cooling responses by all species produced a refrigerated floral layer where most bees foraged at Tout > {Psi} and presumably visited cooled capitula. Thermoregulatory cooling of capitula can benefit plant reproduction by reducing pollen and ovule exposure to high temperature, but also the populations of insect mutualists and antagonists through habitat improvement via a refrigerated flower layer.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Here, we develop a scalable approach that pairs cis- and trans-regulatory CRISPR screens to systematically dissect how the key immune checkpoint PD-L1 is regulated. In human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, we tile the PD-L1 locus using ~25,000 CRISPR perturbations in constitutive and IFN{gamma}-stimulated conditions. We discover 67 enhancer- or repressor-like CREs and show that distal CREs tend to contact the promoter of PD-L1 and related genes. Next, we measure how loss of all ~2,000 transcription factors (TFs) in the human genome impacts PD-L1 expression and, using this, we link specific TFs to individual CREs and reveal novel PD-L1 regulatory circuits. For one of these regulatory circuits, we confirm the binding of predicted trans-factors (SRF and BPTF) using CUT&RUN and show that loss of either the CRE or TFs potentiates the anti-cancer activity of primary T cells engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor. Finally, we show that expression of these TFs correlates with PD-L1 expression in vivo in primary PDAC tumors and that somatic mutations in TFs can alter response and overall survival in immune checkpoint blockade-treated patients. Taken together, our approach establishes a generalizable toolkit for decoding the regulatory landscape of any gene or locus in the human genome, yielding insights into gene regulation and clinical impact.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

We identified a total of 226 ALS saDMPs (sex-associated DMPs) annotated to a total of 159 unique genes.

These ALS saDMPs were enriched for transcription factor motifs such as ESR1 and REST. Moreover, we identified an additional 10 genes associated with ALS saDMPs through chromatin loop interactions, suggesting a potential regulatory role for these saDMPs on distant genes. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between DNA methylation at specific CpG sites and overall survival in ALS using Cox proportional hazards models. We identified two ALS saDMPs, cg14380013 and cg06729676, that showed significant associations with survival.

However, electrophysiological recordings are limited in their capacity to track the same neuronal populations across long periods of time (days to weeks).

The underlying neural mechanisms of IS remain largely unknown. In this study, high-density EEG was used to investigate these mechanisms in healthy adults (n=53) performing a speeded reaction time (RT) task involving visual and auditory stimuli. Trials were categorized as Repeat (same preceding modality) or Switch (different preceding modality). Switch trials showed slower RTs and delayed sensory responses (N1 and P2 components). Furthermore, across both Repeat and Switch trials, RT correlated with the latency of these neural responses. Additionally, lower alpha-band inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) in primary sensory regions was noted for Switch compared to Repeat trials, suggesting reduced efficiency of sensory processing. Greater induced theta activity over fronto-central scalp regions in Switch trials suggested increased cognitive control demands, potentially involving the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). These findings reveal that IS is characterized by delayed sensory processing and heightened cognitive load, supporting a model where prior stimulus primes the sensory cortex for faster processing in Repeat trials, while Switch trials demand more cognitive resources for adjustment. The similarity of effects across both auditory and visual sensory modalities suggests that IS effects represent core features of sensory processing, potentially reflecting a fundamental, modality-independent mechanism of attentional switching across sensory domains.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Despite daily clinical use in thousands of patients, it remains fundamentally unknown how human neurons respond to intracranial stimulation.

We address this question at a basic level by characterizing neuronal cell-type specific firing rate responses to single pulses of electrical stimulation of the human brain. We carried out broadly distributed stimulation in 30 patients undergoing neuromonitoring for epilepsy while recording from isolated neurons on microwires implanted into the medial temporal and frontal lobes.

Out of a total of 228 recorded units, 16.2% (N = 191) were classified as interneurons and 83.8% (N = 37) were classified as principal cells, using a threshold clustering method, based on intrinsic waveshape characteristics. To see how stimulation affected neuronal activation for each cell type, we calculated firing rate change between a pre-stimulation and post-stimulation window and observed that 174 units were significantly modulated with the vast majority (91%) showing firing rate suppression. We then characterized stimulation-evoked changes in firing rate to gain insight into cell type-specific responses. Additionally, in a subset of the units, we observed that firing rate responses were modulated by stimulation distance, where local stimulation (within approximately 40 mm) could evoke instantaneous firing, whereas distant stimulation reliably suppressed firing in the same units. Finally, we analyzed a subset of units within the seizure onset zone, which exhibited unique waveform features and responses to stimulation.

This study bridges a gap in the neuromodulation field by examining the single-unit firing rate response to direct electrical stimulation of the human brain and analyzing cell-type specific firing rate responses. We show that low frequency, single-pulse stimulation broadly elicits firing rate suppression, but parameters, such as distance from the unit, can have diverse effects on firing rate responses. This work informs the neuronal basis of CCEP generation and therefore has implications for clinical mapping and informs novel  active probing strategies for precision diagnosis and neuromodulation of seizure pathophysiology in surgical cases. Moreover, this research has general implications for understanding neuromodulation via direct brain stimulation.

Highlights- Putative principal cell waveform shapes are characterized by longer trough-to-peak and full-width half max durations (s) compared to interneurons.
- Monopolar stimulation @ 3 mA generally has a widespread suppressive effect on neuronal firing, lasting approximately 1.5 s.
- Principal cells show greater suppression amplitude and longer suppression durations than interneurons.
- Stimulation within [~] 40 mm is capable of evoking instantaneous firing, despite general suppression from stimulation at greater distances.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Selective attention involves the preferential processing and sampling of behaviorally important information from the external environment, while working memory involves the preferential processing and sampling of behaviorally important, internally stored information. These essential cognitive processes share neural resources within a large-scale network that includes frontal, parietal, and sensory cortices, and these shared neural resources can lead to between-domain interactions. Previous research has linked external sampling during selective attention and internal sampling during working memory to theta-rhythmic (3-8 Hz) neural activity in higher-order (e.g., frontal cortices) and sensory regions (e.g., visual cortices). Such theta-rhythmic neural activity might help to resolve the competition for shared neural resources by isolating neural activity associated with different functions over time. Here, we used EEG and a dual-task design (i.e., a task that required both external and internal sampling) to directly compare (i) theta-dependent fluctuations in behavioral performance during external sampling with (ii) theta-dependent fluctuations in behavioral performance during internal sampling. Our findings are consistent with a domain-general, theta-rhythmic process for sampling either external information or internal information. We further demonstrate that interactions between external and internal information--specifically, when to-be-detected information matches to-be-remembered information--are not dependent on theta-band activity (i.e., theta phase). Given that these theta-independent  match effects occur during early processing stages (peaking at 75 ms), we propose that theta-rhythmic sampling modulates external and internal information during later processing stages.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

We here derive a viable mechanism for ictogenesis driven by h- and m-channel overexpression from analysis of an in silico spiking neuronal microcircuit exhibiting spontaneous seizure-like events (SLEs). Such SLEs are dependent upon sufficiently strong gain in two adaptation terms phenomenologically modeling these channels effects: voltage homeostasis (h-current) and spike-frequency adaptation (m-current). Excessive gain of these adaptation terms interferes with the circuits processing of highly correlated input, promoting a sequence of network-level events that collectively provoke an SLE. Importantly, these changes do not cause increased excitability in isolated neurons, nor does this cascade require a change in the amplitude of external input to the circuit, suggesting an ictogenic pathway independent of classical changes to the E-I balance. The viability of this mechanism for SLE onset is strengthened by the host of experimentally-characterized features of seizure produced in this model reliant upon the presence of these adaptation terms, including the irregular initiation and termination of seizure-like events and time-varying peak frequency of oscillations during such events (i.e., chirps). Moreover, the cell-type dependent effects of changes in these adaptation terms, as delineated in our analyses, represent experimentally-testable predictions for future study of h- and m-channelopathies. These computational results provide vital new insights into the epileptogenic nature of h- and m-channel overexpression currently absent in the experimental literature.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Thus, we examined whether disuse and/or recovery RT affected these outcomes. All participants underwent two weeks of left leg immobilization using locking leg braces and crutches followed by eight weeks (3d/week) of knee extensor focused progressive RT. VL biopsies were obtained at baseline (PRE), immediately after disuse (MID), and after RT (POST). Western blotting was used to assay angiogenesis markers and immunohistochemistry was performed in 16/21 participants to determine type I and II muscle fiber capillary number. Significant main effects of time (p<0.05) were observed for protein levels of VEGF (MID<POST), VEGFR2 (PRE&MID<POST), TSP-1 (PRE<POST), TIMP1 (MID<POST), phosphorylated/pan eNOS (Ser1177) (POST<PRE), and pan eNOS (PRE<POST). VEGFR2 exhibited a training status*time (p=0.018), but no differences existed between T and UT at any time point. A significant main effect of time was observed for type II fiber capillary number (PRE<POST), and type II fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) increased from MID to POST (+25%, p<0.001) and PRE to POST (+20%, p=0.019).

While ROS inhibit the E3 ligase CUL3KEAP1 to stabilize NRF2 and elicit antioxidant gene expression, cells recovering from stress must rapidly reactivate CUL3KEAP1 to prevent reductive stress and oxeiptosis-dependent cell death. How cells restore efficient NRF2-degradation upon ROS clearance remains poorly understood. Here, we identify TRIP12, an E3 ligase dysregulated in Clark-Baraitser Syndrome and Parkinsons Disease, as a component of the oxidative stress response. TRIP12 is a ubiquitin chain elongation factor that cooperates with CUL3KEAP1 to ensure robust NRF2 degradation. In this manner, TRIP12 accelerates stress response silencing as ROS are being cleared, but limits NRF2 activation during stress. The need for dynamic control of NRF2-degradation therefore comes at the cost of diminished stress signaling, suggesting that TRIP12 inhibition could be used to treat degenerative pathologies characterized by ROS accumulation.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Transcription factors (TFs) being key to genetic regulation, have been studied in the origins of eusociality in Hymenoptera (Bees, Ants and Wasps) but less so in Blattodea (Cockroaches and Termites). Here we show that the social transition in Blattodea, from cockroaches to termites, displays similar patterns of regulatory change to those found in Hymenoptera. Specifically, by analysing 3 cockroach and 5 termite genomes, we find more TF families with relaxed selection compared to intensified selection and lineage-specific gene family expansions in termites. We also find that genes under selection support neotenic caste determination. There are key differences in TF regulation in comparison with Hymenoptera with contractions in TF gene families and reduced diversity in enriched DNA binding motifs of TFs.

Furthermore, we show that with increased social complexity TF activating domain diversity, one of the evolutionary and structural building blocks of TFs, decreases with gene family size while DNA binding domain diversity and number increases. This study highlights similarities in social transitions between Hymenoptera and Blattodea, with evidence of large changes in transcriptional regulation followed by lineage specific adaptations. We also show that phenotypic diversity in termites does not necessitate greater transcriptional complexity.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

However, how the sLN is shaped by the tumor and reciprocally affects metastatic progression is poorly understood. Here, we mapped immune organization in involved and non-involved sLNs of 69 melanoma patients using high-resolution spatial proteomics, spatial transcriptomics and deep learning, leveraging the data for prognostic evaluation. In patients with involved LNs, a robust T cell response correlated with absence of recurrence. In non-involved LNs, protection from metastases was linked to expanded sinuses colocalized with plasmablasts whereas CCR7+ cells and Tregs correlated with future development of distant metastases. We trained a model that predicts development of distant metastases with 79% and 93% AUC for non-metastatic and metastatic LNs, respectively. Our findings reveal conserved immune patterns in sLNs that prospectively identify patients at risk for metastatic disease and may aid in therapeutic decisions.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

VRACs assemble as heteromers of LRRC8A and LRRC8B-E subunits, with different subunit combinations resulting in channels with different properties. Recent studies have described the structures of LRRC8A:C VRACs, but how other VRACs assemble, and which structural features are conserved or variant across channel assemblies remains unknown. Herein, we used cryo-EM to determine structures of a LRRC8A:D VRAC with a 4:2 subunit stoichiometry, which we captured in two conformations. The presence of LRRC8D subunits increases hydrophobicity and widens the selectivity filter, which may explain the unique substrate selectivity of LRRC8D-containing VRACs. The structures reveal lipids bound inside the channel pore, similar to those observed in LRRC8A:C VRACs. Using electrophysiological experiments, we confirmed that pore lipids block conduction in the closed state, demonstrating that lipid-gating is a general property of VRACs. Finally, we observe that LRRC8D subunit incorporation disrupts packing of the cytoplasmic LRR domains, increasing channel dynamics and opening lateral fenestrations, which we speculate are necessary for pore lipid evacuation and channel activation.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Robust gene circuit design requires an understanding of how the combined actions of individual genetic components influence both mRNA and protein levels. Here, we simultaneously measure mRNA and protein levels in single cells using HCR Flow-FISH for a set of commonly used synthetic promoters. We find that promoters generate differences in both the mRNA abundance and the effective translation rate of these transcripts. Stronger promoters not only transcribe more RNA but also show higher effective translation rates. While the strength of the promoter is largely preserved upon genome integration with identical elements, the choice of polyadenylation signal and coding sequence can generate large differences in the profiles of the mRNAs and proteins. We used long-read direct RNA sequencing to characterize full-length mRNA isoforms and observe remarkable uniformity of mRNA isoforms from the transgenic units. Together, our high-resolution profiling of transgenic mRNAs and proteins offers insight into the impact of common synthetic genetic components on transcriptional and translational mechanisms. By developing a novel framework for quantifying expression profiles of transgenes, we have established a system for comparing native and synthetic gene regulation and for building more robust transgenic systems.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

These models use features from single-cell ATAC-seq or multiomic RNA and ATAC-seq data and are trained on a CRISPR perturbation dataset including >10,000 evaluated element-gene pairs.

We apply scE2G to build maps of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions in heterogeneous tissues and interpret noncoding variants associated with complex traits, nominating regulatory interactions linking INPP4B and IL15 to lymphocyte counts. The scE2G models will enable accurate mapping of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions across thousands of diverse human cell types.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

We used virus-like particles (VLPs) to explore how exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 proteins affects brain activity patterns in wild-type (WT) mice and in mice that express the wild-type human tau protein (htau mice). VLP exposure elicited dose-dependent changes in corticosterone and distinct chemokine levels. Longitudinal two-photon microscopy recordings of primary somatosensory and motor cortex neurons that express the jGCaMP7s calcium sensor tracked modifications of neuronal activity patterns following exposure to VLPs. There was a substantial short-term increase in stimulus-evoked activity metrics in both WT and htau VLP-injected mice, while htau mice showed also increased spontaneous activity metrics and increase activity in the vehicle-injected group. Over the following weeks, activity metrics in WT mice subsided, but remained above baseline levels. For htau mice, activity metrics either remain elevated or decreased to lower levels than baseline. Overall, our data suggest that exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 VLPs leads to strong short-term disruption of cortical activity patterns in mice with long-term residual effects. The htau mice, which have a more vulnerable genetic background, exhibited more severe pathobiology that may lead to more adverse outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

To coordinate their growth with their cell wall status, plant cells have developed cell wall integrity (CWI) mechanisms, at the center of which lies the transmembrane Malectin-like receptor kinase FERONIA (FER). FER controls a myriad of plant developmental processes including sexual reproduction, cell growth and morphogenesis, often intersecting with phytohormones-dependent pathways such as abscisic acid (ABA) signaling or plant immunity. Interestingly, FER together with its downstream receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase MARIS (MRI) was shown to similarly control root hair and rhizoid integrity in the vascular angiosperm Arabidopsis and the early diverging bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha, respectively. Here, we performed comparative transcriptomics and proteomics on the M. polymorpha mutant plants, Mpfer-1 and Mpmri-1, and their corresponding wild-type accessions Tak-1 and Tak-2. Large and significant overlaps were observed between differentially expressed genes and differentially abundant proteins in both mutants. Our multi-omics approach revealed that MpFER and MpMRI largely cooperate to negatively regulate transcriptional and translational networks, particularly those related to plant defense and ABA responses. Moreover, our phenotypic analyses showed that Mpfer-1 plants are hypersensitive to ABA-dependent growth inhibition, indicating that FER function of negatively regulating ABA-related growth responses is conserved between bryophytes and vascular plants.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Despite being the second most common inherited bleeding disorder, the pathophysiological mechanism underlying HHT-associated hemorrhage is poorly understood. Mutations in activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) gene cause HHT type 2. HHT pathogenesis is thought to follow a Knudsonian two-hit model, requiring a second somatic mutation for lesion formation. We hypothesize that somatic mutation of Alk1 in arterial endothelial cells (AECs) leads to arterial defects and hemorrhage. Here, we investigate the effects of Alk1 mutation in AECs in mice, using Bmx(PAC)-CreERT2-mediated postnatal somatic mutation. We mutated Alk1 in primarily AECs and found that somatic arterial endothelial mutation of Alk1 is sufficient to induce spontaneous epistaxis and multifocal cerebral microhemorrhage. Interestingly, this bleeding occurred in the presence of tortuous and enlarged blood vessels, loss of arterial molecular marker Efnb2, disorganization of vascular smooth muscle, and impaired vasoregulation. Our data suggest that arterial endothelial mutation of Alk1 causing reduced arterial identity and disruption of vascular smooth muscle cell coverage is a plausible molecular mechanism for HHT-associated severe epistaxis. This work provides the first evidence that somatic ALK1 loss in AECs can cause hemorrhagic vascular lesions, offering a novel preclinical model critically needed for studying HHT-associated epistaxis, and delineating an arterial mechanism to HHT pathophysiology.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Feedback forms were updated to enable real-time adjustments during the event, improving its overall effectiveness. The workshop also expanded its reach by increasing geographical diversity among participants. New didactic strategies, such as pair-teaching, code clubs, and the integration of information and communication technologies (ICTs), were implemented to enhance learning outcomes.

Here we show these signatures encode diverse anti-phage defence systems. Firstly, the WASA-1 prophage encodes a 2-gene abortive-infection system WonAB that renders the lineage resistant to the major predatory vibriophage ICP1, which alongside other phages, restricts cholera epidemics and has potential for use in prophylaxis. Secondly, the unique set of genes on Vibrio seventh pandemic island II encodes an unusual modification-dependent restriction system and a new type of the Shedu defence family. Taken together, we propose that these anti-phage defence systems have likely contributed to the success of a major epidemic lineage of the ongoing seventh cholera pandemic.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Treatment of TB requires prolonged administration of antibiotics, some of which target Mtb ribosomes, the protein synthesizing machine of the cell. We determined high-resolution cryo-EM structures of Mtb ribosomes obtained from biofilms under zinc-depleted conditions that are expected to induce ribosome hibernation. In these structures, in addition to finding the Mtb homolog of the hibernation promoting factor Mpy that binds to the decoding center in the small ribosomal subunit, we discovered an actinobacteria-specific protein, previously of unknown function, bound in the nascent polypeptide-exit tunnel (NPET) within the large ribosomal subunit. We refer to this NPET-bound protein as a actinobacteria-specific ribosome tunnel occlusion factor (RTOF). RTOF is found with vacant or E-tRNA-bound 70S ribosomes, but not in actively translating Mtb ribosomes, suggesting that its binding coincides with ribosome hibernation. RTOF makes strong interactions through the entire stretch of NPET extending up to the peptidyl-transferase center (PTC), such that it would block the passage of nascent polypeptide chain. The highly conserved FRRKSG motif of RTOF also interferes with accommodation of the formyl-methionyl moiety of initiator fMet-tRNAfMet in the conformation required for translation initiation. A molar excess of mRNA and initiator fMet-tRNAfMet displaces RTOF by triggering a significant alteration to the conformation of FRRKSG motif, which suggests how RTOF-bound hibernating ribosomes can be reactivated under optimal cellular conditions. The presence of RTOF would interfere with the binding of PTC-targeting drugs, such as macrolides, lincosamides, and oxazolidines, thereby maintaining a drug-free pool of hibernating Mtb ribosomes.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Given the harmful effects of uncontrolled PKR activation, cells must tightly regulate PKR to ensure that its activation occurs only in response to viral infections, not endogenous dsRNAs. Here, we use CRISPR-Translate, a FACS-based genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening method that exploits translation levels as a readout and identifies PACT as a key inhibitor of PKR during viral infection. We find that cells deficient for PACT hyperactivate PKR in response to several different RNA viruses, raising the question of why cells need to limit PKR activity. Our results demonstrate that PACT cooperates with ADAR1 to suppress PKR activation from self-dsRNAs in uninfected cells. The simultaneous deletion of PACT and ADAR1 results in synthetic lethality, which can be fully rescued in PKR-deficient cells. We propose that both PACT and ADAR1 act as essential barriers against PKR, creating a threshold of tolerable levels to endogenous dsRNA in cells without activating PKR-mediated translation shutdown and cell death.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

This article presents consensus recommendations developed by 13 clinical bioinformatics units taking part in the Nordic Alliance for Clinical Genomics (NACG), by expert bioinformaticians working in clinical production. The recommendations are based on clinical practice and focus on analysis types, test and validation, standardisation and accreditation, as well as core competencies and technical management required for clinical bioinformatics operations. Key recommendations include adopting the hg38 genome build as the reference and a standard set of recommended analyses, including the use of multiple tools for structural variant (SV) calling and in-house data sets for filtering recurrent calls. Clinical bioinformatics production should operate under the ISO 15189 standard, utilising off-grid clinical-grade high-performance computing systems, standardised file formats, and strict code version control. Containerized software containers or environment management systems are needed to ensure reproducibility. Pipelines should be rigorously documented and tested for accuracy and reproducibility, minimally covering unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. Standard truth sets such as GIAB and SEQC2 for germline and somatic variant calling, respectively, should be supplemented by recall testing of previously validated clinical cases. Data integrity must be verified using file hashing, and sample identity should be checked via sample fingerprinting and genetically inferred identification markers such as sex and relatedness. Finally, clinical bioinformatics teams should encompass diverse skills, including software development, data management, quality assurance, and domain expertise in human genetics. These recommendations provide a consensus framework for standardising bioinformatics practices across clinical WGS applications and can serve as a practical guide to facilities that are new to large-scale sequencing-based diagnostics, or as a reference for those who already run high-volume clinical production using NGS.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

While C. necator is amenable to genome editing, existing tools are often inefficient or rely on lengthy protocols, hindering its rapid transition to industrial applications. In this study, we simplified and accelerated the genome editing pipeline for C. necator by harnessing the Self-splicing Intron-Based Riboswitch (SIBR) system. We used SIBR to tightly control and delay Cas9-based counterselection, achieving >80% editing efficiency at two genomic loci within 48 hours after electroporation. To further increase the versatility of the genome editing toolbox, we upgraded SIBR to SIBR2.0 and used it to regulate the expression of Cas12a. SIBR2.0-Cas12a could mediate gene deletion in C. necator with [~]70% editing efficiency. Overall, we streamlined the genome editing pipeline for C. necator, facilitating its potential role in the transition to a bio-based economy.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Despite its fundamental nature, the manner through which sociability arises--whether it is innate or acquired and its neural mechanisms-- remains unknown. Here, we found that the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, produces a constellation of fearful reactions when it encounters another fly for the first time. However, these animals become sociable following several hours of exposure to conspecific (but not heterospecific) odors. Two large-scale neural silencing screens of 188 brain cell types revealed that both initial fearful reactions and learned sociability depend upon overlapping networks including circuits in the mushroom body, the principal center for associative learning and memory in the insect brain. Functional recordings of key mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) from this network over two hours of social interactions support a mechanistic model whereby fly odors modulate social valence by rebalancing MBON population activity, biasing action selection, and thereby driving sociable rather than fearful responses towards other flies. Thus, a center for learning and memory plays a fundamental role in establishing the basis for most social interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

Here we present a comprehensive long-read direct RNA sequencing atlas of full-length transcripts and their m6A modifications across six tissues (hippocampus, frontal cortex, cerebellum, testes, skeletal muscle, and liver) in five mammals (human, mouse, rat, dog, and cow) and a non-mammalian out-group (chicken). Our analysis reveals that 29% of genes have multiple mammalian-conserved alternative transcripts, with 31% of these genes showing tissue-specific switching of the major transcript isoforms. We uncover extensive conservation of coordinated splicing events, primarily driven by tissue-specific mutually associated exon splicing, particularly in neural tissues and cytoskeletal genes. At the epitranscriptome level, we find that 14.2% of m6A RNA modifications are conserved across mammals, with 39% of analysed genes containing a conserved m6A RNA modification. Our work provides unprecedented insight into the evolution of transcript complexity and the epitranscriptome, highlighting their potential roles in shaping mammalian phenotypic diversity and providing a valuable resource for understanding post-transcriptional regulation across mammalian evolutionary time.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

This is particularly apparent during early development when many TEs become de-repressed. MERVL elements are highly yet transiently upregulated in mouse totipotent 2-cell (2C) embryos during major zygotic genome activation (ZGA), and in 2C-like cells in vitro. One of the most powerful activators of MERVL is the pioneer transcription factor, Dux. However, apparent differences lie in the requirement for Dux versus MERVL activation in embryos, for unclear reasons. Moreover, sustained Dux activation causes cell toxicity in multiple cell types, which may or may not be linked to MERVL activation. Using a CRISPR-activation, 2C-GFP reporter system, we have unpicked the relative role of Dux and MERVL in ZGA, totipotent-like characteristics and cell toxicity. We find that direct MERVL activation comprises only a portion of the Dux-dependent transcriptome, and which is sufficient for expanded fate potential, but not other totipotency features. Conversely, Dux-induced pathology is independent of MERVL activation and involves induction of the pro-apoptotic factor, Noxa. Our study highlights the complexity of the Dux-MERVL transcriptional network and uncovers a new player in Dux-driven pathology.","NA","biorxiv",1732831695149

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYO_ST_ABSWhat is a Rapid Review?C_ST_ABSOur rapid reviews use a variation of the systematic review approach, abbreviating or omitting some components to generate the evidence to inform stakeholders promptly whilst maintaining attention to bias.

Who is this Rapid Review for?This Rapid Review was conducted as part of the Health and Care Research Wales Evidence Centre Work Programme. The review question was suggested by representatives of the Womens Health Team of the Welsh Government. The intended audience is Womens Health and continence service commissioners and policy makers in Wales.

Background / Aim of Rapid ReviewUrinary and faecal incontinence, which are often linked to the stresses and strains of childbirth, particularly perineal trauma, are debilitating conditions that can significantly impact womens quality of life. Approximately 85% of vaginal births in the United Kingdom (UK) are affected by childbirth related perineal trauma, either spontaneously or due to episiotomy. Incontinence also places a significant financial burden on the healthcare system. Previous estimates have shown that stress urinary incontinence alone costs the National Health Service (NHS) {pound}177 million per year. The prevention of continence issues following childbirth through evidence-based interventions is essential for the health of women both short-term and later in life. The economic cost of incontinence on both individuals and the healthcare system is substantial and the implementation of effective interventions to prevent incontinence following birth trauma can prevent avoidable and costly care in future. The aim of this rapid review was to identify evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions for preventing continence issues resulting from birth trauma.

Results of the Rapid ReviewO_ST_ABSThe evidence baseC_ST_ABSO_LIThe review included evidence available up until June 2024 (when the searches were conducted). The included studies identified in this rapid review were published between 2003 and 2024. Twenty-three studies were included in this rapid review: 20 systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness and three economic evaluations.

Key findingsO_LITwelve systematic reviews of prenatal and/or postnatal pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and mixed exercise modes (with a PFMT element) were identified.
C_LIO_LIOf the eleven systematic reviews (five of which included meta-analyses) assessing prenatal PFMT and mixed exercise, eight reported findings to support PFMT and exercise for the prevention of urinary incontinence in the postnatal period (up to 6 months postpartum).
C_LIO_LIEvidence from two meta-analyses of longer-term outcomes did not support the effectiveness of prenatal PFMT to prevent urinary incontinence in the late postpartum period (defined as greater than 6-12 months) or after 5 years following childbirth. However, data on longer-term outcomes were combined from a diverse set of studies with varied prescription of the PFMT regimens and the reviews did not explicitly examine the impact of continuing PFMT postnatally.
C_LIO_LIOf the two systematic reviews that assessed postnatal PFMT one focused on existing incontinence and found no evidence on prevention, and the other found conflicting evidence on the prevention of urinary incontinence.
C_LIO_LIFive systematic reviews (of which, three included meta-analyses) explored the effectiveness of prenatal perineal massage. None of the meta-analyses found any significant differences in incidence of urinary incontinence (evidence from three meta-analyses) or faecal incontinence (evidence from two meta-analyses) following prenatal perineal massage. For the other two systematic reviews, one reported a reduction in faecal and gas incontinence but not urinary incontinence, while the other found no effect on any type of incontinence.
C_LIO_LITwo systematic reviews reported on the effectiveness of vaginal devices for existing incontinence but did not report on the prevention of incontinence.
C_LIO_LIIn a systematic review of pushing technique, results demonstrated a significant difference in urinary incontinence scores from baseline to postpartum in the spontaneous pushing group compared with the directed pushing group.
C_LIO_LIA cost-utility analysis (conducted to inform NICE guideline 210) utilising a decision analytic Markov model of supervised prenatal pelvic floor muscle training in a population of pregnant women found the intervention to be cost-effective for preventing urinary incontinence when compared to no intervention. The intervention was likely to be cost-effective for all willingness to pay thresholds over {pound}11,000 per QALY gained.
C_LIO_LIA cost-effectiveness analysis found that group-based pelvic floor muscle training was more cost-effective than individually supervised training for the prevention of urinary incontinence, at a cost of $14.53 per case of urinary incontinence prevented or cured if eight women attended a training session.
C_LIO_LIA RCT and cost-consequence analysis reported no significant difference in urinary or faecal incontinence between groups of nulliparous women adopting an upright or lying down birthing position; but the intervention was not specifically designed to prevent incontinence.
C_LI

Policy and Practice ImplicationsThis rapid review complements existing NICE guidance on the prevention and non-surgical management of pelvic floor dysfunction (NG210, 2021), and the management of faecal incontinence (CG49, 2007). The NICE 2021 guidance recommends pelvic floor muscle training for prenatal and postnatal women, and our rapid review also identified a large evidence base regarding exercise-based interventions to prevent urinary incontinence. However, the NICE guidance indicates limited evidence supporting the long-term effectiveness of PFMT, which also aligns with the findings of our review. We identified two meta-analyses that failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of PFMT in preventing incontinence in the long term, but the included studies varied in prescription of PFMT regimens and did not examine the impact of continuing PFMT postnatally. Incontinence is a potential long-term burden as pregnancy and childbirth can weaken the pelvic floor, making women more susceptible to incontinence in later life. Menopause often exacerbates these issues due to hormonal changes and by further weakening the pelvic floor muscles. Although our review considered a broader range of interventions than the NICE 2021 guidance, other interventions, such as prenatal perineal massage and vaginal devices were less represented in the available evidence base, especially for faecal incontinence outcomes. Despite a paucity of economic evaluations assessing the cost-effectiveness of interventions for incontinence, the substantial economic burden of incontinence on the NHS necessitates investment in clinically effective, preventative options. Our findings present the case for investing in exercise-based interventions. Future recommendations for policy and practice should also consider qualitative findings of womens experiences and the acceptability and feasibility of rolling out interventions for the prevention of incontinence.

Research Implications and Evidence GapsA significant evidence gap exists regarding the cost-effectiveness of interventions aimed at preventing incontinence resulting from birth trauma. Further research is needed for non-exercise interventions and maintenance interventions. Future studies adopting longer time horizons are also needed to assess any potential long-term outcomes such as incidence of incontinence during the menopause. Future evidence reviews need to consider qualitative research of the acceptability and feasibility of interventions to prevent continence issues.","NA","medrxiv",1732831695149

Fluorescent protein tags have been extensively used to study the formation and the properties of condensates in vitro and in vivo, but there is evidence that tags may perturb the condensation properties of proteins. In this study, we carefully assess the effects of protein tags on the yeast DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1, a central regulator of processing bodies (P-bodies), which are biomolecular condensates involved in mRNA metabolism. We show that fluorescent tags as well as a poly-histidine tag greatly affect Dhh1 condensation in vitro and lead to condensates with different dynamic properties. Tagging of Dhh1 with various fluorescent proteins in vivo alters the number of P-bodies upon glucose starvation and some tags even show constitutive P-bodies in non-stressed cells. These data raise concerns about the accuracy of tagged protein condensation experiments, highlighting the need for caution when interpreting the results.

Significance StatementO_LIFluorescent tags are extensively used in protein condensation studies although their effect in condensate dynamics has not been carefully investigated.
C_LIO_LITags affect the condensation propensity and dynamics of Dhh1 in vitro and P-body numbers in vivo.
C_LIO_LITags may generally alter the behavior of proteins in biomolecular condensates and their use needs to be carefully evaluated and controlled.
