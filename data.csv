Since therapeutic research is ongoing, long COVID prevention is a pragmatic public health strategy. While prior analyses have shown the benefit of primary vaccination, the effect of booster vaccination on preventing long COVID caused by an Omicron infection has not been fully investigated. This systematic review identified 31 observational studies, among which 11 were deemed suitable for pairwise meta-analyses. Herein, the pooled risk of long COVID was 22-29% (P<0.0001 and P<0.0001, respectively) lower for vaccinated (any vaccination) populations versus unvaccinated (10 studies); 19% (P<0.0001) lower for primary course vaccination versus no vaccination (3 studies); 26% (P<0.0001) lower for booster vaccination versus no vaccination (4 studies) and 23% (P=0.0044) lower for booster vaccination versus primary course vaccination (3 studies). These findings indicate that booster vaccination can provide additional protection against long COVID; thereby, highlighting the importance of seasonal vaccination against new SARS-CoV-2 variants.","NA","medrxiv",1732659009828

We have previously demonstrated that the virus enters the human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons via an endosomal-lysosomal pathway, which is dependent on low levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and independent of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Here, we use hiPSC-derived neurons overexpressing ACE2 in co-culture with human astrocytes to show that the infection with both SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan and Omicron XBB.1.5 variants is dependent on cathepsins and can be efficiently blocked by an inhibitor of cathepsin B (CA-074-ME). The result was reproducible in non-transgenic hiPSC-derived cortical organoids. The cathepsin L inhibitor SB412515 was less effective against the Wuhan strain but equally effective against the Omicron variant. Using PCR and reinfection assays, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can replicate in neurons in 2D co-cultures. Interestingly, the infectivity of the newly produced virions declined at 24 hours post-infection despite a further increase in released viral RNA at later time points, suggesting the possible activation of an antiviral response in neurons and/or astrocytes, which is supported by a correspondent increase in the levels of secreted cytokines. Furthermore, the number of infected neurons decreased within five days, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection eventually leads to the death of the target neuronal cell in vitro. The infection also caused the accumulation of the hypoxia-inducible stress factor HIF1- in infected neurons under normoxia. Finally, we confirm and expand the previous finding that in SARS-CoV-2 infected neurons, the microtubule-associated protein tau is hyperphosphorylated at multiple loci, including S202/T205, and mislocalized to the soma of the infected neurons. Hyperphosphorylation and mislocalization of tau are hallmarks of Alzheimers disease (AD) and other  tauopathies. Our data provides further evidence supporting the neurodegenerative potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SummaryThe recent COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to infect the brain and worsen brain diseases like Alzheimers disease. Research has shown that SARS-CoV-2 can indeed infect the human brain, including a small number of neurons and other brain cells in laboratory settings.

In our previous studies, we identified the endosomal pathway as the route the virus uses to enter neuronal cells. In this study, we build on that work by demonstrating that inhibitors of endo-lysosomal cathepsin proteases can block this neuronal infection. We also found that infectious progeny virions are released from the infected neuronal cells.

Importantly, the infection proves harmful to the host cells, as evidenced by a decrease in the number of infected cells in experimental cultures over a five-day period. Additionally, we confirm and expand on earlier findings that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to the phosphorylation and altered localization of the tau protein, a process associated with brain diseases like Alzheimers.

Finally, we observed an increase in the production of inflammatory cytokines following neuronal infection with SARS-CoV-2, along with an accumulation of the stress marker protein HIF-1 in neurons. This protein has been linked to other viral infections and Alzheimers disease. Overall, our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits neurodegenerative characteristics.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009828

Interestingly, two unique genetic signatures define the West African South American (WASA) lineage of V. cholerae responsible for the 1991-2001 Latin American cholera epidemic. Here we show these signatures encode diverse anti-phage defence systems. Firstly, the WASA-1 prophage encodes a 2-gene abortive-infection system WonAB that renders the lineage resistant to the major predatory vibriophage ICP1, which alongside other phages, restricts cholera epidemics and has potential for use in prophylaxis. Secondly, the unique set of genes on Vibrio seventh pandemic island II encodes an unusual modification-dependent restriction system and a new type of the Shedu defence family. Taken together, we propose that these anti-phage defence systems have likely contributed to the success of a major epidemic lineage of the ongoing seventh cholera pandemic.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009828

Previous studies suggest that older humans are more resistant to H5N1 infections due to childhood imprinting with other group 1 viruses (H1N1 and H2N2); however, the immunological basis for this is incompletely understood. Here we show that antibody titers to historical and recent H5N1 strains are highest in older individuals and correlate more strongly with year of birth than with age, consistent with immune imprinting. After vaccination with an A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 vaccine, both younger and older humans produced H5-reactive antibodies to the vaccine strain and to a clade 2.3.4.4b isolate currently circulating in cattle, with higher seroconversion rates in young children who had lower levels of antibodies before vaccination.

Three effectors, Hap1-3 (hypertrophy-associated proteins), were identified as virulence factors promoting hypertrophic mesophyll tumor cells (HTT). Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry revealed interactions among Hap effectors, suggesting potential effector complex formation. CRISPR-Cas9 triple knockout of hap1-3 demonstrated a role of Hap1 in HTT formation. Infection assays identified Hap1 as a key virulence factor interacting with maize Snf1-related kinase 1 (SnRK1), a central energy regulator. RNA-seq analysis showed that Hap1 promotes cell cycle and starch biosynthesis genes, while CR-hap1 induced defense-related WRKY transcription factors. Phosphoproteomics revealed increased phosphorylation of SnRK1 and metabolic enzymes during SG200 infection. Our findings support a model where U. maydis induces hypertrophy through Hap1, targeting the SnRK1; subunit to prevent SnRK1 inhibition by high trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), disrupting the antagonistic relationship between T6P and SnRK1. This reprograms host transcription to enhance starch metabolism and induce endoreduplication, leading to hypertrophy induction, while suppressing sugar-induced immune signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009828

These models use features from single-cell ATAC-seq or multiomic RNA and ATAC-seq data and are trained on a CRISPR perturbation dataset including >10,000 evaluated element-gene pairs. We benchmark scE2G models against CRISPR perturbations, fine-mapped eQTLs, and GWAS variant-gene associations and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance at prediction tasks across multiple cell types and categories of perturbations. We apply scE2G to build maps of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions in heterogeneous tissues and interpret noncoding variants associated with complex traits, nominating regulatory interactions linking INPP4B and IL15 to lymphocyte counts. The scE2G models will enable accurate mapping of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions across thousands of diverse human cell types.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009828

Prior to testing whether aging biomarkers may be useful as surrogate endpoints, it is first necessary to determine whether they are responsive to interventions that target aging. Epigenetic clocks are aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation with prognostic value for many aging outcomes. Many individual studies are beginning to explore whether epigenetic clocks are responsive to interventions. However, the diversity of both interventions and epigenetic clocks in different studies make them difficult to compare systematically. Here, we curate TranslAGE-Response, a harmonized database of 51 public and private longitudinal interventional studies and calculate a consistent set of 16 prominent epigenetic clocks for each study, along with 95 other DNAm biomarkers that help explain changes in each clock. With this database, we discover patterns of responsiveness across a variety of interventions and DNAm biomarkers. For example, clocks trained to predict mortality or pace of aging have the strongest response across all interventions and show consistent agreement with each other, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions drive the strongest response from DNAm biomarkers, and study population and study duration are key factors in driving responsiveness of DNAm biomarkers in an intervention. Some classes of interventions such as TNF-alpha inhibitors have strong, consistent effects across multiple studies, while others such as senolytic drugs have inconsistent effects. Clocks with multiple sub-scores (i.e. ""explainable clocks"") provide specificity and greater mechanistic insight into responsiveness of interventions than single-score clocks. Our work can help the geroscience field design future clinical trials, by guiding the choice of interventions, specific subsets of epigenetic clocks to minimize multiple testing, study duration, study population, and sample size, with the eventual aim of determining whether epigenetic clocks can be used as surrogate endpoints.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009828

Although three-dimensional (3D) organisation is emerging as a key regulator of genome function, it is unknown whether it contributes to cellular memory. Here, we establish that acute perturbation of the epigenome can induce cellular memory of gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Specifically, we uncover how a pulse of histone deacetylase inhibition translates to changes in histone acetylation and methylation, as well as global and local genome folding. While most epigenomic and transcriptional changes are readily reversible once the perturbation is removed, genome architecture partially maintains its perturbed conformation. This is significant, as a second transient pulse of hyperacetylation induces continued gene expression deregulation at hundreds of loci. Using ultra-deep Micro-C, we associate memory of gene expression with enhancer-promoter contacts and repressive chromatin topology mediated by Polycomb. These results demonstrate how cells are able to record a transient stress in their 3D genome architecture, enabling them to respond more robustly in a second bout of the same perturbation.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009828

Here, we iteratively improve the tools for genetically manipulating Cryptosporidium and develop a targeted CRISPR-based screening method to rapidly assess how the loss of individual parasite genes influence survival in vivo. Using this method we examine the parasites pyrimidine salvage pathway and a set of leading Cryptosporidium vaccine candidates. From this latter group we determined the parasite gene known as Cp23 to be essential for survival, which was confirmed through inducible knockout in vitro and in vivo. Parasites deficient in Cp23 were able to replicate within and emerge from infected epithelial cells, yet unable to initiate gliding motility which is essential for the reinfection of neighbouring cells. The targeted screening method presented here is highly versatile and will enable researchers to more rapidly expand the knowledge base for Cryptosporidium infection biology, paving the way for new therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

This spectrum includes clinical categories such as unresponsive wakefulness syndrome or minimally conscious state, where the behavioral assessment of consciousness can often be deceptive.

To bridge this dissociation, neuroimaging techniques are employed to look for the residual brain functions. Each neuroimaging modality imperfectly captures distinct aspects of brain preservation - functional, anatomical, or both. In this study, we adopt a comprehensive approach by integrating the neurophysiology and neuroimaging modalities available from the standard and advanced clinical assessment through interpretable machine learning (ML). The electrophysiological modalities included high-density electroencephalography (EEG) (resting state and task), whereas neuroimaging modalities included anatomical and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI, and 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET).

Our investigation reveals that specific modalities, such as functional assessments provide comprehensive insights into the currently evaluated state of consciousness - the diagnosis of the patients. Conversely, structural modalities offer valuable information about the patients evolution within the consciousness spectrum. We validate the proposed analysis with data coming from other centers with different acquisition parameters. Importantly, we show that there is an improved model performance with the increase in the number of modalities. We observe a higher inter-modality disagreement for MCS patients and those patients who improve. Lastly, we observe a difference in feature importances in diagnosis and prognosis.

This integrative multimodal and ML methodology presents a promising avenue for a more nuanced understanding of DoC, contributing to enhanced diagnostic precision and prognostic capabilities in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1732659009829

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYO_ST_ABSWhat is a Rapid Review?C_ST_ABSOur rapid reviews use a variation of the systematic review approach, abbreviating or omitting some components to generate the evidence to inform stakeholders promptly whilst maintaining attention to bias.

Who is this Rapid Review for?This Rapid Review was conducted as part of the Health and Care Research Wales Evidence Centre Work Programme. The review question was suggested by representatives of the Womens Health Team of the Welsh Government. The intended audience is Womens Health and continence service commissioners and policy makers in Wales.

Background / Aim of Rapid ReviewUrinary and faecal incontinence, which are often linked to the stresses and strains of childbirth, particularly perineal trauma, are debilitating conditions that can significantly impact womens quality of life. Approximately 85% of vaginal births in the United Kingdom (UK) are affected by childbirth related perineal trauma, either spontaneously or due to episiotomy. Incontinence also places a significant financial burden on the healthcare system. Previous estimates have shown that stress urinary incontinence alone costs the National Health Service (NHS) {pound}177 million per year. The prevention of continence issues following childbirth through evidence-based interventions is essential for the health of women both short-term and later in life. The economic cost of incontinence on both individuals and the healthcare system is substantial and the implementation of effective interventions to prevent incontinence following birth trauma can prevent avoidable and costly care in future. The aim of this rapid review was to identify evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions for preventing continence issues resulting from birth trauma.

Results of the Rapid ReviewO_ST_ABSThe evidence baseC_ST_ABSO_LIThe review included evidence available up until June 2024 (when the searches were conducted). The included studies identified in this rapid review were published between 2003 and 2024. Twenty-three studies were included in this rapid review: 20 systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness and three economic evaluations.

Key findingsO_LITwelve systematic reviews of prenatal and/or postnatal pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and mixed exercise modes (with a PFMT element) were identified.
C_LIO_LIOf the eleven systematic reviews (five of which included meta-analyses) assessing prenatal PFMT and mixed exercise, eight reported findings to support PFMT and exercise for the prevention of urinary incontinence in the postnatal period (up to 6 months postpartum).
C_LIO_LIEvidence from two meta-analyses of longer-term outcomes did not support the effectiveness of prenatal PFMT to prevent urinary incontinence in the late postpartum period (defined as greater than 6-12 months) or after 5 years following childbirth. However, data on longer-term outcomes were combined from a diverse set of studies with varied prescription of the PFMT regimens and the reviews did not explicitly examine the impact of continuing PFMT postnatally.
C_LIO_LIOf the two systematic reviews that assessed postnatal PFMT one focused on existing incontinence and found no evidence on prevention, and the other found conflicting evidence on the prevention of urinary incontinence.
C_LIO_LIFive systematic reviews (of which, three included meta-analyses) explored the effectiveness of prenatal perineal massage. None of the meta-analyses found any significant differences in incidence of urinary incontinence (evidence from three meta-analyses) or faecal incontinence (evidence from two meta-analyses) following prenatal perineal massage. For the other two systematic reviews, one reported a reduction in faecal and gas incontinence but not urinary incontinence, while the other found no effect on any type of incontinence.
C_LIO_LITwo systematic reviews reported on the effectiveness of vaginal devices for existing incontinence but did not report on the prevention of incontinence.
C_LIO_LIIn a systematic review of pushing technique, results demonstrated a significant difference in urinary incontinence scores from baseline to postpartum in the spontaneous pushing group compared with the directed pushing group.
C_LIO_LIA cost-utility analysis (conducted to inform NICE guideline 210) utilising a decision analytic Markov model of supervised prenatal pelvic floor muscle training in a population of pregnant women found the intervention to be cost-effective for preventing urinary incontinence when compared to no intervention. The intervention was likely to be cost-effective for all willingness to pay thresholds over {pound}11,000 per QALY gained.
C_LIO_LIA cost-effectiveness analysis found that group-based pelvic floor muscle training was more cost-effective than individually supervised training for the prevention of urinary incontinence, at a cost of $14.53 per case of urinary incontinence prevented or cured if eight women attended a training session.
C_LIO_LIA RCT and cost-consequence analysis reported no significant difference in urinary or faecal incontinence between groups of nulliparous women adopting an upright or lying down birthing position; but the intervention was not specifically designed to prevent incontinence.
C_LI

Policy and Practice ImplicationsThis rapid review complements existing NICE guidance on the prevention and non-surgical management of pelvic floor dysfunction (NG210, 2021), and the management of faecal incontinence (CG49, 2007). The NICE 2021 guidance recommends pelvic floor muscle training for prenatal and postnatal women, and our rapid review also identified a large evidence base regarding exercise-based interventions to prevent urinary incontinence. However, the NICE guidance indicates limited evidence supporting the long-term effectiveness of PFMT, which also aligns with the findings of our review. We identified two meta-analyses that failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of PFMT in preventing incontinence in the long term, but the included studies varied in prescription of PFMT regimens and did not examine the impact of continuing PFMT postnatally. Incontinence is a potential long-term burden as pregnancy and childbirth can weaken the pelvic floor, making women more susceptible to incontinence in later life. Menopause often exacerbates these issues due to hormonal changes and by further weakening the pelvic floor muscles. Although our review considered a broader range of interventions than the NICE 2021 guidance, other interventions, such as prenatal perineal massage and vaginal devices were less represented in the available evidence base, especially for faecal incontinence outcomes. Despite a paucity of economic evaluations assessing the cost-effectiveness of interventions for incontinence, the substantial economic burden of incontinence on the NHS necessitates investment in clinically effective, preventative options. Our findings present the case for investing in exercise-based interventions. Future recommendations for policy and practice should also consider qualitative findings of womens experiences and the acceptability and feasibility of rolling out interventions for the prevention of incontinence.

Research Implications and Evidence GapsA significant evidence gap exists regarding the cost-effectiveness of interventions aimed at preventing incontinence resulting from birth trauma. Further research is needed for non-exercise interventions and maintenance interventions. Future studies adopting longer time horizons are also needed to assess any potential long-term outcomes such as incidence of incontinence during the menopause. Future evidence reviews need to consider qualitative research of the acceptability and feasibility of interventions to prevent continence issues.","NA","medrxiv",1732659009829

In this study, we carefully assess the effects of protein tags on the yeast DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1, a central regulator of processing bodies (P-bodies), which are biomolecular condensates involved in mRNA metabolism. We show that fluorescent tags as well as a poly-histidine tag greatly affect Dhh1 condensation in vitro and lead to condensates with different dynamic properties. Tagging of Dhh1 with various fluorescent proteins in vivo alters the number of P-bodies upon glucose starvation and some tags even show constitutive P-bodies in non-stressed cells. These data raise concerns about the accuracy of tagged protein condensation experiments, highlighting the need for caution when interpreting the results.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Despite its widespread use, a quantitative understanding of how DMS reactivity relates to specific RNA 3D structural features remains incomplete. To address this gap, we systematically analyzed DMS reactivity patterns with a massive library of 7,500 RNA constructs containing two-way junctions with known 3D structures. Our results reveal that DMS reactivity exists on a continuous spectrum rather than discrete high and low bins. Approximately 10% overlap in reactivity between WC and non-WC nucleotides demonstrates that simple thresholds cannot accurately determine base-pairing status. In flanking WC pairs, DMS reactivity correlates with base stacking strength and junction dynamics. For non-WC nucleotides, increased hydrogen bonding and decreased solvent accessibility led to WC-like DMS protection. Most significantly, we discover that DMS reactivity in non-canonical pairs strongly correlates with atomic distances and base pair geometry, enabling discrimination between different 3D conformations. These quantitative relationships establish novel metrics for evaluating RNA structural models and provide a new framework for incorporating DMS reactivity patterns into structure prediction algorithms.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

ELS can permanently alter the brain, leading to cognitive impairment, increased sensitivity to future stressors, and mental health risks. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a key brain region implicated in the effects of ELS. Methods: To better understand the effects of ELS on the PFC, we ran a meta-analysis of publicly available transcriptional profiling datasets. We identified five datasets (GSE89692, GSE116416, GSE14720, GSE153043, GSE124387) that characterized the long-term effects of multi-day postnatal ELS paradigms (maternal separation, limited nesting/bedding) in male and female laboratory rodents (rats, mice). The outcome variable was gene expression in the PFC later in adulthood as measured by microarray or RNA-Seq. To conduct the meta-analysis, preprocessed gene expression data were extracted from the Gemma database. Following quality control, the final sample size was n=89: n=42 controls & n=47 ELS: GSE116416 n=23 (no outliers); GSE116416 n=44 (2 outliers); GSE14720 n=7 (no outliers); GSE153043 n=9 (1 outlier), and GSE124387 n=6 (no outliers). Differential expression was calculated using the limma pipeline followed by an empirical Bayes correction. For each gene, a random effects meta-analysis model was then fit to the ELS vs. Control effect sizes (Log2 Fold Changes) from each study. Results: Our meta-analysis yielded stable estimates for 11,885 genes, identifying five genes with differential expression following ELS (false discovery rate< 0.05): transforming growth factor alpha (Tgfa), IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 3 (Iqgap3), collagen, type XI, alpha 1 (Col11a1), claudin 11 (Cldn11) and myelin associated glycoprotein (Mag), all of which were downregulated. Broadly, gene sets associated with oligodendrocyte differentiation, myelination, and brain development were downregulated following ELS. In contrast, genes previously shown to be upregulated in Major Depressive Disorder patients were upregulated following ELS. Conclusion: These findings suggest that ELS during critical periods of development may produce long-term effects on the efficiency of transmission in the PFC and drive changes in gene expression similar to those underlying depression.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Biased compounds that selectively activate therapy-relevant pathways promise to be safer, more effective medications. The determinants of bias are poorly understood, however, and rationally-designed, G protein-subtype-selective compounds are lacking. Here, using the prototypical class A GPCR neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), we find that small molecules binding the intracellular GPCR-transducer interface change G protein coupling by subtype-specific and predictable mechanisms, enabling rational drug design. We demonstrate that the compound SBI-553 switches NTSR1 G protein preference by acting both as a molecular bumper and a molecular glue. Structurally, SBI-553 occludes G protein binding determinants on NTSR1, promoting association with select G protein subtypes for which an alternative, shallow-binding conformation is energetically favorable. Minor modifications to the SBI-553 scaffold produce allosteric modulators with distinct G protein subtype selectivity profiles. Selectivity profiles are probe-independent, conserved across species, and translate to differences in in vivo activity. These studies demonstrate that G protein selectivity can be tailored with small changes to a single chemical scaffold targeting the receptor-transducer interface and, as this pocket is broadly conserved, present a strategy for pathway-selective drug discovery applicable to the diverse GPCR superfamily.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Here, we found that the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, produces a constellation of fearful reactions when it encounters another fly for the first time. However, these animals become sociable following several hours of exposure to conspecific (but not heterospecific) odors. Two large-scale neural silencing screens of 188 brain cell types revealed that both initial fearful reactions and learned sociability depend upon overlapping networks including circuits in the mushroom body, the principal center for associative learning and memory in the insect brain. Functional recordings of key mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) from this network over two hours of social interactions support a mechanistic model whereby fly odors modulate social valence by rebalancing MBON population activity, biasing action selection, and thereby driving sociable rather than fearful responses towards other flies. Thus, a center for learning and memory plays a fundamental role in establishing the basis for most social interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

The availability of massive scRNA-seq datasets and advanced machine learning techniques has recently driven the development of single-cell foundation models that provide informative and versatile cell representations based on expression profiles. However, to understand disease states, we need to consider entire tissue ecosystems, simultaneously considering many different interacting cells. Here, we tackle this challenge by generating patient-level representations derived from multi-cellular expression context measured with scRNA-seq of tissues. We develop PaSCient, a novel model that employs a multi-level representation learning paradigm and provides importance scores at the individual cell and gene levels for fine-grained analysis across multiple cell types and gene programs characteristic of a given disease. We apply PaSCient to learn a disease model across a large-scale scRNA-seq atlas of 24.3 million cells from over 5,000 patients. Comprehensive and rigorous benchmarking demonstrates the superiority of PaSCient in disease classification and its multiple downstream applications, including dimensionality reduction, gene/cell type prioritization, and patient subgroup discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Electrical communication between qNSCs and neurons enables this precise spatial and temporal control of reactivation throughout the entire span of the CNS. Using single-cell RNA-seq we discovered that, remarkably, qNSCs switch on a host of neuronal genes while maintaining a stem cell identity.

We identified a total of 226 ALS saDMPs (sex-associated DMPs) annotated to a total of 159 unique genes.

Moreover, we identified an additional 10 genes associated with ALS saDMPs through chromatin loop interactions, suggesting a potential regulatory role for these saDMPs on distant genes. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between DNA methylation at specific CpG sites and overall survival in ALS using Cox proportional hazards models.

Intratumor cellular heterogeneity related to neural differentiation has emerged as a defining characteristic that can explain its aggressive behavior. Although recurrent driver mutations are not typically observed in these tumors, Rho GTPases signaling genes have been identified as one of the most frequently mutated in aggressive NB cases. Rho GTPases are key regulators of cell morphology, migration, and differentiation, yet their role in NB remains underexplored. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the expression and clinical significance of Rho GTPase signaling networks in NB tumors.

MethodsWe analyzed the expression profiles of Rho GTPases, their regulators, and effectors, across multiple NB patient cohorts. Gene expression correlations with clinical parameters were assessed, and bioinformatics analyses were employed to identify gene expression patterns and interactions in tumors. Functional studies were performed in NB cell lines and in vivo models to validate the role of key Rho GTPases, including Cdc42, in NB progression and differentiation.

ResultsOur analysis revealed widespread dysregulation of Rho GTPase signaling in NB tumors. Specific GTPases, such as RHOA or RHOV, were upregulated in advanced disease stages, while others, including RHOB, RHOU and CDC42, were downregulated and associated with poor prognosis. A minimal Rho-related gene signature was identified as a strong predictor of NB patient survival. Functional validation highlighted Cdc42 as a key regulator of NB differentiation, where its downregulation was necessary for maintaining the malignant, undifferentiated phenotype of NB cells. We also identified ARHGAP31/CdGAP as a critical regulator of Cdc42 in NB progenitor cells, suggesting a mechanism for Cdc42 suppression in aggressive NB.

ConclusionsAn important role for Rho GTPase signaling in NB progression is revealed, providing a foundation for further exploration of Rho GTPase-targeted therapies in NB. In particular, Cdc42 signaling intervene in the balance between differentiation and stemness in NB cells, suggesting specific signaling events controlling the identity and plasticity of NB cells.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Our analysis reveals that 29% of genes have multiple mammalian-conserved alternative transcripts, with 31% of these genes showing tissue-specific switching of the major transcript isoforms. We uncover extensive conservation of coordinated splicing events, primarily driven by tissue-specific mutually associated exon splicing, particularly in neural tissues and cytoskeletal genes.

Thus, robust nervous system function can emerge in the face of the variability that is inherent to the constituent nerve cells; and of unpredictable external influences, notably temperature, that impact on neuronal activity and metabolism. These developmental windows are termed ""critical"" because neuronal networks display elevated sensitivity and plasticity responses to stimuli, such that disturbances during a critical period, but not outside, can cause lasting mal-adjustment of network function. Though the impact of temperature variations on nervous system development have been well established, the underlying signalling framework remains unknown. To study this, we have harnessed a well-defined critical period of the embryo of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and asked how heat stress experienced by the embryo leads to lasting changes during subsequent nervous system development, including change to synaptic receptor composition and overgrowth, and altered crawling behaviour. We identified a highly conserved signalling pathway as responsible for this developmental decision window. Heat stress leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within mitochondria by reverse electron transport, at Complex-I of the electron transport chain. This mitochondrial ROS signal is then transmitted to the nucleus by the Drosophila homologue of the highly conserved hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha, whose activation during an embryonic critical period, but not outside this sensitive developmental window, induces lasting changes in subsequent development and function of the nervous system.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells can persist indefinitely when delivered to patients with B cell cancers and can confer long-term remission. For patients with solid tumors, however, sustaining CAR T cell activity remains a major challenge. This has been attributed in part to the immune microenvironment within solid tumors, though the contribution of specific immune subsets to resistance to CAR T cells is not clear. Here we resolve how the immunology of irradiated tumors dramatically enhances persistence and efficacy of CAR T cells targeted to advanced lung metastases in a syngeneic mouse model. Remarkably, CAR T cell persistence depended critically on dendritic cells (DC) that underwent trogocytic ""antigen-dressing"" of tumor target antigens and stimulated CAR T cells through the chimeric receptor. Furthermore, tumor irradiation increased antigen-dressing onto DCs. In the absence of functional DCs, CAR T cell activity in irradiated tumor was short-lived and tumors relapsed. These findings establish a critical mechanism through which DCs maintain the CAR T cell pool in irradiated tumors, thus supporting translation of this approach to advance CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

We describe this burden and compare it to the burden of influenza in the first two post-pandemic years in Denmark.

MethodsA cohort study including residents in Denmark from May 16, 2022, to June 7, 2024. Data were obtained from national registries, including information on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-positive COVID-19 and influenza admissions, mortality within 30 days of admission, sex, age, COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, comorbidity, and living in long-term care facility for elderly. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to compare rates of admissions between COVID-19 and influenza. To assess severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 30-day mortality between COVID-19 and influenza.

ResultsAmong 5,899,170 individuals, admissions with COVID-19 (n=24,687) were more frequent than admissions with influenza (n=8,682; aIRR 2.01, 95%CI 1.37-2.95), in particular during the first year (p=0.01), in the summer (p<0.001) and among people above 65 years of age (p<0.001). The number of deaths were also higher (COVID-19, n=2,393; influenza, n=522). Among patients, the risk of mortality of COVID-19 was higher than influenza in the 12-30 days following admission (0-11 days, aHR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.25; 12-30 days, aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.21-1.84), in particular among non-vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza (aHR 1.81, 95%CI 1.25-2.62), while it was similar to influenza among patients without comorbidities (aHR 1.07, 95%CI 0.63-1.80).

ConclusionCOVID-19 represented a greater disease burden than influenza, with more hospitalisations and deaths, and more severe disease primarily among non-vaccinated and comorbid patients.

While polyploid organisms are prevalent, ancient polyploidy (paleopolyploidy) is decisively rare. Numerous studies have revealed adaptive changes at the genomic, cellular, and physiological levels that confer evolutionary advantages to polyploids, but the factors contributing to their long-term success remain poorly understood. Here, we assembled a large angiosperm genome dataset encompassing 470 different angiosperm species. We reconstructed a highly concordant evolutionary timescale of angiosperms and conducted a large-scale study to identify and date WGDs across this set of species. We unveiled 132 independent ancient WGD events that do not seem randomly distributed in time, but clustered around periods of great environmental upheaval. We observed that a majority of paleopolyploidizations occurred between 50 and 75 mya, coinciding with the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum and the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary. A more recent wave of ancient WGDs can be observed between 25 and 40 mya, coinciding with periods of glaciation expansion, rapid shifts in sea surface temperatures, and a marked decrease in global mean surface temperature.

However, the neural mechanisms that support diverse sensorimotor transformations across species with distinct navigational strategies remain largely unexplored. By comparing related teleost species, zebrafish (Danio rerio, ZF) and Danionella cerebrum (DC), we investigated behavioral patterns and neural architectures during the visually guided optomotor response (OMR). Closed-loop behavioral tracking during visual stimulation revealed that larval ZF employ burst-and-glide locomotion, while larval DC display continuous, smooth swimming punctuated with sharp directional turns. Although DC achieve higher average speeds, they lack the direction-dependent velocity modulation observed in ZF. Whole-brain two-photon calcium imaging and tail tracking in head-fixed fish reveals that both species exhibit direction-selective motion encoding in homologous regions, including the retinorecipient pretectum, with DC exhibiting fewer binocular, direction-selective neurons overall. Kinematic analysis of head-fixed behavior reveals that DC sustain significantly longer directed swim events across all stimuli than ZF, highlighting the divergent visuomotor strategies, with ZF reducing tail movement duration in response to oblique, turn-inducing stimuli. Lateralized motor-associated neural activity in the medial and anterior hindbrain of both species suggests a shared circuit motif, with distinct neural circuits that independently control movement vigor and direction. These findings highlight the diversity in visuomotor strategies among teleost species, underscored by shared sensorimotor neural circuit motifs, and establish a robust framework for unraveling the neural mechanisms driving continuous and discrete visually guided locomotion, paving the way for deeper insights into vertebrate sensorimotor functions.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

In contrast with the dorso-ventrally flat Drosophila wing, its serial homolog the haltere adopts a globular shape thought to arise from a lack of matrix-mediated adhesion between its dorsal and ventral surfaces. Contradicting this model, however, matrix manipulations are known to deform halteres. To understand haltere morphogenesis, we characterized matrix behavior and monitored metamorphic development of the haltere. We found that, similar to the wing, correct haltere morphogenesis requires Collagen IV degradation, which we show is mediated by ecdysone-controlled expression of Matrix metalloprotease 2 in both wing and haltere. After Collagen IV is degraded, similar again to the wing, dorsal and ventral haltere surfaces establish Laminin-mediated contact through long cytoskeletal projections. Furthermore, time-lapse analysis of shape changes in wild type and mutant halteres indicates that these projections couple the two surfaces through a central tensor, ensuring load distribution across the whole organ to create a globular shape against tissue-wide deforming forces. Our findings reveal an unexpected role for matrix-mediated adhesion in haltere morphogenesis and describe a novel type of matrix-based tensor structure building 3D shape from 2D epithelia.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

This trait is important for adaptation in land plants. The molecular mechanisms of gravitropism have been studied mainly in flowering plants, but there is limited research on other organisms. In this study, we examined the gravitropic response of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, a model for investigating the evolution of land plants. We found the tips of the thallus extend upward and form several straight narrow structures in the dark. These growth directions were always in the opposite direction of gravity, and clinostat treatment disrupted them. The parenchymatous cells in the narrow structures contained amyloplasts, and the sedimentation of the amyloplasts preceded the gravitropic curvature, suggesting their role as statoliths. The starchless mutants, Mppgm1 and Mpaps1 were generated, and an abnormal direction of growth was observed in the narrow structures, but they tended to elongate upward. These observations indicate that although amyloplasts are required for complete gravitropism, plants can sense gravity without well-developed amyloplasts. These results suggest that land plants use amyloplasts as statoliths but also have amyloplast-independent mechanisms of gravitropism.

Here we introduce a methodology grounded in spectral graph theory to elucidate a one-dimensional curve that effectively approximates the spatial coordinates of the examined sample. This curve is then used to establish a new coordinate system that better reflects tissue morphology. We then develop a generalized additive model (GAM) to detect genes with variable expression in the new morphologically relevant coordinate system. Our approach directly models gene counts, thereby eliminating the need for normalization or transformations to satisfy normality assumptions.

Indeed, we often not only choose to learn motor skills because of some external reward, but also because skilled movement, in and of itself, is satisfying. While dopamine is known to drive reward-based motor learning, it remains unclear whether dopamine is implicated in motor learning under conditions ostensibly driven by intrinsic rewards/motivation (i.e., in the absence of extrinsic feedback or reward). Here, we investigated the role of dopamine in motor skill learning guided by internally determined signals of performance success, using a task where learning occurred either in the absence or presence of feedback. We found that dopamine altered performance both in the presence and in the absence of information on task success. This provides direct causal evidence for a role of dopamine in motor learning driven by internal task goals.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

To date, researchers have used just one non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) in a given experiment; here, we validate a novel approach using two different ncAAs in a single experiment. This advancement facilitates the detection of differentially active subpopulations within the same experimental context, thereby reducing the uncertainty and variability associated with parallel treatments, and providing precise spatial information about organisms that are active under distinct conditions or at different times. We show that both ncAAs can be taken up by E. coli cultures and by constituents of the Little Sippewissett Salt Marsh (LSSM) microbiome, resulting in fluorescence signals that are significantly higher than background and ncAA-free control experiments. As a proof of concept experiment, we implemented this Dual-BONCAT approach in LSSM sediments, adding one ncAA during daytime hours and the other at night. Subpopulations of cells that were anabolically active during the day and/or night were distinguishable by both fluorescence microscopy, and by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Subsequent high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of active subpopulations revealed that Methylobacterium, potentially feeding on plant exudate carbon molecules, was preferentially active during the day, while sulfur-cycling taxa dominated the night-active population. Dual-BONCAT offers an important advancement in multiplexing substrate-analog probing techniques, providing a more realistic understanding of metabolic activity under distinct environmental conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Compounds such as Tolvaptan (TVP) and Conivaptan are marketed drugs but their mechanisms of inhibition are not known. In addition, TVP presents unwanted side effects such as serious liver injury. Conivaptan also targets AVP V1a receptor subtype and thus is not selective to V2R. To develop novel molecules with less side effects and better selectivity, rational drug design based on experimental three-dimensional G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structures is a powerful and successful avenue. The lack of antagonist-bound V2R structures has however impaired this strategy for this GPCR. To fill this gap of knowledge, we solved here the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the vasopressin V2R in complex with two selective antagonists, the nonpeptide TVP and the green mamba snake Mambaquaretin toxin (MQ1). Both ligands, known to be competitive, bind into the orthosteric AVP binding site but with substantial differences. The small molecule binds deeper than MQ1, and directly contacts the toggle switch residue W2846.48 in the transmembrane domain 6 (TM6), whereas the peptide Kunitz- fold toxin presents more extensive contacts with the receptor through additional interactions with extracellular and transmembrane residues. As anticipated from the pharmacological properties of TVP and MQ1, both structures represent inactive conformations of the V2R. Their comparison with those of the active AVP-bound V2R reveals the molecular mechanisms modulating receptor activity. Finally, the structure of the V2R bound to a mini-protein such as MQ1 opens a new pharmacology era in the field of water homeostasis and renal diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

A frequently encountered issue is that proteins adsorb to the air-water interface of the sample in a limited number of orientations. This makes it challenging to obtain high-resolution reconstructions or may even cause projects to fail altogether. We have previously observed that laser flash melting and revitrification of cryo samples reduces preferred orientation for large, symmetric particles. Here, we demonstrate that our method can in fact be used to scramble the orientation of proteins of a range of sizes and symmetries. The effect can be enhanced for some proteins by increasing the heating rate during flash melting or by depositing amorphous ice onto the sample prior to revitrification. This also allows us to shed light onto the underlying mechanism. Our experiments establish a set of tools for overcoming preferred orientation that can be easily integrated into existing workflows.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

TubeTracker integrates manual and automatic image processing routines and the graphical user interface allows the user to interact with the software to make manual corrections of automated steps. TubeTracker does not depend on training data sets required to implement machine learning approaches and thus can be immediately implemented using readily available imaging systems. Furthermore, TubeTracker is an excellent tool to produce the pollen performance data sets necessary to take advantage of emerging AI-based methods to fully automate analysis. We tested TubeTracker and found it to be accurate in measuring pollen tube germination and pollen tube tip elongation across multiple cultivars of tomato.

In this study, we introduce new algorithms for clustering scRNA-seq data. The first algorithm builds a k-MST graph from distances obtained directly from the input data without dimensionality reduction. The computation follows an iterative procedure of k steps in which each step calculates and stores the edges of minimum spanning trees over different subgraphs obtained removing edges selected in previous iterations. The Louvain algorithm is executed on the k-MST graph for cell clustering. We also explored alternatives based on neural networks in which an autoencoder is used to learn the parameters of a Gaussian mixture model, aiming to improve the handling of clusters with different shapes and sizes. Benchmark experiments with simulated data and public datasets show that the algorithms proposed in this work have competitive accuracy, compared to previous solutions, but also that sequencing depth, number of cells and tissue types have important effects on the performance of the algorithms. Moreover, we performed further experiments with scRNA-data taken from a patient with refractory epilepsy. The AE-GMM model achieved the best accuracy for this dataset, and the k-MST ranked first among methods that do not require previous information on the expected number of clusters.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Applying principles from active nematics, we show that myoblast and myotube patterning follows physical rules similar to liquid crystal organization. Remarkably, fusion predominantly occurs at comet-shaped topological defects in cellular alignment, which we identified as regions of high compressive stress. We further find that this stress-driven organization depends on extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, which mirrors the nematic order of the cell population. Our integrated data, supported by active nematics-based mathematical modeling, accurately predict self-organization patterns and mechanical stresses that regulate myoblast fusion. By revealing the essential role of biomechanics and ECM interplay in myogenesis, this work establishes a foundational framework for understanding biomechanical principles in morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

We conducted genetic knockdown, evaluated mitochondrial respiration, and performed targeted metabolomics to study the function of these genes in GBM. We demonstrate that MAT2A or AHCY knockdown induces oxidative stress, hinders cellular respiration, and reduces the survival of GBM cells. Furthermore, selective MAT2a or AHCY inhibition reduces GBM cell viability, impairs oxidative metabolism, and changes the metabolic profile of these cells towards oxidative stress and cell death. Mechanistically, MAT2a or AHCY regulates spare respiratory capacity, the redox buffer cystathionine, lipid and amino acid metabolism, and prevents DNA damage in GBM cells.

For proper function, these interactions as well as the involved protein and RNA structures are highly dynamic and thus, mechanistic insights from structural biology are challenging to obtain. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach combining single-molecule force spectroscopy with NMR spectroscopy to analyze the concerted interaction of the two RNA-binding interfaces (A-site, B-site) of the immunoregulatory protein Roquins ROQ domain with the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of the Ox40 mRNA. This 3UTR contains two specific hairpin structures termed constitutive and alternative decay elements (CDE, ADE), which mediate mRNA degradation via binding of Roquin. Our single-molecule experiments reveal the CDE folds cooperatively, while ADE folding involves at least 3 on-pathway and 3 off-pathway intermediates. Utilizing an integrated microfluidics setup allows to extract binding kinetics to Roquin in real time. Supported by NMR, we find opposing effects of the two Roquin sub-domains on distinct regions of the ADE: while the A-site interacts strongly with the folded apical stem-loop, we find that the B-site has a distinct destabilizing effect on the central stem of the ADE owed to single-strand RNA binding. We propose that RNA-motif nature and Roquin A- and B-sites jointly steer mRNA decay with context-encoded specificity, and we suggest plasticity of stem structures as key determinant for Roquin-RNA complex formation. The unique methodological combination of NMR and single-molecule force spectroscopy reveals an unknown mechanism of a dual-function RNA-binding domain suggesting a new model for target RNA recognition.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTLocal RNA structure is decisive for specific engagement with gene-regulatory proteins and, as a consequence, correct cellular function. However, its existence often appears dynamic and thus, challenging to study. This study shows how NMR and single-molecule force spectroscopy efficiently complement each other to provide high-resolution, time-resolved data on RNA folding intermediates during dynamic complex formation with the immune-regulating protein Roquin, which exploits multiple RNA-binding sites. Our data reveal a dual-mode binding of Roquin to RNA by firmly attaching to the stem-loop and, at the same time, destabilizing other regions making them accessible to downstream interaction partners.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

The alternating black-brownish and orange patches seen in tortoiseshell and calico cats are considered as classic examples of the phenotypic expression of random X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) occurring in female mammals. However, the O gene in the cat genome has not been identified, and the genetic variation responsible for the orange coloration remains unknown. We report here that a 5.1-kilobase (kb) deletion within an intron of the X-linked ARHGAP36 gene, encoding a Rho GTPase activating protein, is closely and exclusively associated with orange coloration. The deleted region contains a highly conserved putative regulatory element, whose removal presumably cause altered ARHGAP36 expression. Notably, ARHGAP36 expression in cat skin tissues is linked to the suppression of many melanogenesis genes, potentially shifting pigment synthesis from eumelanin to pheomelanin. Furthermore, we find evidence that the gene undergoes XCI in female human and mouse cells, and XCI-dependent CpG island methylation consistent with random XCI in female domestic cats. The 5.1-kb deletion seems widespread in domestic cats with orange coat coloration, suggesting a single origin of this coat color phenotype.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Human skin undergoes both chronological aging and environmental degradation, particularly UV-induced photoaging. Detrimental structural and physiological changes caused by aging include epidermal thinning due to stem cell depletion and dermal atrophy associated with decreased collagen production. Here, we present a comprehensive single-cell atlas of skin aging, analyzing samples from young, middle-aged, and elderly individuals, including both sun-exposed and sun-protected areas. This atlas reveals age-related cellular composition and function changes across various skin cell types, including epidermal stem cells, fibroblasts, hair follicles, and endothelial cells. Using our atlas, we have identified basal stem cells as a highly variable population across aging, more so than other skin cell populations such as fibroblasts. In basal stem cells, we identified ATF3 as a novel regulator of skin aging. ATF3 is a transcriptional factor for genes involved in the aging process, with its expression reduced by 20% during aging. Based on this discovery, we have developed an innovative mRNA-based treatment to mitigate the effects of skin aging. Cell senescence decreased 25% in skin cells treated with ATF3 mRNA, and we observed an over 20% increase in proliferation in treated basal stem cells. Importantly, we also found crosstalk between keratinocytes and fibroblasts as a critical component of therapeutic interventions, with ATF3 rescue of basal cells significantly enhancing fibroblast collagen production by approximately 200%. We conclude that ATF3-targeted mRNA treatment effectively reverses the effects of skin aging by modulating specific cellular mechanisms, offering a novel, targeted approach to human skin rejuvenation.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

To tackle these challenges, we proposed a machine-learning ""stacking"" approach that draws information from whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) across different modalities, from task-fMRI contrasts and functional connectivity during tasks and rest to structural measures, into one prediction model. We benchmarked the benefits of stacking, using the Human Connectome Projects: Young Adults (n=873, 22-35 years old) and Human Connectome Projects-Aging (n=504, 35-100 years old) and the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (Dunedin Study, n=754, 45 years old). For predictability, stacked models led to out-of-sample r[~].5-.6 when predicting cognitive abilities at the time of scanning, primarily driven by task-fMRI contrasts. Notably, using the Dunedin Study, we were able to predict participants cognitive abilities at ages 7, 9, and 11 using their multimodal MRI at age 45, with an out-of-sample r of 0.52. For test-retest reliability, stacked models reached an excellent level of reliability (ICC>.75), even when we stacked only task-fMRI contrasts together. For generalisability, a stacked model with non-task MRI built from one dataset significantly predicted cognitive abilities in other datasets. Altogether, stacking is a viable approach to undertake the three challenges of BWAS for cognitive abilities.

Significance statementFor decades, psychologists and neuroscientists have attempted to predict cognitive abilities from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data but have had limited success, casting doubt on the predictive ability of brain MRI. Here we proposed a machine learning method, called stacking, which allows us to draw information across different types of brain MRI. Using three large databases (n=2,131, 22-100 years old), we found stacking to make the prediction of cognitive abilities 1) closer to actual cognitive scores when applied to a new individual, not part of the modelling process, 2) reliable over times and 3) applicable to the data collected from different age groups and MRI scanners. Indeed, stacking, especially with fMRI task contrasts, allowed us to use MRI of people aged 45 to predict their childhood cognitive abilities reasonably well. Accordingly, stacking may help MRI realise its potential to predict cognitive abilities.

Here, we show that DNBs can be used for CAR-T, targeting clinically relevant cancer antigens.

Even though the cost of sequencing has dropped throughout the last decades, single-cell assays remain expensive, because they require strategies to index molecules by cells. The high costs of indexing can be mitigated by pooling samples prior to sequencing library preparation. Computational methods have been developed to leverage molecular features that are distinct between different samples to separate the pools into distinct datasets. However, since all multiplexed samples are processed in the same way, information on the origin of each demultiplexed dataset is lost. To map datasets to their sample of origin, additional information such as molecular indexing or additional genotyping is needed. Here, we propose a class of experimental designs that allows identifying the sample of origin of each demultiplexed dataset, only relying on the genetic profiles of the samples and the composition of pools. Our approach is based on splitting and pooling samples in specific combinations. We find a most cost-efficient experimental design in this class and prove its optimality. We present a dynamic programming algorithm to iteratively simplify an optimal experimental design by breaking it into several independent designs while maintaining optimality. Furthermore, we propose a subclass of experimental designs which allow robust sample identification even under partial failure of the experiment and present a provably optimal design in this subclass. We provide an implementation for automatic sample identification under these optimal combinatorial pooling strategies and demonstrate its functionality in a simulation study.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

ResultsWe developed PyEvoCell, a dashboard for trajectory interpretation and analysis that is augmented by large language model (LLM) capabilities. PyEvoCell applies the LLM to the outputs of trajectory inference methods such as Monocle3, to suggest biologically relevant lineages. Once a lineage is defined, users can conduct differential expression and functional analyses which are also interpreted by the LLM. Finally, any hypothesis or claim derived from the analysis can be validated using the veracity filter, a feature enabled by the LLM, to confirm or reject claims by providing relevant PubMed citations.

Despite much progress, little is known about how genetic architecture varies across the trait continuum and, in particular, if it differs in the tails of complex traits, where disease often occurs. Here, applying a novel approach based on polygenic scores, we reveal striking departures from polygenic architecture across 148 quantitative trait tails, consistent with distinct concentrations of high-impact rare alleles in one or both tails of most of the traits. We demonstrate replication of these results across ancestries, cohorts, repeat measures, and using an orthogonal family-based approach[2]. Furthermore, trait tails with inferred enrichment of rare alleles are associated with more exome study hits, reduced fecundity, advanced paternal age, and lower predictive accuracy of polygenic scores. Finally, we find evidence of ongoing selection consistent with the observed departures in polygenicity and demonstrate, via simulation, that traits under stabilising selection are expected to have tails enriched for rare, large-effect alleles. Overall, our findings suggest that while common variants of small effect likely account for most of the heritability in complex traits[3], rare variants of large effect are often more important in the trait tails, particularly among individuals at highest risk of disease. Our study has implications for rare variant discovery, the utility of polygenic scores, the study of selection in humans, and for the relative importance of common and rare variants to complex traits and diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Transcription of hsbAR-hptB and cfcR is RpoS-dependent and induced by stationary phase and the stringent response. A {triangleup}hsbA mutant resumed biofilm formation after dispersal in late stationary phase, stimulated liquid-air biofilm formation and increased Congo Red adsorption. All these phenotypes were traced down to increased c-di-GMP levels in stationary phase dependent on the activity of CfcR and its cognate sensor kinase, CfcA. HsbA was reversibly phosphorylated by the combined action of HptB and HsbR HsbA phosphorylation conditioned its interaction with CfcR and CfcA and the intracellular distribution of the three proteins, but did not greatly influence biofilm regulation. Our results support a model in which HsbA forms a complex with CfcR to inhibit its DGC activity regardless of its phosphorylation state. Upon HsbA dephosphorylation, this complex is recruited to the cell membrane by CfcA to strengthen the inhibitory effect. This system contributes to biofilm dispersal by denying biofilm formation, but allows quick onset of de novo biofilm formation in response to physiological cues that release HsbA inhibition to restore CfcR DGC activity.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

A subset of JIA cases manifests as Systemic JIA (sJIA), which is characterized by joint pain, fevers, rashes, and systemic inflammation. Severe pulmonary complications have not historically been associated with sJIA. Since 2010, inhibitors of interleukin-1 and interleukin 6 (IL-1i/IL-6i) are the recommended course of treatment for sJIA, yet recently studies show evidence of a severe drug hypersensitivity reaction implicating these medications in a subset of those treated. With this reaction, sJIA patients can develop severe lung disease, including pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). As this drug-associated lung disease has only recently been identified, the etiology of sJIA drug-associated PAP (sJIA-daPAP) is poorly understood. We used multiplexed ion beam imaging by time-of-flight (MIBI-TOF) to define the cellular immune infiltrate and describe pathological features of PAP in sJIA-daPAP patients. We found an enrichment of eosinophils, neutrophils, and M2 macrophages within regions of lipoproteinosis. These enriched subsets all upregulate IFN{gamma} within lipoproteinosis, a signature specific to sJIA-daPAP samples compared to non-sJIA-PAP samples. In a cellular neighborhood analysis, we identified that eosinophils, neutrophils, and M2 macrophages frequently co-localize within the same cellular microenvironment, especially in lipoproteinosis regions. Therefore, this spatial coordination may be involved in clearance or persistence of lipoproteinosis in sJIA-daPAP. This study provides a comprehensive overview of sJIA-daPAP immune pathology and suggests cellular mechanisms that drive inflammation in sJIA patients experiencing pulmonary complications associated with delayed drug hypersensitivity during IL-1i/IL-6i treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

One of the most cost-effective and scalable methods for detecting CNVs is based on normalized signal intensity values, such as Log R Ratio (LRR) and B Allele Frequency (BAF), from Illumina genotyping arrays. In this study, we present CNV-Finder, a novel pipeline integrating deep learning techniques on array data, specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, to expedite the large-scale identification of CNVs within predefined genomic regions. This facilitates the efficient prioritization of samples for subsequent, costly analyses such as short-read and long-read whole genome sequencing. We focus on five genes--Parkin (PRKN), Leucine Rich Repeat And Ig Domain Containing 2 (LINGO2), Microtubule Associated Protein Tau (MAPT), alpha-Synuclein (SNCA), and Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein (APP)--which may be relevant to neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), or related disorders such as essential tremor (ET). By training our models on expert-annotated samples and validating them across diverse cohorts, including those from the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program (GP2) and additional dementia-specific databases, we demonstrate the efficacy of CNV-Finder in accurately detecting deletions and duplications. Our pipeline outputs app-compatible files for visualization within CNV-Finder's interactive web application. This interface enables researchers to review predictions and filter displayed samples by model prediction values, LRR range, and variant count in order to explore or confirm results. Our pipeline integrates this human feedback to enhance model performance and reduce false positive rates.

However, within individual brain areas, neurons often exhibit very diverse and seemingly disorganized responses. A more careful analysis shows that these neurons can sometimes be grouped together into specialized subpopulations (categorical representations). Organization can also be found at the level of the representational geometry in the activity space, typically in the form of low-dimensional structures. It is still unclear how the geometry in the activity space and the structure of the response profiles of individual neurons are related. Here, we systematically analyzed the geometric and selectivity structure of the neural population from 40+ cortical regions in mice performing a decision-making task (IBL public Brainwide Map data set). We used a reduced-rank regression approach to quantify the selectivity profiles of single neurons and multiple measures of dimensionality to characterize the representational geometry of task variables. We then related these measures within single areas to the position of each area in the sensory-cognitive cortical hierarchy. Our findings reveal that only a few regions (in primary sensory areas) are categorical. When multiple brain areas are considered, we observe clustering that reflects the brains large-scale organization. The representational geometry of task variables also changed along the cortical hierarchy, with higher dimensionality in cognitive regions. These trends were explained by analytical computations linking the maximum dimensionality of representational geometry to the clustering of selectivity at the single neuron level. Finally, we computed the shattering dimensionality (SD), a measure of the linear separability of neural activity vectors; remarkably, the SD remained near maximal across all regions, suggesting that the observed variability in the selectivity profiles allows neural populations to maintain high computational flexibility. These results provide a new mathematical and empirical perspective on selectivity and representation geometry in the cortical neural code.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

This review investigates whether excess weight increases the risk of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with PCC. Methods: Studies published up to July 2023 were searched independently across eight electronic databases to evaluate the risk of developing neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms more than 12 weeks post-infection between exposure and controls groups (excess weight vs. normal weight; obesity vs. non-obesity). Meta-analyses were conducted under a random-effects model. Results: Of the 10,122 abstracts screened, 18 studies (n = 139,091 adults) met the inclusion criteria and reported PCC symptoms according to nutritional status. These studies included 79,050 individuals with excess weight vs 57,926 normal-weight individuals and 30,694 individuals with obesity vs 107,612 non-obese individuals. The presence of excess weight in PCC significantly increased the risk of depression (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.03-1.42), headache (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.09-1.35), memory issues (RR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.24-1.65), sleep disturbance (RR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.16-1.48), and vertigo (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.04- 1.41). Obesity significantly increased the risk of headache (RR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.34- 1.49), smell disorder (RR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.09-1.21), taste disorder (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.07-1.36), and vertigo (RR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.35-1.53). Conclusions: Excess weight or obesity increases the risk of experiencing neuro-symptoms related to PCC. Individuals with these conditions urgently need enhanced personalized care management in current post-pandemic context.","NA","medrxiv",1732659009829

DesignCohort study.

SettingElectronic health record data.

Participants2 528 916 singleton births from the UKs Clinical Practice Research Datalink (1996-2018), Norways Medical Birth Registry (2009-2020), and Swedens Medical Birth Register (2006-2020).

Main outcome measuresStillbirth, neonatal death, pre- and post-term delivery, small and large for gestational age, and low Apgar score five minutes post-delivery.

ResultsA total of 120 209 (4.8%) deliveries were exposed to maternal antidepressant use during pregnancy. Maternal antidepressant use during pregnancy was associated with increased odds of stillbirth (adjusted pooled OR (aOR) 1.16, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.28), preterm delivery (aOR 1.26, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.30), and Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.75 to 1.91). These findings persisted in the discordant sibling analysis, but with higher uncertainty. The adjusted predicted absolute risk for stillbirth was 0.34% (95% CI 0.33 to 0.35) among the unexposed and 0.40% (95% CI 0.36 to 0.44) in the antidepressant exposed. Restricting to women with depression or anxiety, the association between antidepressant exposure and stillbirth attenuated (aOR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.21). Paternal antidepressant use was modestly associated with preterm delivery and low Apgar score. Most antidepressants were associated with preterm delivery (except paroxetine) and Apgar score (except mirtazapine and amitriptyline).

ConclusionsMaternal antidepressant use during pregnancy may increase the risk of stillbirth, preterm delivery, and low Apgar score, although the absolute risks remained low. Confounding by severity of indication cannot be ruled out, as the severity of symptoms was not available. The modest association between paternal antidepressant use and both preterm delivery and low Apgar score suggests that residual confounding by familial environment cannot be ruled out.","NA","medrxiv",1732659009829

We developed a biohybrid approach to engraft optogenetically-enabled neurons on the cortical surface housed in a 2D-scaffold of circular microwells. The engrafted neurons survived, exhibited spontaneous activity, and integrated with the host brain several weeks after implantation. We then trained mice with biohybrid implants to perform an optical stimulation task and showed that they could effectively report optogenetic stimulation of their neural graft.

Using a computational approach that maximises phylogenetic diversity, we selected an optimal subset of 40 alphacoronavirus spike proteins, including the two human viruses NL63 and 229E, and characterised their host-range using broad mammalian APN and ACE2 receptor libraries. Based on this data, we were able to determine molecular genotypes that contribute to receptor tropism and identify alphacoronaviruses with broad (generalist) or restricted (specialist) receptor usage. Strikingly, we observed that generalism and specialism can vary significantly between closely related viruses. Using structural information, we identified key residues that determine the bat tropism of 229E-like viruses, as well as residues in the ACE2 receptor that likely restrict NL63 infection of certain mammals. Furthermore, we observed that the host range of certain bat alphacoronaviruses is expanded by TMPRSS2 priming of spike. All APN- and ACE2-using alphaCoVs in our study interacted with the receptor of at least one animal species within ecological proximity to humans, suggesting new routes for spillover. However, most bat alphacoronaviruses did not use any of receptors in our screen, refining our understanding of coronavirus entry. We propose a new approach to investigating receptor usage for viral orders/families/genera, which is not constrained by focused analysis of a limited number of sequences from human-tropic viruses. Understanding phenotypic traits, such as entry, at this genus-wide level can revolutionise our ability to predict zoonotic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

The capability for producing custom-shape high-quality backbones for very large proteins would further expand the scope of protein design. To this end, here we introduce the AlphaFold2 (AF2) cycler (af2cycler) design pipeline. AF2cycler is used to refine draft protein backbone geometries of arbitrary shape created by the Chroma diffusion model or other methods, using a combination of AF2 and ProteinMPNN to achieve high designability with minimal deviations from the initial target structure. In silico testing on multiple protein designs (100-1000 amino acids) demonstrated improvements in structural integrity and designability after af2cycling confirmed by enhanced ESMFold repredictions. Experimental wet lab validation through the design of a variety of test proteins with distinct shapes, each comprising 1000 amino acids, showed structural agreement between in silico predictions and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, establishing the af2cyclers efficacy in translating designs into real-world results. Af2cycler provides a convenient and reliable protein design workflow, particularly for large proteins, with potential for expanding to applications in areas such as design of higher-order protein complexes and multi-state backbone optimization.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

To control the outbreak, public health officials began vaccination campaigns using the third-generation orthopoxvirus vaccine MVA-BN. Prior to this outbreak, the durability of MPXV-specific immunity induced by MVA-BN was poorly understood. In 2022, we launched the New York City Observational Study of Mpox Immunity (NYC OSMI, NCT05654883), a longitudinal study of 171 participants comprising MVA-BN vaccinees and mpox convalescent individuals. Peripheral blood sampling was performed at intervals including prior to vaccination, after one dose, and after the second dose. MVA-BN vaccinees with and without a history of smallpox vaccination demonstrated detectable mpox virus (MPXV)-specific memory B cells at one-year post-vaccination. Additionally, MVA-BN increased MPXV neutralizing titers in smallpox vaccine-naive vaccinees, with a comparable peak titer reached in naive and smallpox vaccine-experienced vaccinees. However, neutralizing titers returned to baseline within 5-7 months for naive individuals, while remaining elevated in those with prior smallpox vaccination. Both naive and experienced individuals generated robust, immunodominant IgG responses against MPXV H3 and A35, but naive vaccinees IgG responses showed lower avidity than experienced vaccinees. These data highlight a low avidity antibody response elicited by MVA-BN that is short-lived in naive vaccinees. This work supports the need for long-term studies on protection induced by MVA-BN including the potential need for booster doses as well as the development of next-generation orthopoxvirus vaccines.","NA","medrxiv",1732659009829

Here, we characterize the mechanisms that drive the formation of these structures and their function in gene regulation in a lymphoid-to-myeloid differentiation system. Based on analyses at base-pair resolution, we demonstrate a close correlation between binding of regulatory proteins, formation of chromatin interactions, and gene expression. Integration of single-allele topologies and computational modeling shows that tissue-specific gene loci are organized into chromatin hubs, characterized by cooperative interactions between multiple enhancers, promoters, and CTCF-binding sites. Depletion of CTCF strongly impairs the formation of these structures, but has mild effects on gene expression, which can be explained by rewired enhancer-promoter interactions. This demonstrates an instructive role for enhancer-promoter interactions in gene regulation that is independent of cooperative interactions in chromatin hubs. Together, these results contribute to a mechanistic understanding of the structure-function relationship of the genome during cellular differentiation.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

We identified ten significantly associated loci, of which six were novel (SLITRK1, SYN3, IGSF11, FSHB, TCF7L2, and CDH9), and confirmed previous genome-wide significant associations with risk genes GDF15, IGFBP7, PGR, and GFRAL. In a spatiotemporal analysis of placental development, GDF15 and TCF7L2 were expressed primarily in extra villous trophoblast, and using a weighted linear model of maternal, paternal, and fetal effects, we confirmed opposing effects for GDF15 between maternal and fetal genotype. Conversely, IGFBP7 and PGR were primarily expressed in developing maternal spiral arteries during placentation, with effects limited to the maternal genome. Risk loci were found to be under significant evolutionary selection, with the strongest effects on nausea and vomiting mid-pregnancy. Selected loci were associated with abnormal pregnancy weight gain, pregnancy duration, birth weight, head circumference, and pre-eclampsia. Potential roles for candidate genes in appetite, insulin signaling, and brain plasticity provide new pathways to explore etiological mechanisms and novel therapeutic avenues.","NA","medrxiv",1732659009829

Immunopeptidomics data of cell cultures infected with the foodborne model pathogen Listeria monocytogenes were searched by four different search engines, PEAKS, Comet, Sage and MSFragger, followed by data-driven rescoring with MS2Rescore. Compared to standard single search-engine results, this integrated workflow boosted the number of identified immunopeptides on average by 27% and led to the high confident detection of 18 additional bacterial peptides (+27%) matching 15 different Listeria proteins (+36%). Despite an overall large agreement between the search engines, a small number of conflicts (< 1%) in spectra-to-peptide assignments revealed ambiguous identifications that served as a quality filter. Finally, we show compatibility of our workflow with sensitive timsTOF data acquisition and find that rescoring, now with inclusion of ion mobility features, identifies 76% more peptides compared to orbitrap-based acquisition.

However, the specific mechanisms by which viral proteins influence cholesterol remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cholesterol sequestration within lysosomes, with the viral protein ORF3a identified as the primary driver of this effect. Mechanistically, we found that ORF3a interacts directly with the HOPS complex subunit VPS39 through a hydrophobic interface formed by residues W193 and Y184. A W193A mutation in ORF3a significantly rescues cholesterol egress and corrects the mislocalization of the lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC2, which is caused by defective trafficking of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) sorting receptor, the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). We further observed a marked reduction in bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a lipid essential for lysosomal cholesterol egress, in both SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and ORF3a-expressing cells, suggesting BMP reduction as an additional mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-caused cholesterol sequestration. Inhibition of lysosomal cholesterol egress using the compound U18666A significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting a potential viral strategy of manipulating lysosomal cholesterol to modulate host cell susceptibility. Our findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a disrupts cellular cholesterol transport by altering lysosomal protein trafficking and BMP levels, providing new insights into virus-host interactions that contribute to lipid dysregulation in infected cells.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit. Based on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still undeniably demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1732659009829

Using a combination of PacBio HiFi, Oxford Nanopore and Illumina sequencing, and Hi-C long-range interaction data (using a novel Hi-C protocol presented here), we assembled two haplotypes of 574.9 Mbp (contig N50 = 10.9 Mbp, scaffold N50 = 44.0 Mbp) and 521.2 Mbp (contig N50 = 13.5 Mbp, scaffold N50 = 48.0 Mbp), with assembly BUSCO scores of 92.6% and 92.3%. We annotated 20,333 and 20,140 genes for each haplotype, covering over 90% of the complete BUSCO genes and including two copies of a gene putatively encoding the neurotoxic peptide urthionin, which could contribute to nettles characteristic sting. Despite its relatively small size, the nettle genome displays very high levels of repetitiveness, with transposable elements comprising more than 60% of the genome, as well as considerable structural variation. This genome assembly represents an important resource for the nettle community and will enable the investigation of the genetic basis of the many interesting characteristics of this species.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

To address these issues, we introduce BioLLM, a framework facilitating the integration and application of scFMs in single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis. BioLLM provides a universal interface, bridging diverse scFMs into a seamless ecosystem. By mitigating architectural disparities and coding conventions, it empowers researchers with streamlined access to scFMs. With standardized APIs and comprehensive documentation, BioLLM streamlines model switching and comparative analyses, while incorporating best practices for consistent model evaluation. Our comprehensive evaluation of scFMs revealed distinct strengths and limitations, highlighting scGPTs robust performance across all tasks, both in zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios. Geneformer and scFoundation also demonstrated strong capabilities in gene-level tasks, benefiting from effective pretraining strategies. In contrast, scBERT underperformed relative to other models, likely attributable to its considerably smaller parameter count and the limited size of the training dataset. Ultimately, BioLLM aims to empower the scientific community to leverage the full potential of foundational models, advancing our understanding of complex biological systems through enhanced single-cell analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Many neuronal types show a large depolarization baseline offset (DBLO), which is defined as the positive difference between the minimum membrane potential during action potential trains and resting. We used stochastic parameter search in experimentally constrained conductance-based models to show that four key factors together account for high DBLO: Liquid Junction Potential correction, high backpropagating passive charges during the repolarization phase of an action potential, fast potassium delayed rectifier kinetics, and appropriate transient sodium current kinetics. Several plausible mechanisms for DBLO, such as Ohmic depolarization due to current input or low-pass filtering by the membrane, fail to explain the effect, and many published conductance-based models do not correctly manifest high DBLO. Finally, physiological levels of DBLO constrain ion channel levels and kinetics, and are linked to cellular processes such as bistable firing, spikelets, and calcium influx.

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with poor cognition, but it is unclear whether supplementation would provide benefit, particularly in individuals with mild/moderate deficiencies which do not have other clinical risks. The objective of this study was to establish the impact of daily vitamin D supplementation on cognition in older adults with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency.

Methods and FindingsTwo-arm parallel 24-month randomised controlled trial, with Vitamin D supplementation compared with a placebo. This was a remote trial, completed from home involving 620 adults 50 years or older with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency and early cognitive impairment. The primary outcome was executive function measured through Trail making B and other secondary measures of cognition, function and wellbeing.

Vitamin D supplementation conferred no significant benefit to executive function compared to placebo at follow-up on the primary outcome (between-group difference: 5770, 95% CI: -2189 to 13730) or cognition, function, or wellbeing. Secondary analyses in defined subgroups and a per-protocol analysis also showed no significant impact on any outcome measures.

ConclusionsVitamin D supplementation produced no measurable improvement in cognitive outcomes in older adults with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency. The remote trial methodology provides an innovative approach to large-scale trials.

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the EXO5 gene, which encodes a DNA exonuclease involved in DNA repair previously associated with cancer susceptibility. We employed an integrated approach combining genomic and clinical data analysis, deep learning variant effect prediction, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effects of common EXO5 haplotypes on protein structure, dynamics, and cancer outcomes. We characterized the haplotype structure of EXO5 across diverse human populations, identifying five common haplotypes, and studied their impact on EXO5 protein. Our analyses revealed significant structural and dynamic differences among the EXO5 haplotypes, particularly in their catalytic region. The L151P EXO5 protein variant exhibited the most substantial conformational changes, potentially disruptive for EXO5s function and nuclear localization. Analysis of TCGA data showed that patients carrying L151P EXO5 had significantly shorter progression-free survival in prostate and pancreatic cancers, and exhibited increased genomic instability.

However, we show that organelle boundaries, which are important for defining MCS, are the least confident predictions made by AI. We outline a segmentation strategy termed AI-directed Voxel Extraction (AIVE), that combines AI predictions with image electron signals to confidently segment membrane boundaries irrespective of the AI model used. We demonstrate the precision conferred by AIVE by applying it to the quantitative analysis of organelle interactomes from multiple FIB-SEM datasets.

Devastating human conditions like cancers, neurological disorders, and infections, hijack PPI networks to initiate disease, and to drive disease progression. Understanding precisely how diseases remodel PPI networks can, therefore, help clarify disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets. Protein kinases control most cellular processes through protein phosphorylation. The 518 human kinases, known as the kinome, are frequently dysregulated in disease and highly druggable with ATP-competitive inhibitors. Kinase activity, localization, and substrate recognition are regulated by dynamic PPI networks composed of scaffolding and adapter proteins, other signaling enzymes like small GTPases and E3 ligases, and phospho-substrates. Accordingly, mapping kinase PPI networks can help determine kinome activation states, and, in turn, cellular activation states; this information can be used for studying kinase-mediated cell signaling, and for prioritizing kinases for drug discovery. Previously, we have developed a high-throughput method for kinome PPI mapping based on mass spectrometry (MS)-based chemoproteomics that we named kinobead competition and correlation analysis (kiCCA). Here, we introduce 2nd generation (gen) kiCCA which utilizes data-independent acquisition (dia) with parallel accumulation serial fragmentation (PASEF) MS and a re-designed CCA algorithm with improved selection criteria and the ability to predict multiple kinase interaction partners of the same proteins. Using neuroblastoma cell line models of the noradrenergic-mesenchymal transition (NMT), we demonstrate that 2nd gen kiCCA (1) identified 6.1-times more kinase PPIs in native cell extracts compared to our 1st gen approach, (2) determined kinase-mediated signaling pathways that underly the neuroblastoma NMT, and (3) accurately predicted pharmacological targets for manipulating NMT states. Our 2nd gen kiCCA method is broadly useful for cell signaling research and kinase drug discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

To control the infection with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron JN.1 subvariants, JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccines have been developed. Some previous reports showed that the JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccine of Pfizer/BioNTech (US/Germany) increased antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 subvariants and XEC. However, the efficacy of other available JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccines (e.g., Daiichi-Sankyo, Japan) remains unassessed. To validate the antiviral efficacy induced by JN.1 mRNA vaccines, sera were collected from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech JN.1 mRNA vaccine (N=15) or Daiichi-Sankyo JN.1 mRNA vaccine (N=19) before and 3-4 weeks after vaccination. We then performed a neutralization assay using these sera and pseudoviruses. Both Pfizer/BioNTech JN.1 vaccine (2.4-to 8.0-fold, P=0.0001) and Daiichi-Sankyo JN.1 vaccine (2.3-to 13-fold, P=0.0001) boosted antiviral humoral immunity against all variants tested with statistical significance. While the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine encodes the full-length JN.1 spike (S), the Daiichi-Sankyo mRNA vaccine encodes the receptor-binding domain of JN.1 S. Our data suggest that the receptor-binding domain of JN.1 S can effectively induce antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 subvariants and XEC comparable to the full-length JN.1 S. However, it should be considered that the sizes of our cohorts are relatively small (<20 donors per cohort), and donor characteristics, such as age, sex, underlying disease status, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, may critically affect the experimental results. Future investigations with larger cohorts will address this concern. When compared to vaccination with JN.1 mRNA vaccines, our previous investigations showed that the natural infection of JN.1 and KP.3.3 elicited poorer antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 and its subvariants. Our results suggest that the JN.1 mRNA vaccination more robustly induces antiviral humoral immunity against recent JN.1 subvariants than the natural infection of JN.1 subvariants regardless of manufacturer. Moreover, as we reported last year, the humoral immunity induced by XBB.1.5 monovalent mRNA vaccine against XBB.1.5 was weaker than that against ancestral B.1.1. However, in the case of JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccine, here we showed that the 50% neutralization titer against XBB.1.5 is greater than that against ancestral B.1.1. These observations imply that immune imprinting has shifted from that biased toward pre-Omicron to that biased toward Omicron, depending on the time and/or number of immune stimuli (e.g., infection and/or vaccination).","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Compared with 3 Tesla (3T) MRI, 7 Tesla (7T) MRI can detect more subtle injuries, including hippocampal subfield volume differences and additional standard biomarkers such as white matter lesions. 7T MRI could help with the interpretation of the various persistent post-acute and distal onset sequelae of COVID-19 infection.

ObjectiveTo investigate the differences in white matter hyperintensity (WMH), hippocampal subfields volumes, and cognition between patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and non-hospitalized participants in a multi-site/multi-national cohort.

DesignOriginal investigation of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between 5/2020 and 10/2022 in 3 USA and 1 UK medical centers with follow-up at hospital discharge.

ParticipantsA total of 179 participants without a history of dementia completed cognitive, mood and other assessments and MRI scans.

ExposureCOVID-19 severity, as measured by hospitalization vs no hospitalization

Main Outcomes and Measures7T MRI scans were acquired. All WMH and hippocampal subfield volumes were corrected for intracranial volumes to account for subject variability. Cognition was assessed using a comprehensive battery of tests. Pearson correlations and unpaired t-tests were performed to assess correlations and differences between hospitalized and non-hospitalized groups.

ResultsWe found similar WMH volume (4112 vs 3144mm3, p=0.2131), smaller hippocampal volume (11856 vs 12227mm3, p=0.0497) and lower cognitive and memory performance, especially the MoCA score (24.9 vs 26.4 pts, p=0.0084), duration completing trail making test B (97.6 vs 79.4 seconds, p=0.0285), Craft immediate recall (12.6 vs 16.4 pts, p<0.0001), Craft delay recall (12.0 vs 15.6 pts, p=0.0001), and Benson figure copy (15.2 vs 16.1 pts, p=0.0078) in 52 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (19[37%] female; mean[SD] age, 61.1[7.4] years) compared with 111 age-matched non-hospitalized participants (66[59%] female; mean[SD] age, 61.5[8.4] years).

Conclusions and RelevanceOur results indicate that hospitalized COVID-19 cases show lower hippocampal volume when compared to non-hospitalized participants. We also show that WMH and hippocampal volumes correlate with worse cognitive scores in hospitalized patients compared with non-hospitalized participants, potentially indicating recent lesions and atrophy.

Key PointsQuestion: Do white matter hyperintensity burden, hippocampal whole and subfield volumes, and cognition differ between patients hospitalized with COVID-19 versus participants without hospitalization?

Findings: We found no significant difference in white matter hyperintensity volume, but hippocampal volume was reduced, and cognitive and memory performance were worse in those hospitalized for COVID-19 compared with age-matched non-hospitalized group (either mild COVID-19 or no COVID-19 reported). In the hospitalized group, increased white matter hyperintensity and reduced hippocampal volumes are significantly higher correlated with worse cognitive and memory scores.

Meaning: Adults hospitalized for COVID-19 had lower hippocampal volumes and worse cognitive performance than adults with COVID-19 that did not lead to hospitalization or without reported COVID-19 infection.","NA","medrxiv",1732659009829

H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b exhibits tropism for the mammary gland, with milk from infected cows containing high levels of viral RNA and infectious virus. The viruss ability to infect the mammary gland suggests potential risks of transmission to offspring through breastfeeding. Here, we show that mammary gland infection with bovine H5N1 influenza in lactating ferrets transmits virus and disease to suckling kits. Viral RNA titers significantly increased in milk over time and remained high in mammary gland tissue. Suckling kits had significantly increased viral RNA in the oral and nasal cavity, as well as in feces. However, viral detection in the dam nasal cavities was delayed, with only minimal virus present in the oral cavity. Lung viral RNA levels were low in dams but high in a sampled suckling kit. Additionally, we detected the expression of the H5N1 receptor, 2,3 sialic acid, in mammary tissue from both ferrets and humans. These data demonstrate that H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b infection in lactating dams leads to mastitis-related disease and transmits to suckling pups, resulting in 100% mortality among the neonates.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Recent studies have suggested that SARS- CoV-2 infection can lead to reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), yet, the extent and impact of viral reactivation in COVID-19 and its effect on the host immune system remain incompletely understood.

Here we present a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of viral reactivation of all known chronically infecting viruses in 1,154 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study, who were followed prospectively for twelve months. We reveal significant reactivation of Herpesviridae, Enteroviridae, and Anelloviridae families during acute stage of COVID-19 (0-40 days post- hospitalization), each exhibiting distinct temporal dynamics. We also show that viral reactivation correlated with COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and clinical outcomes, including mortality. Integration of cytokine profiling, cellular immunophenotyping, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics demonstrated virus-specific host responses, including elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, CXCL10, and TNF), increased activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and upregulation of cellular replication genes, independent of COVID-19 severity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Notably, persistent Anelloviridae reactivation during convalescence ([&ge;]3 months post-hospitalization) was associated with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptoms, particularly physical function and fatigue.

Our findings highlight a remarkable prevalence and potential impact of chronic viral reactivation on host responses and clinical outcomes during acute COVID-19 and long term PASC sequelae. Our data provide novel immune, transcriptomic, and metabolomic biomarkers of viral reactivation that may inform novel approaches to prognosticate, prevent, or treat acute COVID- 19 and PASC.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Designing the kinetics and dynamics of a system requires, in addition, the design of excited states that are traversed in transitions from one low-lying state to another2,3. This is a challenging task as such states must be sufficiently strained to be poorly populated, but not so strained that they are not populated at all, and because protein design methods have generally focused on creating near-ideal structures4-7. Here we describe a general approach for designing systems which use an induced-fit power stroke8 to generate a structurally frustrated9 and strained excited state, allosterically driving protein complex dissociation. X-ray crystallography, double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy, and kinetic binding measurements demonstrate that incorporating excited states enables design of effector-induced increases in dissociation rates as high as 6000-fold. We highlight the power of this approach by designing cytokine mimics which can be dissociated within seconds from their receptors.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Representation learning methods summarize high-dimensional single-cell data into a manageable latent space in a typically nonlinear fashion, allowing cross-sample integration or generative modeling. However, these methods often produce entangled representations, limiting interpretability and downstream analyses. Existing disentanglement methods instead either require supervised information or impose sparsity and linearity, which may not capture the complexity of biological data. We, therefore, introduce Disentangled Representation Variational Inference (DRVI), an unsupervised deep generative model that learns nonlinear, disentangled representations of single-cell omics. This is achieved by combining recently introduced additive decoders with nonlinear pooling, for which we theoretically prove disentanglement under reasonable assumptions. We validate DRVIs disentanglement capabilities across diverse relevant biological problems, from development to perturbational studies and cell atlases, decomposing, for example, the Human Lung Cell Atlas into meaningful, interpretable latent dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that if applied to batch integration, DRVIs integration quality does not suffer from the disentanglement constraints and instead is on par with entangled integration methods. With its disentangled latent space, DRVI is inherently interpretable and facilitates the identification of rare cell types, provides novel insights into cellular heterogeneity beyond traditional cell types, and highlights developmental stages.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Our ""Takoyaki"" pulse sequence uses the simultaneous scanning of multiple focal points to excite contrast agents with sufficient acoustic pressure for nonlinear imaging while efficiently covering 3D space.

Although the ability of Stentor to habituate has been extensively documented, the mechanism of learning is currently not known. Here we take a bottom-up approach and investigate a simple biochemistry-based model based on prior electrophysiological measurements in Stentor along with general properties of receptor molecules. In this model, a mechanoreceptor senses the stimulus and leads to channel opening to change membrane potential, with a sufficient change in polarization triggering an action potential that drives contraction. Receptors that are activated can become internalized, after which they can either be degraded or recycled back to the cell surface. This activity-dependent internalization provides a potential means for the cell to learn. Stochastic simulations of this model confirm that it is capable of showing habituation similar to what is seen in actual Stentor cells, including the lack of dishabituation by strong stimuli and the apparently step-like response of individual cells during habituation. The model also can account for several habituation hallmarks that a previous two-state Markov model could not, namely, the dependence of habituation rate on stimulus magnitude, which had to be added onto the two state model but arises naturally in the receptor inactivation model; the rate of response recovery after cessation of stimulation; the ability of high frequency stimulus sequences to drive faster habituation that results in a lower response probability, and the potentiation of habituation by repeated rounds of training and recovery. The model makes the prediction that application of high force stimuli that do not normally habituate should drive habituation to weaker stimuli due to decrease in the receptor number, which serves as an internal hidden variable. We confirmed this prediction using two new sets of experiments involving alternation of weak and strong stimuli. Furthermore, the model predicts that training with high force stimuli delays response recovery to low force stimuli, which aligns with our new experimental data. The model also predicts subliminal accumulation, wherein continuation of training even after habituation has reached asymptotic levels should lead to delayed response recovery, which was also confirmed by new experiments. The model is unable to account for the phenomenon of rate sensitivity, in which habituation caused by higher frequency stimuli is more easily reversed leading to a frequency dependence of response recovery. Such rate sensitivity has not been reported in Stentor. Here we carried out a new set of experiments which are consistent with the models prediction of the lack of rate sensitivity. This work demonstrates how a simple model can suggest new ways to probe single-cell learning at an experimental level. Finally, we interpret the model in terms of a kernel estimator that the cell may use to guide its decisions about how to response to new stimuli as they arise based on information, or the lack thereof, from past stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Likelihood-free approaches optimize a least square objective and have gained popularity in recent years due to their scalability. However, this comes at the cost of accuracy in the ancestry estimates in more complex admixture scenarios. We present a new model-based approach, fastmixture, which adopts aspects from likelihood-free approaches for parameter initialization, followed by a mini-batch expectation-maximization procedure to model the standard likelihood. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that the model-based approaches of fastmixture and ADMIXTURE are significantly more accurate than recent and likelihood-free approaches. We further show that fastmixture runs approximately 30x faster than ADMIXTURE on both simulated and empirical data from the 1000 Genomes Project such that our model-based approach scales to much larger sample sizes than previously possible.

While intracellular Ca2+ signalling has been shown to control cell migration in multiple cell contexts, it is unknown whether it is required for DVE migration.

Using the GCaMP6f Ca2+ reporter line we performed a detailed assessment of Ca2+ dynamics between E0.5 - E5.5 using live imaging. We find that prior to implantation, Ca2+ transients are rare, but at E5.5 widespread, periodic, Ca2+ transients in extra-embryonic tissues can be observed, including in the VE and ExE. In contrast, cells of the E5.5 epiblast remain relatively quiescent but show sporadic large-scale multi-cellular waves. Inhibition of SERCA at E5.5 abolishes Ca2+ transients and leads to DVE arrest, indicative that these transients are required for axial patterning. Together these results reveal the pattern of Ca2+ handling in the early mouse embryo and a novel requirement in anterior-posterior axis formation.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

This longevity discrepancy also extends to health and aging-larger dogs show higher rates of age-related diseases. Despite this well-established phenomenon, we still know little about the biomarkers and molecular mechanisms that might underlie breed differences in aging and survival. To address this gap, we generated an epigenetic clock using DNA methylation from over 3 million CpG sites in a deeply phenotyped cohort of 864 companion dogs from the Dog Aging Project, including some dogs sampled annually for 2-3 years. We found that the largest breed size tends to have epigenomes that are, on average, 0.37 years older per chronological year compared to the smallest breed size. We also found that higher residual epigenetic age was significantly associated with increased mortality risk, with dogs experiencing a 34% higher risk of death for each year increase in residual epigenetic age. These findings not only broaden our understanding of how aging manifests within a diverse species but also highlight the significant role that demographic factors play in modulating the biological mechanisms underlying aging. Additionally, they highlight the utility of DNA methylation as both a biomarker for healthspan-extending interventions, a mortality predictor, and a mechanism for understanding inter-individual variation in aging in dogs.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Despite considerable progress in physics-based methods for peptide design and deep-learning methods for protein design, there are currently no robust approaches for de novo design of protein-binding macrocycles. Here, we introduce RFpeptides, a denoising diffusion-based pipeline for designing macrocyclic peptide binders against protein targets of interest. We test 20 or fewer designed macrocycles against each of four diverse proteins and obtain medium to high-affinity binders against all selected targets. Designs against MCL1 and MDM2 demonstrate KD between 1-10 M, and the best anti-GABARAP macrocycle binds with a KD of 6 nM and a sub-nanomolar IC50 in vitro. For one of the targets, RbtA, we obtain a high-affinity binder with KD < 10 nM despite starting from the target sequence alone due to the lack of an experimentally determined target structure. X-ray structures determined for macrocycle-bound MCL1, GABARAP, and RbtA complexes match very closely with the computational design models, with three out of the four structures demonstrating Ca RMSD of less than 1.5 [A] to the design models. In contrast to library screening approaches for which determining binding mode can be a major bottleneck, the binding modes of RFpeptides-generated macrocycles are known by design, which should greatly facilitate downstream optimization. RFpeptides thus provides a powerful framework for rapid and custom design of macrocyclic peptides for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

We functionally validated tumor reactivity of TCRs identified from the TME and the blood by co-culturing patient-derived tumor cells with TCR-engineered autologous T cells.

Barrier formation requires positioning of functional tight junctions (TJ) to the most suprabasal viable layer of the epidermis through a mechanical circuit that is driven by generation of high tension at adherens junctions. However, what allows the sensing of tension build-up at these adhesions and how this tension is balanced to match the requirements of tissue mechanical properties is unclear. Here we show that the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 is essential for the maturation of intercellular junctions into functional, continuous adhesions. Deletion of Piezo1 results in an imbalance of cell contractility and membrane tension, leading to a delay in adhesion maturation. Consequently, the requirement for Piezo1 activity can be bypassed by lowering contractility or elevating membrane tension. In vivo, Piezo1 function in adhesion integrity becomes essential only in aged mice where alterations in tissue mechanics lead to impaired TJs and barrier dysfunction. Collectively these studies reveal an essential function of Piezo1 in the timely establishment and maintenance of cell-cell junctions in the context of a mechanically tensed epidermis.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

This includes the recent circulation of H5N1 in dairy cattle herds in the USA and a rise in associated human cases. In this study, we investigated differences in tissue tropism of two HPAI H5N1 strains, the isolate A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (VN1203) isolated from a fatal human case in 2004 and the bovine isolate A/Bovine/Ohio/B24osu-342/2024 (Bov342) isolated in 2024, in C57BL/6J mice. Infection with either HPAI H5N1 isolate was uniformly lethal in mice. However, tissue tropism differed significantly: while VN1203 replication was largely restricted to the respiratory tract, Bov342 successfully replicated in the respiratory tract as well as various regions of the brain. Bov342-challenged animals exhibited clinical signs consistent with central nervous system (CNS) infection, and infectious virus was detected in brain tissue. Correspondingly, cytokine profiles in the brain differed significantly between the isolates. Notably, in addition to abundant evidence of CNS infection in Bov342-challenged mice via immunohistochemistry, sporadic intranuclear and intracytoplasmic immunoreactivity was observed in other tissues in the head, including the choroid plexus, retina, and inner ear. This study demonstrates that while both HPAI H5N1 isolates are uniformly lethal in C57BL/6J mice upon aerosol exposure, significant differences exist in tissue tropism, with Bov342 resulting in respiratory disease as well as increased neurotropism and inflammation in the brain and nasal turbinates compared to VN1203, which predominantly induces respiratory disease.

Understanding the phenotypic changes of HPAI H5N1 and associated increase in infection of mammalian hosts is critical. In this study, we investigated the tissue tropism in mice of a bovine HPAI H5N1 strain isolated in 2024 and compared it to a strain isolated from a human patient in 2004. Our findings reveal that the bovine isolate exhibits enhanced neurotropism, unlike the respiratory-restricted replication observed with the HPAI H5N1 isolate from 2004. This difference in tissue tropism, accompanied by distinct cytokine responses in the brain, underscores the potential for altered disease outcomes in other mammalian hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

The complex landscape of tRNA modification presents significant analysis challenges and to date no single approach enables the simultaneous measurement of important but disparate chemical properties of individual, mature tRNA molecules. We developed a new, integrated approach to analyze the sequence, modification, and aminoacylation state of tRNA molecules in a high throughput nanopore sequencing experiment, leveraging a chemical ligation that embeds the charged amino acid in an adapted tRNA molecule. During nanopore sequencing, the embedded amino acid generates unique distortions in ionic current and translocation speed, enabling application of machine learning approaches to classify charging status and amino acid identity. Specific applications of the method indicate it will be broadly useful for examining relationships and dependencies between tRNA sequence, modification, and aminoacylation.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Comprehensive studies are needed to assess its transmission dynamics and clinical presentation.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective observational cohort study at Kamituga General Hospital in South Kivu, DRC, between May 2 and October 9, 2024. Sociodemographic, exposure and clinical data were collected from mpox suspected cases. Cases confirmed by Xpert(R) Mpox PCR were presumed Clade Ib infections (awaiting Clade confirmation) and followed through hospitalization and on days 29 and 59 post-diagnosis to assess clinical progression and outcomes.

FindingsOf 511 included suspected cases, 431 (84%) tested PCR positive; with 205 being women (47%). Age distribution was bimodal, with 279 (65%) individuals aged 15-34 years, and 63 (15%) children under five. Most cases (59%) reported contact with a suspected or confirmed mpox case; among adults, this was primarily a spouse, colleague or sexual partner, while for children, the primary contacts were parents or siblings. Comorbidities were rare (4%), including six (1%) HIV infections. Prodromal symptoms were present in 346 (88%) patients, active skin lesions in 414 (96%), mucosal lesions in 338 (82%), and lymphadenopathy in 295 (71%). In adults, lesions were more concentrated in the genital area, with 90% of adults presenting lesions in this region. In contrast, only 39% of children had genital lesions, with lesions more frequently found elsewhere on the body. Among 427 hospitalized patients, two deaths (0{middle dot}5%) occurred. Among 315 patients with detailed hospital follow-up, complications were primarily genito-urinary (55%) or cutaneous (40%). Four of six pregnant women with recorded outcome (67%) had adverse pregnancy outcomes. Significant sequelae at days 29 and 59 were rare.

InterpretationClade Ib MPXV infections presented differently from previously reported Clade Ia and Clade IIb infections. In adults, the disease primarily affected the genito-urinary system, compatible with sexual transmission, while children mostly manifested extragenital lesions.

Here we present a systematic approach to extract and analyze interpretable features from PLMs using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). By training SAEs on embeddings from the PLM ESM-2, we identify up to 2,548 human-interpretable latent features per layer that strongly correlate with up to 143 known biological concepts such as binding sites, structural motifs, and functional domains. In contrast, examining individual neurons in ESM-2 reveals up to 46 neurons per layer with clear conceptual alignment across 15 known concepts, suggesting that PLMs represent most concepts in superposition. Beyond capturing known annotations, we show that ESM-2 learns coherent concepts that do not map onto existing annotations and propose a pipeline using language models to automatically interpret novel latent features learned by the SAEs. As practical applications, we demonstrate how these latent features can fill in missing annotations in protein databases and enable targeted steering of protein sequence generation. Our results demonstrate that PLMs encode rich, interpretable representations of protein biology and we propose a systematic framework to extract and analyze these latent features. In the process, we recover both known biology and potentially new protein motifs.

Biochemical large language models have transformed the interpretation of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, but have not yet had a comparable impact on understanding small molecule metabolism. Here, we present an approach that leverages chemical language models to discover previously uncharacterized metabolites. We introduce DeepMet, a chemical language model that learns the latent biosynthetic logic embedded within the structures of known metabolites and exploits this understanding to anticipate the existence of as-of-yet undiscovered metabolites. Prospective chemical synthesis of metabolites predicted to exist by DeepMet directs their targeted discovery. Integrating DeepMet with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data enables automated metabolite discovery within complex tissues.

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009829

Here, we found that both KP.3.1.1 and XEC maintained the high ACE2-Spike binding affinity and pseudovirus infectivity of KP.3. Importantly, compared to KP.3, KP.3.1.1, and especially XEC, could further evade the neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma, even those elicited by KP.2-like breakthrough infections. Interestingly, both variants demonstrated increased resistance against monoclonal neutralizing antibodies targeting various epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD).

However, most scientists dont have access to experts from multiple fields. Fortunately, large language models (LLMs) have recently shown an impressive ability to aid researchers across diverse domains by answering scientific questions. Here, we expand the capabilities of LLMs for science by introducing the Virtual Lab, an AI-human research collaboration to perform sophisticated, interdisciplinary science research. The Virtual Lab consists of an LLM principal investigator agent guiding a team of LLM agents with different scientific backgrounds (e.g., a chemist agent, a computer scientist agent, a critic agent), with a human researcher providing high-level feedback. We design the Virtual Lab to conduct scientific research through a series of team meetings, where all the agents discuss a scientific agenda, and individual meetings, where an agent accomplishes a specific task. We demonstrate the power of the Virtual Lab by applying it to design nanobody binders to recent variants of SARS-CoV-2, which is a challenging, open-ended research problem that requires reasoning across diverse fields from biology to computer science. The Virtual Lab creates a novel computational nanobody design pipeline that incorporates ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta and designs 92 new nanobodies. Experimental validation of those designs reveals a range of functional nanobodies with promising binding profiles across SARS-CoV-2 variants. In particular, two new nanobodies exhibit improved binding to the recent JN.1 or KP.3 variants of SARS-CoV-2 while maintaining strong binding to the ancestral viral spike protein, suggesting exciting candidates for further investigation.

However, null space theory makes the counter-intuitive prediction that neurons often generate spikes not to cause behavior, but to prevent the effects that other neurons would have on behavior. What is missing is a direct way to test this theory in the brain. Here, we found that in the marmoset cerebellum, spike-triggered averaging identified a potent vector unique to each Purkinje cell (P-cell) along which the spikes of that cell displaced the eyes. Yet, the P-cells were active not just for saccades along their potent vector, but for all saccades. Simultaneous recordings revealed that two spikes in two different P-cells produced superposition of their potent vectors. The result was a population activity in which the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. But why was one neuron producing spikes that would be canceled by another neuron? To answer this question, we recorded from the mossy fiber inputs and the interneurons in the molecular layer. We found that the mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands as well as the sensory goal of the movement, then the interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P-cells as a population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped. Because this output had faster dynamics than was present in the individual neurons, the cerebellum placed the cells in subtractive competition with each other such that the downstream effects of spiking in one neuron were partially or completely eliminated because of the spiking in another neuron.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009830

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US. It remains unclear, however, how medical and societal changes during this period affected national chronic pain prevalence, a key dimension of population health.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic and explore reasons driving the trends

MethodsWe use data from the 2019, 2021, and 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a multi-wave cross-sectional survey.

Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP also increased from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019, to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023, after a decline to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021. The 2023 increases occurred in all examined body sites except for dental pain. COVID and long COVID had a modest role in the population-wide pain increases, the causes of which remain unclear.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before the pandemic but surged dramatically since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1732659009830

COVID-19 vaccines that are more closely matched to circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages elicit more potent and relevant immune responses that translate to improved real-world vaccine effectiveness. The rise in prevalence of the Omicron JN.1 lineage, and subsequent derivative sublineages such as KP.2 and KP.3, coincided with reduced neutralizing activity and effectiveness of Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted vaccines. Here, we characterized the biophysical and immunologic attributes of BNT162b2 JN.1- and KP.2-adapted mRNA vaccine-encoded spike (S) protein immunogens. Biophysical interrogations of S revealed the structural consequences of hallmark amino acid substitutions and a potential molecular mechanism of immune escape employed by JN.1 and KP.2. The vaccine candidates were evaluated for their immunogenicity when administered as fourth or fifth doses in BNT162b2-experienced mice or as a primary series in naive mice. In both vaccine-experienced and naive settings, JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccines conferred improved neutralizing responses over the BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 vaccine against a broad panel of emerging JN.1 sublineages, including the predominant KP.3.1.1 and emerging XEC lineages. Antigenic mapping of neutralizing responses indicated greater antigenic overlap of JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccine responses with currently circulating sublineages compared to an XBB.1.5-adapted vaccine. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were generally conserved across all three vaccines. Together, the data support the selection of JN.1- or KP.2-adapted vaccines for the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine formula.

ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARYThe Omicron JN.1- and KP.2-adapted BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines encoding prefusion S proteins elicit similar preclinical neutralizing antibody responses against circulating JN.1 sublineage pseudoviruses that are more potent than those elicited by past iterations of BNT162b2 licensed vaccines, thus demonstrating the importance of annual strain changes to the COVID-19 vaccine.","NA","biorxiv",1732659009830
