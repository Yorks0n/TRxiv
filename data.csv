Here, we identify a group of LTR retrotransposons that infect the germline from somatic cells within the Drosophila ovary, despite lacking the fusogenic Envelope protein typically required for retroviral entry. Instead, these elements encode a short transmembrane protein, sORF2, with structural features reminiscent of viral cell-cell fusogens. Through genetics, imaging, and electron microscopy, we show that sORF2 localizes to invasive somatic protrusions, enabling the direct transfer of retrotransposon capsids into the oocyte. Remarkably, sORF2-like proteins are widespread among insect retrotransposons and also occur in piscine nackednaviruses and avian picornaviruses. These findings reveal a noncanonical, Envelope-independent transmission mechanism shared by retrotransposons and non-enveloped viruses, offering important insights into host-pathogen evolution and soma-germline interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403223

In this study, we demonstrate that precise, sensitive, and specific antibody design can be achieved without prior antibody information across six distinct target proteins. For each target, binders were identified from a yeast display scFv library of approximately 106 sequences, constructed by combining 102 designed light chain sequences with 104 designed heavy chain sequences. Binders with varying binding strengths were identified for all six targets, including a case where no experimentally resolved target protein structure was available, demonstrating the highest level of precision compared to previous de novo antibody design reports. For one of the targets, antibodies produced in the IgG format exhibited affinity, activity, and developability, comparable to a commercial antibody, highlighting the sensitivity of the design method. Furthermore, binders capable of distinguishing closely related protein subtypes or mutants were identified, demonstrating that the method can achieve high molecular specificity. These findings underscore the effectiveness of precision molecular design based on atomic-accuracy structure prediction. This study establishes computational antibody design as a viable approach for generating therapeutic molecules with tailored properties, with promising potential for achieving the efficacy and safety required for successful therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403223

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1742249403223

Many recent studies have quantified their adverse events with a focus on gastrointestinal adverse events. However, no large epidemiologic study has investigated the risk of hair loss with these medications. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of hair loss. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone. The adjusted hazard ratio for hair loss for all patients using semaglutide, for men, and for women compared to bupropion-naltrexone were 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.86-2.69), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.05-14.49), and 2.08 (95% CI: 1.17-3.72) respectively. Our results demonstrate an increased risk of hair loss with semaglutide in women.

ObjectiveThis retrospective cohort study compares the overall spending, rates of return visits, laboratory tests, and imaging procedures within 30 days for Medicare fee-for-service patients who underwent in-person and telehealth evaluations between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022.

DesignA large-scale retrospective cohort study using propensity score matching

SettingPatients with no prior visits and 30-day episodes of care initiated by telehealth or in-person visits from July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022.

ParticipantsThis study included 100% of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who are aged >65 years while excluding those with Medicare Advantage coverage and those without continuous Medicare Parts A and B.

Exposure(s)Comparison of index visits initiated by telehealth versus in-person visits.

Primary outcomeAdjusted 30-day total spending.

Secondary outcomes30-day rates of return visits, laboratory tests, and imaging.

ResultsThe study included 30,079,958 participants with 36,709,528 and 429,891,125 episodes initiated by telehealth and in-person visits, respectively. The mean age was 76 for telehealth and 75 years for in-person. Telehealth-initiated visits were associated with lower 30-day spending ($260 vs. $342; net: -$82), though return visit rates were higher for telehealth (16.1% vs. 14.1%). Both lab test rates (7.8% vs. 24.2%) and imaging rates (3.5% vs 7.8%) were lower for telehealth-initiated care episodes compared to in-person-initiated care episodes.

Conclusions and RelevanceTelehealth-initiated episodes of care were associated with lower 30-day Medicare spending and reduced utilization of labs and imaging. These findings suggest that telehealth, when used as a substitute for office visits, may reduce overall Medicare spending.","NA","medrxiv",1742249403223

While the transport of phospholipids synthesized at the inner membrane (IM) to the outer membrane (OM) is critical for maintaining OM integrity and functionality, the molecular mechanisms governing this process remain incompletely understood. Members of the AsmA-like protein family in E. coli have been implicated in lipid transfer to the OM, with the three largest proteins--TamB, YhdP, and YdbH--proposed as redundant lipid transporters. Of these, TamB associates with the outer membrane protein TamA to form the Translocation and Assembly Module (TAM), a complex also implicated in outer membrane protein assembly. Here, we use a combination of structural modelling, coarse grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the lipid transfer ability of TAM and other members of the AsmA-like family. We show that lipids spontaneously enter from the IM and diffuse upwards through the large periplasmic spanning groove of TamB. Lipid dissociation at the OM is impeded when TamA is in complex with TamB but occurs spontaneously in structures of TamB alone. Finally, we also demonstrate that all six members of the AsmA family in E. coli can accommodate lipids within their hydrophobic grooves.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403223

Plants have evolved a complex set of cell-cycle genes with unique features. The high number of cyclin-CDK pairs in flowering plants complicates functional studies due to redundancy and diversification. It is critical to study simple systems in other plant lineages to better understand the functional integration of the cell-cycle control machinery and its evolution across land plants.

Through a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, we show that non-seed plants possess a simple repertoire of cyclin and CDK proteins, suggesting that the observed complexity in seed plants is a derived trait. The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha possess a streamlined set of core cell cycle genes with minimal redundancy during vegetative development. Using single-cell RNA-seq and fluorescent reporters, we found a precise, phase-specific pattern of expression for cell cycle genes. We demonstrated in vivo that only three cyclins are active, one at a given phase, without redundancy. Functional analyses revealed that MpCYCD;1 promotes cell cycle re-entry and disrupts differentiation, while overexpression of MpCYCA or MpCYCB;1 arrests the cell cycle, consistent with their respective roles at G1, S, and G2/M progression.

Our findings highlight the functional conservation of mechanisms for cell-cycle control across eukaryotes and provide insights into its ancestral state, revealing a minimal set of functional components required for multicellular development. This study advances our understanding of fundamental aspects of cell-cycle regulation and opens new possibilities for engineering plant growth.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403223

To clarify how human MRN binds generic and telomeric DNA ends and can separate DNA end sensing from nuclease activities, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of human MRN bound to DNA and to DNA and the telomere protection factor TRF2. MRN senses DSBs through a tight clamp-like sensing state with closed coiled-coil domains, but auto-inhibited MRE11 nuclease. NBS1 wraps around the MRE11 dimer, with NBS1's ATM recruitment motif sequestered by binding to the regulatory RAD50 S site, necessitating an allosteric switch underlying ATM activation. At telomeric DNA, TRF2 blocks the second S site via the iDDR motif to prevent nuclease and ATM activation. Our results provide a structural framework for topological DNA sensing and separation of sensing, signaling and processing activities of mammalian MRN.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403223

Here, we produced chromosome-scale genome assemblies of egg-laying shark species and comparatively investigated genome sequences and transcriptome profiles across diverse cartilaginous fishes. Sex chromosome identification, supported by cytogenetic experiments, elucidated the homology of X chromosomes between sharks and rays as well as an extensively degenerating Y chromosome harboring no male-specific genes. These sex chromosomes scarcely included orthologs of previously documented sex determining genes. Transcriptomic analyses combined with histology of embryonic gonads revealed female-biased expressions of X-linked genes including those implicated in TGF-{beta} and IGF signaling pathways, which are attributed to their incomplete dosage compensation.

In 2023, external funding accounted for 21% of total TB expenditures, with the U.S. contributing over 55% of these funds. The withdrawal of U.S. support threatens essential TB services, including diagnostics, treatment, TB-HIV co-infection interventions, and research initiatives critical to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for TB eradication.

MethodsThis study analyses the dependency of 26 high-burden TB countries (HBCs) on U.S. funding and models the potential impact of funding cuts on TB incidence and mortality. Countries were classified into low (0-22%), moderate (23-37%), and high (>37%) dependency groups based on three-year expenditure data. A deterministic compartmental model simulated service disruptions under three recovery scenarios: (1) minimal impact (services recover within three months), (2) moderate impact (recovery within one year), and (3) worst-case scenario (permanent service reduction). Extrapolations were made for all 26 HBCs based on representative countries from each dependency category.

FindingsFunding cuts are projected to result in substantial increases in TB cases and deaths across the three scenarios. In a high-dependency country, cumulative TB cases could rise by 2.1% (CI 1.5 - 2.5), 5.4% (CI4 - 6.5), or 36% (CI 25 - 47), and TB deaths by 2.9%(CI 2.2 - 3.5), 7.8%(CI 5.9 - 9.2), 68%(CI 45 - 86), depending on the severity of service disruptions. Across all 26 HBCs, additional TB cases are estimated at 0.63 million (CI 0.45 - 0.81) (minimal impact), 1.66 million (CI 1.2 - 2.1) (moderate impact), and 10.67 million (CI 7.85 - 13.19) (worst-case). Corresponding TB deaths are projected to increase by 99,800 (CI 65,200-130,000), 268,600 (CI 185,800-337,900), and 2,243,700 (CI 1,570,800-2,807,300), respectively. The findings underscore the catastrophic consequences of the funding cut, particularly in countries highly reliant on U.S. support.

InterpretationThe loss of U.S. funding endangers global TB control, jeopardizing End TB and SDG targets. While some nations may adapt, short-term disruptions will severely impact vulnerable populations. Urgent alternative funding is needed to sustain TB prevention and treatment efforts and mitigate the effects of aid withdrawal.

Current cell segmentation methods are prone to over- and under-segmentation, misassign transcripts to cells, require manual intervention, and suffer from low sensitivity and scalability. We introduce segger, a versatile graph neural network based on a heterogeneous graph representation of individual transcripts and cells, that frames cell segmentation as a transcript-to-cell link prediction task and can leverage single-cell RNA-seq information to improve transcript assignments. On multiple Xenium dataset benchmarks, segger exhibits superior sensitivity and specificity, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute time than existing methods.

Oxygen has been shown to be produced and consumed in dark and anoxic environments, as evidenced by its prevalence in deep-sea surface sediments. However, the microbial communities and pathways driving deep-sea dark oxygen production (DOP) remain poorly understood. Here we identify a novel DOP pathway driven by dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) in two deep-sea Deferribacterota strains. The DOP activity of these Deferribacterota strains potentially promotes the formation of manganese nodules and influences the growth and metabolism of both aerobic and anaerobic microbes, underscoring the significant role of microbial DOP in shaping deep-sea geological and ecological systems. We also cultured several deep-sea DOP-capable microorganisms from the Campylobacterota, Deinococcota, and Pseudomonadota phyla, which generate dark oxygen through unidentified nitrate-driven pathways. Combined with previous geological evidence, our results suggest that nitrate-driven dark oxygen, alongside photosynthetic oxygen, jointly contributed to early Earths oxygenation, driving the Great Oxidation Event. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into deep-sea oxygen sources, shed light on the origins of early Earths oxygen, and expand perspectives on the potential for terraforming other planets.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

Our prior works show that shortening the S1/S2 loop by deleting either the FCS ({Delta}PRRA) or deleting an upstream sequence ({Delta}QTQTN), ablates spike processing, alters host protease usage, and attenuates infection in vitro and in vivo. With the importance of the loop length established, here we evaluated the impact of disrupting the FCS, but preserving the S1/S2 loop length. Using reverse genetics, we generated a SARS-CoV-2 mutant that disrupts the FCS (PQQAR) but maintains its extended S1/S2 loop. The SARS-CoV-2 PQQAR mutant has reduced replication, decreased spike processing, and attenuated disease in vivo compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2. These data, similar to the FCS deletion mutant, indicate that loss of the furin cleavage site attenuates SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Importantly, we subsequently found that the PQQAR mutant is transmitted in the direct contact hamster model despite lacking an intact FCS. However, competition transmission showed that the mutant was attenuated compared to WT SARS-CoV-2. Together, the data argue that the FCS is required for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis but is not strictly required for viral transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

We established that both 1 and 10m polystyrene (PS) particles penetrated the intestinal epithelium after oral administration and could be detected in blood and liver of mice after ten days of oral administration. Using intravital microscopy we captured the in vivo phagocytosis of 1m PS by mouse neutrophils in the liver.

Here, we demonstrate that the hippocampus supports rapid generalization in mice by generating disentangled memory representations, where different aspects of experience are encoded independently. This code enabled the transfer of prior knowledge to solve new tasks. We identify specific circuit mechanisms underlying this rapid generalization. We show that the seemingly random changes in individual neuronal activity over time and across environments result from structured circuit-level processes, governed by the dynamics of local inhibition and cross-regional cell assemblies, respectively.

In spite of this overwhelming disease prevalence and staggering cost, its severe impact on patients lives and intense global research efforts, study of the disease has proved challenging due to its complexity. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified only four loci potentially associated with the disease, although these results did not statistically replicate between studies. A previous combinatorial analysis study identified a total of 73 genes that were highly associated with two long COVID cohorts in the predominantly (>91%) white European ancestry Sano GOLD population, and we sought to reproduce these findings in the independent and ancestrally more diverse All of Us (AoU) population.

MethodsWe assessed the reproducibility of the 5,343 long COVID disease signatures from the original study in the AoU population. Because the very small population sizes provide very limited power to replicate findings, we initially tested whether we observed a statistically significant enrichment of the Sano GOLD disease signatures that are also positively correlated with long COVID in the AoU cohort after controlling for population substructure.

ResultsFor the Sano GOLD disease signatures that have a case frequency greater than 5% in AoU, we consistently observed a significant enrichment (77% - 83%, p < 0.01) of signatures that are also positively associated with long COVID in the AoU cohort. These encompassed 92% of the genes identified in the original study. At least five of the disease signatures found in Sano GOLD were also shown to be individually significantly associated with increased long COVID prevalence in the AoU population. Rates of signature reproducibility are strongest among self-identified white patients, but we also observe significant enrichment of reproducing disease associations in self-identified black/African-American and Hispanic/Latino cohorts. Signatures associated with 11 out of the 13 drug repurposing candidates identified in the original Sano GOLD study were reproduced in this study.

ConclusionThese results demonstrate the reproducibility of long COVID disease signal found by combinatorial analysis, broadly validating the results of the original analysis. They provide compelling evidence for a much broader array of genetic associations with long COVID than previously identified through traditional GWAS studies. This strongly supports the hypothesis that genetic factors play a critical role in determining an individuals susceptibility to long COVID following recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. It also lends weight to the drug repurposing candidates identified in the original analysis. Together these results may help to stimulate much needed new precision medicine approaches to more effectively diagnose and treat the disease.

This is also the first reproduction of long COVID genetic associations across multiple populations with substantially different ancestry distributions. Given the high reproducibility rate across diverse populations, these findings may have broader clinical application and promote better health equity. We hope that this will provide confidence to explore some of these mechanisms and drug targets and help advance research into novel ways to diagnose the disease and accelerate the discovery and selection of better therapeutic options, both in the form of newly discovered drugs and/or the immediate prioritization of coordinated investigations into the efficacy of repurposed drug candidates.","NA","medrxiv",1742249403224

Whether the level, structure, and content of ripple-nested activity are consistent across consecutive events or are tuned in each event remains unclear. By profiling individual ripples using laminar currents in the mouse hippocampus during sleep/rest, we identified Radsink and LMsink ripples featuring current sinks in stratum radiatum versus stratum lacunosum-moleculare, respectively. These two ripple profiles recruit neurons differently. Radsink ripples integrate recent motifs of waking coactivity, combining superficial and deep CA1 principal cells into denser, higher-dimensional patterns that undergo hour-long stable reactivation. In contrast, LMsink ripples contain core motifs of prior coactivity, engaging deep cells into sparser, lower-dimensional patterns that undergo a reactivation drift, gradually updating their pre-structured content for recent wakefulness. We propose that ripple-by-ripple diversity instantiates parallel reactivation channels for stable integration of recent wakefulness and flexible updating of prior internal representations.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

While COVID-19 exacerbated the decline in routine vaccination through disruption of healthcare services and the diversion of resources, factors including vaccine hesitancy, socioeconomic disparities and vaccine policy also contribute to changes in vaccination behavior. Understanding the factors that influence vaccination choice is necessary to develop effective public health policy.

MethodsWe collect county-level MMR vaccination rates for kindergarten children from 2017 - 2024 for 2,266 U.S. counties, evaluate coverage patterns and trends before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and implement multivariable weighted logistic regression models to identify factors associated with low and declining MMR vaccination rates in U.S. counties.

FindingsWe reveal a nationwide decline in MMR rates following the COVID-19 pandemic, with declines observed in 1,688 of the counties evaluated. We find state-level non-medical exemption (NME) policies to be strongly associated with low and declining MMR rates. We identify a positive association in vaccination rates across vaccine types. We find higher MMR rates are positively associated with Republican-aligned counties and declines in MMR rates to be positively associated with COVID-19 death rates.

InterpretationThe significant association between NMEs and low and declining MMR rates suggest these state level policies are harmful and reduce vaccination coverage. The positive associations among vaccine types suggest spillover effects in vaccine seeking behavior. The association between MMR rates and Republican-aligned counties contrast COVID-19 vaccination patterns, highlighting the complex nature of political polarization on vaccine-related behavior, while the association between MMR declines and COVID-19 death rate reveals an additional burden posed by the pandemic.

MethodsWe used nationwide data from Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, using 28- and 180-days risk periods following BNT162b2 vaccination or a positive test for SARS-Cov-2 infection. Individuals aged 5-19 years during the study period (1st January 2021-31st December 2022) were included. We used a common data model, using individual level data linked from nation-wide registers and a shared analysis script to harmonize data and analysis. Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) comparing outcome rates in risk windows to unvaccinated or uninfected follow-up rates. This was supplemented with self-controlled case series analyses. Results from different countries were analyzed jointly in a meta-analysis.

ResultsWe observed no clear association between BNT162b2 vaccination and new-onset AH, GBS or T1D.

Nuclear RNAs (nucRNAs) have been proposed to be important regulators of such changes; however, the type, abundance, and functions of nucRNAs during neurodifferentiation remain largely unexplored. Here, we integrate multi-omic data generated in the frame of the Functional ANnoTation Of the Mammalian genome (FANTOM6) to chart 3D genome, RNA-DNA contactome, and transcriptome changes during in vitro differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells to neural stem cells and neurons. We find that most RNA-DNA contacts form between transcripts and their source gene; however, a group of intronic RNAs engages in chromatin contacts with distal loci on the same or on different chromosomes. We detect such trans-contacting intronic RNAs (TIRs) in all cell types profiled by FANTOM6, but most prominently in neurons, where TIRs are produced from highly expressed, neuron-specific, long (mean length: 400 kilobases, kb) protein-coding genes. In neurons, TIRs accumulate in the nucleus forming large clouds around their source loci, and they occasionally spread across the nucleus. TIRs engage in local and distal contacts with a set of genomic regions (named TIR-contacted regions or TIRCs) carrying much shorter (mean length: 30 kb) neuron-specific genes that become upregulated and move towards the nuclear center during neurodifferentiation, forming high-connectivity hubs. TIR source genes, and especially their introns, are strongly enriched in risk loci for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Notably, knockdown of a single TIR by antisense oligonucleotides leads to downregulation of multiple genes implicated in NDDs and of source genes of most other TIRs. We propose that TIRs orchestrate cell type-specific gene expression during neurodifferentiation and might be pathogenically linked to NDDs.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

We identified core regulators of cell identity and developed sequence-based models that revealed conserved regulatory codes. By predicting chromatin accessibility across 240 mammalian species, we reconstructed the evolutionary histories of human cis-regulatory elements, identifying sets associated with positive selection and gene expression changes, including the recent gain of THRB expression in cerebellar progenitor cells.

In schizophrenia, the normally observed suppression of second response to two paired sounds is drastically reduced. Apart from sensitivity to critical schizophrenia players as NMDA and dopamine, the microcircuitry behind gating remains unknown. We found that the first sound excitatory response recruits, via NMDA receptors, local inhibition to gate the second response via GABAB receptors. Optogenetic inhibition of somatostatine-interneurons counteracted gating more effectively compared to parvalbumine-positive interneurons. Dopamine local blockade also counteracted gating, and dopamine effect was prevented by somatostatine-, but not parvalbumine-, optoactivation. Thus, prefrontal gating is mediated by NMDA-dependent recruitment of dendrite-targeting, somatostatine-interneurons, facilitated by dopamine. The results identify a critical synapse to better target psychose-prone disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

RNAhub is a freely available user-friendly web server for a reliable generation of RNA multiple sequence alignments and the detection of the presence of structural RNA utilizing evolutionary information. This web-based tool, developed by the integration of existing computational approaches, takes an RNA sequence as input and automatically retrieves and aligns sequences homologous to the input (query) RNA sequence through an iterative and structure-agnostic approach. Based on the alignment, this tool statistically assesses whether the query RNA sequence has a conserved RNA structure using covariation analysis. The web server allows the user to efficiently search the sequence of interest against carefully curated, ready-to-use genomic databases to produce a multiple sequence alignment. Using this alignment, our tool either detects the presence of a conserved structural RNA, finds evidence against the presence of a conserved structure, or cannot make any assessment due to a lack of sequence diversity in the alignment.

However, preparing inputs for the locally installed software is not always straightforward, and the results of local runs are not always presented in an ideally accessible fashion. Furthermore, it is not yet clear whether the latest tools perform equivalently for all types of target. Results: ABCFold facilitates the use of AlphaFold 3, Boltz-1, and Chai-1 with a standardised input to predict atomic structures, with Boltz-1 and Chai-1 being installed on runtime (if required). MSAs can be generated internally using either the JackHMMER MSA search within AlphaFold 3, or with the MMseqs2 API. Alternatively, users can provide their own custom MSAs. This therefore allows AlphaFold 3 to be installed and run without downloading the large databases needed for JackHMMER. There are also straightforward options to use templates, including custom templates. Results from all packages are treated in a unified fashion, enabling easy comparison of results from different methods. A variety of visualisation options are available which include information on steric clashes. Availability and implementation: ABCFold is coded in Python and JavaScript.

However, traditional fish models, such as zebrafish, regenerate only dermal fin rays, which are neither homologous to limbs nor as cellularly complex. To address this, we employed a multi-omics approach leveraging the regenerative capacity of Polypterus senegalus, a fish species capable of full fin regeneration. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing revealed extensive erythrocyte and myeloid cell infiltration during Polypterus fin regeneration. Spatial transcriptomics identified key cellular contributors to the blastema, while cross-species comparisons with axolotl limbs uncovered both common and divergent expression patterns of wound epidermis and blastema markers. Fin amputation triggered a conserved injury response, including sequential activation of pro- and anti-inflammatory programs and DNA damage repair in cycling cells. Hypoxia responses involved hif1a modulation, consistent with other regenerative models, but uniquely included the expression of hif4a in erythrocytes and the upregulation of a myoglobin gene in the wound epidermis. Furthermore, genome-wide chromatin profiling identified candidate regeneration-responsive elements. Together, these findings establish Polypterus as a powerful comparative model for identifying shared and derived mechanisms of limb and fin regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

While deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have demonstrated hierarchical feature extraction similar to biological systems (DiCarlo and Cox, 2007; Yamins and DiCarlo, 2016), recent findings reveal a growing discrepancy: DCNNs with higher object categorization accuracy paradoxically show worse performance at predicting neural responses (Xu and Vaziri-Pashkam, 2021; Linsley et al., 2023). Using a large-scale human electroencephalography (EEG) dataset (n=10, 82,160 trials), we investigate whether this discrepancy arises because human neural EEG signals predominantly reflect scene segmentation processes rather than high-level, category-specific object representations. We trained DCNNs to perform object recognition using visual diets (~1 million training images across 292 object categories) with systematically varying scene segmentation demands: objects-only (pre-segmented), background-silhouette (explicit boundaries), original/background-only images (requiring full segmentation). Despite substantial differences in categorization accuracy (27-53%), all trained models showed remarkably uniform encoding performance, with peak correlations with neural data at ~0.1s post-stimulus. Layer-wise analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between categorization accuracy and encoding performance, with earlier network layers better predicting EEG responses than deeper layers specialized for object categorization. This dissociation suggests that EEG signals primarily reflect fundamental scene parsing mechanisms rather than object-specific representations, explaining the growing discrepancy between DCNNs increasing categorization performance but deteriorating neural prediction performance.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

In this study we examined whether these formulations resulted in significant differences in gastruloid development. Our results reveal that while both media enable the standard gastruloid elongation, HM-N2B27 results in gastruloids that start the elongation process earlier, have higher number of cells and an increased anterior domain. RNAseq analysis showed significant differences in cell fate specification, with HM-N2B27 gastruloids exhibiting higher expression of spinal cord-related genes, while NDiff227 favours mesodermal differentiation. Furthermore, differential gene enrichment analysis suggests that changes in key signalling pathways underline the differences between HM-N2B27 and NDiff227 gastruloids.

In this study, we developed an aptamer (Apt343) that targets IF3N with the goal of elucidating its contribution to translation initiation. Rapid kinetics assays revealed that Apt343 reduces the rate of IF3 association with the 30S ribosomal subunit by 13-fold, while inducing a pronounced rearrangement of both IF3 domains on the 30S. These changes compromise IF2-, mRNA-, and fMet-tRNAfMet-dependent movements of IF3, delaying 30S initiation complex (30S IC) formation by up to two orders of magnitude. Cryo-EM analysis suggests that Apt343 may sterically clash with fMet-tRNAfMet, thereby perturbing the canonical pathway by which the initiator tRNA is accommodated after IF2-dependent recruitment and prior to start codon decoding. However, once the 30S IC is formed, blocking IF3N does not prevent 50S subunit joining or 70S IC assembly. Collectively, these findings support a role for IF3N in enhancing an efficient path for fMet-tRNAfMet accommodation towards the 30S IC and promoting IF3C displacement to unlock 50S recruitment. Moreover, this aptamer-based strategy offers a valuable tool for dissecting domain-specific activities of multidomain factors within complex environments such as the initiating ribosome.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

For example, Directed Methylation with Long-read sequencing (DiMeLo-seq) enables mapping of protein-DNA interactions along long, single chromatin fibers, including in highly repetitive genomic regions. However, DiMeLo-seq involves lossy centrifugation-based wash steps that limit its applicability to many sample types.

This protocol enables the interrogation of genome-wide protein binding with as few as 100,000 cells and without the requirement of a nuclear envelope, enabling confident measurement of protein-DNA interactions during mitosis. Using this protocol, we detected strong binding of CTCF to mitotic chromosomes in diploid human cells, in contrast with earlier studies in karyotypically unstable cancer cell lines, suggesting that CTCF ""bookmarks"" specific sites critical for maintaining genome architecture across cell divisions.

This uncertainty poses a difficult challenge for adaptive decision making, as failing to preserve relevant information can prevent us from making good choices later on. One solution to this challenge is to store detailed memories of individual experiences that can be flexibly accessed whenever their details become relevant. By allowing us to store and recall specific events in vivid detail, the human episodic memory system provides exactly this capacity. Yet whether and how this ability supports adaptive behavior is poorly understood. Here we aimed to determine whether people use detailed episodic memories to make decisions when future task demands are uncertain. We hypothesized that the episodic memory systems ability to store events in great detail allows us to reference any of these details if they later become relevant. We tested this hypothesis using a novel decision making task where participants encoded individual events with multiple features and later made decisions based on these features to maximize their earnings. Across four experiments (total n = 472), we found that participants referenced episodic memories during decisions in feature-rich environments, and that they did so specifically when it was unclear at encoding which features would be needed in the future. Overall, these findings reveal a fundamental adaptive function of episodic memory, showing how its rich representational capacity enables flexible decision making under uncertainty.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

In mice, as in other mammals, color vision originates in the retina, where photoreceptor signals are processed by neural circuits. However, retinal responses to stimuli involving multiple colors are still not well understood. One possible explanation of this knowledge gap is that previous studies have not thoroughly examined how neuronal activity adapts to a 30 seconds to a few minutes timescale when exposed to multiple color sources. To address this, we systematically varied the UV-to-green light balance with a custom-built stimulator targeting mice opsins spectra while recording retinal ganglion cell responses in the ventral retina using multielectrode arrays. Responses to full-field chirp and checkerboard stimulations with alternating UV and green light revealed that more than one order of magnitude of intensity difference favoring green M- opsin over UV S-opsin is needed for a balanced reliability in retinal ganglion cell responses. An incorrect balance, with slightly increased UV light, silenced responses to green illumination. To determine if these values are consistent with natural conditions, we analyzed isomerisation rates in the mouse retina across different times of the day. We found that the M- to S-opsin activation ratio remains constant through the mesopic-photopic range, and our empirically determined values align well with these natural conditions, lying far from a simple equalization of M- and S-opsin isomerisation rates. In conclusion, a finely tuned color intensity balance is essential for accurately measuring both fast temporal responses and detailed spatial receptive fields.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

Evidence that floral hotspots are an important point of contagion is building, but few models currently allow us to characterise these novel plant-pathogen-pollinator systems where horizontal infections occur from concentrated, short-lived sites of contagion. Infection success is going to depend heavily upon the behaviour of individual pollinators, alongside the structure of the floral landscape that they are foraging within. Here, we describe an individual-based model that considers the impact of environmental heterogeneity and individual differences in movement on the spread of a disease that is spread via floral hotspots, considering a centrally nesting social pollinator (such as a social bee). The biggest effects we saw were associated with the likelihoods of leaving and staying in the nest and the distances travelled by the pollinators, and so it is likely that social pollinators, most of which are constrained to return to a central nest, could be strongly impacted by the schedules they use for allocating foraging behaviour. We also considered the impact of the pollinators being able to deposit and detect temporary scent-marks, which could inform an uninfected pollinator of a potentially infected site. Scent marks have a negative impact on pathogen transmission, and their effect may be dependent on both the longevity of the scent mark, the turnover of flowers in the environment, and the factors affecting pathogen viability and infectivity. Overall, although the structure of the landscape may have limited impact on pathogen spread, the behaviour of the pollinators is important, and needs further consideration within models of this pathogen system.

AUTHOR SUMMARYFlowers have long been suggested to be infection hotspots for pollinator diseases, as, during their brief lifespan, they are visited and handled by many individuals from a diverse range of species. Evidence that floral hotspots are an important point of contagion is building, but we currently know little about the environmental biology of these infections. We describe a model that considers how pathogens caught at floral infection hotspots might spread in populations of social pollinators (such as a bumblebee or honeybee), and show that both pollinator behaviour and how flowers are distributed through the landscape can have a big impact on the spread of the pathogen. Pollinators can leave temporary detectable scent marks on the surfaces of the flowers that they visit: our model demonstrates that being able to detect these marks reduces the spread of the pathogen, as the pollinator is better able to avoid potential hotspots.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

Current chemical-based treatments target cells by inhibiting growth or metabolic function, but their effectiveness is diminishing. To address the growing antimicrobial resistance crisis, there is an urgent need for innovative therapies. Conjugative plasmids, a natural mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, have been repurposed to deliver toxic genetic cargo to recipient cells, showing promise as next-generation antimicrobial agents. However, the ecological risks posed by unintended gene transfer require robust biocontainment strategies. In this study, we developed inducible conjugative plasmids to solve these challenges. Utilizing an arabinose-inducible promoter, we evaluated 13 plasmids with single essential gene deletions, identifying trbC and trbF as strong candidates for stringent regulation. These plasmids demonstrated inducibility in both cis and trans configurations, with induction resulting in up to a 5-log increase in conjugation efficiency compared to uninduced conditions.

The universally conserved F1Fo-ATP synthase regenerates ATP from ADP and Pi by harnessing a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient (pmf). Bacteria have evolved a wide diversity of pmf-forming proteins to make ATP using light, organic, and inorganic energy sources. Recently, we proposed that many bacteria survive using atmospheric trace gases to produce ATP when limited for other energy sources. However, there is no direct proof that atmospheric energy sources are sufficient to generate pmf or drive ATP synthesis. Here, we show that the membrane-associated hydrogen:quinone oxidoreductase Huc from Mycobacterium smegmatis enables ATP synthesis from air. Purified Huc couples H2 oxidation to the reduction of various ubiquinone and menaquinone analogues. We designed and optimised a minimal respiratory chain in which Huc is reconstituted into liposomes with a pmf-generating terminal oxidase and the ATP-generating F1Fo-ATP synthase. Our experiments show that passive hydrogen exchange from air to solution is sufficient for the electron transfer and pmf generation required to accumulate ATP. Finally, by combining continuous culture bioenergetics measurements with theoretical calculations, we show this process is sufficient for mycobacteria to sustain pmf and ATP synthesis (two ATP molecules per H2 oxidised) for maintenance energy requirements during nutrient starvation. These findings prove that atmospheric energy sources are dependable ""lifeline"" substrates that enable continuous energy conservation during nutrient starvation. In addition, this work provides a new tool for ATP production in synthetic applications, which unlike other approaches is traceless without by-product accumulation.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

We performed functional genomics on sorted Salmonella populations expressing SPI-1 or not, to characterize how SPI-1 activation affects chromatin composition, DNA conformation, gene expression and SPI-1 subcellular localization. High H-NS occupancy co-exists with low spurious transcriptional activity and low RNA polymerase occupancy at silent SPIs. Upon SPI-1 activation, remodeling of H-NS occupancy defines a new chromatin landscape, which together with the master SPI-1 regulator HilD, facilitates transcription of SPI-1 genes.

TIR domains encoded by plants and prokaryotes function as enzymes to produce diverse small molecule immune signals. Plant genomes can encode hundreds of TIR-domain containing proteins, many of which confer important agricultural disease resistance as TIR-NLR (nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat) immune receptors. Despite their importance, how natural variation influences TIR enzymatic output and immunity-associated cell death is largely unexplored. We assayed a complete collection of the TIR domains of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 (the ""AtTIRome"") to explore variation in TIR metabolite production and cell death signaling. Roughly half of the AtTIRome triggered cell death in transient assays. Artificial TIR proteins designed based on consensus sequences of the AtTIRome's cell death phenotypic classes revealed polymorphisms controlling variation in TIR cell death elicitation and metabolite production. Structure-function analyses of artificial TIRs revealed that natural variation in the ""BB-loop"", a flexible region overlying the catalytic pocket, determines differences in function across Arabidopsis TIR-containing proteins. We further demonstrate that artificial TIRs are functional on an NLR chassis and that BB-loop variation can tune the activity of a natural TIR-NLR protein.

Yet, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Calcium (Ca2+) signals, which initiate embryo development at fertilization, are frequently disrupted in human ART. In mice, abnormal Ca2+ signals at fertilization impair embryo development and adult offspring metabolism. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ drive mitochondrial activity and production of metabolites used by the epigenetic machinery. For example, acetyl-CoA (derived mainly from pyruvate) and lactyl-CoA (derived from lactate) are used for writing H3K27ac and H3K18la marks that orchestrate initiation of development. Using both a genetic mouse model and treatment with ionomycin to raise intracellular Ca2+ of wild-type fertilized eggs, we found that excess Ca2+ at fertilization changes metabolic substrate availability, causing epigenetic changes that impact embryo development and offspring health. Specifically, increased Ca2+ exposure at fertilization led to increased H3K27ac levels and decreased H3K18la levels at the 1-cell (1C) stage, that persisted until the 2-cell (2C) stage. Ultralow input CUT&Tag revealed significant differences in H3K27ac and H3K18la genomic profiles between control and ionomycin groups. In addition, increased Ca2+ exposure resulted in a marked reduction in global transcription at the 1C stage that persisted through the 2C stage due to diminished activity of RNA polymerase I. Excess Ca2+ following fertilization increased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (enzyme that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA) and decreased total lactate levels. Provision of exogenous lactyl-CoA before ionomycin treatment restored H3K18la levels at the 1C and 2C stages and rescued global transcription to control levels. Our findings demonstrate conclusively that Ca2+ dynamics drive metabolic regulation of epigenetic reprogramming at fertilization and alter EGA.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

Their assembly occurs in ER regions enriched with seipin which, through its homooligomeric ring-like structure, facilitates neutral lipid nucleation. In yeast, seipin (Sei1) partners with Ldb16, Ldo45 (yeast homologue of human LDAF1) and Ldo16, which regulate LD formation and consumption. How the molecular architecture of the yeast seipin complex and its interaction with regulatory proteins adapt to different metabolic conditions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that multiple Ldb16 regions contribute differently to recruiting Ldo45 and Ldo16 to the seipin complex. Using an in-vivo site-specific photo-crosslinking approach, we further show that Ldo45 resides at the center of the seipin ring both in the absence and presence of neutral lipids. Interestingly, neutral lipid synthesis leads to the recruitment of Ldo45 but not Ldo16 to the complex. Our findings suggest that the seipin complex serves as a pre-assembled scaffold for lipid storage that can be remodeled in response to increased neutral lipid availability.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

Historically, their conformational states have been defined by the DFG motif: DFG-in and DFG-out. However, this binary paradigm overlooks the broader conformational heterogeneity of apo STKs, which encompasses multiple metastable states within an expanded DFG-Phe ensemble. We introduced a novel nomenclature that integrates the dynamics of the DFG-Phe, activation loop, and C-helix, highlighting how these regions respond to various ensemble perturbations (e.g., mutations, ligand binding, and protein- protein interactions). A major bottleneck in studying kinases lies in sampling their wide-ranging conformations because static snapshots often remain trapped in specific free energy minima, limiting traditional molecular dynamics simulations from exploring multiple functionally relevant states starting from a single structure. To accelerate conformational sampling, we introduce a computational framework that integrates AlphaFold, machine learning, physics-based simulations, and Markov state modeling. Rather than focusing on single-structure snapshots or structural hypotheses generated by protein structure prediction models, our framework captures shifts in conformational populations under varying perturbations, shedding light on both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the transitions. A key innovation lies in our machine learning algorithms, which capture slowly varying structural features to uncover hidden states and generate latent representations of conformational motions across different kinase domains. The physics-refined structural ensemble sampled from the latent layers is then used to launch new simulations that more comprehensively explore the full conformational landscape than traditional molecular simulation approaches. By capturing how these conformational shifts influence downstream protein-protein interactions, conformational allostery, and cryptic pocket formation, our accelerated simulation framework provides deeper insights into STK mechanisms and enables the development of new therapeutic modalities. Finally, by uniting our comprehensive conformational definition with an AI-accelerated molecular simulation strategy, we capture generalized conformational dynamics in kinases and how their heterogeneity is influenced by ensemble-level perturbations. This framework can be extended to investigate broader protein families--such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and tumor necrosis factors (TNFs)--where functional outcomes are dictated by conformational heterogeneity.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

However, recent studies have demonstrated both the widespread synthesis of guanidine, e.g. in plants and mammals, as well as the widespread occurrence of guanidine metabolism in bacteria, suggesting a broader biological role. Here, we provide insights into guanidine assimilation via guanidine hydrolases (GdmH) in cyanobacteria. The gdmH gene is widespread among cyanobacteria and enables growth on guanidine as sole nitrogen source. Strains lacking gdmH, naturally or by deletion, failed to grow on guanidine. Expression of gdmH increased under nitrogen limitation, regulated by the transcription factor NtcA. However, guanidine is toxic above 5 mM, necessitating GdmH activity and adaptive mutations activating the multidrug efflux system PrqA. The gdmH gene is frequently co-localized with ABC transporter genes, which are driven by an additional NtcA-regulated promoter. At low guanidine concentrations, their mutation disrupted guanidine-dependent growth of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, supporting that they encode a high affinity transport system. In presence of >1 mM guanidine, these mutants grew like wildtype, suggesting the existence of additional uptake mechanisms for guanidine. We next demonstrate the high-affinity binding of guanidine to a previously described, conserved RNA motif located within the gdmH 5' UTR, validating it as a guanidine I riboswitch.

These results demonstrate that electrical stimulation of specific pulvinar subregions influences distinct occipital, parietal and lateral temporal areas. Selective targeting of pulvinar subregions to maximize seizure network engagement may be essential for individualized treatment of posterior quadrant and temporal epilepsies.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

This process depends at least in part on plasticity in visual cortex (Widmer et al., 2022). Key signals involved in driving this plasticity are visuomotor prediction errors (Keller et al., 2012; Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018). Ideally however, the amount of plasticity induced by an error signal should be a function of several variables - including overall cortical prediction error, the animals experience in the current environment or task, stability of the current environment, and task engagement - for optimal computational performance. Candidates for regulators of visuomotor prediction error driven plasticity are the three major neuromodulatory systems that innervate visual cortex in the mouse: acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and serotonin. While visuomotor mismatch acutely triggers activity in noradrenaline (Jordan and Keller, 2023) but not acetylcholine (Yogesh and Keller, 2023) axons in visual cortex, how serotonergic axons in cortex respond to visuomotor mismatch is unknown. The serotonergic system in particular, is an interesting candidate for regulating visuomotor plasticity, as its activity is correlated with action-outcome uncertainty in mice (Grossman et al., 2020), and is increased under conditions of higher visuomotor gain in larval zebra fish (Kawashima et al., 2016). Here, we characterized the activity of serotonergic axons in visual cortex (V1) and in area A24b, a motor cortical area in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), of awake head-fixed mice using two-photon calcium imaging. Our results reveal cortical region-specific responses to visuomotor stimuli in serotonergic axons, but no evidence of a response to visuomotor mismatch. However, average activity in serotonergic axons was increased under conditions of greater visuomotor uncertainty. Thus, serotonin could function to regulate visuomotor plasticity as a function of the predictability of the environment on longer time scales.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

One explanation is that conscious perception fluctuates with the brains internal state, influencing how external stimuli are processed. Ongoing brain oscillations in the alpha band (8 to 13 Hz), thought to reflect neuronal excitability levels and play a role in functional inhibition, have been shown as a key contributor to such perceptual variability. Under high alpha conditions, faint stimuli are more likely to be missed. Some studies suggested alpha oscillations modulate perceptual criterion, shifting the threshold for interpreting sensory information; while others (including our prior work) suggested alpha modulates sensitivity, changing the precision of sensory encoding. Few studies observed modulations in both metrics, making these results appear mutually exclusive. Most studies have focused solely on overall alpha activity, whether within a region of interest or across the whole brain, and overlooked the coexistence of multiple distinct alpha networks, which fluctuate in terms of predominance and adapt to behavioural demands. Hence, it remained unclear whether different networks contributions to perception vary with their momentary state. Here, aiming to characterize how different alpha networks influence perceptual decision-making, we analyzed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data recorded while participants performed a visual detection task with threshold-level stimuli. We found that while the visual alpha network modulates perceptual sensitivity, the sensorimotor alpha network modulates criterion in perceptual decision-making. These findings reconcile previous conflicting results and highlight the functional diversity of alpha networks in shaping perception.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

In 2023 for the first time in Cameroon, identification of PAMIs for cholera control was conducted, following the 2023 GTFCC guidelines. We hereby describe experience of PAMIs identification in a cholera high-burden country.

MethodsIn August 2023, a multisectoral technical team was set up, under the leadership of the Ministry of health to conduct identification of PAMIs. Stakeholders were briefed on GTFCC guidelines. A retrospective (January 2016-September 2023) descriptive study was conducted in all the 10 regions of Cameroon. Data were collected from DHIS-2, national cholera line lists, situation reports, databases from the Centre Pasteur of Cameroon and the National Public Health Laboratory. These datasets were entered in the GTFCC tool for automated analysis. An initial list of PAMIs was identified based on a priority index using four indicators: cholera incidence, mortality, persistence, and positivity. In December 2023, we conducted a multisectoral validation workshop, during which the threshold of 9 was set for PAMIs prioritization and a second prioritization done using vulnerability factors.

ResultsOverall, 48 health districts (25% of all health districts) were identified as PAMIs, 35 PAMIs using the priority index and 13 based on vulnerability factors. About 11 488 089 people (41% of the countrys population) live in these PAMIs from which 93% of cholera cases were reported over the past 8 years. The Centre, Littoral, South-West, and the Far North regions are home to 66% of PAMIs.

ConclusionIdentification of PAMIs was successfully conducted in Cameroon and provided scientific evidence for decision-making to level up cholera preparedness and prevention. The ownership and leadership of governmental main stakeholders were critical. Data availability facilitated this exercise.

Key questionsO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSEnding cholera requires implementation of targeted interventions in high-priority areas for maximum impact. Identification of these areas (PAMIs) is the first step towards cholera elimination.

What this study addsPriority areas for targeted cholera control interventions were identified and categorized in Cameroon for cholera control. PAMIs represent 25% of health districts in Cameroon with a targeted population representing 41% of the whole country. The study describes lessons learnt and challenges of using GTFCC guides for PAMIs identification, which is useful information for other countries.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyOur findings will inform decision-making for cholera control in Cameroon and in other countries through elaboration, implementation and monitoring and evaluation of a national cholera control budgeted plan with specific key long-term interventions to be conducted where needed.","NA","medrxiv",1742249403224

Halfway during Drosophila embryogenesis, two lateral epidermal sheets stretch to fuse at the dorsal midline; concomitant with this, the main tubes of the respiratory system also shift towards the dorsal side of the embryo. Here, we show that these two processes occur simultaneously and are coordinated by the adhesion of the epidermal sheets and a subset of cells of the tracheal trunks to a common extracellular matrix (ECM) that separates them. We show that during dorsal closure, tracheal trunk cells extend protrusions towards the ECM underneath the epidermis. These protrusions are under tension, suggesting they have a mechanical function. Additionally, perturbing adhesion between tracheal cells and the epidermis affects the development of both tissues. Altogether, our findings uncover a novel mechanism used for tissue coordination during development, one that is based on tissue adhesion towards a common ECM capable of transmitting forces across the embryo.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

To address this challenge, we developed the Evidence Aggregator (EvAgg), a generative AI tool designed for rare disease diagnosis that systematically extracts relevant information from the scientific literature for any human gene. EvAgg provides a thorough and current summary of observed genetic variants and their associated clinical features, enabling rapid synthesis of evidence concerning gene-disease relationships. EvAgg demonstrates strong benchmark performance, achieving 97% recall in identifying relevant papers, 92% recall in detecting instances of genetic variation within those papers, and [~]80% accuracy in extracting individual case and variant-level content (e.g. zygosity, inheritance, variant type, and phenotype). Further, EvAgg complemented the process of manual literature review by identifying a substantial number of additional relevant pieces of information. When tested with analysts in rare disease case analysis, EvAgg reduced review time by 34% (p-value < 0.002) and increased the number of papers, variants, and cases evaluated per unit time. These savings have the potential to reduce diagnostic latency and increase solve rates for challenging rare disease cases.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

Human neocortex expansion during evolution has been attributed to an increase in the proliferative capacity of neural progenitor cells during development, particularly basal radial glia (bRG). Despite their evolutionary relevance, the genomic changes driving human-specific bRG biology remain uncharacterized. We used comparative chromatin and transcriptional profiling of neural progenitor cells isolated from gorilla, chimpanzee and human cerebral organoids to identify cis-regulatory elements that have gained activity in humans. Focusing specifically on bRG, we discovered that morphoregulatory enhancer activity and gene expression signatures distinguish human bRG from other great apes. Functional analysis of the morphoregulatory genes FAM107A and CNGA3 in human organoids revealed that these genes are required for the morphological complexity of human bRG. Taken together, our interspecies comparison of basal radial glia suggests that human-specific morphoregulatory signatures characterize neocortex evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

Complementarity to the miRNA seed region (miRNA nucleotides 2-7) is typically both necessary and sufficient for repression. Here, we investigate unusual sites with extensive complementarity to the miRNA 3' region (nucleotide 9 and onwards) but without complementarity to the seed. Top 3'-only sites bind as well as top canonical sites and impart similar repression, which can be further boosted by as few as 2-3 additional pairs to the miRNA seed. Despite these similarities, 3'-only sites have slower association and dissociation rates than seed-matched sites. They also impart different conformations to bound AGO-miRNA complexes than do seed-matched sites, and individual miRNAs differ substantially with respect to how well they bind their respective 3'-only sites. Thus, pairing to the seed is not required for binding and repression, or for a target to gain access to the 3' region of the guide. Overall, for those miRNAs which recognize 3'-only sites, those sites are estimated to constitute 0.5-1% of the endogenous targetome, a proportion resembling that of other rare but functional site types, such as 3'-compensatory sites.

The disease is caused by the self-templated misfolding of the prion protein (PrP) into toxic species, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration and death. We evaluated a novel epigenetic regulation approach using Zinc Finger Repressors (ZFRs) to ablate PrP expression at the transcriptional level. When delivered using adeno-associated virus (AAV), ZFRs potently and specifically reduced prion mRNA expression by >95% in vitro and to near undetectable levels within single neurons in vivo. In wildtype mice, ZFRs stably lowered neuronal PrP expression throughout the central nervous system for at least 17 months. In mice inoculated with misfolded PrP, AAV-ZFRs given at either early or late disease stages profoundly extended lifespan, significantly reduced PrP in the brain, and improved an array of molecular, histological, biomarker, and behavioral readouts. Finally, we delivered a ZFR targeting the human prion gene (PRNP) to cynomolgus monkeys using a novel blood-brain-barrier penetrant AAV capsid. Extensive bulk and single-cell assessments revealed widespread ZFR expression and PRNP repression in all 35 brain regions assessed, providing the first demonstration of epigenetic regulation across the nonhuman primate neuraxis following a single intravenous (IV) dose. These results highlight the potential of a one-time IV administered ZFR treatment for prion disease and other neurological disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

Calcium imaging is such a key method which, however, records neuronal activity only indirectly and is therefore difficult to interpret. These difficulties arise primarily from the kinetics, nonlinearity, and sensitivity of the calcium indicator, but also depend on the methods for calcium signal analysis. Here, we evaluate the ability of the recently developed calcium indicator GCaMP8 to reveal neuronal spiking, and we investigate how existing spike inference methods (CASCADE, OASIS, MLSpike) should be adapted for optimal performance. We demonstrate, both for principal cells and interneurons, that algorithms require fine-tuning to obtain optimal results with GCaMP8 data. Specifically, supervised algorithms adapted for GCaMP8 result in more linear and therefore more accurate recovery of complex spiking events. In addition, our analysis of cortical ground truth recordings shows that GCaMP8s and GCaMP8m - but not GCaMP6, GCaMP7f or GCaMP8f - are able to reliably detect isolated action potentials for realistic noise levels. Finally, we demonstrate that, due to their fast rise times, GCaMP8 indicators support shorter closed-loop latencies for real-time detection of neuronal activity.

Rapidly proliferating cells require large amounts of nucleotides, making nucleotide metabolism a widely exploited target for cancer therapy. However, resistance frequently emerges, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of nucleotide regulation. Here, we harness uridine salvage and CRISPR-Cas9 screening to reveal regulators of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. We identify several factors and report that pyrimidine synthesis can continue in the absence of coenzyme Q (CoQ), the canonical electron acceptor in de novo synthesis. We further investigate NUDT5 and report its conserved interaction with PPAT, the rate-limiting enzyme in purine synthesis. We show that in the absence of NUDT5, hyperactive purine synthesis siphons the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) pool at the expense of pyrimidine synthesis, promoting resistance to chemotherapy. Intriguingly, the interaction between NUDT5 and PPAT appears to be disrupted by PRPP, highlighting intricate allosteric regulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental mechanism for maintaining nucleotide balance and position NUDT5 as a potential biomarker for predicting resistance to chemotherapy.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

We gathered two diverse pretraining datasets: one consisting of 19,551 reference genomes, including over 18,000 prokaryotic genomes (115B nucleotides), and another more balanced dataset with 1,354 genomes, including 1,166 prokaryotic and 188 eukaryotic reference genomes (180B nucleotides).

Therefore, it is critically important to optimize how existing antibiotics act against bacterial infections. Although antibiotic activity is well studied at the single cell level, many infections are caused by spatially structured multicellular populations. In such populations, cellular consumption of scarce nutrients establishes strong spatial variations in their abundance. These nutrient variations have long been hypothesized to help bacterial populations tolerate antibiotics, since single-cell studies show that antibiotic tolerance depends on metabolic activity, and thus, local nutrient availability. Here, we directly test this hypothesis by visualizing cell death in Escherichia coli populations with defined structures upon exposure to nutrient (glucose) and antibiotic (fosfomycin). We find that nutrient availability acts as a bottleneck to antibiotic killing, causing death to propagate through the population as a traveling front---a phenomenon predicted over 20 years ago, but never verified until now. By integrating our measurements with biophysical theory and simulations, we establish quantitative principles that explain how collective nutrient consumption can limit the progression of this ""death front,"" protecting a population from a nominally deadly antibiotic dose. While increasing nutrient supply can overcome this bottleneck, our work reveals that in some cases, excess nutrient can unexpectedly promote the regrowth of resistant cells. Altogether, this work provides a key step toward predicting and controlling antibiotic treatment of spatially structured bacterial populations, yielding fundamental biophysical insights into collective behavior and helping to guide strategies for more effective antibiotic stewardship.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

Borrelia is known to disseminate through organs, including the skin, joints, spinal cord, bladder, and heart, leading to Lyme arthritis, neuroborreliosis, and Lyme carditis. While previous studies have investigated the impact of LD on pregnancy in both mice and humans and have found the presence of B. burgdorferi in the uterus of mice, we studied the impact of LD on the non-pregnant female reproductive tract. We use a mouse model for LD and find an ongoing and severe infection of the reproductive tract of female mice, which persists up to 15-months post-inoculation. This infection results in uterine glandular cysts and endometrial hyperplasia as well as vaginal epithelial thickening, polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell epithelial infiltration, and epithelial desquamation into the vaginal lumen. Strikingly, we find that age has an impact on the extent of gynecologic pathology such that aged female mice (1-year old) that are reproductively senescent have more gynecologic pathology with infection compared to young mice (15-weeks old) when infected for the same length of time. Using large-scale electronic healthcare record data, we report that LD additionally results in increased infection-associated risk of menorrhagia (1.5-fold), miscarriage (1.62-fold), uterine fibroids (1.42-fold), and endometriosis (1.93-fold). Underreporting of gynecological outcomes is pervasive throughout many different infectious diseases, and LD-associated gynecological pathologies may have been similarly underappreciated in the field. This work suggests that further study of the female reproductive tract and the effects of B. burgdorferi infection therein will help clarify and expand the knowledge of myriad LD outcomes.

These processes vary widely across cell types and differ depending on the nature and structure of the vector, whether it is a lipid nanoparticle or a different synthetic material. We developed a novel genome-wide CRISPR screening strategy to better understand these limitations within human cells to identify genes modulating cellular uptake, payload delivery, and gene editing efficiency. Our screen interrogates the cellular processes controlling genome editing by Cas-based nuclease and base editing strategies in human cells. We designed a genome-wide screen targeting 19,114 genes in HEK293 cells, and we identified six genes whose knockout increased nonviral editing efficiency in human cells by up to five-fold. Further validation through arrayed knockouts of the top hits from our screen boosted the editing efficiency from 5% to 50% when Cas9 was delivered via lipid-based nanoparticles. By designing the guides to target the screen library cassette, we could accurately track the library sgRNA identity and the editing outcome on the same amplicon via short-read sequencing, enabling the identification of rare outcomes via  computationally sorting edited from unedited cells within a heterogenous pool of >200M cells. In patient-derived human retinal pigment epithelium cells derived from pluripotent stem cells, BET1L, GJB2, and MS4A13 gene knockouts increased targeted genome editing by over five-fold. We anticipate that this high-throughput screening approach will facilitate the systematic engineering of novel nonviral genome editing delivery methods, where the identified novel gene hits can be further used to increase editing efficiency for other therapeutically relevant cell types.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

We developed a massively parallel dual reporter assay that enables simultaneous assessment of the intrinsic promoter and enhancer potential exerted by the same sequence. Parallel quantification for thousands of elements reveals that canonical human promoters and enhancers can act as both promoters and enhancers under the same contexts, and that promoter activity may be necessary but not sufficient for enhancer function. We find that regulatory potential is intrinsic to element sequences, irrespective of downstream features typically associated with distinct element classes. Perturbations to element transcription factor binding motifs lead to disruptions in both activities, implicating a shared syntax for the two regulatory functions. Combinations of elements with different minimal promoters reveal reciprocal activity modulation between associated elements and a strong positive correlation between promoter and enhancer functions imply a bidirectional feedback loop used to maintain environments of high transcriptional activity. Finally, our results indicate that the magnitude and balance between promoter and enhancer functions are shaped by both intrinsic sequence properties and contextual regulatory influences, suggesting a degree of plasticity in regulatory action.

What cognitive and neural processes underlie these moments of understanding? We hypothesized that narrative insight accompanies retrieving causally related past events in memory and updating the current event representation. To test this, we designed an fMRI study in which participants watched a TV episode that was cut into multiple events and presented in temporally scrambled orders. Participants pressed an ""aha"" button whenever they understood something new and verbally explained why they pressed in those moments at the end of each run. Supporting our prediction, more than 40% of insights included the retrieval of past events that were causally related to the current event. Neural patterns representing causally related past events were reinstated in cortical areas. This neural reinstatement drove sudden shifts in cortical representation patterns [~]2 s prior to aha button presses, reflecting an update in situational representation at moments of insight. Moreover, distributed areas in the brain represented causally related events with similar neural patterns, beyond their shared semantic or perceptual features. Together, the study suggests that we comprehend events by reinstating causally related past events via shared neural patterns, followed by updating neural patterns at moments of insight.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

However, the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood, with ongoing debate about whether sensory neurons can be directly infected by the virus. In this study, human iPSC-derived sensory neurons were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant, a mutant virus, or viral S1 proteins. Under control conditions, sensory neurons exhibited low expression of ACE2. However, exposure to BA.5 or S1 proteins significantly upregulated ACE2 expression in peripherin-positive sensory neurons. Virological analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons, including olfactory neurons. Moreover, exposure to the live virus or S1 proteins induced TRPV1 upregulation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in axonal destruction. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed that viral exposure enhanced cAMP signaling, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels, which collectively contributed to synaptic and axonal damage. Importantly, treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist demonstrated neuroprotective effects. These findings underscore the need for further research into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TRPV1, as well as its downstream signaling pathways, to develop therapeutic strategies for preventing sensory neuron loss during viral infections.

HighlightsO_LIiPSC technology was employed to generate peripheral sensory neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), providing a valuable platform for studying the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on peripheral sensory neurons.
C_LIO_LIOur findings demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 variant exerted both direct and indirect effects on peripheral sensory neurons. Virus exposure upregulated the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in peripherin-positive neurons.

While LC symptoms vary widely, neuropathy is one of the most prevalent symptoms and drastically affects quality of life. However, the underlying pathophysiology of LC neuropathy remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the prevalence and potential mechanisms of LC neuropathy in the largest LC neuropathy cohort to date.

MethodsWe conducted an observational study of 977 adults with LC at Dell Medical School. Participants underwent clinical assessments, skin punch biopsy, and comprehensive metabolic, endocrine and immunological profiling. A subset of patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment.

FindingsNeuropathic symptoms were reported by 55% (534/977) participants, with skin biopsy confirming small fiber neuropathy in 56.5% (48/85) cases, affecting both epidermal and autonomic nerve fibers. Common risk factors for neuropathy, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, did not fully explain neuropathic symptoms. While general immunological markers (lymphocyte, T cell, and B cell count and CRP) were unremarkable, unexpectedly, we detected anti-ganglioside antibodies (AGAs) in 25% of patients with LC neuropathy, a comparable rate to other AGA-associated neuropathies. Longitudinal testing revealed persistent AGA positivity, and multiple elevated AGAs in a subset of patients. In a pilot treatment cohort of eight patients, IVIG treatment resulted in improvement of patient reported neuropathic symptoms.

InterpretationOur findings reveal a high prevalence of small fiber neuropathy in LC, with evidence suggesting an autoimmune mechanism involving AGAs in one in four LC neuropathy patients. The therapeutic response to IVIG further supports an autoimmune pathophysiology, suggesting potential benefits of immunomodulation in LC neuropathy patients.","NA","medrxiv",1742249403224

We identified human-specific epigenetic signatures including cis-regulatory regions and enhancer-promoter interactions and linked them to gene regulatory dynamics. Deep learning models revealed that complex regulatory grammar at cis-regulatory regions, including transcription factor binding sites, local context and higher-order chromatin organization, underlies species and cell type-specific differences. High-resolution Hi-C uncovered unexpected global shifts in 3D genome architecture in chimpanzee and gorilla neural stem cells while topologically associating domains remain remarkably conserved. Notably, species-specific genes interacted with multiple differentially accessible regions, suggesting that synergistic enhancer activation is a key mechanism driving epigenome evolution.

To go much beyond this number, smaller and simpler genetic systems are needed to avoid significant technical challenges. Chloroplast genomes offer multiple advantages for codon compression and reassignment. Here we report a recoding scheme for the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast genome, in which two stop codons and one or more of the codons for arginine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine and serine, all of which have two cognate tRNAs, are absent, compressing the genetic code to 51 codons. Firstly, several recoding strategies were tested on the essential rpoA gene, encoding a subunit of the chloroplast RNA polymerase. A defined compression scheme, which relied on swapping the target codons with the permitted frequent codons, could replace the native protein coding sequence without affecting chloroplast protein expression levels or the strain fitness. The same strategy was successfully used for codon compression of ycf1, encoding a subunit of the chloroplast translocon, psaA and psbA, intron-containing highly expressed genes encoding reaction centres subunits of both photosystems, and an 8.5 kb operon encoding essential and non-essential genes. Finally, we tested degeneracy of the 51-codon genetic code by exploring the combinatorial design for the large subunit of RuBisCO, relying on restoration of photosynthesis in an rbcL mutant strain. More than 70 functional sequences with diverse codon adaptation indices were recovered. In all codon-compressed genes there was no observable penalty on photosynthetic growth.

Significance StatementWe demonstrate the use of a chloroplast genome as a synthetic biology platform to test modifications of the universal genetic code. Elimination of 13 of the 64 possible triplet codes (codons) was possible for several essential and/or highly expressed genes without affecting chloroplast function. The technology is mature, paving the way for codon compression of the entire genome and thus enabling further radical rearrangement or expansion of the genetic code.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

Here we present the GrimACE, the first fully standardised and automated cage-side monitoring tool for mice, the most widely used animals in research. The GrimACE uses computer vision to provide automated mouse grimace scale (MGS) assessment together with pose estimation in a dark, safe environment. We validated the system by analysing pain after brain surgeries (craniotomies) with head implants under two analgesia regimes. Human-expert and automated MGS scores showed very high correlation (Pearson's r=0.87). Both expert and automated scores revealed that a moderate increase in pain can be detected for up to 48 hours after surgeries, but that both a single dose of meloxicam (5mg/kg s.c.) or 3 doses of buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg) + meloxicam (5mg/kg s.c.) provide adequate and comparable pain management. Simultaneous pose estimation demonstrated that mice receiving buprenorphine + meloxicam showed increased movement 4h after surgery, indicative of hyperactivity, a well-known side-effect of opioid treatment. Significant weight loss was also detected in the buprenorphine + meloxicam treatment group compared to the meloxicam-only group. Additionally, detailed BehaviorFlow analysis and automated MGS scoring of control animals suggests that habituation to the GrimACE system is unnecessary, and that measurements can be repeated multiple times, ensuring standardised post-operative recovery monitoring.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

In heterodichogamy, two hermaphroditic morphs exploit distinct temporal reproductive niches by alternating phases of male and female flowering, promoting disassortative mating. This system is widespread within Juglandaceae, and known to be controlled by ancient balanced polymorphisms in walnuts (Juglans) and hickories (Carya). Here we identify distinct inheritance mechanisms controlling heterodichogamy in two separate Juglandaceae genera, the wingnuts (Pterocarya and Cyclocarya). We first document the occurrence of heterodichogamy in Pterocarya and map its genomic basis to haplotypes overlapping a single candidate gene in the FANTASTIC FOUR superfamily (GFAFL). These haplotypes segregate throughout the entire genus and the dominant haplotype controls female-first flowering. We show heterodichogamy in the sister genus Cyclocarya is associated with a distinct pair of ancient haplotypes at the same locus in both diploids and tetraploids, but with a dominant allele controlling male-first flowering. We infer a well-resolved fossil-calibrated phylogeny of Juglandaceae and date the divergence of the Pterocarya and Cyclocarya haplotypes to 51 and 44 million years ago, more recent than the divergence of these genera. In Pterocarya female-first heterozygotes, the dominant haplotype is associated with allele-specific suppression of the recessive copy of GFAFL during early male flower development. In Cyclocarya male-first heterozygotes, the dominant haplotype is associated with allele-specific activation of the recessive copy of GFAFL during male flower development, while the dominant copy itself shows higher expression in female flowers. We propose a model for the evolution of reciprocal sex matching in heterodichogamy through the combination of cis-regulatory divergence and allelic interactions involving  fast and  slow alleles at a single gene regulating flowering time. The non-independent expression of alleles in both systems is reminiscent of trans-sensing phenomena in other systems and suggests a mechanism mediated by DNA homology or an RNA intermediary. Notably, the dominant haplotypes in both genera show parallel architecture with a hemizygous region containing tandem duplicates of the same 1 kb motif downstream of the transcribed region of GFAFL which may be linked with such a mechanism. Our findings shed light on the molecular basis of heterodichogamy and contribute to an emerging view that diverse genetic pathways can be co-opted during its evolution and facilitate turnover in its genetic control.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

We analysed all three pathway-specific regulators and found that biosynthesis is subject to negative feedback and redox control via two MarR-family proteins while activation of the pathway is dependent on a cytoplasmic two-component system. Like many Streptomyces antibiotics, formicamycins are only produced in solid culture and biosynthesis is switched off in aerated liquid cultures.

We then describe proteoform diversity across mouse tissues, revealing distinct patterns of post translational modifications and alternative splicing.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

Using Xenopus egg extracts, we show that a replication fork encountering an SSB on either the leading- or lagging-strand template produces a single-ended double-strand break (seDSB). These broken ends are efficiently resolved by homologous recombination to yield D-loops and erroneous end-to-end fusions. Surprisingly, DNA synthesis downstream of an seDSB is highly inefficient. In contrast, when two forks converge at an SSB, they generate a double-ended DSB (deDSB) that efficiently completes DNA synthesis through double-strand break repair that is not dependent on homologous recombination. Leading, but not lagging, seDSBs can undergo extensive nucleolytic degradation that disassembles the divergent fork. These  secondary collapse events efficiently resolve seDSBs but without completion of DNA synthesis. Moreover, PARP inhibition can enhance fork collapse at unmodified SSBs but not at abasic site SSBs, contrary to expectations. Our findings distinguish end resolution from replication completion and demonstrate flexibility in how PARP inhibition affects fork collapse.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

To successfully navigate between breeding and wintering quarters, they, in addition to other natural orientation cues, rely on their ability to sense the Earths magnetic field. For this reason, migratory birds have become key model species for studying the sensory mechanisms underlying magnetic field-guided navigation, as evidenced by the identification of several brain regions believed to be involved in processing magnetic field information. However, there is as yet no readily accessible, high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) brain atlas to serve as a common reference within and across studies. Here we provide the neuroscience research community with the first freely available, digital, high-resolution (25 {micro}m), 3D bird brain atlas. It is based on light microscopy images from ten Eurasian blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla), a night-migratory songbird widely used model species in magnetoreception and navigation research. We outline the individual steps for the creation of a brain atlas, from whole-brain imaging using serial-section, two-photon tomography, to the creation of an average template at an isotropic 25-{micro}m voxel size, and finally to brain area segmentation and annotation. In this first version of the atlas, we have mapped a total of 24 brain areas, including 6 principal compartments, 13 conspicuous anatomical subdivisions common to all bird species and 5 functionally defined areas of the visual and trigeminal sensory systems involved in processing magnetic field information. This atlas is accessible via the standardised BrainGlobe Atlas API, making it compatible with a growing suite of computational neuroanatomy tools provided by the BrainGlobe Initiative. This integration enables precise alignment of future experimental data to a common coordinate space, facilitating collaboration, data visualization and sharing. Furthermore, this resource enables the accurate localization and comparison of implanted devices, injection sites, and/or cell populations across individual brains, both within and across studies.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

These communities are shaped by root exudates including plant specialized metabolites. Benzoxazinoids are such secreted compounds of maize. Individual microbes differ in their ability to tolerate and metabolize antimicrobial benzoxazinoids. To investigate how these traits combine in a community, we designed two synthetic communities of maize root bacteria that share six common strains and differ in their ability to metabolize benzoxazinoids based on the seventh strain. We exposed both communities to the benzoxazinoid MBOA (6-methoxybenzoxazolin-2(3H)-one) and found that the metabolizing community did not degrade MBOA to its aminophenoxazinone, as observed for individual strains, but as a community they formed the corresponding acetamide. MBOA shaped differential compositions of both communities and increased the fraction of MBOA-tolerant strains. The benzoxazinoid metabolizing community showed a higher tolerance to MBOA and was able to utilize MBOA as their sole carbon source for growth. Hence, bacterial interaction results in alternative benzoxazinoid metabolization and increases community performance in presence of these antimicrobial compounds. Future work is needed to uncover the genetics of this metabolic interaction and ecological consequences for the bacterial community and the host plant.

ImportanceWe investigated how maize root bacteria - alone or in community - tolerate and metabolize antimicrobial compounds of their host plant. We found the capacity to metabolize such a compound to impact bacterial community size and structure and most importantly, to beneeit community eitness. We also found that interacting bacteria redirected the metabolisation of the antimicrobial compound to an alternative degradation product. Our work highlights the need to study the team work of microbes to uncover their community traits to ultimately understand the ecological consequences for the bacterial community and eventually the host plant.","NA","biorxiv",1742249403224

There are > 10,000 new hospitalizations per week in the U.S., many of whom develop post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), or ""long COVID"", with long-term health issues and compromised quality of life. Early identification of individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 is key for monitoring and supporting respiratory status and improving outcomes. Therefore, precision tools for early detection of patients at high risk of severe disease can reduce morbidity and mortality. Here we report an untargeted and longitudinal metabolomic study of plasma derived from adult patients with COVID-19. One-carbon metabolism, a pathway previously shown as critical for viral propagation and disease progression, and a potential target for COVID-19 treatment, scored strongly as differentially abundant in patients with severe COVID-19. A follow-up targeted metabolite profiling revealed that one arm of the one-carbon metabolism pathway, the methionine cycle, is a major driver of the metabolic profile associated with disease severity. The methionine cycle produces S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl group donor important for methylation of DNA, RNA, and proteins, and its high abundance was reported to correlate with disease severity. Further, genomic data from the profiled patients revealed a genetic contributor to methionine metabolism and identified the C677T allele of the MTHFR gene as a pre-existing predictor of disease trajectory - patients homozygous for the MTHFR C677T have higher incidence of experiencing severe disease. Our results raise the possibility that screening for the common genetic MTHFR variant may be an actionable approach to stratify risk of COVID severity and may inform novel precision COVID-19 treatment strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1742249403224
