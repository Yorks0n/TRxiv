Recent cross-species transmission events to mammals, including humans, highlight this risk. Critical determinants for cross-species and intra-species transmission include the ability to attach to and replicate in respiratory epithelial cells. Although these factors have been studied for HPAI H5N1 viruses in the past, limited studies are available for currently circulating strains.

MethodsWe compared level of adaptation to human respiratory tract of a HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b (H5N12022) virus with those of well characterized HPAI H5N1 clade 2.1.3.2 (H5N12005) and seasonal H3N22003 viruses by three methods. First, we compared pattern of virus attachment by virus histochemistry. Second, we compared efficiency of infection and replication, as well as innate immune responses in human respiratory epithelium in vitro. Lastly, we compared polymerase complex activity in a minigenome assay.

FindingsThe H5N12022 virus attached more abundantly to and replicated more efficiently in cells of the human respiratory tract compared to H5N12005 and H3N2 viruses. This increased replication was not associated with an increased polymerase activity of H5N12022 virus compared to H3N22003 virus. The efficient replication of H5N12022 virus infection induced a robust innate immune response almost comparable to H3N22003.

InterpretationThe pattern of virus attachment and replication efficiency of a HPAI H5N12022 virus resembled that of H3N22003 virus more closely than a HPAI H5N12005. This could contribute to an increased risk for both human infection and virus adaptations to humans.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSHighly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 viruses of the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (GsGd) lineage (clade 2.3.4.4b) have the ability to spread to a wide range of domesticated and wild mammalian species, including humans. Cross species transmission and transmission among humans requires-- among other factors--efficient infection of epithelial cells in the respiratory epithelium of the upper respiratory tract.

Added value of this studyIn our study we show that a recent clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI H5N1 virus attached to and replicated more efficiently in respiratory epithelium than a clade 2.1.3.2 H5N1 virus that circulated in 2005.

Implications of all the available dataThese data suggest that there might be an increased risk of human infections with the currently circulating 2.3.4.4b HPAI H5N1 viruses, which might facilitate opportunities for human adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

An outstanding question is whether SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences can directly induce inflammatory responses. In this study, we identify a region in the SARS-CoV-2 S2 spike protein with sequence homology to bacterial super-antigens (termed P3). Computational modeling predicts P3 binding to sites on MHC class I/II and the TCR that partially overlap with sites for the binding of staphylococcal enterotoxins B and H. Like SEB and SEH peptides, P3 stimulated 25-40% of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, increasing IFN-{gamma} and granzyme B production. viSNE and SPADE profiling identified overlapping and distinct IFN-{gamma} and GZMB subsets. The super-antigenic properties of P3 were further evident by its selective expansion of T cells expressing specific TCR V and V{beta} chain repertoires. In vivo experiments in mice revealed that the administration of P3 led to a significant upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1{beta}, IL-6, and TNF-. While the clinical significance of P3 in COVID-19 remains unclear, its homology to other mammalian proteins suggests a potential role for this peptide family in human inflammation and autoimmunity.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

Previous work focused mainly on Tibetans, establishing their genetic relatedness to East Asians and their genetic adaptation to high altitude, especially at EPAS1. Here, we present 87 new whole-genome sequences from 16 Himalayan populations and the insight they provide into the genomic history of the region. We show that population structure in the Himalayas began to emerge as early as 10,000 years ago, predating archaeological evidence of permanent habitation above 2,500 meters by approximately 6,000 years. The high prevalence of the introgressed adaptive EPAS1 haplotype in all high-altitude populations today supports a shared genetic origin and its importance for survival in this region. We also identify additional selection signals in genes associated with hypoxia, physical activity, immunity and metabolism which could have facilitated adaptation to the harsh environment. Over time, increasing genetic structure led to the diverse and strongly differentiated ethnic groups observed today, most of which maintained small population sizes throughout their history or experienced severe bottlenecks. Between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago, a few uniparental lineages became predominant, likely coinciding with the advent of agriculture, although significant population growth was not observed in the Himalayas except in the Tibetans. In more recent times, we detect bidirectional gene flow between high-altitude and lowland groups, occurring on both sides of the Himalayan range. The timing of this admixture aligns with the rise and expansion of historical regional powers, particularly during the Tibetan Empire and the northern Indian Gupta Empire. In the past few centuries, migrations to the Himalayas seem to have occurred alongside conflicts and population displacements in nearby regions and show some sex bias.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

However, methods to categorize paired NLRs remain limited, primarily relying on the presence of non-canonical domains in some sensor NLRs. Here, we propose that the AI system AlphaFold 3 can classify paired NLR proteins into sensor or helper categories based on predicted structural characteristics. Helper NLRs showed higher AlphaFold 3 confidence scores than sensors when modelled in oligomeric configurations. Furthermore, funnel-shaped structures--essential for activating immune responses--were reliably predicted in helpers but not in sensors. Applying this method to uncharacterized NLR pairs from rice, we found that AlphaFold 3 can differentiate between putative sensors and helpers even when both proteins lack non-canonical domain annotations. These findings suggest that AlphaFold 3 offers a new approach to categorize NLRs and enhances our understanding of the functional configurations in plant immune systems, even in the absence of non-canonical domain annotations.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

Simultaneously, quantum sensing is emerging as a cutting-edge technology for precision biosensing. However, biological based candidates for quantum-sensors have thus far been limited to in vitro systems, are prone to light induced degradation, and require sophisticated experimental setups making high-throughput studies prohibitively complex. We recently created a new class of magneto-sensitive fluorescent proteins (MFPs) [1], which we now show overcome these challenges and represent the first biological quantum-based sensor that functions at physiological conditions and in living cells. Through directed evolution, we demonstrate the possibility of engineering these proteins to alter properties of their response to magnetic fields and radio frequencies. These effects are explained in terms of the spin correlated radical pair (SCRP) mechanism, involving the protein backbone and a bound flavin cofactor. Using this engineered system we demonstrate the first observation of a fluorescent protein exhibiting Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) in living bacterial cells at room temperature, at sufficiently high signal-to-noise to be detected in a single cell, paving the way for development of a new class of in vivo biosensors. We further demonstrate the use of multiple variants of MFPs for multiplexing or lock-in amplification of fluorescence signals, opening a new approach to combining or extracting multiple signals from a biological measurement. Taken together, our results represent a new intersection of imaging and perhaps actuation modalities for engineered biological systems, based on and designed around understanding the quantum mechanical properties of MFPs.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

Integrating smoking cessation support into lung cancer screening can improve abstinence rates. However, healthcare decision makers need evidence of cost effectiveness to understand the cost/benefit of adopting this approach. Methods. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different smoking cessation interventions, and service delivery, we used a Markov model, adapted from previous National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on smoking cessation. This uses long-term epidemiological data to capture the prevalence of the smoking-related illnesses, where prevalence is estimated based on age, sex, and smoking status. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to capture joint parameter uncertainty. Results. All smoking cessation interventions appeared cost-effective at a threshold of 20,000 pounds per quality-adjusted life year, compared to no intervention or behavioural support alone. Offering immediate smoking cessation as part of lung cancer screening appointments, compared with usual care (onward referral to stop smoking services) was also estimated to be cost-effective with a net monetary benefit of 2,198 pounds per person, and a saving of between 34 and 79 pounds per person in reduced workplace absenteeism among working age attendees. Estimated healthcare cost savings were more than four times greater in the most deprived quintile compared to the least deprived, alongside a fivefold increase in QALYs accrued. Conclusions. Smoking cessation interventions within lung cancer screening are cost-effective and should be integrated so that treatment is initiated during screening visits. This is likely to reduce overall costs to the health service, and wider integrated care systems, improve quality and length of life, and may lessen health inequalities.","NA","medrxiv",1732918080110

The increase in the assembly contiguity and the reduced number of assembly contigs also implies that whole-genome alignment is no longer an embarrassingly parallel problem. The conventional method of aligning sequences of the query genome in parallel is to utilize a single thread per sequence. This results in poor CPU utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we designed optimizations to accelerate whole-genome alignment on multi-core processors and implemented them in a commonly used aligner, minimap2. Our improvements include a fine-grained parallel chaining method and a fast mechanism for differentiating primary and secondary chains. Our approach accelerates alignment of human, plant, and primate genomes by 1.6x to 7.2x without compromising accuracy.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

Such targeting is challenging as it requires readout of the few outward facing peptide antigen residues and the avoidance of extensive contacts with the MHC carrier which is present on almost all cells. Here we describe the use of deep learning-based protein design tools to de novo design small proteins that arc above the peptide binding groove of pMHC complexes and make extensive contacts with the peptide. We identify specific binders for ten target pMHCs which when displayed on yeast bind the on-target pMHC tetramer but not closely related peptides. For five targets, incorporation of designs into chimeric antigen receptors leads to T-cell activation by the cognate pMHC complexes well above the background from complexes with peptides derived from proteome. Our approach can generate high specificity binders starting from either experimental or predicted structures of the target pMHC complexes, and should be widely useful for both protein and cell based pMHC targeting.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

Mass spectrometry confirmed the transported proteins as the most abundant in EV membranes, and the presence of many receptor-interacting proteins demonstrates the utility of EVs for characterizing membrane protein interactomes. Cryo-electron tomography of EGFR-containing EVs reveals that EGFR forms clusters in the presence of EGF with a [~]3 nm gap between the inner membrane and cytoplasmic density. EGFR extracellular regions do not form regular arrays, suggesting that clustering is mediated by the intracellular region. Subtomogram averaging of the EGFR extracellular region (ECR) yielded a 15 [A] map into which the crystal structure of the ligand-bound EGFR ECR dimer fits well. These findings refine our understanding of EGFR activation, clustering, and signaling, and they establish EVs as a versatile platform for structural and functional characterization of human membrane proteins in a native-like environment.

Significance StatementAtomic or near-atomic resolution structural studies of proteins embedded in cell membranes have proven challenging. We show that transporting integral membrane proteins to cell-derived extracellular vesicles enables structural and functional studies of human membrane proteins in a native membrane environment. We have used this approach to visualize an active form of full-length Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and show that it forms clusters in the membrane and projects its cytoplasmic signaling domains [~]3 nm away from the membrane surface. EGFR is essential for normal development, but abnormal EGFR activity is associated with several human cancers and is the target of many anticancer therapies. Our studies refine current models of how ligand binding to EGFR transmits signals across cell membranes.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

Compared to HC, individuals with SSD exhibited reduced structural similarity in the temporal and cingulate lobes, with more pronounced reductions in individuals exhibiting a  poor clinical status (more impaired cognitive functioning and more severe symptomatology). These alterations in MIND networks were associated with cortical hierarchy and maturational events, locating MIND reductions in higher-order association areas that predominantly mature later. Finally, we mapped 46 neurobiological features from healthy individuals onto MIND networks revealing a high presence of neurotransmitters, astrocytes, and microglia, along with decreased metabolism and microstructure, in regions with reduced similarity in SSD.

In human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, we tile the PD-L1 locus using [~]25,000 CRISPR perturbations in constitutive and IFN{gamma}-stimulated conditions. We discover 67 enhancer- or repressor-like CREs and show that distal CREs tend to contact the promoter of PD-L1 and related genes. Next, we measure how loss of all [~]2,000 transcription factors (TFs) in the human genome impacts PD-L1 expression and, using this, we link specific TFs to individual CREs and reveal novel PD-L1 regulatory circuits. For one of these regulatory circuits, we confirm the binding of predicted trans-factors (SRF and BPTF) using CUT&RUN and show that loss of either the CRE or TFs potentiates the anti-cancer activity of primary T cells engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor. Finally, we show that expression of these TFs correlates with PD-L1 expression in vivo in primary PDAC tumors and that somatic mutations in TFs can alter response and overall survival in immune checkpoint blockade-treated patients.

We analyzed DNA sequence data, derived from the blood cells of >700,000 participants in UK Biobank and the All of Us Research Program, and developed new computational approaches to recognize, measure and learn from DNA-repeat instability at 15 highly polymorphic CAG-repeat loci. We found that expansion and contraction rates varied widely across these 15 loci, even for alleles of the same length; repeats at different loci also exhibited widely variable relative propensities to mutate in the germline versus the blood. The high somatic instability of TCF4 repeats enabled a genome-wide association analysis that identified seven loci at which inherited variants modulate TCF4 repeat instability in blood cells. Three of the implicated loci contained genes (MSH3, FAN1, and PMS2) that also modulate Huntingtons disease age-at-onset as well as somatic instability of the HTT repeat in blood; however, the specific genetic variants and their effects (instability-increasing or-decreasing) appeared to be tissue-specific and repeat-specific, suggesting that somatic mutation in different tissues--or of different repeats in the same tissue--proceeds independently and under the control of substantially different genetic variation. Additional modifier loci included DNA damage response genes ATAD5 and GADD45A.

To address this question, we analyzed brief, task-free magnetoencephalographic recordings from over 1,000 individuals aged 4-89. We found that neurophysiological activity is significantly more similar between individuals in childhood than in adulthood, though periodic patterns of brain activity remain reliable markers of individuality across all ages. The cortical regions most critical for determining individuality shift across neurodevelopment and aging, with sensorimotor cortices becoming increasingly prominent in adulthood. These developmental changes in neurophysiology align closely with the expression of cortical genetic systems related to ion transport and neurotransmission, suggesting a growing influence of genetic factors on neurophysiological traits across the lifespan. Notably, this alignment peaks in late adolescence, a critical period when genetic factors significantly shape brain individuality. Overall, our findings highlight the role of sensorimotor regions in defining individual brain traits and reveal how genetic influences on these traits intensify with age. This study advances our understanding of the evolving biological foundations of inter-individual differences.

They found that the brain regions most associated with individuality change with age: sensory and motor regions become increasingly distinctive in early adulthood, highlighting their role in shaping a persons unique characteristics of brain activity. The study also revealed that changes in brain activity across different ages correspond to specific patterns of gene expression, shedding light on how genetics influence brain individuality. These findings deepen our understanding of the biological foundations of inter-individual differences and how it evolves over the lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

The underlying neural mechanisms of IS remain largely unknown. In this study, high-density EEG was used to investigate these mechanisms in healthy adults (n=53) performing a speeded reaction time (RT) task involving visual and auditory stimuli. Trials were categorized as Repeat (same preceding modality) or Switch (different preceding modality). Switch trials showed slower RTs and delayed sensory responses (N1 and P2 components). Furthermore, across both Repeat and Switch trials, RT correlated with the latency of these neural responses. Additionally, lower alpha-band inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) in primary sensory regions was noted for Switch compared to Repeat trials, suggesting reduced efficiency of sensory processing. Greater induced theta activity over fronto-central scalp regions in Switch trials suggested increased cognitive control demands, potentially involving the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). These findings reveal that IS is characterized by delayed sensory processing and heightened cognitive load, supporting a model where prior stimulus primes the sensory cortex for faster processing in Repeat trials, while Switch trials demand more cognitive resources for adjustment. The similarity of effects across both auditory and visual sensory modalities suggests that IS effects represent core features of sensory processing, potentially reflecting a fundamental, modality-independent mechanism of attentional switching across sensory domains.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

Autonomous flower cooling could help to alleviate exposure of pollen and ovules to harmful temperatures, yet investigations on the thermal ecology of flowers in hot environments are still needed to evaluate the frequency, magnitude and ecological significance of floral thermoregulatory cooling. This paper reports a study on the thermal ecology of flower heads (=capitula) of 15 species of summer-blooming Asteraceae, tribe Cardueae, from hot-dry habitats in the southern Iberian Peninsula. Temperature inside (Tin) and outside (Tout) capitula were assessed under natural field conditions by two complementary sampling and measurement procedures, which provided information on the relationships between the two temperatures at the levels of individual capitula (""continuous recording"") and local plant populations (""instantaneous measurements""). Baselines for the Tin-Tout relationship in absence of physiological activity were obtained by exposing dehydrated capitula to variable ambient temperatures. To assess whether the co-flowering capitula of summer-blooming Asteraceae collectively defined a distinct thermal layer, the vertical distribution of capitula relative to the ground was quantified. Bees visiting capitula were watched and the temperature of the air beside the visited capitulum was measured. Capitula of all species were exposed to high ambient temperatures during long periods, yet their interior was cooler than the air for most of the time, with temperature differentials ({Delta}T=Tin-Tout) quite often approaching, and sometimes exceeding -10{degrees}C. The relationship between Tin and Tout was best described by a composite of steep and shallow linear relationships separated by a breakpoint ({Psi}, interspecific range=25{degrees}C-35{degrees}C). Capitula were weakly or not thermoregulated for Tout<{Psi}, but switched to intense, thermoregulated cooling when Tout>{Psi}. Narrow vertical distribution of capitula above ground and similar cooling responses by all species produced a refrigerated floral layer where most bees foraged at Tout>{Psi} and presumably visited cooled capitula. Thermoregulatory cooling of capitula can benefit plant reproduction by reducing pollen and ovule exposure to high temperature, but also the populations of insect mutualists and antagonists through habitat improvement via a refrigerated flower layer.

While the functions and underlying neural circuitry of individual neocortical areas are well studied, it is unclear how these regions operate collectively to form percepts and implement cognitive processes. In particular, it remains unknown how distributed, potentially conflicting computations can be reconciled. Here we show that the reciprocal excitatory connections between cortical areas orchestrate neural dynamics to facilitate the gradual emergence of a  consensus across areas. We investigated the joint neural dynamics of primary (V1) and higher-order lateromedial (LM) visual areas in mice, using simultaneous multi-area electrophysiological recordings along with focal optogenetic perturbations to causally manipulate neural activity. We combined mechanistic circuit modeling with state-of-the-art data-driven nonlinear system identification, to construct biologically-constrained latent circuit models of the data that we could further interrogate. This approach revealed that long-range, reciprocal excitatory connections between V1 and LM implement an approximate line attractor in their joint dynamics, which promotes activity patterns encoding the presence of the stimulus consistently across the two areas. Further theoretical analyses revealed that the emergence of line attractor dynamics is a signature of a more general principle governing multi-area network dynamics: reciprocal inter-area excitatory connections reshape the dynamical landscape of the network, specifically slowing down the decay of activity patterns that encode stimulus features congruently across areas, while accelerating the decay of inconsistent patterns. This selective dynamic amplification leads to the emergence of multi-dimensional consensus between cortical areas about various stimulus features. Our analytical framework further predicted the timescales of specific activity patterns across areas, which we directly verified in our data. Therefore, by linking the anatomical organization of inter-area connections to the features they reconcile across areas, our work introduces a general theory of multi-area computation.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

Existing methods, such as optogenetic tagging (i.e., Optotagging1), have proven useful for identifying cell types in in vivo electrophysiological recordings during freely moving behavior. However, electrophysiological recordings are limited in their capacity to track the same neuronal populations across long periods of time (days to weeks). Single-photon miniscope imaging offers the advantage of tracking the same cells across weeks to months; however, it is difficult to distinguish different cell types within the recorded population. Here, we present ""chemotagging,"" a technique that allows for the identification of specific cell types in in vivo calcium imaging recordings. This protocol offers a method for tagging cell types with chemogenetic tools like Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs)2, while simultaneously recording calcium activity from a pan-neuronal population with calcium indicators.

However, the genetic basis of most of these traits has not been elucidated. To facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying NMR physiology and behaviour, we generated a long-read chromosomal-level genome assembly of the NMR. This genome was subsequently annotated and incorporated into multiple whole genome alignments in the Ensembl database. Our long-read assembly identified thousands of repeats and genes that were previously unassembled in the NMR and improved the results of routinely used short-read sequencing-based experiments such as RNA-seq, snRNA-seq, and ATAC-seq. We identified several spermatozoa related gene losses that may underlie the unique degenerative sperm phenotype in NMRs (IRGC, FSCB, AKAP3, MROH2B, CATSPER1, DCDC2C, ATP1A4, TEKT5, and ZAN), and an additional gene loss related to the established NK-cell absence in NMRs (PILRB). We resolved several tandem duplications in genes related to pathways underlying unique NMR adaptations including hypoxia tolerance, oxidative stress, and nervous system protection (TINF2, TCP1, KYAT1). Lastly, we describe our ongoing efforts to generate a reference telomere-to-telomere assembly in the NMR which includes the resolution of complex gene families. This new reference genome should accelerate the discovery of the genetic underpinnings of NMR physiology and adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

Selective attention involves the preferential processing and sampling of behaviorally important information from the external environment, while working memory involves the preferential processing and sampling of behaviorally important, internally stored information. These essential cognitive processes share neural resources within a large-scale network that includes frontal, parietal, and sensory cortices, and these shared neural resources can lead to between-domain interactions. Previous research has linked external sampling during selective attention and internal sampling during working memory to theta-rhythmic (3-8 Hz) neural activity in higher-order (e.g., frontal cortices) and sensory regions (e.g., visual cortices). Such theta-rhythmic neural activity might help to resolve the competition for shared neural resources by isolating neural activity associated with different functions over time. Here, we used EEG and a dual-task design (i.e., a task that required both external and internal sampling) to directly compare (i) theta-dependent fluctuations in behavioral performance during external sampling with (ii) theta-dependent fluctuations in behavioral performance during internal sampling. Our findings are consistent with a domain-general, theta-rhythmic process for sampling either external information or internal information. We further demonstrate that interactions between external and internal information--specifically, when to-be-detected information matches to-be-remembered information--are not dependent on theta-band activity (i.e., theta phase). Given that these theta-independent  match effects occur during early processing stages (peaking at 75 ms), we propose that theta-rhythmic sampling modulates external and internal information during later processing stages.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

Here, we identified CRL4DCAF12 as a new factor controlling the assembly of nascent MCM complexes. During MCM biogenesis, MCMBP facilitates the assembly and transport of newly synthesized MCM3-7 subcomplexes into the nucleus2,3. Once in the nucleus, the MCM2 subunit must be incorporated into the MCM3-7 subcomplex, while MCMBP needs to be removed. CRL4DCAF12 facilitates the degradation of MCMBP and thereby regulates the assembly of MCM2-7 complexes. The absence of CRL4DCAF12 adversely affects the level of chromatin-bound nascent MCMs, resulting in accelerated replication forks and genome instability. Collectively, our findings uncovered the molecular mechanism underlying nascent MCM production essential to counteract genome instability and tumor formation.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

However, the effective indexing and analysis of this vast amount of data pose significant challenges to the scientific community. K-mer indexing has proven crucial in managing extensive datasets across a wide range of applications, including alignment, compression, dataset comparison, error correction, assembly, and quantification. As a result, developing efficient and scalable k-mer indexing methods has become an increasingly important area of research. Despite the progress made, current state-of-the-art indexing structures are predominantly static, necessitating resource-intensive index reconstruction when integrating new data. Recently, the need for dynamic indexing structures has been recognized. However, many proposed solutions are only pseudo-dynamic, requiring substantial updates to justify the costs of adding new datasets. In practice, applications often rely on standard hash tables to associate data with their k-mers, leading to high k-mer encoding rates exceeding 64 bits per k-mer. In this work, we introduce Brisk, a drop-in replacement for most k-mer dictionary applications. This novel hashmap-like data structure provides exceptional throughput while significantly reducing memory usage compared to existing dynamic associative indexes, particularly for large k-mer sizes. Brisk achieves this by leveraging hierarchical minimizer indexing and memory efficient super-k-mer representation. We also introduce novel techniques for efficiently probing k-mers within a set of super-k-mers and managing duplicated minimizers. We believe that the methodologies developed in this work represent a significant advancement in the creation of efficient and scalable k-mer dictionaries, greatly facilitating their routine use in genomic data analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

To address this, we sampled the entire thermoreceptor population using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia of awake and anesthetized mice. We found that the vast majority of thermoreceptors respond bidirectionally, with an enhanced response to cool and a suppressed response to warm. Using in vivo pharmacology and computational modelling, we demonstrate that conductance changes in the cool-sensitive TRPM8 channel are sufficient to explain this bidirectional response type. Our comprehensive dataset reveals the fundamental principles of the peripheral encoding of innocuous temperatures and suggests that the same population of thermoreceptors underlie the distinct sensations of cool and warm.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

However, the prevalence and mechanisms of such intergenerational epigenetic inheritance (IEI) in mammals remain poorly defined. Moreover, the interplay between paternal exposure, genetics, and age on emergent offspring features is unexplored. Here, we measure the quantitative impact of three paternal environments on early embryogenesis across genetic backgrounds. Using in vitro fertilisation (IVF) at scale, we capture batch-robust transcriptomic signatures of IEI with single-blastocyst resolution. Amongst these, paternal gut microbiota dysbiosis is linked with aberrant expression of lineage regulators in blastocysts, particularly affecting extra-embryonic tissues. Conversely, paternal low-protein high-sugar diet associates with subtle preimplantation developmental delay. We further identify gene expression variability as a paternally-induced F1 phenotype, and highlight confounding issues for IEI such as batch-effects and under-sampling. Finally, paternal genetic background and age exert a dominant influence over the inherited environmental signature. This study systematically characterises how paternal conditioning programmes subtle but detectable molecular responses in early embryos, and suggests guiding principles to dissect intergenerational phenomenology.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

ACTN4 depletion from human iPSC-CMs stabilizes canonical sarcomere proteins and drives contractility-dependent cellular hypertrophy while ACTN4 overexpression destabilizes sarcomeres.

Transcription factors (TFs) being key to genetic regulation, have been studied in the origins of eusociality in Hymenoptera (Bees, Ants and Wasps) but less so in Blattodea (Cockroaches and Termites). Here we show that the social transition in Blattodea, from cockroaches to termites, displays similar patterns of regulatory change to those found in Hymenoptera. Specifically, by analysing 3 cockroach and 5 termite genomes, we find more TF families with relaxed selection compared to intensified selection and lineage-specific gene family expansions in termites. We also find that genes under selection support neotenic caste determination. There are key differences in TF regulation in comparison with Hymenoptera with contractions in TF gene families and reduced diversity in enriched DNA binding motifs of TFs.

Furthermore, we show that with increased social complexity TF activating domain diversity, one of the evolutionary and structural building blocks of TFs, decreases with gene family size while DNA binding domain diversity and number increases. This study highlights similarities in social transitions between Hymenoptera and Blattodea, with evidence of large changes in transcriptional regulation followed by lineage specific adaptations. We also show that phenotypic diversity in termites does not necessitate greater transcriptional complexity.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

In particular, yeasts have been reported as part of the core microbiome of seeds using next generation sequencing methods, but their diversity and functional roles remain largely undescribed. This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by characterizing the diversity of seed-associated yeasts across nine plant species (crops and non-cultivated species) using culturomics, microscopy, and metabarcoding.

Our results show that seed-associated yeasts largely belong to Basidiomycota phylum and more particularly to the Tremellomycetes class. This yeast collection covers 15 genera (2 of Ascomycota and 13 of Basidiomycota). Out of the 219 isolates described, the most frequently isolated yeasts were Holtermaniella, Vishniacozyma, Filobasidium, Naganishia and Sporobolomyces. The yeasts from these dominant genera were isolated from multiple plant species (4 to 8), except for Naganishia which only originated from Solanum lycopersicum L.. These results are also consistent with the fact that these dominant taxa were recently identified as members of the core seed microbiome, indicating their high prevalence and abundance across diverse plant hosts and environments. Compared to previous plant yeast diversity surveys, the members from Ascomycota are less frequent in seeds and only represented here by the Aureobasidium and Taphrina genera. Altogether, these results suggest that yeasts are generally well-adapted to the aboveground habitats of plants, but seeds represent a specific habitat that diverse Basidiomycota yeasts can colonize.

In patients with involved LNs, a robust T cell response correlated with absence of recurrence. In non-involved LNs, protection from metastases was linked to expanded sinuses colocalized with plasmablasts whereas CCR7+ cells and Tregs correlated with future development of distant metastases. We trained a model that predicts development of distant metastases with 79% and 93% AUC for non-metastatic and metastatic LNs, respectively.

To coordinate their growth with their cell wall status, plant cells have developed cell wall integrity (CWI) mechanisms, at the center of which lies the transmembrane Malectin-like receptor kinase FERONIA (FER). FER controls a myriad of plant developmental processes including sexual reproduction, cell growth and morphogenesis, often intersecting with phytohormones-dependent pathways such as abscisic acid (ABA) signaling or plant immunity. Interestingly, FER together with its downstream receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase MARIS (MRI) was shown to similarly control root hair and rhizoid integrity in the vascular angiosperm Arabidopsis and the early diverging bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha, respectively.

Here, we performed comparative transcriptomics and proteomics on the M. polymorpha mutant plants, Mpfer-1 and Mpmri-1, and their corresponding wild-type accessions Tak-1 and Tak-2. Large and significant overlaps were observed between differentially expressed genes and differentially abundant proteins in both mutants. Our multi-omics approach revealed that MpFER and MpMRI largely cooperate to negatively regulate transcriptional and translational networks, particularly those related to plant defense and ABA responses. Moreover, our phenotypic analyses showed that Mpfer-1 plants are hypersensitive to ABA-dependent growth inhibition, indicating that FERs function of negatively regulating ABA-related growth responses is conserved between bryophytes and vascular plants.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

Robust gene circuit design requires an understanding of how the combined actions of individual genetic components influence both mRNA and protein levels. Here, we simultaneously measure mRNA and protein levels in single cells using HCR Flow-FISH for a set of commonly used synthetic promoters. We find that promoters generate differences in both the mRNA abundance and the effective translation rate of these transcripts. Stronger promoters not only transcribe more RNA but also show higher effective translation rates. While the strength of the promoter is largely preserved upon genome integration with identical elements, the choice of polyadenylation signal and coding sequence can generate large differences in the profiles of the mRNAs and proteins. We used long-read direct RNA sequencing to characterize full-length mRNA isoforms and observe remarkable uniformity of mRNA isoforms from the transgenic units. Together, our high-resolution profiling of transgenic mRNAs and proteins offers insight into the impact of common synthetic genetic components on transcriptional and translational mechanisms. By developing a novel framework for quantifying expression profiles of transgenes, we have established a system for comparing native and synthetic gene regulation and for building more robust transgenic systems.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

Despite being the second most common inherited bleeding disorder, the pathophysiological mechanism underlying HHT-associated hemorrhage is poorly understood. Mutations in activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) gene cause HHT type 2. HHT pathogenesis is thought to follow a Knudsonian two-hit model, requiring a second somatic mutation for lesion formation. We hypothesize that somatic mutation of Alk1 in arterial endothelial cells (AECs) leads to arterial defects and hemorrhage. Here, we investigate the effects of Alk1 mutation in AECs in mice, using Bmx(PAC)-CreERT2-mediated postnatal somatic mutation. We mutated Alk1 in primarily AECs and found that somatic arterial endothelial mutation of Alk1 is sufficient to induce spontaneous epistaxis and multifocal cerebral microhemorrhage. Interestingly, this bleeding occurred in the presence of tortuous and enlarged blood vessels, loss of arterial molecular marker Efnb2, disorganization of vascular smooth muscle, and impaired vasoregulation. Our data suggest that arterial endothelial mutation of Alk1 causing reduced arterial identity and disruption of vascular smooth muscle cell coverage is a plausible molecular mechanism for HHT-associated severe epistaxis. This work provides the first evidence that somatic ALK1 loss in AECs can cause hemorrhagic vascular lesions, offering a novel preclinical model critically needed for studying HHT-associated epistaxis, and delineating an arterial mechanism to HHT pathophysiology.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

As a nascent technique, replication of its effects on brain function is important. Of particular interest is offline 5Hz repetitive TUS (5Hz-rTUS), originally reported by Zeng and colleagues [1] to elicit lasting corticospinal excitability increases, with large effect sizes.

Material and methodHere, we conducted a pre-registered (https://osf.io/p5n4q) replication of this protocol that benefitted from three additional features: double-blind application of TUS, neuronavigation for consistent TMS positioning, and acoustic simulations to assess M1 target exposure to TUS. Changes in resting motor thresholds (rMT), motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) in response to TUS (5Hz-rTUS vs. sham) were measured in the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles, with unbiased selection of participants. Transducer location was determined by the TMS-hotspot for motor representations of the right FDI, as in the original work.

ResultsNo significant effects of 5Hz-TUS (vs sham) were observed. Post-hoc simulations showed considerable variability of the acoustic focus, which was outside the anatomical M1-hand area in 67% of participants - in line with the known poor correspondence of TMS-hotspot location and M1-hand area.

ConclusionOur results indicate that the effect sizes of the neuromodulatory effects of 5Hz-rTUS on M1 may be more variable than previously appreciated. We suggest that double-blinding, neuronavigated TMS, individualised acoustic simulations for TUS targeting and pre-registration will aid reproducibility across studies.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

Given the harmful effects of uncontrolled PKR activation, cells must tightly regulate PKR to ensure that its activation occurs only in response to viral infections, not endogenous dsRNAs. Here, we use CRISPR-Translate, a FACS-based genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening method that exploits translation levels as a readout and identifies PACT as a key inhibitor of PKR during viral infection. We find that cells deficient for PACT hyperactivate PKR in response to several different RNA viruses, raising the question of why cells need to limit PKR activity. Our results demonstrate that PACT cooperates with ADAR1 to suppress PKR activation from self-dsRNAs in uninfected cells. The simultaneous deletion of PACT and ADAR1 results in synthetic lethality, which can be fully rescued in PKR-deficient cells. We propose that both PACT and ADAR1 act as essential barriers against PKR, creating a threshold of tolerable levels to endogenous dsRNA in cells without activating PKR-mediated translation shutdown and cell death.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying PC biosynthesis by PmtA remain largely unclear, owing to the lack of structural information. Here, we determined the crystal structures of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Pmt (AtPmtA) in complex with SAH or 5'-methylthioadenosine. Crystal structures and NMR analysis revealed the binding mode of AtPmtA to SAH in solution. Structure-based mutational analyses showed that a conserved tyrosine residue in the substrate-binding groove is involved in methylation. Furthermore, we showed that differences in substrate specificity among Pmt homologs were determined by whether the amino acid residues comprising the substrate-binding groove were isoleucine or phenylalanine. These findings provide a structural basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying Pmts-mediated PC biosynthesis.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

Previously, we used in situ cryo- electron tomography (cryo-ET) to reveal the native thylakoid architecture of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [1] and then map the molecular organization of these thylakoids with single-molecule precision [2]. However, it remains to be shown how generalizable this green algal blueprint is to the thylakoids of vascular plants, which possess distinct membrane architecture subdivided into grana stacks interconnected by non-stacked stromal lamellae. Here, we continue our cryo-ET investigation to reveal the molecular architecture of thylakoids within intact chloroplasts isolated from spinach (Spinacia oleracea). We visualize the fine ultrastructural details of grana membranes, as well as interactions between thylakoids and plastoglobules. We apply and further develop AI-based computational approaches for automated membrane segmentation and membrane protein picking [3], enabling us to quantify the organization of photosynthetic complexes within the plane of the thylakoid membrane and across adjacent stacked membranes. Our analysis reveals that, despite different 3D architecture, the molecular organization of thylakoid membranes in vascular plants and green algae is strikingly similar. In contrast to isolated plant thylakoids, where semi- crystalline arrays of photosystem II (PSII) appear to hold some membranes together, we find in intact chloroplasts that PSII is non-crystalline and has uniform concentration both within the membrane plane and across stacked grana membranes. Similar to C. reinhardtii, we observe strict lateral heterogeneity of PSII and PSI at the boundary between appressed and non-appressed thylakoid domains, with no evidence for a distinct grana margin region where these complexes have been proposed to intermix. Based on these measurements, we support a simple two-domain model for the molecular organization of thylakoid membranes in both green algae and plants.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

In the absence of ACKR2, elevated CCL11 leads to increased egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. As a result, eosinophil and monocyte interactions are reduced within the bone marrow niche, leading to changes in monocyte gene expression. Monocytes from ACKR2-/- mice are recruited to the tissues but are fundamentally altered in their ability to differentiate into macrophages, in the lung, peritoneal cavity and cavity wall. Bacterial elimination is impaired in ACKR2-/- mice during peritoneal infection. ACKR2 is therefore a key regulator of eosinophil-driven monocyte education in the bone marrow, required for full monocyte differentiation and macrophage function within the tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

Whereas updated guidelines exist for how to interpret and report on variants that are identified from NGS using bioinformatics pipelines, there is a need for standardised bioinformatics practices for diagnostics to ensure clinical consensus, accuracy, reproducibility and comparability of the results. This article presents consensus recommendations developed by 13 clinical bioinformatics units taking part in the Nordic Alliance for Clinical Genomics (NACG), by expert bioinformaticians working in clinical production. The recommendations are based on clinical practice and focus on analysis types, test and validation, standardisation and accreditation, as well as core competencies and technical management required for clinical bioinformatics operations. Key recommendations include adopting the hg38 genome build as the reference and a standard set of recommended analyses, including the use of multiple tools for structural variant (SV) calling and in-house data sets for filtering recurrent calls. Clinical bioinformatics production should operate under the ISO 15189 standard, utilising off-grid clinical-grade high-performance computing systems, standardised file formats, and strict code version control. Containerized software containers or environment management systems are needed to ensure reproducibility. Pipelines should be rigorously documented and tested for accuracy and reproducibility, minimally covering unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. Standard truth sets such as GIAB and SEQC2 for germline and somatic variant calling, respectively, should be supplemented by recall testing of previously validated clinical cases. Data integrity must be verified using file hashing, and sample identity should be checked via sample fingerprinting and genetically inferred identification markers such as sex and relatedness. Finally, clinical bioinformatics teams should encompass diverse skills, including software development, data management, quality assurance, and domain expertise in human genetics. These recommendations provide a consensus framework for standardising bioinformatics practices across clinical WGS applications and can serve as a practical guide to facilities that are new to large-scale sequencing-based diagnostics, or as a reference for those who already run high-volume clinical production using NGS.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110

A hierarchy of effects are identified, distinctly mediated by the Y chromosome, the dosage of X chromosomes, X-chromosome imprinting, and by Xist, the non-coding RNA that initiates X-inactivation. The sex chromosomes have strong trans effects on autosomal gene expression throughout preimplantation development. The Y chromosome has an unexpectedly pronounced impact on the trophectoderm, the precursor of the placenta, and this property is shared with genes expressed from the inactive X chromosome. The paternal and maternal X chromosomes differentially promote preimplantation growth, and we identify multiple novel candidate X-linked imprinted genes mediating this effect. Our findings show that sex chromosomes impact the embryo from the beginning of life, long before the appearance of overt sex differences.","NA","biorxiv",1732918080110
