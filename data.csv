We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1718057323650

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which convergently acquired S protein substitutions such as S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Furthermore, JN.1 subvariants such as LB.1 (JN.1.9.2.1) and KP.2.3 (JN.1.11.1.2.3), which convergently acquired S:S31del in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. We have recently reported the virological features of KP.2. Here we investigated the virological properties of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. We then performed virological and immunological experiments with pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323650

Chronic aberrations in these brain-body interactions are implicated in a broad spectrum of mental health disorders. However, the specific contributions of the gastric-brain coupling to affective symptoms remain poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between this novel interoceptive axis and mental health symptoms in 243 participants, using a cross validated machine learning approach. We find that frontal parietal brain coupling to the gastric rhythm indexes a dimensional signature of mental health spanning anxiety, depression, stress, and well-being. Control analyses confirm the specificity of these interactions to the gastric-brain axis. Our study establishes coupling between the stomach and brain as a factor in the pathology of mental health, and offers new targets for interventions remediating aberrant brain-body coupling.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323650

Here, we introduce an advanced TUS system that achieves unprecedented precision in deep brain neuromodulation. The system features a 256-element, helmet-shaped transducer array operating at 555 kHz, coupled with a stereotactic positioning system, individualised treatment planning, and real-time monitoring using functional MRI. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate the system's ability to selectively modulate the activity of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and its functionally connected regions in the visual cortex. Participants exhibited significantly increased visual cortex activity during concurrent TUS and visual stimulation, with high reproducibility across individuals. Moreover, a theta-burst TUS protocol induced robust neuromodulatory effects, with decreased visual cortex activity observed for at least 40 minutes post-stimulation. These neuromodulatory effects were specific to the targeted LGN, as confirmed by control experiments. Our findings highlight the potential of this advanced TUS system to non-invasively modulate deep brain circuits with high precision and specificity, offering new avenues for studying brain function and developing targeted therapies for neurological and psychiatric disorders. The unprecedented spatial resolution and prolonged neuromodulatory effects demonstrate the transformative potential of this technology for both research and clinical applications, paving the way for a new era of non-invasive deep brain neuromodulation.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323650

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323650

Our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the channeling of hepatocyte neutral lipids towards cytosolic LDs or secreted lipoproteins remains incomplete. Here, we performed a series of CRISPR-Cas9 screens under different metabolic states to uncover mechanisms of hepatic neutral lipid flux. Clustering of chemical-genetic interactions identified CLIC-like chloride channel 1 (CLCC1) as a critical regulator of neutral lipid storage and secretion. Loss of CLCC1 resulted in the buildup of large LDs in hepatoma cells and knockout in mice caused liver steatosis. Remarkably, the LDs are in the lumen of the ER and exhibit properties of lipoproteins, indicating a profound shift in neutral lipid flux. Finally, remote homology searches identified a domain in CLCC1 that is homologous to yeast Brl1p and Brr6p, factors that promote the fusion of the inner and outer nuclear envelopes during nuclear pore complex assembly. Loss of CLCC1 lead to extensive nuclear membrane herniations, consistent with impaired nuclear pore complex assembly. Thus, we identify CLCC1 as the human Brl1p/Brr6p homolog and propose that CLCC1-mediated membrane remodeling promotes hepatic neutral lipid flux and nuclear pore complex assembly.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323650

Key to lipid catabolism in the lysosome is bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a major lipid constituent of intralysosomal vesicles (ILVs) and a stimulator of lipid-degrading enzymes. BMP levels are altered in a broad spectrum of human conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. Although BMP synthase was recently discovered, it has long been thought that the unique stereochemistry of BMP confers resistance to acid phospholipases, a requirement for its role in the lysosome. Here, we demonstrate that PLA2G15, a major lysosomal phospholipase, efficiently hydrolyzes BMP with primary esters regardless of stereochemistry. Interestingly, we discover that the unique esterification position of BMP is what confers resistance to hydrolysis. Purified PLA2G15 catabolizes most BMP species derived from cell and tissue lysosomes under acidic conditions. Furthermore, PLA2G15 catalytic activity against synthesized BMP stereoisomers with primary esters was comparable to its canonical substrates. Conversely, BMP with secondary esters is intrinsically stable in vitro and requires acyl migration for hydrolysis in lysosomes. Consistent with our biochemical data, PLA2G15-deficient tissues and cells accumulate multiple BMP species, a phenotype reversible by supplementing wildtype PLA2G15 but not its catalytically dead mutant. Increasing BMP levels by targeting PLA2G15 reverses the cholesterol accumulation phenotype in Niemann Pick Disease Type C (NPC1) patient fibroblasts and significantly ameliorate disease pathologies in NPC1-deficient mice leading to extended lifespan. Our findings establish the rules that govern the stability of BMP in the lysosome and identify PLA2G15 as a lysosomal BMP hydrolase and as a potential target for modulating BMP levels for therapeutic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323650

MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial, several potential treatments for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were assessed in separate comparisons in RECOVERY, both of which are reported here. Eligible and consenting adults could join the molnupiravir comparison, the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, or both. For each comparison, participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the relevant antiviral (five days of molnupiravir 800mg twice daily or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir 300mg/100mg twice daily) or to usual care without the relevant antiviral drug, using web-based unstratified randomisation with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were time to discharge alive from hospital, and among those not on invasive ventilation at baseline, progression to invasive ventilation or death. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Both comparisons were stopped by the investigators because of low recruitment. ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsFrom 24 January 2022 to 24 May 2023, 923 patients were recruited to the molnupiravir comparison (445 allocated molnupiravir and 478 allocated usual care), and from 31 March 2022 to 24 May 2023, 137 patients were recruited to the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison (68 allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 69 allocated usual care). More than three-quarters of the patients in both comparisons were vaccinated and had anti-spike antibodies at randomisation, and more than two-thirds were receiving other SARS-CoV-2 antivirals (including remdesivir or sotrovimab). In the molnupiravir comparison, 74 (17%) patients allocated to molnupiravir and 79 (17%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.28; p=0.66). In the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, 13 (19%) patients allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 13 (19%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.47-2.23; p=0.96). In neither comparison was there evidence of a significant difference in the duration of hospitalisation or the proportion of patients progressing to invasive ventilation or death.

InterpretationIn adults hospitalised with COVID-19, neither molnupiravir nor nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were associated with reductions in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death although these comparisons had limited statistical power due to low recruitment.

In response, naked mole-rats have evolved a suite of molecular and physiological adaptations to survive extreme hypoxia. Yet, how naked mole-rats rewire their metabolism to protect the heart has not been comprehensively addressed. Here, we performed comparative analyses of naked mole-rat and mouse organs exposed to ischaemic conditions. We show that naked mole-rats have retained features of foetal cardiac metabolism replacing fatty acid utilisation for a unique type of carbohydrate metabolism largely dependent on glycogen. We found that naked mole-rats have co-opted specialised liver-like glycogen handling mechanisms in the heart. Amongst these is the expression of liver-specific enzyme isoforms and amylase, a digestive enzyme known for starch breakdown in saliva and intestine but whose biological role in glycogen processing has not been fully recognised. We show that amylase is rapidly activated in ischaemia and hydrolyses internal glycosidic bonds for more efficient downstream processing. This biochemical adaptation occurred in both mouse and naked mole-rat livers but exclusively in the naked mole-rat heart, which retained higher ATP levels by maintaining an increased glycolytic flux in an amylase-dependent mechanism. Overall, we discovered a previously unknown type of glycogen metabolism in the naked mole-rat that holds relevance to pathologies where glycogen plays a role. Furthermore, we describe a novel type of metabolic plasticity in the heart which may be harnessed for cardiac disease.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

Here we show that VPS13C, a bridge-like lipid transport protein and a PD gene, is a sensor of lysosome stress/damage. Upon lysosome membrane perturbation, VPS13C rapidly relocates from the cytosol to the surface of lysosomes where it tethers their membranes to the ER. This recruitment depends on Rab7 and requires release of a brake, most likely an intramolecular interaction within VPS13C, which hinders access of its VAB domain to lysosome-bound Rab7. While another PD protein, LRRK2, is also recruited to stressed/damaged lysosomes, its recruitment occurs at much later stages and by different mechanisms. Given the putative role of VPS13 proteins in bulk lipid transport, these findings suggest lipid delivery to lysosomes by VPS13C is part of an early response to lysosome damage.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

Besides eliminating mutant alleles in familial disease, gene-editing can also be used to favorably manipulate upstream pathophysiologic events and alter disease-course in wider patient populations, but few such feasible therapeutic avenues have been reported. Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the last exon of amyloid precursor protein (App), relevant for Alzheimer disease (AD). Our strategy effectively eliminates an endocytic (YENPTY) motif at APP C-terminus, while preserving the N-terminus and compensatory APP-homologues. This manipulation favorably alters events along the amyloid-pathway; inhibiting toxic APP-beta-cleavage fragments (including amyloid-beta; and upregulating neuroprotective APP-alpha-cleavage products. AAV-driven editing ameliorates neuropathologic, electrophysiologic, and behavioral deficits in an AD knockin mouse model. Effects persist for many months, and no abnormalities are seen in WT mice even after germline App-editing; underlining overall efficacy and safety. Pathologic alterations in the glial-transcriptome of App-KI mice, as seen by single nuclei RNA-sequencing (sNuc-Seq), are also normalized by App C-terminus editing. Our strategy takes advantage of innate transcriptional rules that render terminal exons insensitive to nonsense-decay, and the upstream manipulation is expected to be effective for all forms of AD. These studies offer a path for a one-time disease-modifying treatment for AD.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

However, the neural mechanisms are poorly understood, partly due to challenges replicating their metabolic effects in rodents. Here, we report a new mouse model that recapitulates overeating induced by clozapine, a widely prescribed APD. Our study shows that clozapine boosts food intake by inhibiting melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Interestingly, neither clozapine nor risperidone, another commonly used APD, affects receptor-ligand binding or the canonical Gs signaling of MC4R. Instead, they inhibit neuronal activity by enhancing the coupling between MC4R and Kir7.1, leading to the open state of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel. Deletion of Kir7.1 in Mc4r-Cre neurons prevents clozapine-induced weight gain, while treatment with a selective Kir7.1 blocker mitigates overeating in clozapine-fed mice. Our findings unveil a molecular pathway underlying the effect of APDs on feeding behavior and suggest its potential as a therapeutic target.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1718057323651

However, only a minority of infected cells undergo innate immune activation. By examining these ''first responder'' cells during West Nile virus infection, we found that specific accumulation of anti-genomic negative-sense viral RNA (-vRNA) underlies innate immune activation and that RIG-I preferentially interacts with -vRNA. However, flaviviruses sequester -vRNA into membrane-bound replication compartments away from cytosolic sensors. We found that single-stranded -vRNA accumulates outside of replication compartments in ''first responder'' cells, rendering it accessible to RLRs. Exposure of this -vRNA occurs at late timepoints of infection, is linked to viral assembly, and depends on the expression of viral structural proteins. These findings reveal that while most infected cells replicate high levels of vRNA, release of -vRNA from replication compartments during assembly occurs at low frequency and is critical for initiation of innate immunity during flavivirus infection.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

Here, we demonstrate a general framework for identifying genetic tool-independent, pharmacological strategies for neural circuit-selective modulation. We developed an economically accessible calcium imaging-based approach for large-scale pharmacological scans of endogenous receptor-mediated neural activity. As a testbed for this approach, we used the mouse locus coeruleus due to the combination of its widespread, modular efferent neural circuitry and its wide variety of endogenously expressed GPCRs. Using machine learning-based action potential deconvolution and retrograde tracing, we identified an agonist cocktail that selectively inhibits medial prefrontal cortex-projecting locus coeruleus neurons. In vivo, this cocktail produces synergistic antinociception, consistent with selective pharmacological blunting of this neural circuit. This framework has broad utility for selective targeting of other neural circuits under different physiological and pathological states, facilitating non-genetic translational applications arising from cell type-selective discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

However, it is unclear whether kinetochores are mere docking sites for SAC proteins, or further contribute to co-orientation of SAC catalysts, including MAD1:MAD2 and BUB1:BUB3, to facilitate SAC signaling. Here, we combined biochemical reconstitutions of kinetochores and the SAC to address this question in vitro. We engineered recombinant kinetochore particles that recruit most SAC components and activate SAC signaling after induction with Rapamycin, and challenged them with a battery of impairing mutants. At approximately physiological concentrations of SAC catalysts, kinetochores were crucially required for rapid assembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), the SAC effector. Our observations depict kinetochores as a cradle that catalyzes rapid MCC assembly by concentrating and co-orienting distinct SAC catalysts.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

The oscillation period of the human segmentation clock, as measured in induced presomitic mesoderm (iPSM) cells, is two times longer than that of mouse. While the core clock gene HES7 is known to show slower protein degradation in human iPSM compared with mouse iPSM, it remains unclear whether the concept of species-specific protein stability is generalizable to other genes. Here we systematically compared the protein degradation rates of approximately 5000 genes between human and mouse iPSM by using dynamic SILAC-based proteomics, demonstrating a pervasive trend of slower protein degradation in human cells. The inter-species difference was observed not only for proteasome-mediated but also for lysosome-mediated degradation. We further investigated the effect of metabolism on the protein stability profile. Treating mouse iPSM cells with a glycolysis inhibitor extended the segmentation clock period, aligning the protein stability profile more closely with that of human cells, though with less effect on lysosome-mediated degradation.

A series of studies have therefore used willingness to wait for delayed rewards as a proxy for decision confidence. However, interpretation of waiting behavior is limited because it is unclear how environmental statistics influence optimal waiting, and how sources of internal variability influence subjects' behavior. We trained rats to perform a confidence-guided waiting task, and derived expressions for optimal waiting that make relevant environmental statistics explicit, including travel time incurred traveling from one reward opportunity to another. We found that rats waited longer than fully optimal agents, but that their behavior was closely matched by optimal agents with travel times constrained to match their own. We developed a process model describing the decision to stop waiting as an accumulation to bound process, which allowed us to compare the effects of multiple sources of internal variability on waiting. Surprisingly, although mean wait times grew with confidence, variability did not, inconsistent with scalar invariant timing, and best explained by variability in the stopping bound. Our results describe a tractable process model that can capture the influence of environmental statistics and internal sources of variability on subjects' decision process during confidence-guided waiting.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

Initially studied in mammals and birds, recent findings have identified CMA in fish, reshaping our understanding of its evolution across metazoans. Given the exciting perspectives this finding offered, we have now developed the required tools to investigate and functionally asses that CMA function in a powerful fish genetic model: the zebrafish (Danio rerio). After adapting and validating a fluorescent reporter (KFERQ-Dendra2; previously used to track CMA in mammalian cells) in zebrafish primary embryonic cells, we first demonstrated CMA functionality in this fish species. Then, we developed a transgenic zebrafish line expressing the KFERQ-Dendra2 CMA reporter, enabling the real-time tracking of CMA activity in vivo. This model revealed heterogeneous CMA responses within tissues, highlighting the zebrafish as a valuable model for investigating tissue-specific and cell-scale variations in CMA. Moreover, a novel role for CMA has been uncovered, acting as a gatekeeper of sperm cell proteostasis, thereby playing a crucial role in the production of active and high-quality spermatozoa. Overall, these findings emphasize the zebrafish as a pivotal model for advancing our comprehension of the fundamental mechanisms underlying CMA.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

However, little is known about how the microbial community in the rumen responds to Asparagopsis supplementation, and how changes in the rumen microbiome may contribute to shifts in rumen function and ultimately the hosts phenotype. In this study, we generated and analyzed metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from the microbiome associated with rumen fluid collected from two cohorts of lactating dairy cows, one fed a diet supplemented with Asparagopsis armata (treatment) and another fed the same diet without A. armata supplementation (control). The reduction of CH4 emission from animals that received A. armata was coupled to a qualitative decrease in relative archaeal abundance and a significant reduction in the transcription of methanogenesis pathways. Additionally, a significant decrease in the transcription of genes for complex carbon catabolism and a re-organization of the expression profile of carbon catabolic genes at the species level was observed in treated animals. Increased H2 production, a consequence of methanogenesis suppression, was coupled to a significant increase in the transcription of hydrogenases that mediate hydrogenotrophic metabolism in the treatment group. Analysis of metatranscriptome data identified a single uncultured hydrogenotrophic bacterial species (a Duodenibacillus sp.) as the dominant driver of this transcriptional change. Comparative genomic analysis between the Duodenibacillus sp. and other hydrogenotrophic rumen organisms revealed metabolic traits in the Duodenibacillus that may provide a competitive advantage in H2 scavenging. These findings provide an initial understanding of how rumen microbiota respond to a promising CH4 reducing feed additive, and may serve as a model to understand alternative stable rumen microbiome states that produce less methane and increase animal productivity.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

However, the contribution of other checkpoints is unknown. Here, we reveal that Lag3 and PD-L1 pathways are the major regulators of TCR signalling in adaptively tolerised CD4+ T cells. Lag3 and PD-L1 co-blockade (CB) drove additive and synergistic changes in T cell activation, resulting in a transcriptional profile dominated by a NFAT-biased/ T follicular helper cell signature. Mechanistically, CB led to an enhanced duration of TCR signalling, which drove a transcriptional motif of TCR signal duration-sensitive genes. In addition, CB synergistically upregulated CCR6, leading to enhanced CCL20-dependent migration. Analysis of datasets from humans on anti-PD-1 and anti-Lag3 immunotherapy revealed upregulation of CCR6 and ICOS in blood effector memory CD4+ T cells, underscoring the translational relevance of our findings. The PD-L1 and Lag3 pathways, therefore, are major regulators of TCR signal duration in adaptively tolerised CD4+ T cells in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

Two actionable variants in these genes have reached much higher frequencies than in cosmopolitan UK populations. Here, we report a BRCA2 splice acceptor variant, c.517-2A>G, found in breast and ovarian cancer families from Shetland. We investigated the frequency and origin of this variant in a population-based research cohort of people of Shetland ancestry, VIKING I. The variant segregates with female breast and ovarian cancer in diagnosed cases and is classified as pathogenic. Exome sequence data from 2,108 participants with three or more Shetlandic grandparents in VIKING I was used to estimate the population prevalence of c.517-2A>G in Shetlanders. Nine VIKING I research volunteers carry this variant, on a shared haplotype (carrier frequency 0.4%). This frequency is [~]130-fold higher than in UK Biobank, where the small group of carriers has a different haplotype. Records of birth, marriage and death indicate genealogical linkage of VIKING I carriers to a founder from the Isle of Whalsay, Shetland, similar to our observations for the BRCA1 founder variant from Westray, Orkney. In total, 93.5% of pathogenic BRCA variant carriers in Northern Isles exomes are accounted for by these two drifted variants. We thus provide the scientific evidence of an opportunity for screening people of Orcadian and Shetlandic origins for each drifted pathogenic variant, particularly women with Westray or Whalsay ancestry.","NA","medrxiv",1718057323651

Content-dependent corrections overparameterize protein alignment models. Here, we propose an approach that is based on (dis)similarily measures, which do not use the marginal probability, and score only probabilities of finding amino acids in pairs. The dissimilarity scoring matrix endows a metric space on the set of aligned sequences. This allowed us to develop new heuristics.

We suggest that such alignments that are done without explicit evolution-based modeling assumptions should be used for testing hypotheses about evolution of proteins (e.g., molecular phylogenetics).","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

The physiological response was highly consistent across experiments, indicating the involvement of an epigenetic mechanism, leading us to investigated differences in DNA methylation. Our results identified a large number of alterations in DNA methylation patterns between fluctuating light acclimated plants, and square light acclimated plants, demonstrating natural fluctuations in light impacts the plant epigenetic mechanisms. Most importantly, there are more differences in DNA methylation patterns between different light pattern regimes than between different light intensities. These differences in DNA methylation were accompanied by significant changes in gene expression, some of which correlated with altered DNA methylation. Interestingly, several transposable elements which displayed differential methylation were found to be differentially expressed between light regimes. Our data suggests DNA methylation plays a role in acclimation to natural light which may directly regulate gene expression and impact transposable element activation.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

To address this question, we performed large-scale recordings from neurons in both somatosensory cortices (S1) while mice shared information between their hemispheres and discriminated between two categories of bilateral stimuli. When expert mice touched stimuli associated with reward, they moved their whiskers with greater bilateral symmetry. During this period, synchronous spiking and enhanced spike-field coupling emerged between the hemispheres. This coordinated activity was absent in stimulus-matched naive animals, indicating that interhemispheric (IH) binding was controlled by a goal-directed, internal process. In S1 neurons, the addition of ipsilateral touch primarily facilitated the contralateral, principal whisker response. This facilitation primarily emerged for reward-associated stimuli and was lost on trials where expert mice failed to respond. Taken together, these results reveal a novel state-dependent logic underlying bilateral integration in S1, where stimulus binding and facilitation are controlled by behavioral relevance.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

Under interpretable regularity conditions, we show that the proportion of detectable identity-by-descent segments at a locus is normally distributed for large sample size and large scaled population size. We use efficient and exact simulations to study the distributional behavior of the detectable identity-by-descent rate in finite samples.

High-quality evidence syntheses (ES) are essential for policy-making. Search filters - validated combinations of search terms - play an important role in implementing robust search methods for ES. The identification of climate-health evidence presents challenges, such as the volume and multidisciplinary nature of the evidence and the fact that relevant studies do not consistently state their link to CC. Thus, our aim was to develop search filters for two search interfaces of the MEDLINE database. Methods: CC impacts human health via several exposure pathways: extreme weather events, heat stress, air quality, water quality and quantity, food supply and safety, vector distribution and ecology, and social factors. We established a gold standard by comprehensively identifying health-related ES mentioning CC in five literature databases in February 2021. After screening 8,614 search results, we identified 110 ES for inclusion, extracted their included studies, and classified them according to exposure pathways. From this gold standard we empirically derived search terms per pathway and tested their performance with an independent set of studies. Results: We extracted 2,324 studies from the first 79 ES. Based on a gold standard with 1,572 relevant studies indexed in PubMed, it was possible to develop and validate search filters with a sensitivity of 95%, 97% and 99% for six of the seven major climate-health exposure pathways. Filter development was not possible for one pathway due to the lack of coverage in MEDLINE. Conclusion: We designed ready-to-use PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE search filters with a graded sensitivity for most exposure pathways linking CC with human health. These can be deployed by public and global health researchers conducting ES or primary research on climate-health to ensure robust identification of relevant evidence.

The study of duplication is central to understanding protein evolution, but the detection of repetitive sequence patterns is often challenging due to decreasing similarity between internal repeats resulting from long-term divergence. The most sensitive sequence-based repeat detection method, HHrepID, relies on the construction of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to enhance homology signals and thus facilitate the detection of very ancient duplications. However, such an alignment-based approach is slow and limits the ability to perform large-scale scans. Recent advances in protein representation learning have introduced sequence embeddings extracted from protein language models as a powerful and much faster alternative to MSAs. Protein sequence representations have been shown to be effective in homology detection, as exemplified by software such as our recently developed pLM-BLAST. In this study, we implement pLM-Repeat, a pipeline built upon pLM-BLAST, to identify repeats encoded in sequence embeddings. pLM-Repeat achieves comparable sensitivity to HHrepID in detecting the presence of repeats, while predicting many more repeat units and providing significantly better run times. We further trained a neural network DeepRepeat for the detection of domains that have patterns similar to well-characterized repeat folds to support fast filtering. Using our newly developed tools, we scanned the AFDB90v4 database and identified a collection of novel and undescribed repeat proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

Silencing these neurons increased spontaneous activity during locomotion and impaired visual responses in L2/3 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, the contrast-dependent visual response of neurogliaform cells varies with their laminar location and is constrained by their morphology and input connectivity.

To explore how the microbiome may impact PD-associated genetic risks, we quantitatively profiled nearly 630 metabolites from 26 biochemical classes in the gut, plasma, and brain of -synuclein-overexpressing (ASO) mice with or without microbiota. We observe tissue-specific changes driven by genotype, microbiome, and their interaction.

Although rare worldwide, LFS is prevalent in Southern Brazil due to a founder pathogenic variant, c.1010G>A, p.Arg337His (R337H), discovered through its association with risk of childhood adrenal cortical carcinoma. Methods Here, we have analyzed tumor patterns, cancer risk, sex differences and temporal tumor trends in a cohort of 303 adult R337H carriers and we have compared them with those of 405 adult carriers of other TP53 variants typical of LFS. Findings Compared to the latter, R337H carriers had a lower cumulative risk of developing cancer (54% for R337H vs 78% for other TP53 variants at age 50 years). Female R337H carriers were at a higher risk than males (65% vs 30% at age 50 years) and had a higher risk of developing a second primary cancer, underscoring a strong sex bias not observed in carriers of other variants. The most common cancers were breast (75%), soft tissue sarcoma (9%) and lung cancer (8%) in females, and soft tissue sarcoma (30%), prostate (13%) and lung cancer (12%) in males. Common second malignancies were breast cancer in females and lung cancer in males. Interpretations Overall, this study confirms that R337H is associated with a lifetime risk of multiple cancers of the LFS spectrum but with incomplete penetrance, particularly in males. Our findings suggest that R337H carriers would benefit from adapted lifetime and surveillance strategies for risk reduction.","NA","medrxiv",1718057323651

One major cell state change is senescence, which is associated with dramatic changes in cell metabolism, including increases in lipid metabolism, but how cells accommodate such alterations is poorly understood. Here, we show that the transcription factor p53 enables recycling of the lipid headgroups required to meet the increased demand for membrane phospholipids during senescence. p53 activation increases supply of phosphoethanolamine (PEtn), an intermediate in the Kennedy pathway for de novo synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), by transactivating genes involved in autophagy and lysosomal catabolism that enable membrane turnover. Disruption of PEtn conversion to PE is well-tolerated in the absence of p53 but results in dramatic organelle remodeling and perturbs growth and gene expression following p53 activation. Consistently, CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screens reveal that p53-activated cells preferentially depend on genes involved in lipid metabolism.

It has been isolated as part of the gut microbiome of animals and insects, as well as from stool samples of patients with diarrhea. Specific P. alcalifaciens strains encode gene homologs of virulence factors found in other pathogenic members of the same Enterobacterales order, such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Shigella flexneri. Whether these genes are also pathogenic determinants in P. alcalifaciens is not known. Here we have used P. alcalifaciens 205/92, a clinical isolate, with in vitro and in vivo infection models to investigate P. alcalifaciens-host interactions at the cellular level. Our particular focus was the role of two type III secretion systems (T3SS) belonging to the Inv-Mxi/Spa family. T3SS1b is widespread in Providencia spp. and encoded on the chromosome. T3SS1a is encoded on a large plasmid that is present in a subset of P. alcalifaciens strains, which are primarily isolates from diarrheal patients. Using a combination of electron and fluorescence microscopy and gentamicin protection assays we show that P. alcalifaciens 205/92 is internalized into eukaryotic cells, rapidly lyses its internalization vacuole and proliferates in the cytosol. This triggers caspase-4 dependent inflammasome responses in gut epithelial cells. The requirement for the T3SS1a in entry, vacuole lysis and cytosolic proliferation is host-cell type specific, playing a more prominent role in human intestinal epithelial cells as compared to macrophages. In a bovine ligated intestinal loop model, P. alcalifaciens colonizes the intestinal mucosa, inducing mild epithelial damage with negligible fluid accumulation. No overt role for T3SS1a or T3SS1b was seen in the calf infection model. However, T3SS1b was required for the rapid killing of Drosophila melanogaster. We propose that the acquisition of two T3SS by horizontal gene transfer has allowed P. alcalifaciens to diversify its host range, from a highly virulent pathogen of insects to an opportunistic gastrointestinal pathogen of animals.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

Lactate Dehydrogenase (Ldh) and Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpdh1) support larval biosynthetic metabolism by maintaining NAD+/NADH redox balance and promoting glycolytic flux. Consistent with the cooperative functions of Ldh and Gpdh1, the loss of both enzymes, but neither single enzyme, induces a developmental arrest. However, Ldh and Gpdh1 exhibit complex and often mutually exclusive expression patterns, suggesting that the Gpdh1; Ldh double mutant lethal phenotype could be mediated nonautonomously. Here we find that the developmental arrest displayed by the double mutants extends beyond simple metabolic disruption and instead stems, in part, from changes in systemic growth factor signaling. Specifically, we demonstrate that this synthetic lethality is linked to the upregulation of Upd3, a cytokine involved in the Jak/Stat signaling pathway. Moreover, we demonstrate that either loss of the Upd3 or dietary administration of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) rescue the synthetic lethal phenotype of Gpdh1; Ldh double mutants. Together, these findings demonstrate that metabolic disruptions within a single tissue can nonautonomously modulate interorgan signaling to ensure synchronous developmental growth.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

This study used three population-based cohorts of younger and older adults (n=1,950) from the Human Connectome Project-Young Adult (HCP-YA), HCP-Aging (HCP-A), and enhanced Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland sample (eNKI-RS). Several canonical correlation analyses were computed within a machine learning framework to assess the associations between each of the three domains (sleep quality, depressive symptoms, grey matter volume (GMV)) and MP. The HCP-YA analyses showed progressively stronger associations between MP and each domain: depressive symptoms (unexpectedly positive, r=0.13, SD=0.06), sleep quality (r=0.17, SD=0.05), and GMV (r=0.19, SD=0.06). Combining sleep and depressive symptoms significantly improved the canonical correlations (r=0.25, SD=0.05), while the addition of GMV exhibited no further increase (r=0.23, SD=0.06). In young adults, better sleep quality, mild depressive symptoms, and GMV of several brain regions were associated with better MP. This was conceptually replicated in young adults from the eNKI-RS cohort. In HCP-Aging, better sleep quality, fewer depressive symptoms, and increased GMV were associated with MP. Robust multivariate associations were observed between sleep quality, depressive symptoms and GMV with MP, as well as age-related variations in these factors. Future studies should further explore these associations and consider interventions targeting sleep and mental health to test the potential effects on MP across the lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) -- a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GAN's generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

However, sex chromosomes can also facilitate this by directly linking gene expression to sex. Moreover, heteromorphic sex chromosomes often exhibit different gene content, which contributes to sexual dimorphism. Understanding patterns of sex-biased gene expression across organisms is important for gaining insight about the evolution of sexual dimorphism and sex chromosomes. Moreover, studying gene expression in species with recently established sex chromosomes can help understand the evolutionary dynamics of gene loss and dosage compensation. The threespine stickleback is known for its strong sexual dimorphism, especially during the reproductive period. Sex is determined by a young XY sex chromosome pair with three non-recombining regions that have started to degenerate. Using the high multiplexing capability of 3' QuantSeq to sequence the sex-biased transcriptome of liver, gills and brain, we provide the first characterization of sex-specific transcriptomes from ~80 stickleback (40 males and 40 females) collected from a natural population during the reproductive period. We find that the liver is extremely differentiated (36% of autosomal genes) and reflects ongoing reproduction, while the brain shows very low levels of differentiation (0.78%) with no particular functional enrichment. Finally, the gills exhibit high levels of differentiation (5%), suggesting that sex should be considered in physiological and ecotoxicological studies of gill responses in fishes. We also find that sex-biased gene expression in X-linked genes is mainly driven by a lack of dosage compensation. However, sex-biased expression of genes that have conserved copies on both sex chromosomes is likely driven by the degeneration of Y allele expression and a down-regulation of male-beneficial mutations on the X chromosome.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

Because species traits can plastically respond to competition, the competitive effect of one individual on another involves not only reductions in performance, but also changes in morphology, behavior, phenology or physiology that affect interactions with other individuals. In this context, plasticity is often argued to favor species coexistence by increasing the niche differentiation between species, though experimental support that explicitly considers competitive outcomes is largely lacking. Here, we transiently subjected four annual plant species to early-season intraspecific or interspecific competition to explicitly induce plastic responses, and then examined the response of these individuals to other competitors. By measuring the interactions between the species with and without early-season competitors, we isolated the impact of plasticity on species interactions and coexistence. Growing with nearby competitors early in life impacted plant traits including height and morphology. These plastic responses tended to amplify the sensitivity of individuals to competition, and particularly so for interspecific competition. This increase in inter- relative to intraspecific competition caused plasticity to decrease the predicted likelihood of pairwise coexistence. By combining recent theory with a new experimental approach, we provide a pathway towards integrating phenotypic plasticity into our quantitative understanding of coexistence.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

Yet, studies rarely, if ever, consider the possibility that systematic differences in inner experience (i.e., what subjects think and feel during the scan) may directly affect FC measures. Here we demonstrate that is the case using a rs-fMRI dataset comprising 471 scans annotated with experiential data. Wide-spread significant differences in FC are observed between scans that systematically differ in terms of reported in-scanner experience.

In this study, we employed an unbiased screening approach to discover broadly neutralizing antibodies and successfully isolated two mAbs from individuals with only exposure to ancestral SARS-CoV-2. One of these antibodies, CYFN1006-1, exhibited robust cross-neutralization against a spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the latest JN.1 and KP.2 variants, with consistent IC50 values ranging from ~1 to 5 ng/mL. Notably, it also displayed broad neutralization activity against SARS-CoV and related sarbecoviruses, such as WIV1, SHC014, RaTG13, and GD-Pangolin. Structural analysis revealed that these mAbs target shared hotspot but mutation-resistant epitopes, with their Fabs locking the RBD in the ""down"" conformation through interactions with adjacent Fabs and RBDs, and cross-linking Spike trimers into di-trimers to block viral infection. In vivo studies conducted in a JN.1-infected hamster model validated the protective efficacy of CYFN1006-1, emphasizing its therapeutic potential.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) dysregulates GI physiology, including bowel movements (motility), but in many IBD patients, GI motility disorders persist in remission through a poorly understood pathological process. Here we uncover that post-inflammatory GI dysmotility (PI-GID) stems from structural ENS remodeling driven by a combination of neuronal loss and neurogenesis. Enteric neurons respond to mucosal inflammation by upregulating CCL2 expression and facilitating the recruitment of CCR2+ monocytes into the neural myenteric plexus within the intestinal muscle. This is followed by the expansion of monocyte-derived macrophages and their migration into the myenteric ganglia and phagocytosis of neurons. However, excessive recruitment of monocytes results in disproportionate ENS remodeling and PI-GID. The expansion of inflammatory cells is known to promote tissue hypoxia. We find that enteric neurons become hypoxic upon colitis, but hypoxia-induced signaling via HIF1a; initiates an adaptation program in enteric neurons to attenuate CCL2 expression and limit monocyte recruitment. We demonstrate that reinforcing HIF1a; signaling in enteric neurons prevents PI-GID by reducing colitis-associated monocyte recruitment in the myenteric plexus and protecting against ENS remodeling. In summary, our findings unveil PI-GID pathogenesis and identify a regulatory axis for its prevention.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

Twin studies and recent Genome-Wide Association Studies have demonstrated a strong genetic basis of frailty but there remains a lack of genetic studies exploring genetic prediction of Frailty. Previous work has shown that a single polygenic predictor - represented by a Frailty polygenic score - predicts Frailty, measured via the frailty index, in independent samples within the United Kingdom. We extended this work, using a multi-polygenic score (MPS) approach to increase predictive power. Predictor variables - twenty-six polygenic scores (PGS) were modelled in regularised Elastic net regression models, with repeated cross-validation, to estimate joint prediction of the polygenic scores and order the predictions by their contributing strength to Frailty in two independent cohorts aged 65+ - the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936). Results showed that the MPS explained 3.6% and 4.7% of variance compared to the best single-score prediction of 2.6% and 2.2% of variance in ELSA and LBC1936 respectively. The strongest polygenic predictors of worsening frailty came from PGS for Chronic pain, Frailty and Waist circumference; whilst PGS for Parental Death, Educational attainment, and Rheumatoid Arthritis were found to be protective to frailty. Results from the predictors remaining in the final model were then validated using the longitudinal LBC1936, with equivalent PGS scores from the same GWAS summary statistics. Thus, this MPS approach provides new evidence for the genetic contributions to frailty in later life and sheds light on the complex structure of the Frailty Index measurement.","NA","medrxiv",1718057323651

The H3K27M driver histone mutation leads to transcriptional dysregulation, indicating that targeting the epigenome and transcription may be key therapeutic strategies against this highly aggressive cancer. One such target is the Facilitates Chromatin Transcription (FACT) histone chaperone. We found FACT to be enriched at developmental gene promoters, coinciding with regions of open chromatin and binding motifs of core DMG regulatory transcription factors. Furthermore, FACT interacted and co-localized with the Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal Domain (BET) protein BRD4 at promoters and enhancers, suggesting functional cooperation between FACT and BRD4 in DMG. In vitro, a combinatorial therapeutic approach using the FACT inhibitor CBL0137, coupled with BET inhibition revealed potent and synergistic cytotoxicity across a range of DMG cultures, with H3K27M-mutant cells demonstrating heightened sensitivity. These results were recapitulated in vivo, significantly extending survival in three independent orthotopic PDX models of DMG. Mechanistically, we show that CBL0137 treatment decreased chromatin accessibility, synergizing with BET inhibition to disrupt transcription, silencing several key oncogenes including MYC, PDGFRA and MDM4, as well as causing alterations to the splicing landscape. Combined, these data highlight the therapeutic promise of simultaneously targeting FACT and BRD4 in DMG, proposing a novel strategy for combating this devastating pediatric brain tumor.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

We present the Successor Sequence Predictor (SSP) as an innovative solution. Successor Sequence Predictor is an in silico method that mimics laboratory-based protein evolution by reconstructing a protein's evolutionary history and suggesting future amino acid substitutions based on trends observed in that history through carefully selected physicochemical descriptors. This approach enhances specialised proteins by predicting mutations that improve desired properties, such as thermostability, activity, and solubility. Successor Sequence Predictor can thus be used as a general protein engineering tool to develop practically useful proteins.

The gut microbiome has been shown to enhance absorption of nutrients, such as lipids, by intestinal epithelial cells. However, whether protein absorption is also affected by the gut microbiome is poorly understood. Here, we investigate connections between protein absorption and microbes in the zebrafish gut. Using live microscopy-based quantitative assays, we find that microbes slow the pace of protein uptake and degradation in LREs. While microbes do not affect the number of absorbing LRE cells, microbes lower the expression of endocytic and protein digestion machinery in LREs. Using transgene assisted cell isolation and single cell RNA-sequencing, we characterize all intestinal cells that take up dietary protein. We find that microbes affect expression of bacteria-sensing and metabolic pathways in LREs, and that some secretory cell types also take up protein and share components of protein uptake and digestion machinery with LREs. Using custom-formulated diets, we investigated the influence of diet and LRE activity on the gut microbiome. Impaired protein uptake activity in LREs, along with a protein-deficient diet, alters the microbial community and leads to increased abundance of bacterial genera that have the capacity to reduce protein uptake in LREs. Together, these results reveal that diet-dependent reciprocal interactions between LREs and the gut microbiome regulate protein absorption.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

By combining supernatant and competition assays with an established linear model method, we show that both factors have significant effects on functioning, but identity effects generally outweigh strain interaction effects. These results hold irrespective of whether strains interactions are inferred statistically or approximated experimentally. Our results have implications for microbiome engineering, as the success of approaches aiming to induce beneficial (probiotic) strain interactions will be sensitive to strain identity effects in many communities.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

However, non-declarative memories do not require the hippocampus for learning or for sleep-dependent consolidation19-26 meaning what drives their consolidation is unknown. Here we show, using an unsupervised method, that replay occurs in the dorsal striatum of mice during offline consolidation of a non-declarative, procedural, memory and that this replay is generated independently of the hippocampus. Replay occurred at both real-world and time-compressed speeds and was also prioritised both at the level of the individual neurons and the type of neural sequence. Complete bilateral lesions of the hippocampus had no effect on any feature of this replay. Our results demonstrate that procedural replay during consolidation of a non-declarative memory is independent of the hippocampus.

This is because it is challenging to distinguish between adverse effects arising from the properties of the expressed excess protein (cytotoxicity) and those caused solely by protein overexpression. In this study, we attempted to identify the model protein with the lowest cytotoxicity in yeast cells by introducing a new neutrality index. We found that a non-fluorescent fluorescent protein (mox-YG) and an inactive glycolytic enzyme (Gpm1-CCmut) showed the lowest cytotoxicity. These proteins can be expressed at levels exceeding 40% of total protein while maintaining yeast growth. The transcriptome of cells expressing mox-YG to the limit indicated that the cells were in a nitrogen source requirement state. Proteome analysis revealed increased mitochondrial function and decreased ribosome abundance, like the inactivated state of the TORC1 pathway. The decrease in ribosome abundance was presumably due to defective nucleolus formation, partially rescued by a mutation in the nuclear exosome. These findings suggest that massive overexpression of excess protein, termed protein burden, causes nitrogen source starvation, a metabolic shift toward more energy-efficient respiration, and a ribosomal biosynthesis defect due to an imbalance between ribosomal protein and rRNA synthesis in the nucleolus.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

The database encompasses 1,053 samples (277 integrated datasets) from 67 AD-related scRNA-seq & snRNA-seq studies, totaling 7,332,202 cells. Additionally, it archives 381 ST datasets from 18 human and mouse brain studies. Each dataset is annotated with details such as species, gender, brain region, disease/control status, age, and AD Braak stages. ssREAD also provides an analysis suite for cell clustering, identification of differentially expressed and spatially variable genes, cell-type-specific marker genes and regulons, and spot deconvolution for integrative analysis. ssREAD is freely available at https://bmblx.bmi.osumc.edu/ssread/.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

While the influence of life history traits on invasive success is well-established, the role of behavior in the invasive potential of animals is less studied. The common coqui frog, Eleutherodactylus coqui, is a highly successful invader in Hawaii. We build on previous research characterizing changes in physiology and morphology to explore behavioral variation across the invasive range of coqui in Hawaii. We hypothesized that behavioral traits contributing to invasion expansion would be reflected in behavioral differences at the invasive center versus invasive edge. To investigate whether differences in the field represent local adaptation or behavioral plasticity, we additionally evaluated behavior following acclimation to a shared laboratory environment. While we identified only subtle behavioral variation among populations in the field, we found that individuals from all populations became less bold, active, and exploratory in the laboratory, converging on a similar behavioral phenotype. Alongside previous work, our results suggest that coqui adjust their behavior to local environmental conditions across their invasive range, and that behavioral flexibility may contribute to invasive success.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

This is a case of sound-symbolism, known as the Bouba-Kiki effect. Studies on four-months infants suggest that this effect might constitute a predisposed perceptual mechanism. However, these studies suffered from the impossibility of ruling out a fast experience-driven origin of the effect resulting from infants speed of learning, their sensitivity to environmental regularities, and the large number of sound-symbolic associations to which they are precociously exposed when interacting with adults. To better describe its ontogeny and fill in this gap, we tested the Bouba-Kiki effect in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus). Being a precocial species, chicks can be tested on the very early days of life, allowing for a virtually total control of their experience before test. Three-day-old chicks (n=42) first learned to circumnavigate a panel to obtain a food reward. Then, they were presented with two identical panels, one depicting a spiky shape, and one depicting a round shape, while hearing either the sound  Bouba or  Kiki. We recorded which panel chicks chose with either sound, in a total of 24 trials. Chicks preferred the panel with the spiky shape when hearing the  Kiki sound, and that with the round shape when hearing the  Bouba sound. Results from naive baby chicks hint at a predisposed mechanism for matching the two dimensions of shape and sound that may be widespread across species.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

SummaryAmong 47561 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine was 23% effective against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1718057323651

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded. We report the value of wastewater sequencing to track avian influenza.","NA","medrxiv",1718057323651

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

Here, we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), a genome editing system that combines the programmability and precision of CRISPR/Cas9 with the RNA-mediated gene insertion capabilities of the human LINE1 (L1) element. CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1718057323651

Recently, H5 viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b have caused large outbreaks in avian and multiple non-human mammalian species1,2. Previous studies have identified molecular phenotypes of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein that contribute to pandemic potential in humans, including cell entry, receptor preference, HA stability, and reduced neutralization by polyclonal sera3-6. However, prior experimental work has only measured how these phenotypes are affected by a handful of the >10,000 different possible amino-acid mutations to HA. Here we use pseudovirus deep mutational scanning7 to measure how all mutations to a 2.3.4.4b H5 HA affect each phenotype. We identify mutations that allow HA to better bind 2-6-linked sialic acids, and show that some viruses already carry mutations that stabilize HA. We also measure how all HA mutations affect neutralization by sera from mice and ferrets vaccinated against or infected with 2.3.4.4b H5 viruses. These antigenic maps enable rapid assessment of when new viral strains have acquired mutations that may create mismatches with candidate vaccine strains. Overall, the systematic nature of deep mutational scanning combined with the safety of pseudoviruses enables comprehensive measurements of the phenotypic effects of mutations that can inform real-time interpretation of viral variation observed during surveillance of H5 influenza.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1718057323651
