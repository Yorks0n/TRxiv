Our results reveal pre-Islamic Mediterranean-wide gene flow into Iberia, indicating a pan-Mediterranean homogenization during the Roman Empire. While North African ancestry appears sporadically in late antiquity genomes, it becomes more consolidated during the Islamic period. Notably, we identified one of the earliest Islamic burials in Spain, with evidence of high inbreeding, and for the first time, we demonstrate the persistence of North African ancestry in a Christian cemetery until the 17th century, along with signs of slave trafficking from the Maghreb. These findings emphasize the intricate relationship between political events and cultural shifts, such as the Expulsion of the Moriscos in 1609 CE, in shaping the genetic and cultural landscape of eastern Iberia.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

This regimen establishes highly protective HA-specific mucosal immune memory responses in the respiratory tract. Intranasal HA boosters provided significantly reduced viral replication compared to parenteral mRNA-LNP boosters in both young and old mice. Correlation analysis revealed that slightly increased levels of nasal IgA are significantly associated with a reduced viral burden in the upper respiratory tract. Intranasal boosting with an antigenically distinct H1 HA conferred sterilizing immunity against heterologous H1N1 virus challenge. Additionally, a heterosubtypic intranasal H5 HA booster elicited cross-reactive mucosal humoral responses.

However, the absolute and relative accuracy of these methods is poorly characterized, limiting their informed use, their improvement, and the interpretation of their predictions. To address these issues, we created a benchmarking platform that combines a panel of 11 large-scale perturbation datasets with an expression forecasting software engine that encompasses or interfaces to a wide variety of methods. We used our platform to systematically assess methods, parameters, and sources of auxiliary data, finding that performance strongly depends on the choice of metric, and especially for simple metrics like mean squared error, it is uncommon for expression forecasting methods to out-perform simple baselines. Our platform will serve as a resource to improve methods and to identify contexts in which expression forecasting can succeed.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

The bat wing is characterized by an extreme elongation of the second to fifth digits and a wing membrane called chiropatagium connecting them. Here we investigated the developmental and cellular origin of this structure by comparing bat and mouse limbs using omics tools and single-cell analyses. Despite the substantial morphological differences between the species, we observed an overall conservation of cell populations and gene expression patterns including interdigital apoptosis. Single-cell analyses of micro-dissected embryonic chiropatagium identified a specific fibroblast population, independent of apoptosis-associated interdigital cells, as the origin of this tissue. These distal cells express a conserved gene program including the transcription factors MEIS2 and TBX3, which are commonly known to specify and pattern the early proximal limb. Transgenic ectopic expression of MEIS2 and TBX3 in mouse distal limb cells resulted in the activation of genes expressed during wing development and phenotypic changes related to wing morphology, such as the fusion of digits. Our results elucidate fundamental molecular mechanisms of bat wing development and illustrate how drastic morphological changes can be achieved through repurposing of existing developmental programs during evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

While this localization is well established, it is not known to what extent viral membrane remodeling, genome replication, virion assembly, and maturation are coordinated. Here, we imaged tick-borne flavivirus replication in human cells using cryo-electron tomography. We find that the RO membrane bud is shaped by a combination of a curvature-establishing coat and the pressure from intraluminal template RNA. A protein complex at the RO base extends to an adjacent membrane, where immature virions bud. Naturally occurring furin site variants determine whether virions mature in the immediate vicinity of ROs. We further visualize replication in mouse brain tissue by cryo-electron tomography. Taken together, these findings reveal a close spatial coupling of flavivirus genome replication, budding, and maturation.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

We generated an atlas of TFBSs across ten flowering plants and demonstrated that conserved TFBSs are strongly enriched for genomic and epigenomic signatures of functional regulatory elements. We uncovered conserved properties of TFBSs, including TF family-specific clustering of binding sites in distinct promoter and gene body locations. By integrating this atlas with single nuclei RNA and chromatin profiles, we elucidated conserved TF activity underlying development and stress responses and annotated key cell type-specific regulatory pathways. Finally, we found that TF ortholog binding specificity is preserved over long evolutionary times, suggesting that divergence of regulatory sequences, rather than TFs, is a primary driver of regulatory evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

In contrast, experimental and theoretical work has argued both for and against the existence of specialized sub-populations of neurons (modules) within single brain regions. By studying artificial neural networks, we show that this local modularity emerges to support context-dependent behavior, but only when the input is low-dimensional. No anatomical constraints are required. We also show when modular specialization emerges at the population level (different modules correspond to orthogonal subspaces). Modularity yields abstract representations, allows for rapid learning and generalization on novel tasks, and facilitates the rapid learning of related contexts. Non-modular representations facilitate the rapid learning of unrelated contexts. Our findings reconcile conflicting experimental results and make predictions for future experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Despite the central importance of signaling in biomedical research, our ability to quantify it in individual cells over time remains limited. Here, we introduce INSCRIBE, an approach for reconstructing signaling history in single cells using endpoint fluorescence images. By regulating a CRISPR base editor, INSCRIBE generates mutations in genomic target sequences, at a rate proportional to signaling activity. The number of edits is then recovered through a novel ratiometric readout strategy, from images of two fluorescence channels. We engineered human cell lines for recording WNT and BMP pathway activity, and demonstrated that INSCRIBE faithfully recovers both the intensity and duration of signaling. Further, we used INSCRIBE to study the variability of cellular response to WNT and BMP stimulation, and test whether the magnitude of response is a stable, heritable trait. We found a persistent memory in the BMP pathway. Progeny of cells with higher BMP response levels are likely to respond more strongly to a second BMP stimulation, up to 3 weeks later. Together, our results establish a scalable platform for genetic recording and in situ readout of signaling history in single cells, advancing quantitative analysis of cell-cell communication during development and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

However, in the absence of DNA methylation due to mutations in the DNA methylation machinery or in certain developmental contexts, the same TEs can gain Polycomb-associated H3K27me3, another epigenetic silencing mark that is usually linked with the facultative silencing of genes. In this study, we initially aimed to investigate whether DNA methylation and H3K27me3 could compete during the establishment of silencing at TEs in the model plant Arabidopsis. Strikingly, we show that the deposition of the H3K27me3 mark at newly inserted transgenic TE sequences is impaired in plants in which the de novo DNA methyltransferase DRM2 is mutated, contrary to the competition model hypothesized. Further profiling of H3K27me3 in drm2 mutants and in the DNA demethylase mutant rdd confirmed this new role of DNA methylation in promoting H3K27me3 deposition at some TEs, in addition to the previously described antagonistic role at others. These findings further reveal a new function of DNA demethylation in modulating H3K27me3 levels in vegetative tissues, which we confirmed via targeted DNA methylation experiments. Together, our results uncover a novel crosstalk between DNA methylation and Polycomb at TEs and reveal that these two pathways, thought to be specialized and antagonistic, can be interdependent and cooperate more than anticipated to maintain genome and epigenome integrity in eukaryotes.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

However, these dances have attracted little scientific attention and their structure and meaning remain largely obscure. Here we analyse close-range video recordings of captive crested gibbons, extracting descriptions of dance in four Nomascus species (N. annamensis, N. gabriellae, N. leucogenys, and N. siki). Additionally, we report results from a survey amongst relevant professionals clarifying behavioural contexts of dance in captive and wild crested gibbons. Our results demonstrate that dances in Nomascus represent a common and intentional form of visual communication restricted to sexually mature females. While primarily used as a proceptive signal to solicit copulation, dances occur in a wide range of contexts related to arousal and/or frustration in captivity. A linguistically informed view of this sequential behaviour demonstrates that dances follow a grouping organisation and isochronous rhythm - patterns not described for visual displays in other non-human primates. We argue that applying the concept of dance to gibbons allows us to expand our understanding of the communicative behaviours of non-human apes and develop hypotheses on the rules and regularities characterizing this behaviour. We propose that gibbons dances likely evolved from less elaborate rhythmic proceptive signals, similar to those found in siamangs. Although dance displays in humans and crested gibbons share a number of key characteristics, they cannot be assumed to be homologous. Nevertheless, gibbon dances represent a model behaviour whose investigation could be extended to the study of complex gestural signals in hominoid primates.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

One approach to this problem has been to test specific hypotheses on the relevance of a visual property (e.g. orientation or color), build a set of 'artificial' stimuli that vary along that property and then record neural responses to those stimuli. Here, we present a complementary, data-driven method to retrieve the tuning properties of visual neurons. Exploiting deep generative networks and electrophysiology in monkeys, we first used a method to reconstruct any stimulus from its evoked neuronal activity in the inferotemporal cortex (IT). Then, by arbitrarily perturbing the response of individual cortical sites in the model, we generated naturalistic and interpretable sequences of images that strongly influence neural activity of that site. This method enables the discovery of previously unknown tuning properties of high-level visual neurons that are easily interpretable, which we tested with carefully controlled stimuli. When we knew which images drove the neurons, we activated the cells with electrical microstimulation and observed a predicable shift of the monkey perception in the direction of the preferred image. By allowing the brain to tell us what it cares about, we are no longer limited by our experimental imagination.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Here, we describe expansion in situ genome sequencing (ExIGS), a technology that enables sequencing of genomic DNA and superresolution localization of nuclear proteins in single cells. We applied ExIGS to fibroblast cells derived from an individual with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome to characterize how variation in nuclear morphology affects spatial chromatin organization. Using this data, we discovered that lamin abnormalities are linked to hotspots of aberrant euchromatin repression that may erode cell identity.

Engineering PRRs to recognize evading PAMPs could potentially generate broad-spectrum and durable disease resistance. In this study, we reverse-engineered two natural FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2) variants, VrFLS2XL and GmFLS2b, with extended recognition specificities towards evading flg22 variants. We identified minimal gain-of-function residues enabling blind FLS2s to recognize otherwise evading flg22 variants. We uncovered two strategies: (i) enhancing FLS2-flg22 interaction around flg22 key evasion sites, and (ii) strengthening direct interaction between FLS2 and its co-receptor BAK1 to overcome weak agonistic and antagonistic flg22s, respectively. Additionally, we leveraged polymorphisms that enhance recognition through unknown mechanisms to engineer superior recognition capability. These findings offer basic design principles for PRRs with broader recognition spectra, paving the way for PRR engineering using precise gene-editing to increase disease resistance in crops.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

With recent advances in imaging and machine learning, there has been significant progress in our understanding of 3D cell and tissue shape in vivo. However, even after gaining 3D segmentation of cells, it remains challenging to extract cell shape metrics beyond volume and surface area for cells within densely packed tissues.

While small animals vocalize at higher pitch than large ones due to the smaller size of their vocal apparatus, the rules governing vocalization rhythms throughout the animal kingdom remain unknown. Vocal rhythms serve as a natural information parser, and one possibility is that they are constrained by the neural rhythms of transmitter and receiver, known to be relatively conserved across species and independent of their size. In this study, we quantified acoustic rhythms across taxa and investigated their evolutionary history with regard to phylogeny and selective pressure. In 98 species from six classes, we tested the main factors likely to influence their communication rhythms: morphology, physiology, social complexity, mastication and detectability. Phylogenetic modeling did not confirm the influence of these species-specific factors, but rather point to a scenario where acoustic communication rhythms have been maintained around an optimum at around 3Hz in the biological (neuronal) delta range (1-4Hz) well before the mammals split. These results suggest that the rhythm of acoustic communication signals, unlike their pitch, has a universal neural determinant that has been conserved throughout evolution, allowing for intra- and cross-species signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Accordingly, the perceived value of a reward varies depending on an animal's current needs. Updating the specific value of rewards predicted by external cues depends on the basolateral amygdala (BLA). However, neurophysiological investigations have centered around the assumption of stimulus-invariant value representations and have not been able to account for behavioral findings that support the BLA's ability to represent stimulus-specific value of distinct appetitive or aversive outcomes. To address how the BLA encodes and updates stimulus-specific value representations, we exposed head-fixed mice to distinct sets of gustatory rewards while tracking perceived value using lick microstructural analysis. Two-photon calcium imaging of BLA principal neurons revealed that the magnitude of the BLA population response scaled with perceived reward value and that the values of different rewards were encoded by distinct neuronal subpopulations. Moreover, reward representations rapidly re-scaled when mice were exposed to a reward that was larger than all previous rewards. Finally, value representations depended on an animal's internal state as thirst selectively increased the responses to water rewards whereas aversive experiences strongly attenuated responses to sucrose. Our findings demonstrate that value representations in the BLA are stimulus-specific and highly adaptive to account for changes in relative reward value and to reflect an animal's current affective and homeostatic state. This mechanism enables sensory-specific value updates necessary for state-adapted decision making and learning.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

However, we know little about the mechanisms leading to changes in dietary preference. Here, we use the three closely-related species Drosophila sechellia, D. simulans and D. melanogaster to study taste circuit and food choice evolution. D. sechellia, a host specialist, feeds exclusively on a single fruit (Morinda citrifolia, noni) - the latter two are generalists living on various substrates. Using quantitative feeding assays, we recapitulate the preference for noni in D. sechellia and detect conserved sweet but altered bitter sensitivity via calcium imaging in peripheral taste neurons. Noni surprisingly activates bitter sensing neurons more strongly in D. sechellia due to a small deletion in one single gustatory receptor. Using volumetric calcium imaging in the ventral brain, we show that instead of peripheral physiology, species-specific processing of noni and sugar signals in sensorimotor circuits recapitulates differences in dietary preference. Our data support that peripheral receptor changes alone cannot explain altered food choice but rather modifications in how sensory information is transformed into feeding motor commands.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Yet, protein abundance also depends on the regulation of protein synthesis and degradation rates. To estimate the contributions of such post transcriptional regulation, we quantified the proteomes of 5,883 single cells from human testis using 3 distinct mass spectrometry methods (SCoPE2, pSCoPE, and plexDIA). To distinguish between biological and technical factors contributing to differences between protein and RNA levels, we developed BayesPG, a Bayesian model of transcript and protein abundance that systematically accounts for technical variation and infers biological differences. We use BayesPG to jointly model RNA and protein data collected from 29,709 single cells across different methods and datasets. BayesPG estimated consensus mRNA and protein levels for 3,861 gene products and quantified the relative protein-to-mRNA ratio (rPTR) for each gene across six distinct cell types in samples from human testis. About 28 % of the gene products exhibited significant differences at protein and RNA levels and contributed to about 1,500 significant GO groups. We observe that specialized and context specific functions, such as those related to spermatogenesis are regulated after transcription. Among hundreds of detected post translationally modified peptides, many show significant abundance differences across cell types. Furthermore, some phosphorylated peptides covary with kinases in a cell-type dependent manner, suggesting cell-type specific regulation. Our results demonstrate the potential of inferring protein regulation in complex tissues from single-cell proteogenomic data and provide a generalizable model, BayesPG, for performing such analyses.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

In Colias eurytheme butterflies, males exhibit two specialized wing scale types -- UV-iridescent (UVI) and lanceolate scales -- absent in females and likely integral to male courtship behavior. This study investigates the regulatory mechanisms and single-nucleus transcriptomics underlying these two sexually dimorphic cell types during wing development. We show that Doublesex (Dsx) expression is itself dimorphic and required to repress the UVI cell state in females, while unexpectedly, UVI activation in males is independent from Dsx. In the melanic marginal band, Dsx is required in each sex to enforce the presence of lanceolate scales in males, and their absence in females. Single-nucleus RNAseq reveals that UV-iridescent and lanceolate scale cell precursors each show distinctive gene expression profiles at 40% of pupal development, with marker genes that include regulators of transcription, cell signaling, cytoskeletal patterning, and chitin secretion. Both male-specific cell types share a low expression of the Bric-a-brac (Bab) transcription factor, a key repressor of the UVI fate. Bab ChIP-seq profiling suggests that Bab binds the cis-regulatory regions of gene markers associated to UVI fate, including potential effector genes involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal processes and chitin secretion, and loci showing signatures of recent selective sweeps in an UVI-polymorphic population. These findings open new avenues for exploring wing patterning and scale development, shedding light on the mechanisms driving the specification of sex-specific cell states and the differentiation of specialized cell ultrastructures.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Work by us and others has shown that the choice of these synonymous codon is not random, and carries regulatory and functional consequences. Existing protein foundation models ignore this context-dependent role of coding sequence in shaping the protein landscape of the cell. To address this gap, we introduce cdsFM, a suite of codon-resolution large language models, including both EnCodon and DeCodon models, with up to 1B parameters. Pre-trained on 60 million protein-coding sequences from more than 5,000 species, our models effectively learn the relationship between codons and amino acids, recapitualing the overall structure of the genetic code. In addition to outperforming state-of-the-art genomic foundation models in a variety of zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks, the larger pre-trained models were superior in predicting the choice of synonymous codons. To systematically assess the impact of synonymous codon choices on protein expression and our models' ability to capture these effects, we generated a large dataset measuring overall and surface expression levels of three proteins as a function of changes in their synonymous codons. We showed that our EnCodon models could be readily fine-tuned to predict the contextual consequences of synonymous codon choices. Armed with this knowledge, we applied EnCodon to existing clinical datasets of synonymous variants, and we identified a large number of synonymous codons that are likely pathogenic, several of which we experimentally confirmed in a cell-based model. Together, our findings establish the cdsFM suite as a powerful tool for decoding the complex functional grammar underlying the choice of synonymous codons.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Tremendous progress in sample preparation, imaging and data processing over the past decade has contributed to the identification and determination of large biomolecular complexes. However, the majority of proteins are of a size that still eludes identification in cellular cryo-EM data, and most proteins exist in low copy numbers. Therefore, novel tools are needed for cryo-EM to identify the vast majority of macromolecules across multiple size scales (from microns to nanometers). Here, we introduce and validate novel nanogold probes that enable the detection of specific proteins using cryo-ET (cryo-Electron Tomography) and resin-embedded correlated light and electron microscopy (CLEM). We demonstrate that these nanogold probes can be introduced into live cells, in a manner that preserves intact molecular networks and cell viability. We use this system to identify both cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins by room temperature EM, and resolve associated structures by cryo-ET. We further employ gold particles of different sizes to enable future multiplexed labeling and structural analysis. By providing high efficiency protein labeling in live cells and molecular specificity within cryo-ET tomograms, we establish a broadly enabling tool that significantly expands the proteome available to electron microscopy.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

We aimed to establish data-driven computations of individualized risk/benefit ratios to optimize MS care.

MethodsWe derived determinants of DMTs efficacy on disability progression from re-analysis and integration of 61 randomized, blinded Phase 2b/3 clinical trials that studied 46,611 patients for 91,787 patient-years. From each arm we extracted 80 and computed 30 features to identify and adjust for biases, and to use in multiple regression models. DMTs mortality risks were estimated from age mortality tables modified by published hazard ratios.

FindingsBaseline characteristics of the recruited patients determine disability progression rates and DMTs efficacies with high effect sizes. DMTs efficacies increase with MS lesional activity (LA) measured by relapses or contrast-enhancing lesions and decrease with increasing age, disease duration and disability. Unexpectedly, as placebo arms relapse rate rapidly declines with trial duration, efficacy of MS DMTs likewise decreases quickly with treatment duration. Conversely, DMTs morbidity/mortality risks increase with age, advanced disability, and comorbidities. We integrated these results into an interactive personalized web based DMTs risk/benefit estimator.

InterpretationResults predict that prescribing DMTs to patients traditionally excluded from MS clinical trials causes more harm than benefit. Treatment with high efficacy drugs at MS onset followed by de-escalation to DMTs that do not increase infectious risks would optimize risk/benefit. DMTs targeting mechanisms of progression independent of LA are greatly needed as current DMTs inhibit disability caused by LA only.","NA","medrxiv",1728943866033

Both methods, however, make strong simplifying assumptions which have not been tested and the reliability of inferences made from either method remains in question. Here we rigorously test and refine both reconstruction methods using the well-known Teleorgryllus oceanicus model system and determine the appropriate conditions required to reconstruct the vibroacoustic behaviour of male forewings.

Treatment aimed mainly at pain reduction, which may not target the underlying pathophysiology, is frequently ineffective. Another impediment to the effective management of SFN may be the significant between-patient heterogeneity. Accordingly, we launched this study to gain insights into the symptomatic variability of SFN and determine if SFN patients can be sub-grouped based on clinical characteristics.

MethodsTo characterize the phenotype and investigate how patients with SFN differ from those with large fiber involvement, 105 patients with skin-biopsy proven SFN and 45 with mixed fiber neuropathy (MFN) were recruited. Using unsupervised machine learning, SFN patients were clustered based upon symptom concurrence and severity. Demographics, clinical data, symptoms, and skin biopsy- and laboratory findings were compared between the groups.

ResultsMFN- as compared to SFN patients, were more likely to be male, older, had a lower intraepidermal nerve fiber density at the ankle and more frequent abnormal immunofixation. Beyond these differences, symptom prevalence and intensities were similar in the two cohorts. SFN patients comprised three distinct phenotypic clusters, which differed significantly in symptom severity, co-occurrence, localization, and skin biopsy findings. Only one subgroup, constituting about 20% of the patient population, was characterized by intense neuropathic pain, which was always associated with several other SFN symptoms of similarly high intensities. A pauci-symptomatic cluster comprised patients who experienced few SFN symptoms, generally of low to moderate intensity. The largest cluster was characterized by intense fatigue, myalgias and subjective weakness, but lower intensities of burning pain and paresthesia.

DiscussionThis data-driven study introduces a new approach to subgrouping patients with SFN. Considering both neuropathic pain and pernicious symptoms beyond pain, we identified three clusters, which may be related to distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. Although additional validation will be required, our findings represent a step towards stratified treatment approaches and, ultimately, personalized treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1728943866033

A{beta}-Amyloid (A{beta}) and phosphorylated tau, pathologies usually found in Alzheimers Disease (AD), have also been implicated in PD, with over 50% of patients exhibited the co-expression of these proteins (co-pathologies). In both AD and PD postmortem tissue, neuroinflammation, the activation of microglia and resident macrophages and the infiltration of immune cells from the periphery, including T cells and monocytes, are drivers of neurodegeneration. However, how the co-expression of these pathologies contribute to the inflammatory response and overall neurodegenerative disease phenotype remains unknown. To understand how the co-expression of pathologies drives neuropathology, we developed a novel co-pathology model by stereotaxically injecting -syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) into the striatum, and AAV-doublemut tau virus into the entorhinal cortex, of 3-month-old J20 transgenic mice with A{beta} pathology. We analyzed immune cell populations in the brain and periphery at 3 months post-induction (3MPI). At 6MPI, neuronal loss in the hippocampus and substantia nigra pars compacta were assessed along with pathological protein deposition. At 3MPI, the co-pathology mouse model begins to exhibit enhanced pathology load in the cortex and hippocampus. There was a robust neuroinflammatory response in interconnected brain regions, including increased microglial cell number, changes in microglial activation markers, and infiltration of T cells. This was synergistic in the co-pathology model, compared to the individual models, supporting the hypothesis that these collectively may drive the progression of disease.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

It should be particularly topical in the case of soil organisms, which represent the majority of known species, but it still suffers from a considerable taxonomic knowledge deficit. We propose here an estimation of the global number of earthworm species based on the Joppa approach, which models taxonomic effort over time in order to estimate the total number of known and, as yet, unknown species in a given taxa. We also conducted regional assessments of species numbers, which allowed us to refine global estimates by providing an accurate overview of the taxonomic deficit in different latitudinal locations on the planet. Our results allow us to propose a conservative estimation of global diversity of the order of 30,000 species. This means that the 5,679 species and subspecies already described represent at best around 20% of the global number of earthworm species. Considering the current rate of new species description, we calculate that it would take at least 120 years to describe all the species existing on Earth. We discuss the strategies that could be developed to reduce the magnitude of this taxonomic deficit.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Zymoseptoria tritici, an important fungal pathogen of wheat, has a compartmentalized and rapidly evolving genome. In the genome of the reference isolate Z. tritici IPO323, 8 of the 21 chromosomes are accessory. In spite of the profound impact on genome organization, the origin of accessory chromosomes in Z. tritici is still poorly understood. Combining genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics, we discovered a new chromosome in Z. tritici isolates infecting wild grasses from the genus Aegilops, and we use this discovery to study the origin of accessory chromosomes. The newly identified chromosome presents similar characteristics to known accessory chromosomes in Zymoseptoria species, including presence-absence variation, low gene expression in vitro and in planta, and enrichment with heterochromatin-associated histone methylation marks (H3K27me3). Interestingly, we found an orthologous chromosome in Zymoseptoria ardabiliae, a closely related fungal species also infecting wild grasses. This ortholog chromosome also presents accessory chromosomes characteristics, but lacks the enrichment of heterochromatin-associated methylation marks. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the orthologous chromosome in Z. ardabiliae harbors active transposable elements (TEs) congruent with lower signatures of host-genome defense mechanisms against TE expansion and spread (quantified as repeat-induced-point (RIP) mutation signatures). Our findings suggest that the chromosome has been exchanged between Z. tritici and Z. ardabiliae by introgressive hybridization events underlining the relevance of hybridization in the evolution of new accessory chromosomes. We speculate that the regulation of TEs has not yet occurred on this new accessory chromosome in Z. ardabiliae, contributing to its rapid evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Our study identifies mgat4b, a glycosyl transferase involved in selective N-glycan branching enriched in pigment progenitors, as a key regulator of directional melanocyte migration and establishment of melanocyte stem cell (McSC) pool during early development. Single cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing analysis in zebrafish upon targeted disruption of mgat4b reveals, that migratory melanocyte progenitors marked by galectin expression fail to persist. Lectin affinity proteomic analysis reveals the glycosylation of key melanocyte proteins GPNMB, KIT, and TYRP1 to be under the control of MGAT4B in melanocytic cells. Additionally, mislocalization of Junctional plakoglobin (JUP) explains the observed defects in cell adhesion and migration to be regulated by MGAT4B but not its isozyme MGAT4A. Our meta-analysis further reveals that melanoma patients with both the BRAFV600E mutation and elevated MGAT4B levels have significantly worse survival outcomes compared to those with only the BRAFV600E mutation. By leveraging the MAZERATI platform to model BRAFV600E driver mutation in vivo, we show that mgat4b mutant cells fail to aggregate and initiate tumors. RNA profiling of the transformed melanocytes revealed cell-cell junction, adhesion and ECM binding to be probable contributing factors that resulted in the failure of tumor onset. Using a small-molecule inhibitor we demonstrate the inhibitory role of this complex N-glycosylation in the progression of early-stage melanoma. Our study underscores the importance of selective N-glycan branching in both melanocyte development and melanoma initiation, suggesting MGAT4B as a promising therapeutic target for melanoma treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Though many studies have uncovered significant molecular distinctions between astrocytes from different brain regions, how this regionalization unfolds over development is not fully understood. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to characterize the molecular diversity of brain cells across six developmental stages and four brain regions in the mouse and marmoset brain. Our analysis of over 170,000 single astrocyte nuclei revealed striking regional heterogeneity among astrocytes, particularly between telencephalic and diencephalic regions, at all developmental time points surveyed in both species. At the stages sampled, most of the region patterning was private to astrocytes and not shared with neurons or other glial types. Though astrocytes were already regionally patterned in late embryonic stages, this region-specific astrocyte gene expression signature changed dramatically over postnatal development, and its composition suggests that regional astrocytes further specialize postnatally to support their local neuronal circuits. Comparing across species, we found divergence in the expression of astrocytic region- and age-differentially expressed genes and the timing of astrocyte maturation relative to birth between mouse and marmoset, as well as hundreds of species differentially expressed genes. Finally, we used expansion microscopy to show that astrocyte morphology is largely conserved across gray matter forebrain regions in the mouse, despite substantial molecular divergence.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

In this study, we used PacBio long-read sequencing, CUT&RUN sequencing, DNA methylation analysis, and RNA sequencing to generate genomic and epigenomic maps of these regions. We find that centromeric regions are primarily occupied by 120-mer Minor satellites, with other Minor Satellite length variants, 112-mers and 112-64-dimers, localized at centromere-pericentric junctions. Pericentromeric regions are mainly composed of homogeneous Major satellites, while pericentric-chromosomal junctions contain a higher density of divergent satellites. Additionally, the density of non-satellite repeats increases progressively from centromeres to pericentromeres, and further toward chromosomal arm junctions. We found that 120-mer Minor satellites in the core centromere are highly enriched with CENP-A, while the 112-mers and 112-64-dimers show lower CENP-A levels. Homogeneous Major satellites are more enriched with H3K9me3 heterochromatin, whereas divergent Major satellites are preferentially associated with H3K27me3. Furthermore, DNA methylation levels are lower in centromeres compared to pericentric regions. We also observed that only a small subset of satellites is transcribed into RNA, particularly regions exhibiting lower DNA methylation density.

Despite the potentially life-threatening nature of the immediate post-ictal state, its neurobiological underpinnings remain understudied. We provide evidence in mice and humans that seizure-associated focal spreading depolarization (sSD) is a pathoclinical key factor in epilepsy. Using two-photon or widefield imaging (hippocampus, neocortex), field potential and single unit recordings, and behavioral assessment in mice, we first studied seizures during viral encephalitis, and subsequently established an optogenetic approach to dissociate hippocampal seizures and SD. We find region-specific occurrence of sSD that displays distinct spatial trajectories to preceding seizures, and show that seizure-related and isolated hippocampal SD prompt post-ictal wandering. This clinically relevant locomotor phenotype occurred in the absence of hippocampal SD progression to the neocortex. Finally, we confirm sSD existence in human epilepsy, in a patient cohort with refractory focal epilepsy, via Behnke-Fried electrode recordings. In this cohort, sSD displayed a similar temporomesial propensity as in mice. This work uncovers sSD as a previously underrecognized pathoclinical entity underlying postictal behavioral abnormalities in epilepsy.

Recent studies have reported robust associations between sleep disturbance and various brain structural and functional traits. However, the complex interplay between sleep health and macro-scale brain organization remains inconclusive. In this study, we aimed to uncover the links between brain imaging features and diverse sleep health-related characteristics by means of Machine Learning (ML). Methods: We used 28,088 participants from the UK Biobank to calculate 4677 structural and functional neuroimaging markers. Then, we employed them to predict self-reported insomnia symptoms, sleep duration, easiness getting up in the morning, chronotype, daily nap, daytime sleepiness, and snoring. We built seven different linear and nonlinear ML models for each sleep health-related characteristic to assess their predictability. Results: We performed an extensive ML analysis that involved more than 100,000 hours of computing. We observed relatively low performance in predicting all sleep health-related characteristics (e.g., balanced accuracy ranging between 0.50-0.59). Across all models, the best performance achieved was 0.59, using a Linear SVM to predict easiness getting up in the morning. Conclusions: The low capability of multimodal neuroimaging markers in predicting sleep health-related characteristics, even under extensive ML optimization in a large population sample suggests a complex relationship between sleep health and brain organization.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Given the relatively small number of signaling pathways, the existence of multiple related ligands for many of these pathways is thought to represent a key evolutionary innovation for encoding complexity into cell-cell signaling. Relatedly, crosstalk and other interactions between pathways is another critical feature which allows a modest number pathways to ultimately generate an enormously diverse range of outcomes. It would thus be useful to have genetic tools to identify and manipulate not only those cells which express a given signaling ligand, but also those cells that specifically co-express pairs of signaling ligands. Here, we present a collection of split-Gal4 knock-in lines targeting many of the ligands for highly conserved signaling pathways in Drosophila (Notch, Hedgehog, FGF, EGF, TGF, JAK/STAT, JNK, and PVR). We demonstrate that these lines faithfully recapitulate the endogenous expression pattern of their targets, and that they can be used to specifically identify the cells and tissues that co-express pairs of signaling ligands. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that the 4th chromosome TGFligands myoglianin and maverick are broadly co-expressed in muscles and other tissues of both larva and adults, and that the JAK/STAT ligands upd2 and upd3 are partially co-expressed from cells of the midgut following gut damage. Together with our previously collection of split-Gal4 lines targeting the seven Wnt ligands, this resource allows Drosophila researchers to identify and genetically manipulate cells that specifically express pairs of conserved ligands from nearly all the major intercellular signaling pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Major bodies of ecological theory have emerged, largely independently, to address temperature and resource effects. It remains a major challenge to unite these ideas and determine the interactive effects of temperature and resources on ecological patterns and processes, and their consequences across ecological scales. Here, we propose a simple, physiologically motivated model capturing the interactive effects of temperature and resources (including inorganic nutrients and light) on the growth of microbial ectotherms over multiple ecological scales. From this model we derive a set of key predictions. At the population level, we predict (i) interactive effects of resource limitation on thermal traits, (ii) consistent differences in the temperature sensitivity of auto- and heterotrophs, and (iii) the existence of specific tradeoffs between traits that determine the shape of thermal performance curves. At the community level, we derive predictions for (iv) how limitation by nutrients and light can change the relationship between temperature and productivity. All four predictions are upheld, based on our analyses of a large compilation of laboratory data on microbial growth, as well as field experiments with marine phytoplankton communities. Collectively, our modeling framework provides a new way of thinking about the interplay between two fundamental aspects of life -- temperature and resources -- and how they constrain and structure ecological properties across scales. Providing links between population and community responses to simultaneous changes in abiotic factors is essential to anticipating the multifaceted effects of global change.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Many reconciliation algorithms consider only duplication and loss events (and sometimes horizontal transfer), ignoring effects of the coalescent process, including incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Here, we present a new algorithm for carrying out reconciliation that accurately accounts for incomplete lineage sorting by treating ILS as a series of nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) events. For discordant branches of the gene tree identified by last common ancestor (LCA) mapping, our algorithm recursively chooses the optimal history by comparing the cost of duplication and loss to the cost of NNI and loss. We demonstrate the accuracy of our new method, which we call reconcILS, using a new simulation engine (dupcoal) that can accurately generate gene trees produced by the interaction of duplication, ILS, and loss. We show that reconcILS is much more accurate than models that ignore ILS, and at least as accurate or better than the leading method that can model ILS, duplication, and loss.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated for chronic kidney disease (CKD), and various glomerulonephritides. HLA associations in those with APOL1 high-risk genotype were also investigated. Results: A positive genetic diagnosis was made in 17% (38/218) of patients. The median age of uKF onset was 36 years. Fewer genetic diagnoses were found in those aged >36 years compared to younger individuals, both with (11% vs. 35%, P=0.03) and without (5% vs. 19%, P=0.05) a family history. Three patients [&ge;] 36 years without a family history had pathogenic variants in type IV collagen genes. The high-risk APOL1 genotype was enriched in patients with recent African ancestry (52% vs 8.4%, P =5.97x10-8). Dividing the uKF cohort by subsequent identification of monogenic diagnosis, high-risk APOL1 genotype, or neither, we found that the SSNS PRS was higher in those with high-risk APOL1 (P=0.048), driven by differences at HLA-DQB1*03:19 (P=0.001). Conclusions: These findings estimate the likelihood of a genetic diagnosis using WGS in uKF patients, showing fewer diagnoses in older patients without a family history. APOL1 contributes significantly to uKF in those with recent African ancestry, potentially interacting with HLA-DQB1. The lack of PRS signal for CKD suggests distinct biology between uKF and more common causes of CKD.","NA","medrxiv",1728943866033

The myrtle warbler (Setophaga coronata coronata) has two disjunct non-breeding ranges in North and Central America-one along the Gulf Coast and the other on the Pacific. Previous work indirectly linked birds breeding in Alaska with the Pacific non-breeding area, suggesting that high latitude populations evolved a shorter migration route. We directly tested this hypothesis using geolocators measuring both light and atmospheric pressure to track Alaskan myrtle warbler migration in fine detail and inferred non-breeding areas using hydrogen isotopes for a larger sample of birds breeding in Alaska, British Columbia, and Alberta. We found, contrary to expectations, that all geolocator-tracked birds and most birds with stable isotope data migrated to the southeastern United States, while only a small subset of birds ([~]5%) likely wintered on the Pacific Coast.

In this study, by analyzing a new individual (1.25x) and published Republican samples, we propose a novel perspective for the presence of Near Eastern ancestry in the Imperial gene pool. In our scenario, the spread of this genetic ancestry took place during the late Republican period, predating the onset of the Empire by [~]200 years. The diffusion of this ancestry may have occurred due to early East-to-West movements, since Eastern Mediterranean regions were already under Roman political influence during the Republic, or even as a result of migration from Southern Italy where Greeks and Phoenicians settled.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Therefore, there is a need for other therapies with broad efficiency. Here, we targeted the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the major entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. We purified three single domain heavy chain antibodies (VHHs) after immunization of an alpaca with the ectodomain of ACE2. These VHHs bound ACE2 with nanomolar affinity and specifically detected membrane-anchored ACE2. Two of them (B07 and B09) neutralized by a competitive mechanism multiple SARS-CoV-2 isolates, including Omicron variants (XBB.1.16.1; EG.5.1.3; BA.2.86.1), without impacting the proteolytic activity of the enzyme. Fusion of B07 with conventional Fc domain markedly improved its binding and neutralizing efficacy. This dimeric Fc-conjugated B07 (B07-Fc) recognized specific residues of the N-terminal helix 1 of ACE2. When administrated prophylactically and intranasally, B07-Fc induced a strong dose-dependent protection of mice expressing human ACE2 (K18-hACE2) from SARS-CoV-2 Omicron. Hamsters were weakly protected due to low binding of B07-Fc to hamster ACE2. These single domain antibodies targeting hACE2 represent potential broad-spectrum therapeutic candidates against any emerging viruses using ACE2 as a receptor. These inhalable neutralizing single domain antibodies also represent a non-invasive approach against respiratory viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

We reasoned that designed agonists that induce different conformational changes in the receptor might induce different downstream responses, which could be useful both therapeutically and to shed light on how extracellular conformation is coupled to intracellular signaling. We used de novo protein design to first generate binders to individual IR extracellular domains, and then to fuse these together in different orientations and with different conformational flexibility. We describe a series of synthetic agonists that signal through the IR that differ from insulin and from each other in the induction of receptor autophosphorylation, MAPK activation, intracellular trafficking, and cell proliferation. We identify designs that are more potent than insulin causing much longer lasting reductions in glucose levels, and that retain signaling activity on disease-causing receptor mutants that do not respond to insulin. These results inform our understanding of how changes in receptor conformation and dynamics are transmitted to downstream signaling, and our synthetic agonists have considerable therapeutic potential for diabetes and severe insulin resistance syndromes.

Such patterns fulfill both biotic and abiotic functions, mediating plant-pollinator communication and providing protection against damaging UV rays or desiccation. These motifs are often evolutionary labile, varying in size, shape and hue between closely related species and constitute excellent systems to illuminate the evolutionary processes that generate morphological diversity or instead lead to the repetitive emergence of similar forms. Hibiscus trionum flowers have a prominent bullseye pattern combining a purple center contrasting against a white margin. H. trionum belongs to a small clade of Hibiscus known as the Trionum Complex that displays a range of petal patterns within and between species. Here, we integrate phylogenomic approaches, molecular techniques and genetic manipulation to solve species relationships across the Trionum Complex, identify key genes involved in the production of bullseye pigmentation, and reveal molecular events underpinning pattern variation during the evolution of the group. We find that repetitive bullseye reduction events primarily occur through independent modifications of a single genetic locus encoding BERRY1, an R2R3 MYB that regulates anthocyanin pigment production in petals. Moreover, we demonstrate that buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) discriminate against flowers with smaller bullseye sizes suggesting that a reduction in bullseye proportions potentially impacts plant fitness and contributes to trait distribution across the group. Collectively, our results demonstrate how repeated mutations in a single locus led to morphological variation in petal patterning, a trait that contributes to angiosperm reproductive isolation and speciation.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

However, less structural data is available for peptides and their flexibility makes them harder to design. Here, we present a method to design both novel linear and cyclic peptide binders of varying lengths based solely on a protein target sequence.

To protect therapeutics from degradation and enable cell-specific targeting, they are often encapsulated into drug delivery vehicles such as lipid nanoparticles, viral vectors or lipid vesicles. These delivery vehicles have been extremely successful in delivering small molecules, nucleic acids or proteins. However, there is no universal drug delivery vehicle that can deliver therapeutics irrespective of the choice of cargo. Here, we present a method to engineer lipid vesicles with asymmetric leaflets and show that they can deliver mRNA and proteins to cells. We also find that the leaflet asymmetry can increase the lipid vesicle uptake by cells. When we load asymmetric vesicles with mRNA, we observe a 5-fold increase in the transfection efficiency indicative of an improved uptake and release by asymmetric vesicles. Moreover, our findings extend beyond mRNA cargos by showcasing the effectiveness of asymmetric vesicles in delivering a wide range of proteins to cells, including the promising CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system. Our method and findings expand the parameter space for engineering drug delivery vehicles and demonstrate the pivotal role of leaflet asymmetry in determining the performance of drug delivery vehicles. Consequently, our work leads to many applications, including the formation of more efficient universal drug carriers and the delivery of gene-editing proteins to cells.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Studying their propagation within single cortical areas has mostly been restricted to invasive measurements. Their investigation in healthy humans, however, requires non-invasive recordings, such as MEG or EEG. Identifying traveling waves with these techniques is challenging because source summation, volume conduction, and low signal-to-noise ratios make it difficult to localize cortical activity from sensor responses. The difficulty is compounded by the lack of a known ground truth in traveling wave experiments. Rather than source-localizing cortical responses from sensor activity, we developed a two-part model-based neuroimaging approach: (1) The putative neural sources of a propagating oscillation were modeled within primary visual cortex (V1) via retinotopic mapping from functional MRI recordings (encoding model); and (2) the modeled sources were projected onto MEG and EEG sensors to predict the resulting signal using a biophysical head model. We tested our model by comparing its predictions against the MEG-EEG signal obtained when participants viewed visual stimuli designed to elicit either fovea-to-periphery or periphery-to-fovea traveling waves or standing waves in V1, in which ground truth cortical waves could be reasonably assumed. Correlations on within-sensor phase and amplitude relations between predicted and measured data revealed good model performance. Crucially, the model predicted sensor data more accurately when the input to the model was a traveling wave going in the stimulus direction compared to when the input was a standing wave, or a traveling wave in a different direction. Furthermore, model accuracy peaked at the spatial and temporal frequency parameters of the visual stimulation. Together, our model successfully recovers traveling wave properties in cortex when they are induced by traveling waves in stimuli. This provides a sound basis for using MEG-EEG to study endogenous traveling waves in cortex and test hypothesis related with their role in cognition.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

While cell-intrinsic mechanisms underlying CD8 T cell exhaustion have been extensively studied, the impact of the metabolic environment in which exhausted CD8 T cells (Tex) operate remains less clear. Using untargeted metabolomics and the murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection model we investigated systemic metabolite changes early and late following acute versus chronic viral infections. We identified distinct short-term and persistent metabolite shifts, with the most significant differences occurring transiently during the acute phase of the sustained infection. This included nutrient changes that were independent of viral loads and partially associated with CD8 T cell-induced anorexia and lipolysis. One remarkable observation was the elevation of medium- and long-chain fatty acid (FA) and acylcarnitines during the early phase after chronic infection. During this time, virus-specific CD8 T cells from chronically infected mice exhibited increased lipid accumulation and uptake compared to their counterparts from acute infection, particularly stem-like Tex (TexSTEM), a subset that generates effector-like TexINT which directly limit viral replication. Notably, only TexSTEM increased oxidative metabolism and ATP production upon FA exposure. Consistently, short-term reintroduction of FA during late chronic infection exclusively improved TexSTEM mitochondrial fitness, percentages and numbers. This treatment, however, also reduced TexINT, resulting in compromised viral control. Our study offers a valuable resource for investigating the role of specific metabolites in regulating immune responses during acute and chronic viral infections and highlights the potential of long-chain FA to influence TexSTEM and viral control during a protracted infection.

SignificanceThis study examines systemic metabolite changes during acute and chronic viral infections. Notably, we identified an early, transient nutrient shift in chronic infection, marked by an increase in medium- and long-chain fatty acid related species. Concomitantly, a virus-specific stem-like T cell population, essential for maintaining other T cells, displayed high lipid avidity and was capable of metabolizing exogenous fatty acids. Administering fatty acids late in chronic infection, when endogenous lipid levels had normalized, expanded this stem-like T cell population and enhanced their mitochondrial fitness. These findings highlight the potential role of fatty acids in regulating stem-like T cells in chronic settings and offer a valuable resource for studying other metabolic signatures in both acute and persistent infections.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Here, we report that the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora enters apple leaves through naturally-occurring wounds caused by the abscission of trichomes during the course of leaf development. Through macroscopic and microscopic observations, we depicted a clear invasion path for E. amylovora cells, from epiphytic growth on glandular trichomes (GT) and non-glandular trichomes (NT), to entry through wounds caused by abscised trichomes, into the epithem, and subsequent spread through xylem. We further observed that GT and NT undergo an abscission process, and that the amount of naturally-occurring wounds during abscission is associated with the increase in E. amylovora population. Key genes important for the colonization of GT and NT were identified. Contribution of the type III secretion system and amylovoran biosynthesis during GT colonization was validated.

The underlying neural mechanisms are attributed theoretically to effects of variant connective tissue on the precision of interoceptive representations contributing to emotions.

MethodsWe used functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging (fMRI) to quantify regional brain responses to emotional stimuli (facial expressions) in patients with generalised anxiety disorder (N=30) and a non-anxious comparison group (N=33). All participants were assessed for joint laxity and were classified (using Brighton Criteria) for the presence and absence of Hypermobility Syndrome (HMS: now considered Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder).

ResultsHMS participants showed attenuated neural reactivity to emotional faces in specific frontal (inferior frontal gyrus, pre-supplementary motor area), midline (anterior mid and posterior cingulate cortices), and parietal (precuneus and supramarginal gyrus) regions. Notably, interaction between HMS and anxiety was expressed in reactivity of left amygdala (a region implicated in threat processing) and mid insula (primary interoceptive cortex) where activity was amplified in HMS patients with generalised anxiety disorder. Severity of hypermobility in anxious, compared to non-anxious, individuals correlated with activity within anterior insula (implicated as the neural substrate linking anxious feelings to physiological state). Amygdala-precuneus functional connectivity was stronger in HMS, compared to non-HMS, participants.

ConclusionsThe predisposition to anxiety in people with variant connective tissue reflects dynamic interactions between neural centres processing threat (amygdala) and representing bodily state (insular and parietal cortices). Correspondingly, interventions to regulate of amygdala reactivity while enhancing interoceptive precision may have therapeutic benefit for symptomatic hypermobile individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1728943866033

Determining whether the pursuit of addictive drugs is habitual is hampered by a lack of behavior assessments suitable for use during a bout of drug seeking. Therefore, to understand how variable histories of drug reinforcement might affect goal-directed and habitual pursuit of drug rewards, we trained rats to perform a multi-step decision-making task to earn oral fentanyl or sucrose rewards following extensive training with either fentanyl or sucrose. Importantly, this task allowed for independent measurements of goal-directed and habitual choice characteristics during online pursuit of rewards, and habitual choice could further be categorized into perseverative and reward-guided components. Extensive fentanyl training led to a bias for reward-guided habitual choice specifically in females, and a relatively high degree of perseveration in both sexes. These behavioral changes after chronic fentanyl generalized across fentanyl and sucrose seeking. In contrast, during fentanyl sessions, females showed increased perseveration, and both sexes showed blunting of the gradual improvement in goal-directed choice. These results show that chronic drug reinforcement induced habits that generalized across seeking drug and non-drug rewards, and female rats were especially susceptible to habitual control induced by both chronic and acute drug reinforcement.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

RNA polymerase ribozymes could constitute such a system, but their large size and structural complexity hinder their self-replication and make their spontaneous emergence improbable. Here we describe QT45: a 45-nucleotide ribozyme, discovered from a random sequence pool, that catalyzes general RNA-templated RNA synthesis using trinucleotide triphosphate substrates. QT45 can synthesize both its complementary strand from a mix of all 64 trinucleotides and a copy of itself using 13 defined trinucleotides and one hexamer as substrates. The discovery of this complex activity in a small ribozyme suggests that polymerase ribozymes may be more abundant in RNA sequence space than anticipated, thereby facilitating the emergence of self-replication.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

However, most of these studies have been limited by their focus on mammalian systems. Here, we aimed to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms that are active during lung growth and tissue repair in amphibians, specifically Xenopus tropicalis (X. tropicalis). First, we analyzed the stem cell composition and signaling pathways that are active in epithelial and mesenchymal cells during lung growth. Then, we established a protocol for lung injury to assess the types of stem cells underlying tissue repair. In mammals, Sftpc+ (AT2) cells are alveolar stem cells that can differentiate to Krt8+ cells during lung homeostasis and post-injury repair. In this study, we identified Sftpc+ cells and Krt8+ cells, along with the activity of key developmental signaling pathways, Hippo and Wnt, during lung maturation at post-metamorphosis stages. We then established a protocol for lung injury using chemically induced injury with bleomycin, which damages the lung through oxidative stress. The results show an elevation in collagen post-injury, indicating bleomycin's effect in causing lung fibrosis. X. tropicalis froglets survived 42 days post-injury, with a continuous decrease in fibrosis. To explore this effect, we analyzed the distribution of lung stem cells; Sox9 protein levels and Sftp gene expression were downregulated at the alveoli 42 days post-injury. The decrease in stem cell marker expression 42 days post-injury suggests they are differentiating as part of the healing process. Nevertheless, we could still detect them after a few weeks of healing. These results suggest that X. tropicalis has a regenerative capacity for lung tissue repair and that the same signaling pathways and stem cells are active in both amphibians and mammalian lungs during lung growth, regeneration, and healing. These findings show for the first time the physiological similarities between the anuran and the mammalian lung during growth and tissue repair processes, suggesting X. tropicalis as a potential animal model to study lung regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

This occurs in the olfactory system, where OSNs are highly sensitive to low concentrations of odors and maintain discriminability in complex odor environments. How olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) maintain both sensitivity and sparsity is not well understood. Here, we investigated whether the calcium-activated chloride channel, TMEM16B, may support these dual roles in OSNs. We used multiphoton microscopy to image the stimulus-response density of OSNs in the olfactory epithelium. In TMEM16B knockout mice, we found that sensory representations were denser, and the magnitude of OSN responses was increased. Behaviorally, these changes in sensory representations were associated with an increased aversion to the odorant trimethylamine, which switches perceptual valence as its concentration increases, and a decreased efficiency of olfactory-guided navigation. Together, our results indicate that the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16B sparsens sensory representations in the peripheral olfactory system and contributes to efficient integrative olfactory-guided behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Similar to other actin-binding probes, F-tractin alters actin organization and impairs cell migration when expressed at high levels. In addition, the probe has been reported to directly induce actin bundling. To elucidate the mechanism behind these effects, we determined the structure of the F-tractin-F-actin complex using electron cryo-microscopy. Our analysis revealed that the F-tractin peptide consists of a flexible N-terminal region and an amphipathic C-terminal helix. The N-terminal part is completely dispensable for F-actin binding but is responsible for the actin bundling effect. The C-terminal helical region interacts with a hydrophobic pocket formed by two neighboring actin subunits, a region identified as an interface for many other actin-binding polypeptides, including Lifeact, the most widely used actin-binding probe. Thus, rather than contrasting F-tractin and Lifeact, our data indicate that these peptides have analogous modes of interaction with F-actin. Our study dissects the structural elements of F-tractin and provides a mechanistic basis for the selection and future development of actin probes.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

However, evidence on how these attentional templates is represented during preparation remains controversial. Here, we combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an orientation cueing task to isolate preparatory activity from stimulus-evoked responses. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found decodable information of the to-be-attended orientation during preparation; yet preparatory activity patterns were different from those evoked when actual orientations were perceived. When perturbing the neural activity by means of a visual impulse ( pinging technique), the preparatory activity patterns in visual cortex resembled those associated with perceiving these orientations. The observed differential patterns with and without the impulse perturbation suggest a predominantly non-sensory format and a latent, sensory-like format of representation during preparation. Furthermore, the emergence of the sensory-like template coincided with enhanced information connectivity between V1 and frontoparietal areas and was associated with improved behavioral performance. This dual-format mechanism suggests that during preparation the brain encodes more detailed template information beyond its immediate use, potentially providing advantages for adaptive attentional control. Consistent with recent theories of non-veridical,  good-enough attentional template for initial guidance, our findings established a neural basis for implementing two representational formats in different functional states during preparation: a predominantly non-sensory format for guidance and a latent sensory-like format for prospective stimulus processing.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Previously, the overamplification of the glyphosate-resistance gene, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSPS), in A. palmeri was determined to be driven by an extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA). Here, a novel eccDNA is described that carries both glyphosate and glufosinate-ammonium target site due to co-duplication of their chromosomic native region, conferring resistance. Besides EPSPS, the novel replicon has a region replaced by a fragment carrying the GS2 isoforms (GS2.1 and GS2.2) and other genes. The co-existence of eccDNA carrying only EPSPS was confirmed in MSR2 samples harboring dual targeting eccDNA. The genomic structure of GS2 and EPSPS amplification was also assessed in a different glufosinate-resistant A. palmeri accession (MSR1) along with MSR2. The accessions showed distinct GS2.1 and GS2.2 amplification patterns suggesting the existence of diverse replicons that were not assembled here. The EPSPS was amplified in both accessions, and a correlation was observed with the GS2 isoforms in MSR2, further supporting the co-existence of these genes in the same replicon.

To help identify such candidate genes, several recent tools estimate microbial gene copy numbers directly from metagenomes. These tools rely on alignments to pangenomes, which in turn are derived from the set of all individual genomes from one species. While large-scale metagenomic assembly efforts have made pangenome estimates more complete, mixed communities can also introduce contamination into assemblies, and it is unknown how robust pangenome-based metagenomic analyses are to these errors. To gain insight into this problem, we re-analyzed a case-control study of the gut microbiome in cirrhosis, focusing on commensal Clostridia previously implicated in this disease. We tested for differentially prevalent genes in the Lachnospiraceae, then investigated which were likely to be contaminants using sequence similarity searches. Out of 86 differentially prevalent genes, we found that 33 (38%) were probably contaminants originating in taxa such as Veillonella and Haemophilus, unrelated genera that were independently correlated with disease status. Our results demonstrate that even small amounts of contamination in metagenome assemblies, below typical quality thresholds, can threaten to overwhelm gene-level metagenomic analyses. However, we also show that such contaminants can be accurately identified using a method based on gene-to-species correlation. After removing these contaminants, we observe that several flagellar motility gene clusters in the Lachnospira eligens pangenome are associated with cirrhosis status. We have integrated our analyses into an analysis and visualization pipeline, PanSweep, that can automatically identify cases where pangenome contamination may bias the results of gene-resolved analyses.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Comparative genomics, particularly through sequence conservation analysis, offers a promising approach to infer lncRNA functions. Traditional methods focusing on protein-coding genes (PCGs) fall short due to the rapid evolutionary divergence of lncRNA sequences.

Over the past five decades, numerous methodologies have been employed to elucidate the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying NK cell-mediated tumor control. While significant progress has been made in elucidating the interactions between NK cells and tumor cells, the regulatory factors governing NK cell-mediated tumor cell destruction are not yet fully understood. This includes the diverse array of tumor ligands recognized by NK cells and the mechanisms that NK cells employ to eliminate tumor cells.

MethodsIn this study, we employed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening approach in conjunction with functional cytotoxicity assays to delineate the proteins modulating the susceptibility of colon adenocarcinoma HCT-116 cells to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

ResultsAnalysis of guide RNA (gRNA) distribution in HCT-116 cells that survived co-incubation with NK cells identified ICAM-1 as a pivotal player in the NKp44-mediated immune synapse, with NKp44 serving as an activating receptor crucial for the elimination of HCT-116 tumor cells by NK cells. Furthermore, disruption of genes involved in the apoptosis or IFN-{gamma} signaling pathways conferred resistance to NK cell attack. We further dissected that NK cell-derived IFN-{gamma} promotes mitochondrial apoptosis in vitro and exerts control over B16-F10 lung metastases in vivo.

ConclusionMonitoring ICAM-1 levels on the surface of tumor cells or modulating its expression should be considered in the context of NK cell-based therapy. Additionally, considering the diffusion properties of IFN-{gamma}, our findings highlight the potential of leveraging NK cell-derived IFN-{gamma} to enhance direct tumor cell killing and facilitate bystander effects via cytokine diffusion, warranting further investigation.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICNK cells play a crucial role in identifying and eliminating various cancer cell types. However, the mechanisms that regulate NK cell-mediated destruction of tumor cells are not yet fully understood. This involves the array of tumor ligands that NK cells recognize and the processes they utilize to carry out tumor cell elimination.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSOur research emphasizes the critical role of ICAM-1 in NKp44-mediated destruction of HCT-116 tumor cells. Additionally, we found that interfering with genes related to apoptosis or IFN-{gamma} signaling pathways increased resistance to NK cell attack. We showed that IFN-{gamma} produced by NK cells induces mitochondrial apoptosis in vitro and helps regulate B16-F10 lung metastases in vivo.

HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICYGiven the ability of IFN-{gamma} to diffuse, our findings suggest that NK cell-derived IFN-{gamma} can be harnessed to directly kill tumor cells and trigger bystander effects through cytokine spread. This approach holds promise for further exploration. Additionally, assessing or manipulating ICAM-1 levels on tumor cell surfaces could enhance the effectiveness of NK cell-based therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Innate activation and cytokine release occurred within 24 hours and T and B cell activation and antigen-specific antibody secretion occurred during the ensuing 14-day culture. Among the immune cell populations, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) exhibited the highest ChAdOx1 transduction levels. pDC-derived IFN- was critical for humoral responses, but production of antigen in pDCs was dispensable. Furthermore, IL-6 enhanced humoral responses in both IFN--dependent and independent manners, indicating intricate signaling interplay.

We then utilized ASOs targeting C9ORF72 sense repeat RNA to examine whether sense or antisense RNA is the major source of the poly(GP) protein - a question for which conflicting evidence exists. We found that these ASOs reduced the intended sense RNA target, but also the antisense RNA, thus preventing the production of poly(PR). Our data highlights the importance of the sequences preceding the antisense CCCCGG repeat expansion for the synthesis of antisense DPR proteins and supports the use of sense C9ORF72 ASOs to prevent the accumulation of both sense- and antisense-dependent DPR proteins in C9ORF72 ALS/FTD.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Animals often use cues to assess reward availability and to make predictions about future outcomes. The gustatory region of the insular cortex (IC), the so-called gustatory cortex, has a well-established role in the representation of predictive cues, such that IC neurons encode both a general form of outcome expectation as well as anticipatory outcome-specific knowledge. Here, we used Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) in male rats to assess if the IC is also required for predictive cues to exert both a general and specific influence over instrumental actions. Chemogenetic inhibition of IC abolished the ability of a reward-predictive stimulus to energize instrumental responding for reward. This deficit in general transfer was evident whether the same or different outcomes were used in the Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning phases. We observed a similar deficit in specific PIT, such that rats with IC inhibition failed to use a reward-predictive stimulus to guide choice toward actions that deliver the same food reward. Finally, we show that rats with IC inhibition also fail to show outcome-selective reinstatement. Together, these data suggest a crucial role for IC in the representation of appetitive outcomes, and particularly in using this representation to guide instrumental action.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

By the use of a bunch of techniques and libraries, such as Shiny, htrr, dplyr, tibble, rvest or visNetwork, we have developed an application that provides a well-designed user-oriented interface with all the facilities to assess their data and start analyzing it directly from the scratch through a few steps. The software, as mentioned, allows an exhaustive exploration of KEGG pathways and Gene Ontologies, facilitating the analysis of complex biological processes. To achieve this, functions described in the scripts integrate data manipulation methods and web scraping techniques in order to extract the necessary information from online official databases, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGGs) and QuickGo. Furthermore, those functions are computed by parallel processing, resulting in efficient petitions to the database servers and allowing the user to get quick results from a large dataset. A fundamental feature in the app is the capability, by the techniques explained above, to obtain ancestral information for KEGG pathways and gene ontologies, making easier to understand the hierarchy of those and how each of the samples in a dataset are classified through it; offering users a way to study the dataset in different levels of taxonomy directly from the raw data. Additionally, the ability to create interactive networks is implemented, with the aim of representing all the experimental data to be able to see the relationships between the groups and the ontologies, without disregarding the classification created, being the main tool to understand the meaning of the relations that will be seen around the system displayed. As a result of all these attributes, the software represents a key tool for the analyst involved in the study of KEGG pathways and Gene Ontologies, as providing an intuitive interface with advanced data processing techniques, allowing researchers to puzzle out the intricacy of the biological functions and obtain insights the relationships between genes or molecular components.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Unlike eukaryotes, bacteria lack cytoskeleton-based machinery to segregate their chromosomal DNA (nucleoid). The bacterial ParABS system segregates the duplicated chromosomal regions near the origin of replication. However, this function does not explain how bacterial cells partition the rest (bulk) of the chromosomal material. Furthermore, some bacteria, including Escherichia coli, lack a ParABS system. Yet, E. coli faithfully segregates nucleoids across various growth rates. Here, we provide theoretical and experimental evidence that polysome production during chromosomal gene expression helps compact, split, segregate, and position nucleoids in E. coli through phase separation, inherently coupling these processes to biomass growth across nutritional conditions. Halting polysome formation immediately stops sister nucleoid migration while ensuing polysome depletion gradually reverses nucleoid segregation. Redirecting gene expression away from the chromosome and toward plasmids arrests nucleoid segregation and causes ectopic polysome accumulations that drive aberrant nucleoid dynamics. Cell width perturbations show that radial confinement of polysomes and nucleoids spatially controls their phase separation to ensure that nucleoids split along cell length and not width. Our findings suggest a built-in mechanism for coupling chromosome segregation to cell growth and highlight the importance of cell width regulation in nucleoid segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Detailed, high-quality observations of when plants undergo seasonal transitions such as leaf-out, flowering, and fruiting are critical for tracking causes and consequences of phenology shifts, but these data are often sparse and biased globally. These data gaps limit broader generalizations and forecasting improvements in the face of continuing disturbance. One solution to closing such gaps is to document phenology on field images taken by public participants. iNaturalist, in particular, provides global scale research-grade data and is expanding rapidly. Here we utilize over 53 million field images of plants and millions of human annotations from iNaturalist-data spanning all angiosperms and drawn from across the globe - to train a computer vision model (PhenoVision) to detect the presence of fruits and flowers. PhenoVision utilizes a vision transformer architecture pretrained with a masked autoencoder to improve classification success, and it achieves high accuracy for flower (98.5%) and fruit presence (95%). Key to producing research-ready phenology data is post-calibration tuning and validation focused on reducing noise inherent in field photographs, and maximizing the true positive rate. We also develop a standardized set of quality metrics and metadata so that results can be used effectively by the community. Finally, we showcase how this effort vastly increases phenology data coverage, including regions of the globe where data have been limited before. Our end products are tuned models, new data resources, and an application streamlining discovery and use of those data for the broader research and management community. We close by discussing next steps, including automating phenology annotations, adding new phenology targets, e.g., leaf phenology, and further integration with other resources to form a global central database integrating all in-situ plant phenology resources.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

A major challenge in vaccine design is the incomplete understanding of the diverse protein complexes the virus uses to infect cells. In Herpesviridae, the gH/gL glycoprotein heterodimer is expected to be a basal element of virion cell entry machinery. For HCMV, gH/gL forms a heterotrimer (trimer) with gO and a heteropentamer (pentamer) with UL128, UL130, and UL131A, with each complex binding distinct receptors to enter varied cell types. Here, we reveal a third glycoprotein complex, abundant in HCMV virions, which significantly enhances infection of endothelial cells. In this novel complex-- which we refer to as the 3-mer, gH, without gL, associates with UL116 and UL141, an immunoevasin previously known to function in an intracellular role. Cryo-EM reveals the virion-surface 3-mer is structurally unique among Herpesviridae gH complexes, with gH-only scaffolding, UL141-mediated dimerization and a heavily glycosylated UL116 cap. Given that antibodies directed at gH and UL141 each can restrict HCMV replication, our work highlights this virion surface complex as a new target for vaccines and antiviral therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Software designed for transcript-level differential expression analyses account for the uncertainty of transcript quantification, the read-to-transcript ambiguity (RTA), in statistical analyses via resampling methods. Bootstrap sampling is a popular resampling method that is implemented in the RNA-seq quantification tools kallisto and Salmon. However, bootstrapping is computationally intensive and provides replicate counts with low resolution when the number of sequence reads originating from a gene is low. For lowly expressed genes, bootstrap sampling results in noisy replicate counts for the associated transcripts, which in turn leads to non reproducible and unrealistically high RTA-dispersion for those transcripts. Gibbs sampling is a more efficient and high resolution algorithm implemented in Salmon. Here we leverage the developments of edgeR v4 to present an improved differential transcript expression analysis pipeline with Salmon's Gibbs sampling algorithm. The new bias-corrected quasi-likelihood method with adjusted deviances for small counts from edgeR, combined with the efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm from Salmon, provides faster and more accurate DTE analyses of RNA-seq data. Comprehensive simulations and test data show that the presented analysis pipeline is more powerful and efficient than previous differential transcript expression pipelines while providing correct control of the false discovery rate.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

In the Roman era, we document profound demographic transformation, with an influx of people with ancestry from the Central and Eastern Mediterranean in all the areas under study and of North Africans, especially in central and southern Iberia. Germanic (Buri, Suebi, Vandals & Visigoths) and Sarmatian (Alans) took over political control beginning in the 5th century, and although we identify individuals with Germanic-associated ancestry at sites with Germanic-style ornaments and observe that such individuals were closely related across large distances as in the case of two siblings separated by 700 km, for Iberia as a whole, we observe high continuity with the previous Hispano-Roman population. The demographic patterns in Iberia contrast sharply with those in Britain, which showed the opposite pattern of little change in the Roman period followed by great change in the Migration period, and also from demographic patterns in the central Mediterranean where both periods were associated with profound transformation, raising broader questions about the forces that precipitated change over this time.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

We develop a combined CRISPR-screening approach using endogenous RNA and RE-reporters as readouts. Applied to the Xist locus, crucial for X-chromosome inactivation in females, this method allows us to comprehensively identify Xist-controlling TFs and map their TF-RE wiring. We find a group of transiently expressed TFs that regulate proximal REs, driving the binary activation of Xist expression. These basal activators are more highly expressed in cells with two X chromosomes, potentially driving female-specific Xist upregulation. A second set of developmental TFs is upregulated later during differentiation and targets distal REs. This regulatory axis is crucial to achieve high levels of Xist RNA, which is necessary for X-chromosome inactivation. Our findings support a model for developmental gene regulation in which factors targeting proximal REs drive binary ON-OFF decisions, while factors interacting with distal REs control the transcription output.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Gs-coupled GPCRs are thought to achieve this by internalizing and allosterically activating cognate G proteins again on the endosome membrane. Here we demonstrate that the -opioid receptor (MOR), a Gi-coupled GPCR, increases endosomal G protein activity in a different way. Leveraging conformational biosensors, we resolve the subcellular activation dynamics of endogenously expressed MOR and Gi/o-subclass G proteins. We show that MOR activation triggers a transient increase of active-state Gi/o on the plasma membrane that is followed by a prolonged increase on endosomes. Contrary to the Gs-coupled GPCR paradigm, however, we show that the MOR-induced increase of active-state Gi/o on endosomes requires neither internalization of MOR nor activation of MOR in the endosome membrane. We propose a distinct and additional cellular mechanism for GPCR-triggered elevation of G protein activity on endosomes that is mediated by regulated trafficking of the activated G protein rather than its activating GPCR.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Spacer acquisition has been used to develop unique biotechnological applications such as the immunization of industrially relevant bacteria against bacteriophage infection and the recording of biological signals into stable genetic information. These technologies, however, are constrained by the low efficiency of the spacer acquisition process. To overcome this limitation, we developed a genetic system that combined deep mutational scanning (DMS) of cas genes from the Streptococcus pyogenes type II-A CRISPR- Cas system with a method that selects bacteria that acquire new spacers. This procedure enabled the identification of cas mutations that support up to a sevenfold increase in the levels of spacer acquisition and a significant enhancement of immunity against phage infection.

To address these challenges, we present an optimized pipeline for Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation and simplified a protocol to obtain stable transgenic lines of the model liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, paving the way for efficient high-throughput experiments for plant synthetic biology and other applications. Our protocol involves freeze-thaw Agrobacterium transformation method in 6-well plates that can be adapted to robotic automation. Using the Opentrons open-source platform, we implemented a semi-automated protocol showing similar efficiency compared to manual manipulation. Additionally, we have streamlined and simplified the process of stable transformation and selection of M. polymorpha, reducing cost, time, and manual labour without compromising transformation efficiency. The addition of sucrose in the selection media significantly enhances the production of gemmae, accelerating the generation of isogenic plants. We believe these protocols have the potential to facilitate high-throughput screenings in diverse plant species and represent a significant step towards the full automation of plant transformation pipelines. This approach allows testing [~]100 constructs per month, using conventional plant tissue culture facilities. We recently demonstrated the successful implementation of this protocol for screening hundreds of fluorescent reporters in Marchantia gemmae.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Current state-of-the-art models are primarily evaluated using two categories of in silico metrics: sequence-based metrics, such as amino acid recovery (AAR), and structure-based metrics, including root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), predicted alignment error (pAE), and interface predicted template modeling (ipTM). While metrics such as pAE and ipTM have been shown to be useful filters for experimental success, there is no evidence that they are suitable for ranking, particularly for antibody sequence designs. Furthermore, no reliable sequence-based metric for ranking has been established. In this work, using real-world experimental data from seven diverse datasets, we extensively benchmark a range of generative models, including LLM-style, diffusion-based, and graph-based models. We show that log-likelihood scores from these generative models correlate well with experimentally measured binding affinities, suggesting that log-likelihood can serve as a reliable metric for ranking antibody sequence designs. Additionally, we scale up one of the diffusion-based models by training it on a large and diverse synthetic dataset, significantly enhancing its ability to predict and score binding affinities.

A key feature of the transition to MASH involves oxidative stress resulting from defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Here, we show that pathological alterations in the lipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) directly instigate electron transfer inefficiency to promote oxidative stress. Specifically, cardiolipin (CL) was downregulated across four mouse models of MASLD. Hepatocyte-specific CL synthase knockout (CLS-LKO) led to spontaneous MASH with elevated mitochondrial electron leak. Loss of CL interfered with the ability of coenzyme Q (CoQ) to transfer electrons, promoting leak primarily at sites IIF and IIIQ0. Data from human liver biopsies revealed a highly robust correlation between mitochondrial CL and CoQ, co-downregulated with MASH. Thus, reduction in mitochondrial CL promotes oxidative stress and contributes to pathogenesis of MASH.

While traditional approaches using genetic screens in model organisms have uncovered some fundamental processes underlying these traits, model organisms do not possess the variation required to understand the evolution of traits with complex genetic architectures. In contrast, the advent of genomics at tree-of-life scales enables us to study the genetic interactions underlying these processes by leveraging millions of years of evolutionary trial-and-error. Here, we use the rich species diversity of the genus Myotis - one of the longest-living clades of mammals - to study the evolution of longevity-associated traits and infectious disease using functional evolutionary genomics. We generated reference genome assemblies and cell lines for 8 closely-related ([~]11 MYA) species of Myotis rich in phenotypic and life history diversity. Using genome-wide screens of positive selection, analysis of structural variation and copy number variation, and functional experiments in primary cell lines, we identify new patterns of adaptation in longevity, cancer resistance, and viral interactions both within Myotis and across bats. We find that the rapid evolution of lifespan in Myotis has some of the most significant variations in cancer risk across mammals, and demonstrate a unique DNA damage response in the long-lived M. lucifugus using primary cell culture models. Furthermore, we find evidence of abundant adaptation in response to DNA viruses, but not RNA viruses, in Myotis and other bats. This is in contrast to these patterns of adaptation in humans, which might contribute to the importance of bats as a reservoir of zoonotic viruses. Together, our results demonstrate the utility of leveraging natural variation to understand the genomics of traits with implications for human health and suggest important pleiotropic relationships between infectious disease tolerance and cancer resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Although commensal bacteria display host preference, their beneficial impact on their cognate host and mechanisms of species selection by the plant are still unclear. We use bacterial culture collections derived from the two model species Arabidopsis thaliana (At) and Lotus japonicus (Lj) to design synthetic communities (SynComs) and test their protective function upon exposure of At Col-0 to the detrimental root-colonizing Pseudomonas isolate R401. Lj-derived SynComs were fully protective, whereas At-derived SynComs displayed full protective activity only towards a R401 mutant impaired in the production of inhibitory exometabolites. The protective phenotypes were associated with a reduced titer of the R401 opportunistic pathogen. In vitro antagonist assays, in planta and in vitro bacterial community profiling, as well as strain-swapping and strain-dropout experiments revealed that competition among commensal Pseudomonas strains and R401 determines the success of the opportunist, independent of the original host or the phylogeny of the commensals. Furthermore, we determine the carbon utilization potential of these isolates, which may explain the competition with the detrimental strain and the role of host-secreted compounds. Our results provide evidence that intra-genus interactions within SynComs modulate plant health and disease, and that an individual beneficial strain can be sufficient to outcompete an opportunistic relative. This has implications for the successful development of beneficial microbial consortia for agriculture.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Projections from the LHA to the lateral habenula (LHb) shape internal states, with excitatory estrogen receptor 1-expressing (Esr1+) LHA-LHb neurons driving aversive responses and sustained negative states. Here, we identify and functionally characterize a specific projection from the nucleus accumbens (ACB) that targets Esr1+ LHA-LHb neurons. Using cell-type-specific tracing of monosynaptic inputs, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and neuroanatomical mapping, we demonstrate that the Esr1+ LHA-LHb pathway receives a major input from a striosomal Tac1+/Tshz1+/Oprm1+ ACB neuron subtype. Intersectional cell-type-specific and input-output defined optogenetic manipulation of this ACB-LHA-LHb pathway revealed its role in signaling aversion after repeated activation, with the negative behavioral state being dependent on recruitment of Esr1+ LHA-LHb neurons. Importantly, we found that activation of the D1+ ACB-LHA pathway drives reward-independent compulsive-like seeking behaviors, expressed as compulsive digging or poking behaviors. We found that these complex yet stereotyped behaviors compete with highly motivated states and can override the need for natural rewards or social stimuli. Our findings reveal a discrete striosomal Tac1+ ACB projection targeting the aversive Esr1+ LHA-LHb pathway as a key circuit that promotes compulsive seeking behaviors over goal-directed actions.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects.

Despite its importance in human development, gastrulation remains difficult to study. Stem cell-based embryo models, including those that recapitulate different aspects of pre- and peri-gastrulation human development5-15, are emerging as promising tools for studying human embryogenesis16-18. However, it remains unclear whether existing human embryo models are capable of modeling the development of the trilaminar embryonic disc structure, a hallmark of human gastrulation. Here we report a transgene-free human embryo model derived solely from primed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), which recapitulates various aspects of peri-gastrulation human development, including formation of trilaminar embryonic layers situated between dorsal amnion and ventral definitive yolk sac and primary hematopoiesis. We term this model the peri-gastrulation trilaminar embryonic disc (PTED) embryoid. The development of PTED embryoid does not follow natural developmental sequences of cell lineage diversification or spatial organization. Instead, it exploits both extrinsic control of tissue boundaries and intrinsic self-organizing properties and embryonic plasticity of the diverse peri-gastrulation-stage cell lineages, leading to the emergence of in vivo-like tissue organization and function at a global scale. Our lineage tracing study reveals that in PTED embryoids, embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderm cells, as well as embryonic and extraembryonic endoderm cells, share common progenitors emerging during peri-gastrulation development. Active hematopoiesis and blood cell generation are evident in the yolk sac-like structure of PTED embryoids. Together, PTED embryoids provide a promising and ethically less challenging model for studying self-organizing properties of peri-gastrulation human development.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

However, the lack of three-dimensional (3D) characterization of ovary elasticity limits our understanding of localized elasticity patterns and their connection to the tissue composition. Here, we developed an integrated approach to link ovarian tissue elasticity, volume, and cell-matrix composition using quantitative micro-elastography (QME), a label-free, non-invasive approach to study the 3D microscale elasticity in conjunction with immunofluorescence microscopy. QME revealed distinct spatial elasticity patterns in ovarian compartments, namely follicles and corpora lutea (CLs), and local elasticity alterations in different age cohorts. For example, CL elasticity significantly increased during ovarian ageing while follicle elasticity changed minimally. CLs showed size-dependent elasticity changes, while follicles exhibited distinct spatial variations in elasticity correlated with the emergence of theca cell layers during follicle development. These findings have the potential to guide the development of novel diagnostic tools and identify therapeutic targets, improving womens reproductive health and longevity.

Latin American samples are significantly underrepresented in global cancer genomics studies, which directly affects patients in these regions as it is known that cancer risk and incidence may be influenced by ancestry and environmental exposures. To address this, here we characterise the genome and transcriptome of 128 acral melanoma tumours from 96 Mexican patients, a population notable because of its genetic admixture. Compared with other studies of melanoma, we found fewer frequent mutations in classical driver genes such as BRAF, NRAS or NF1. While most patients had predominantly Amerindian genetic ancestry, those with higher European ancestry had increased frequency of BRAF mutations and a lower number of structural variants. These BRAF-mutated tumours have a transcriptional profile similar to cutaneous non-volar melanocytes, suggesting that acral melanomas in these patients may arise from a distinct cell of origin compared to other tumours arising in these locations. KIT mutations were found in a subset of these tumours, and transcriptional profiling defined three expression clusters; these characteristics were associated with overall survival. We highlight novel low-frequency drivers, such as SPHKAP, which correlate with a distinct genomic profile and clinical characteristics. Our study enhances knowledge of this understudied disease and underscores the importance of including samples from diverse ancestries in cancer genomics studies.","NA","medrxiv",1728943866033

However, little is known about how this drug alters large-scale brain activity. We collected naturalistic electroencephalography (EEG) data of 29 healthy individuals before and after inhaling a high dose (12mg) of vaporised synthetic 5-MeO-DMT. We replicate work from rodents showing amplified low-frequency oscillations, but extend these findings with novel tools for characterising the organisation and dynamics of complex low-frequency spatiotemporal fields of neural activity. We find that 5-MeO-DMT radically reorganises low-frequency flows of neural activity, causing them to become incoherent, heterogeneous, viscous, fleeting, nonrecurring, and to cease their typical travelling forwards and backwards across the cortex compared to resting state. Further, we find a consequence of this reorganisation in broadband activity, which exhibits slower, more stable, low-dimensional behaviour, with increased energy barriers to rapid global shifts. These findings provide the first detailed empirical account of how 5-MeO-DMT sculpts human brain dynamics, revealing a novel set of cortical slow wave behaviours, with significant implications for extant neuroscientific models of serotonergic psychedelics.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Male mosquitoes, on the other hand, are thought to rely exclusively on plant sugars for their energetic needs; indeed, this dichotomy is one of the central tenets of medical entomology. Here, we show that male Culex tarsalis and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes will readily take blood from a membrane feeder when reared under dehydration conditions with no toxic effects. Mosquitoes with impaired humidity detection do not increase their bloodfeeding rates when dehydrated compared to wild-type controls. While conventionally reared males ignore a human host, dehydrated males are attracted to and attempt to probe, with some success, although they cannot access host capillaries. However, they will take blood from a vertebrate host wound. When fed a blood meal containing West Nile virus, male mosquitoes can become infected with and orally transmit the pathogen at rates and titers equivalent to females. These data suggest that under some circumstances male mosquitoes may be able to probe and/or ingest blood and transmit pathogens to vertebrate hosts, and that their role in maintaining pathogen transmission cycles should be re-examined.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

In this study, we describe our approach for designing stable mRNA molecules by combining machine learning-driven sequence design with high-throughput experimental assays. We developed a high-throughput massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) that, in a single experiment, measures the half-life of tens of thousands of unique mRNA sequences containing designed 3 UTRs. Over multiple design-build-test iterations, we have accumulated 180,000 unique measurements of mRNA stability covering unique genomic and synthetic 3 UTRs, representing the largest such dataset of sequences. We trained highly-accurate machine learning models to map from 3 UTR sequence to mRNA stability, and used them to guide the design of synthetic 3 UTRs that increase mRNA stability in cell lines. Finally, we validated the function of several ML-designed 3 UTRs in mouse models, resulting in up to 2-fold more protein production over time and 30-100-fold higher protein output at later time points compared to a commonly used benchmark. These results highlight the potential of ML-driven sequence design for mRNA therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

The peak emergence of BA.1.1 and BA.1.1.18 pure reverse mutants occurred a few weeks before the peak of all collected samples, whereas the peak of pure reverse mutants in major BA.1 variants and BA.2 coincides with the overall sampling peak.

A total of 462 papers were curated, leading to 54,666 mutation entries all classified with the degree of evidence that supports their role in resistance. FungAMR covers 92 species, 202 genes and 184 drugs. We combined variant effect predictors with FungAMR resistance mutations and showed that these tools could be used to help predict the potential impact of mutations on AMR. Additionally, a comparative analysis among species revealed a high level of convergence in the molecular basis of resistance, revealing some potentially universal resistance mutations. The analysis also showed that a significant number of resistance mutations lead to cross-resistance within antifungals of a class, as well as between classes for certain mutated genes. The acquisition of fungal resistance in the clinic and the field is an urging concern. Finally, we provide a computational tool, ChroQueTas, that leverages FungAMR to screen fungal genomes for AMR mutations.

ObjectiveThis SLR summarizes the evidence across studies among predominately adults that report an adjusted measure of association for the relationship between vaccination and PCC, by timing of vaccination relative to infection or PCC-onset and across different study characteristics.

Evidence reviewA comprehensive search strategy was developed within the OVID platform across EMBASE, MEDLINE(R) and Evidence-Based Medicine reviews, and supplemented with WHO COVID library and Google Scholar(R) searches, to collate evidence on vaccination and PCC published or posted as pre-prints between January 1st, 2020 and July 18th, 2023. JBI Critical Appraisal Checklists were used to assess each studys risk of bias.

FindingsThis review included 97 studies and synthesized results from 56 studies with low risk of bias that reported adjusted measures for the association between vaccination and PCC. Overall, 77% of pre-infection adjusted VE (aVE) estimates (vs. unvaccinated) were statistically significant (range: 7%-95%), 80% of estimates reflecting a mix of those vaccinated before and after infection were statistically significant (range: 62%-73%), one of five estimates reflecting vaccination after PCC onset was statistically significant (aVE=41%), 43% of post-infection vaccination estimates were statistically significant (two were protective [range: 28%-40%] and one was not [aVE=-47%]), and 46% of estimates not specifying vaccination timing were statistically significant (23 were protective [range: 29%-75%] and one was not [aVE=-132%]). Statistically significant pre-infection aVE estimates were slightly higher for mRNA (range: 14%-84%) than non-mRNA vaccines (range: 16%-38%) and aVE ranges during (4 studies; range: 10%-70%) and before Omicron predominance (10 studies; range: 7%-50%) overlapped. Pre-infection vaccination was protective regardless of vaccine type, number of doses received, PCC definition, predominant variant, and severity of acute infections included.

Conclusions and RelevanceCollectively our findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination received prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces the subsequent risk of developing PCC regardless of the predominant variant circulating.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDo measures of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC) vary by timing of vaccine relative to SARS-CoV-2 infection or PCC onset, vaccine type and number of doses received, PCC definition, predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, and disease severity?

FindingsCOVID-19 vaccination before SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to reduce the risk of PCC (vs. unvaccinated). Compared with other COVID-19 vaccine types, mRNA vaccines seemed to offer greater protection, and a dose response was observed for mRNA vaccines.

Recent work using single-cell transcriptomic approaches to create molecular definitions of cell types in the form of cell atlases has provided the necessary data for such an endeavor. Here, we present the Universal Cell Embedding (UCE) foundation model. UCE was trained on a corpus of cell atlas data from human and other species in a completely self-supervised way without any data annotations. UCE offers a unified biological latent space that can represent any cell, regardless of tissue or species. This universal cell embedding captures important biological variation despite the presence of experimental noise across diverse datasets. An important aspect of UCEs universality is that any new cell from any organism can be mapped to this embedding space with no additional data labeling, model training or fine-tuning. We applied UCE to create the Integrated Mega-scale Atlas, embedding 36 million cells, with more than 1,000 uniquely named cell types, from hundreds of experiments, dozens of tissues and eight species. We uncovered new insights about the organization of cell types and tissues within this universal cell embedding space, and leveraged it to infer function of newly discovered cell types. UCEs embedding space exhibits emergent behavior, uncovering new biology that it was never explicitly trained for, such as identifying developmental lineages and embedding data from novel species not included in the training set. Overall, by enabling a universal representation for every cell state and type, UCE provides a valuable tool for analysis, annotation and hypothesis generation as the scale and diversity of single cell datasets continues to grow.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

While traditionally viewed as a waste product, lactate is an important energy source for many organs, but first must be oxidized to pyruvate for entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle). This reaction is thought to occur in the cytosol, with pyruvate subsequently transported into mitochondria via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Using 13C stable isotope tracing, we demonstrated that lactate is oxidized in the myocardial tissue of mice even when the MPC is genetically deleted. This MPC-independent lactate import and mitochondrial oxidation is dependent upon the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1/Slc16a1). Mitochondria isolated from the myocardium without MCT1 exhibit a specific defect in mitochondrial lactate, but not pyruvate, metabolism. The import and subsequent mitochondrial oxidation of lactate by mitochondrial lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) acts as an electron shuttle, generating sufficient NADH to support respiration even when the TCA cycle is disrupted. In response to diverse cardiac insults, animals with hearts lacking MCT1 undergo rapid progression to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Thus, the mitochondrial import and oxidation of lactate enables carbohydrate entry into the TCA cycle to sustain cardiac energetics and maintain myocardial structure and function under stress conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Using deep convolutional neural networks, we identify 1.3 million individual vocalizations and align them in time with continuously collected telemetry data recording social interactions between individually identifiable mice. We find that vocalization is seasonal and correlated with long-term dynamics in features of social groups. In addition, we find that vocalization is closely associated in time with entrances to and exits from those groups, occurs most often in the presence of pups, and is correlated with how much time pairs of mice spend together.

However, many eukaryotic viruses, including amoeba-infecting mimiviruses, have codon usage that is largely deviated from that of their host, despite using the host machinery for translation. This raises the question of how these viruses cope with the mismatch between tRNA supply and demand. Here we show that Acanthamoeba castellanii mimivirus generates a subcellular area in the host cells to translate virus mRNAs. A combination of genome-wide ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing showed that ribosomes traversed along viral mRNAs with fewer pausing events than were observed on amoeba mRNAs. Frequently used codons in viral mRNAs had higher tRNA accessibility than the same type of codons in amoeba mRNAs. tRNA sequencing showed that the tRNA pool was not greatly altered during the infection even though the virus encodes tRNA genes. Instead, by in situ labelling, we found that viral mRNAs and newly synthesized proteins were localized at the periphery region of the viral factory, likely creating a unique environment to facilitate viral translation. Our data provide a perspective on how local translation assists the virus in overcoming the mismatch between tRNA supply and demand.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Despite this, no studies have employed proteomics to characterize host immune responses to severe pediatric vLRTI in both the lower airway and systemic circulation. To address this gap, gain insights into vLRTI pathophysiology, and test a novel diagnostic approach, we assayed 1,305 proteins in tracheal aspirate (TA) and plasma from 62 critically ill children using SomaScan. We performed differential expression (DE) and pathway analyses comparing vLRTI (n=40) to controls with non-infectious acute respiratory failure (n=22), developed a diagnostic classifier using LASSO regression, and analyzed matched TA and plasma samples. We further investigated the impact of viral load and bacterial coinfection on the proteome. The TA signature of vLRTI was characterized by 200 DE proteins (Padj<0.05) with upregulation of interferons and T cell responses and downregulation of inflammation-modulating proteins including FABP and MIP-5. A nine-protein TA classifier achieved an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI 0.90-1.00) for identifying vLRTI. In plasma, the host response to vLRTI was more muted with 56 DE proteins. Correlation between TA and plasma was limited, although ISG15 was elevated in both compartments. In bacterial coinfection, we observed increases in the TNF-stimulated protein TSG-6, as well as CRP, and interferon-related proteins. Viral load correlated positively with interferon signaling and negatively with neutrophil-activation pathways. Taken together, our study provides fresh insight into the lower airway and systemic proteome of severe pediatric vLRTI, and identifies novel protein biomarkers with diagnostic potential.

IMPORTANCEWe describe the first proteomic profiling of the lower airway and blood in critically ill children with severe viral lower respiratory tract infection (vLRTI). From tracheal aspirate (TA), we defined a proteomic signature of vLRTI characterized by increased expression of interferon signaling proteins and decreased expression of proteins involved in immune modulation including FABP and MIP-5. Using machine learning, we developed a parsimonious diagnostic classifier that distinguished vLRTI from non-infectious respiratory failure with high accuracy. Comparative analysis of paired TA and plasma specimens demonstrated limited concordance, although the interferon-stimulated protein ISG15 was significantly upregulated with vLRTI in both compartments. We further identified TSG-6 and CRP as airway biomarkers of bacterial-viral coinfection, and viral load analyses demonstrated positive correlation with interferon-related protein expression and negative correlation with the expression of neutrophil activation proteins. Taken together, our study provides new insight into the lower airway and systemic proteome of severe pediatric vLRTI.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Attachment of phages to bacterial cells is a crucial initial step of the interaction. The classic assay to quantify the dynamics of phage attachment involves co-culturing and enumeration of bacteria and phages, which is laborious, lengthy, hence low-throughput, and only provides ensemble estimates of model-based adsorption rate constants. Here, we utilized fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking to obtain trajectories of individual virus particles interacting with cells. The trajectory durations quantified the heterogeneity in dwell time, the time that each phage spends interacting with a bacterium. The average dwell time strongly correlated with the classically-measured adsorption rate constant. We successfully applied this technique to quantify host-attachment dynamics of several phages including those targeting key bacterial pathogens. This approach should benefit the field of phage biology by providing highly quantitative, model-free readouts at single-virus resolution, helping to uncover single-virus phenomena missed by traditional measurements. Owing to significant reduction in manual effort, our method should enable rapid, high-throughput screening of a phage library against a target bacterial strain for applications such as therapy or diagnosis.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

This study evaluates the value of using Google Trends indices of dengue-related keywords to complement official dengue data for nowcasting dengue in Brazil, a country frequently affected by this disease. We compare various nowcasting approaches that incorporate autoregressive features from official dengue cases, Google Trends data, and a combination of both, using a naive approach as a baseline.

Error measures and 95% coverage probabilities reveal that models incorporating Google Trends data enhance the accuracy of weekly nowcasts across states and offer valuable insights into dengue activity levels. To support real-time decision-making, we also present Dengue Tracker, a website that displays weekly dengue nowcasts and trends to inform both decision-makers and the public, improving situational awareness of dengue activity.

Author summaryDengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that poses significant public health challenges in tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide. Surveillance systems are crucial for dengue prevention and control. Unfortunately, traditional systems often rely on delayed data, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, nowcasting methods are needed to estimate underreported cases, enabling more timely decision-making. This study evaluates how Google Trends indices of dengue-related keywords can complement official dengue data to improve nowcasting of dengue in Brazil, a country frequently affected by this disease. We compare the performance of various nowcasting approaches that incorporate Google Trends data with other approaches that rely solely on official reported cases data, assessing their accuracy and uncertainty in nowcasting weekly dengue cases from March to June 2024 across Brazilian states.

A typical human cell expresses over 200 different SLCs, yet their collective influence on cell phenotypes is not well understood due to overlapping substrate specificities and expression patterns. To address this, we performed systematic pairwise gene double knockouts using CRISPR-Cas12a and -Cas9 in human colon carcinoma cells. A total of 1,088,605 guide combinations were used to interrogate 35,421 SLC-SLC and SLC-enzyme double knockout combinations across multiple growth conditions, uncovering 1,236 genetic interactions with a growth phenotype. Further exploration of an interaction between the mitochondrial citrate/malate exchanger SLC25A1 and the zinc transporter SLC39A1 revealed an unexpected role for SLC39A1 in metabolic reprogramming and anti-apoptotic signaling. This full-scale genetic interaction map of human SLC transporters is the backbone for understanding the intricate functional network of SLCs in cellular systems and generates hypotheses for pharmacological target exploitation in cancer and other diseases.

This isolation, combined with substantial Denisovan ancestry, contributes to the unique genetic makeup of the Papua New Guinean population. Previous research suggested the possibility of admixture with an early diverged modern human population, but the extent of this contribution remains debated. This study re-examines the demographic history of the Papua New Guinean population using newly published samples and advanced analytical methods. Our findings demonstrate that the observed shifts in relative cross coalescent rate curves are unlikely to result from technical artefacts or contributions from an earlier out of Africa population. Instead, they are likely due to a significant bottleneck and slower population growth rate within the Papua New Guinean population. Our analysis positions the Papua New Guinean population as a sister group to other Asian populations, challenging the notion of Papua New Guinean as an outgroup to both European and Asian populations. This study provides new insights into the complex demographic history of the Papua New Guinean population and underscores the importance of considering population-specific demographic events in interpreting relative cross coalescent rate curves.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866033

Nonetheless, these are often examined at the individual level, while societal-environmental exposures and their association with anxiety disorders are under-researched, especially in the Israeli context. This study leverages 19 years of longitudinal data from a large healthcare organization to examine the impact of national security instability on short-term anxiolytic purchases in Israel.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records of over 1.1 million individuals from 2006 to 2024, examining rates of first-time and renewed use of anxiolytic medications of the benzodiazepines group during periods of armed conflict, including military operations and wars. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess associations, adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, socioeconomic status, socioreligious sector, residence and previous psychiatric treatment.

ResultsThe risk for first purchase of an anxiety-relief short terms medication during military operations was 28% higher (HR 1.28, 95% CI: 1.21-1.34) compared to periods of relative national stability, after adjustments, and 44% higher during the Second Lebanon War (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.27-1.62). The events of October 7th were the most significant armed conflict increasing the risk for anxiety-related reaction necessitating treatment throughout the 19-years follow-up, with individuals at 317% increased risk for treatment initiation compared to periods of relative national stability (HR 4.17, 95% CI 3.97-4.38). Alongside a baseline increased risk for initiating anti-anxiety treatment, women experienced an additional elevated risk for anxiolytic therapy during times of national security threats, with 26% additional increased risk during military operations and an 81% increased risk following the events of October 7th. Residents of northern Israel had an increased risk of purchasing anxiolytics during the Second Lebanon War (HR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.12-1.72), while during military operations it was the residents of southern Israel who faced an increased risk for anxiolytic usage, with an HR of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.05-1.33). Conversely, the residential region did not significantly influence anti-anxiety treatment patterns following October 7th among residents of southern or northern Israel, compared to individuals living in central Israel, indicating a broader national impact beyond regional differences.

ConclusionsNational armed conflicts significantly influence anxiolytic medication use in Israel, with the October 7th war showing the most pronounced effect. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive mental health interventions during times of national crisis, focusing on both short-term relief and long-term mental health support to prevent dependency and improve mental health outcomes in the wake of national crises.","NA","medrxiv",1728943866034

Exporting this measure to the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and UK Biobank neuroimaging datasets revealed that faster DunedinPACNI predicted participants cognitive impairment, accelerated brain atrophy, and conversion to diagnosed dementia. Underscoring close links between longitudinal aging of the body and brain, faster DunedinPACNI also predicted physical frailty, poor health, future chronic diseases, and mortality in older adults. Furthermore, DunedinPACNI followed the expected socioeconomic health gradient. When compared to brain age gap, an existing MRI aging biomarker, DunedinPACNI was similarly or more strongly related to clinical outcomes.

Nevertheless, no direct link between hippocampal ripples and MSL has yet been established. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography from the hippocampus in 20 epilepsy patients during a MSL task in which participants showed steady improvement across nine 30-second training blocks interspersed with 30-second rest ( offline) periods. We first demonstrate that ripple rates strongly increase during rest periods relative to training blocks. Importantly, ripple rates during rest periods tracked learning behaviour, both across blocks and across participants. These results suggest that hippocampal ripples during offline periods play a functional role in motor sequence learning and that the hippocampus may be involved in offline learning beyond episodic memory.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866034

Here, we first identified a conserved high-density region of binding motifs near the origin of replication, an advantageous trait for titration of DnaA. We then investigated the mobility of DnaA by single-particle tracking microscopy in wild-type and deletion mutants E. coli strains, while monitoring cellular size and DNA content.

However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866034

While several software tools are available for this task, ranging from Python and R libraries to standalone graphical user interfaces, there is lack of a tool that offers fast, automated usage and the production of publication-ready vector images.

Here we present LoVis4u, a command-line tool and Python API designed for highly customizable and fast visualisation of multiple genomic loci. LoVis4u generates vector images in PDF format based on annotation data from GenBank or GFF files. It is capable of visualising entire genomes of bacteriophages as well as plasmids and user-defined regions of longer prokaryotic genomes. Additionally, LoVis4u offers optional data processing steps to identify and highlight accessory and core genes in input sequences.

Availability and ImplementationLoVis4u is implemented in Python3 and runs on Linux and MacOS. The command-line interface covers most practical use cases, while the provided Python API allows usage within a Python program, integration into external tools, and additional customisation. Source code is available at the GitHub page: github.com/art-egorov/lovis4u. Detailed documentation that includes an example-driven guide is available from the software home page: art-egorov.github.io/lovis4u.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866034

Here we develop minimally invasive optical clearing media for fluorescence imaging of live mammalian tissues. Light scattering is minimized by adding spherical polymers with low osmolarity to the extracellular medium. A clearing medium containing bovine serum albumin (SeeDB-Live) is minimally invasive to live cells, allowing for structural and functional imaging of live tissues, such as spheroids, organoids, acute brain slices, and the mouse brain in vivo. SeeDB-Live minimally affects the electrophysiological properties and sensory responses of neurons. We demonstrate its utility for widefield imaging of subcellular voltage dynamics, such as backpropagating action potentials, in acute brain slices. We also utilize SeeDB-Live for widefield voltage imaging of dozens of dendrites in vivo, demonstrating population dynamics. Thus, SeeDB-Live expands the scale and modalities of fluorescence imaging of live mammalian tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866034

Active modifications to the spatial environment could thus be a potent tool to mitigate epidemic risk. We tested whether Lasius niger ants modify their nest architecture in response to pathogens by introducing controlor pathogen-treated individuals into nest-digging groups, and monitoring three-dimensional nest morphogenesis over time. Pathogen exposure led to an array of architectural changes including faster nest growth, increased spacing between entrances, transmission-inhibitory changes in overall nest network topology, and reduced chamber centrality. Simulations confirmed that these changes reduced disease spread. These results provide evidence for architectural immunity in a social animal and offer insights into how spatial organisation can be leveraged to decrease epidemic susceptibility.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866034

This degeneracy impacts the efficiency of heterologous protein production due to the codon usage preferences of each organism. The process of tailoring organism-specific synonymous codons, known as codon optimization, must respect local sequence patterns that go beyond global codon preferences. As a result, the search space faces a combinatorial explosion that makes exhaustive exploration impossible. Nevertheless, throughout the diverse life on Earth, natural selection has already optimized the sequences, thereby providing a rich source of data allowing machine learning algorithms to explore the underlying rules. Here, we introduce CodonTransformer, a multispecies deep learning model trained on over 1 million DNA-protein pairs from 164 organisms spanning all kingdoms of life. The model demonstrates context-awareness thanks to the attention mechanism and bidirectionality of the Transformers we used, and to a novel sequence representation that combines organism, amino acid, and codon encodings. CodonTransformer generates host-specific DNA sequences with natural-like codon distribution profiles and with negative cis-regulatory elements. This work introduces a novel strategy of Shared Token Representation and Encoding with Aligned Multi-masking (STREAM) and provides a state-of-the-art codon optimization framework with a customizable open-access model and a user-friendly interface.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866034

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866034

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","10.1186/s40168-024-01916-8","biorxiv",1728943866034

TEs are epigenetically silenced to prevent harmful effects caused by either global activation leading to genome instability or insertional mutation disturbing gene transcription. However, whether the activation of a single element can contribute to pathological phenotypes without directly affecting gene expression is largely unknown. Here, we show that tissue-specific expression of a TE in the embryo leads to the production of viral-like particles (VLPs) which can affect organ formation. Failure to silence an LTR retrotransposon inserted upstream of the Fgf8 gene results in its co-expression with Fgf8 in the developing embryo. While local gene regulation is unaffected, the LTR retrotransposon participates in chromatin folding at the locus and adopts the expression of the regulatory domain it is located in. This drives the production of VLPs in the Fgf8-expressing cells of the developing limb, triggering apoptotic cell death at the time of digit outgrowth and resulting in a limb malformation resembling human ectrodactyly. This phenotype can be rescued by knock-out or knock-in of the retrotransposon causing mutations preventing its full retroviral cycle. Insertion of the same element at other developmental loci faithfully recapitulates expression according to the neighboring regulatory activity. Our findings provide a mechanism by which TE insertion is incorporated into the local genomic regulatory landscape and show how VLP production in post-implantation embryos can interfere with organ formation.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866034

Yet, no efficient mechanisms for their removal have been identified. Here we report bioaccumulation of PFAS by several gut bacterial species over a wide range of concentrations from nanomolar up to 500 M. For bioaccumulating Bacteroides uniformis, a highly prevalent species, we estimate intracellular PFAS concentration in the mM range - above that of most native metabolites. Despite this high bioaccumulation, B. uniformis cells could grow appreciably up to 250 M perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure. Escherichia coli, which accumulated PFAS to a much lesser extent, substantially increased PFAS bioaccumulation when lacking TolC efflux pump indicating trans-membrane transport in PFAS bioaccumulation. Electron microscopy and cryogenic Focused Ion Beam-Secondary Ion Mass-spectrometry revealed distinct morphological changes and intracellular localisation of PFNA aggregates. Bioaccumulation of PFAS and transmembrane transport is also evident in proteomics, metabolomics, thermal proteome profiling, and mutations following adaptive laboratory evolution. In an in vivo context, mice colonized with human gut bacteria showed, compared to germ-free controls or those colonized with low-bioaccumulating bacteria, higher PFNA levels in excreted feces. As the gut microbiota is a critical interface between exposure and human body, our results have implications for understanding and utilizing microbial contribution to PFAS clearance.","NA","biorxiv",1728943866034
