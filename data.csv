Wilt pathogens that colonize water-conducting plant tissues can aggravate the problem and affect a wide range of agricultural crops. However, whilst fungal infections with the vascular pathogen Verticillium dahliae are typically associated with wilt symptoms due to occlusion of xylem tissues, the related V. longisporum induces de novo formation of tracheary elements. This promotes not only its virulence but also enables elevated water storage capacity of the infected host plant and resilience against drought stress conditions. Here, we identified a secreted Verticillium protein, TRANSDIFFERENTIATION EFFECTOR (TRADE), which triggers cell identity switches of bundle sheath cells into tracheary elements. We show that TRADE interacts with the intracellular plant protein VARICOSE (VCS), a conserved component of the mRNA turnover machinery and ortholog of the metazoan protein ENHANCER OF DECAPPING 4 (EDC4/HEDLS/Ge-1). The TRADE-VCS interaction induces SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING 1 (SNF1)-related protein kinase (SRK)-dependent phosphorylation and thus dysfunction of VCS. This affects the abundance of mRNAs encoding master regulators of xylem differentiation and demonstrates how a single pathogen effector protein triggers complex tissue-specific developmental reprogramming and thus promotes abiotic stress resilience.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

Processing bodies (P-bodies) are dynamic ribonucleoprotein condensates formed by phase separation in the cytosol. P-bodies are involved in translational arrest and mRNA decay and regulate several developmental processes and stress responses. Pathogens have evolved strategies to exploit host degradation pathways for their own benefit, however little is known about how they impact translation. Here we show that upon infection with pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato (Pst), P-body assembly is enhanced in an effector-dependent manner. Moreover, a P-body-defective mutant is more tolerant to bacterial infection due to altered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses, suggesting a role of P-bodies as novel susceptibility hubs. Pst infection is accompanied by a general host translation attenuation, which is both effector-dependent, and deregulated in the P-body-defective mutant. This indicates that P-bodies are required for the bacterial modulation of the plant translation, probably to hinder the defense responses. Additionally, host autophagy is also exploited by the bacteria to modulate P-body dynamics and its subsequent translation attenuation, revealing a complex interplay between P-body formation and disassembly during infection. Altogether, our discoveries provide novel insights on how host translation is targeted by bacteria via effector-triggered P-body formation to promote disease and uncover unknown connections between ER stress responses and autophagy with P-body dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

A subset of PCS patients develops severe myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (pcME/CFS). Dysregulated autoantibodies (AABs) have been implicated in PCS, contributing to immune dysregulation, impairment of autonomous nerve and vascular function. As recently shown in autoimmune diseases, IgG fractions translate disease-specific pathways into various cells. Therefore, we asked whether IgG fractions from PCS patients could be applied in vitro to identify specific cytokine rersponses for PCS patients without (nPCS) and with pcME/CSF. To assess this, we have stimulated monocyte cell lines with IgG fractions from PCS patients. Our findings reveal distinct patterns of immune regulation by AABs in vascular and immune dysfunction. In contrast to nPCS, pcME/CSF AABs induced enhanced neurotrophic responses, characterized by significant cytokine correlations involving brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and LIGHT. AAB-induced cytokine levels correlate with clinical symptoms. Further, this study emphasizes a contribution of AAB in PCS, in mitigating long-term immune dysregulation, and a need for therapies modulating IgG-induced pathways.","NA","medrxiv",1736892493551

Genome organization, including compartments, topologically associated domains, and chromatin loops, are sensitive to reduced TBX5 dosage in a human model of CHD, with variations in response across individual cells. Regions normally bound by TBX5 are especially sensitive, while co-occupancy with CTCF partially protects TBX5-bound TAD boundaries and loop anchors.

The modern-day indigenous Arabians are believed to be the descendants who remained from the ancient split of the migrants into Eurasia. Here, we investigated how the population history and cultural practices such as endogamy have shaped the genetic variation of the Saudi Arabians. We genotyped 3,352 individuals and identified twelve genetic sub-clusters that corresponded to the geographical distribution of different tribal regions, differentiated by distinct components of ancestry based on comparisons to modern and ancient DNA references. These sub-clusters also showed variation across ranges of the genome covered in runs of homozygosity, as well as differences in population size changes over time. Using 25,488,981 variants found in whole genome sequencing data (WGS) from 302 individuals, we found that the Saudi tend to show proportionally more deleterious alleles than neutral alleles when compared to Africans/African Americans from gnomAD (e.g. a 13% increase of deleterious alleles annotated by AlphaMissense between 0.5 - 5% frequency in Saudi, compared to 7% decrease of the benign alleles; P < 0.001). Saudi sub-clusters with greater inbreeding and lower effective population sizes showed greater enrichment of deleterious alleles as well. Additionally, we found that approximately 10% of the variants discovered in our WGS data are not observed in gnomAD; these variants are also enriched with deleterious annotations. To accelerate studying the population-enriched deleterious alleles and their health consequences in this population, we made available the allele frequency estimates of 25,488,981 variants discovered in our samples. Taken together, our results suggest that Saudi's population history impacts its pattern of genetic variation with potential consequences to the population health. It further highlights the need to sequence diverse and unique populations so to provide a foundation on which to interpret medical- and pharmaco- genomic findings from these populations.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

These are neuronal populations that form complex neuroanatomical circuits, are modified by experiences to store information, and allow for memory recall. At the molecular level, learning modifies synaptic communication to rewire engram circuits, a mechanism known as synaptic plasticity. However, despite its functional role on memory formation, the 3D molecular architecture of synapses within engram circuits is unknown. Here, we demonstrate the use of engram labelling technology and cryogenic correlated light and electron microscopy (cryoCLEM)-guided cryogenic electron tomography (cryoET) to visualize the in-tissue 3D molecular architecture of engram synapses of a contextual fear memory within the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus. Engram cells exhibited structural diversity of macromolecular constituents and organelles in both pre- and postsynaptic compartments and within the synaptic cleft, including in clusters of membrane proteins, synaptic vesicle occupancy, and F-actin copy number.

Yet, mechanical stress can also contribute to the evolution of some pathologies, notably by accelerating pretumoural cell expansion through the process of mechanical cell competition. Mechanical cell competition is a conserved process in which one cell population is preferentially eliminated when mixed with another cell population due to its higher sensitivity to mechanical stress. Most of the recent theoretical and experimental explorations of mechanical cell competition focused so far on the contribution of growth and pressure to cell elimination and were limited to few genetic contexts, including the activation of Ras in vivo, and the mutation of the polarity gene scribble in mammalian cell culture. However, it remains unclear whether other oncogenes can trigger similar mechanisms and whether growth is generally the only central regulator of cell compaction and cell elimination. Using the Drosophila pupal notum (a single layer epithelium), quantitative live imaging and vertex modelling, we revisited the mechanisms contributing to cell compaction and cell elimination during mechanical cell competition. Doing so, we outlined the co-existence of two modes of wild type (WT) cell compaction near oncogenic cells, namely the compaction driven by growth versus local compaction driven by increased tension at tumoural/WT cell interfaces in zones of high curvature (similar to Laplace pressure). We highlighted distinctive signatures in cell deformation and cell elimination distribution that can delineate these two modes of compaction, and we recapitulated them in silico and in vivo using genetic backgrounds affecting growth and/or interfacial tension independently. Altogether, this study reveals for the first time the contribution of interfacial tension-driven compaction to mechanical cell competition and outlines the co-existence of various modes of compaction during cell elimination and pretumoural clone expansion.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

Fluorescence sensors currently used to monitor such signals in vivo are typically optimized to detect fast, relative changes in concentration of the target molecule. They are less well suited to detect slowly-changing signals and rarely provide absolute measurements of either fast and slow signaling components. Here, we developed a system for fluorescence lifetime photometry at high temporal resolution (FLIPR) that utilizes frequency-domain analog processing to measure the absolute fluorescence lifetime of genetically-encoded sensors at high speed but with long-term stability and picosecond precision in freely moving mice. We applied FLIPR to investigate dopamine signaling in two functionally distinct regions in the striatum, the nucleus accumbens core (NAC) and the tail of striatum (TOS). We observed higher tonic dopamine levels at baseline in the TOS compared to the NAC and detected differential and dynamic responses in phasic and tonic dopamine to appetitive and aversive stimuli. Thus, FLIPR enables simple monitoring of fast and slow time-scale neuronal signaling in absolute units, revealing previously unappreciated spatial and temporal variation even in well-studied signaling systems.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

ResultsWe performed genomic profiling of rosettes in two Arabidopsis accessions, Col-0 and Can-0, and assembled their genomes using long reads and chromatin interaction data. We measured gene and protein expression in biological replicates grown in a controlled environment, also measuring CpG methylation, ribosome-associated transcript levels and tRNA abundance. Each omic level is highly reproducible between biological replicates and between accessions despite their 0.5% sequence divergence; the single best predictor of any level in one accession is the corresponding level in the other. Within each accession, gene codon frequencies accurately model both mRNA and protein expression. The effects of a codon on mRNA and protein expression are highly correlated but are unrelated to genome-wide codon frequencies or to tRNA levels which instead match genome-wide amino acid frequencies. Ribosome-associated transcripts closely track mRNA levels.

ConclusionsIn the absence of environmental perturbation, neither methylation, tRNA nor ribosome-associated transcript levels add appreciable information about constitutive protein abundance beyond that in DNA codon frequencies and mRNA expression levels. The impact of constitutive gbM is mostly explained by gene codon composition. tRNA abundance tracks overall amino acid demand. However, genetic differences between accessions associate with differential gbM by inflating differential expression variation. Our data show that the Central Dogma holds only if both sequence and abundance information in mRNA are considered.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

Moreover, differences between systems are defined by a distance that is symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality, enabling downstream analyses such as clustering and nearest-neighbor regression.

Such goal-directed behaviour - or model-based (MB) reinforcement learning (RL) - can flexibly adapt choice to changes, being thus distinct from simpler habitual - or model-free (MF) RL - strategies. Previous inactivation and neuroimaging work implicates prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the caudate striatal region in MB-RL; however, details are scarce about its implementation at the single-neuron level. Here, we recorded from two PFC regions - the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), and two striatal regions, caudate and putamen - while two rhesus macaques performed a sequential decision-making (two-step) task in which MB-RL involves knowledge about the statistics of reward and state transitions. All four regions, but particularly the ACC, encoded the rewards received and tracked the probabilistic state transitions that occurred. However, ACC (and to a lesser extent caudate) encoded the key variables of the task - namely the interaction between reward, transition and choice - which underlies MB decision-making. ACC and caudate neurons also encoded MB-derived estimates of choice values. Moreover, caudate value estimates of the choice options flipped when a rare transition occurred, demonstrating value update based on structural knowledge of the task. The striatal regions were unique (relative to PFC) in encoding the current and previous rewards with opposing polarities, reminiscent of dopaminergic neurons, and indicative of a MF prediction error. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of selective and temporally dissociable neural mechanisms underlying goal-directed behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

A novel ipcs2W205* mutant was recovered from a forward genetic screen for Arabidopsis plants with enhanced epidermal cell entry success of the non-adapted barley fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh). A yeast complementation assay and a sphingolipidomic approach revealed that the ipcs2W205* mutant represents a knock-out and lacks IPCS2-specific enzymatic activity. Further mutant analyses suggested that IPCS2-derived glycosyl inositol phosphorylceramides (GIPCs) are required for cell entry control of non-adapted fungal intruders. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) studies indicated that upon pathogen attack, IPCS2 remains at the TGN to produce GIPCs, while focal accumulation of the defense cargo PENETRATION 3 (PEN3) at Bgh penetration sites was reduced in the ipcs2W205* mutant background.

Epithelial tissues contact the external environment and are exposed to various stresses that are potentially deleterious for the epithelial barrier. However, how focal epithelial barrier defects are detected and repaired to maintain epithelial barrier homeostasis remains poorly understood. We co-cultured ZO-1/ZO-2 double-knockout (DKO) MDCK II cells, which lack tight junctions, with wild-type MDCK II cells, to understand how epithelial cells respond to focal epithelial barrier defects. When co-cultured with wild-type cells, ZO-1/ZO-2 DKO cells were selectively eliminated by induction of apoptosis. The elimination depended on a purse-string-like contraction of supracellular actomyosin cables formed at the clone boundary, regulated by ROCK. Furthermore, Hippo signaling and adherens junctions in the surrounding wild-type cells were required to eliminate ZO-1/ZO-2 DKO cells. These results demonstrate that selective elimination of ZO-1/ZO-2-deficient cells by cell competition regulates epithelial barrier homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

Little is known of how neural activity captured by laboratory tasks relates to ability measured by clinical instruments and, by extension, clinical diagnoses of pathological conditions. We therefore sought to determine what aspects of neural activity elicited in laboratory tasks are predictive of performance in neuropsychological instruments. We recorded neural activity from intracranial electrodes implanted in human epilepsy patients as they performed laboratory working memory tasks. These patients had completed neuropsychological instruments preoperatively, including the Weschler Adult Intelligent Scale and the Wisconsin Card Sorting test. Our results revealed that increased high-gamma (70-150 Hz) power in the prefrontal and parietal cortex after presentation of visual stimuli to be remembered was indicative of lower performance in the neuropsychological tasks. On the other hand, we observed a positive correlation between high-frequency power amplitude in the delay period of the laboratory tasks and neuropsychological performance. Our results demonstrate how neural activity around task events relates to executive function and may be associated with clinical diagnosis of specific cognitive deficits.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

Using single-cell RNA- and ATAC-sequencing, we analyzed mouse hypothalamic and prethalamic development from embryonic day 11 to postnatal day 8, profiling 660,000 cells in total. This identified key transcriptional and chromatin dynamics driving regionalization, neurogenesis, and differentiation. This identified multiple distinct neural progenitor populations, as well as gene regulatory networks that control their spatial and temporal identities, and their terminal differentiation into major neuronal subtypes. Integrating these results with large-scale genome-wide association study data, we identified a central role for transcription factors controlling supramammillary hypothalamic development in a broad range of metabolic and cognitive traits. Recurring cross-repressive regulatory relationships were observed between transcription factors that induced prethalamic and tuberal hypothalamic identity on the one hand and mammillary and supramammillary hypothalamic identity on the other. In postnatal animals, Dlx1/2 was found to severely disrupt GABAergic neuron specification in both the hypothalamus and prethalamus, resulting in a loss of inhibition of thalamic neurons, hypersensitivity to cold, and behavioral hyperactivity. By identifying core gene regulatory networks controlling the specification and differentiation of major hypothalamic and prethalamic neuronal cell types, this study provides a roadmap for future efforts aimed at preventing and treating a broad range of homeostatic and cognitive disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

A central strategy for genetic adaptation is epigenetic phase variation (ePV) mediated by bacterial DNA methylation, which can regulate gene expression, enhance clonal heterogeneity, and enable a single bacterial strain to exhibit variable phenotypic states. Genome-wide and site-specific ePV have been well characterized in human pathogens antigenic variation and virulence factor production. However, the role of ePV in facilitating adaptation within the human microbiome remains poorly understood. Here, we comprehensively cataloged genome-wide and site-specific ePV in human infant and adult gut microbiomes. First, using long-read metagenomic sequencing, we detected genome-wide ePV mediated by complex structural variations of DNA methyltransferases, highlighting the ones associated with antibiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation. Second, we analyzed an extensive collection of public short-read metagenomic sequencing datasets, uncovering a greater prevalence of genome-wide ePV in the human gut microbiome. Third, we quantitatively detected site-specific ePVs using single-molecule methylation analysis to identify dynamic variations associated with antibiotic treatment or probiotic engraftment. Finally, we performed an in-depth assessment of an Akkermansia muciniphila isolate from an infant, highlighting that ePV can regulate gene expression and enhance the bacterial adaptive capacity by employing a bet-hedging strategy to increase tolerance to differing antibiotics. Our findings indicate that epigenetic modifications are a common and broad strategy used by bacteria in the human gut to adapt to their environment.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

Effective inhibition of target pathogenicity with blocking approaches, however, is often challenged by target parameters that lead to insufficient occupancy and/or incomplete pharmacology limited by only single site binding. Extracellular targeted protein degradation approaches, such as lysosomal targeting chimeras (LYTACs), offer an opportunity to minimize these challenges by an event-driven mechanism that selectively, thoroughly and irreversibly eliminates drivers of disease. First generation LYTACs, designed to traffic to the lysosome, show limited durability since the therapeutic is degraded along with the target protein of interest. Here we describe cataLYTACs, which overcome this limitation by combining stabilized asialoglycoprotein (ASGPR) ligands, pH-sensitive target binding and recycling via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). These cataLYTACs degraded superstoichiometric levels of a target protein, IgE, in vitro and demonstrated deep and sustained clearance of human IgE in mouse models. In non-human primates, cataLYTACs resulted in >98% clearance of circulating endogenous IgE for 2 weeks and outperformed the standard of care blocking antibody, omalizumab (Xolair), in both free IgE elimination and duration of action. CataLYTACs represent a new therapeutic modality for a wide range of disease states driven by circulating factors, with the potential for superior efficacy and duration of action compared to traditional inhibitors.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

Fortunately, transmission to and between humans is scarce. Yet, if such an event were to occur, it could spark a pandemic as humans are immunologically naive to H5 viruses. A significant determinant of transmission to and between humans is the ability of the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein to shift from an avian-type to a human-type receptor specificity. Here, we demonstrate that a 2016 2.3.4.4e virus HA can convert to human-type receptor binding via a single Q226L mutation, in contrast to a cleavage-modified 2016 2.3.4.4b virus HA.

Here, we identify and quantify TEs in the breakpoints of the four large-scale inversions previously reported in Atlantic cod, leveraging on three high-quality long-read-based reference genome assemblies for the Norwegian Coastal cod, the Northeast Arctic cod and Celtic cod ecotypes. We detected a significant enrichment of TE orders and superfamilies with terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) within the inversion breakpoints of chromosomes 1, 7 and 12. Notably, we discovered a tandem accumulation of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) belonging to a family of hAT transposons, exclusively residing in the breakpoints of the inverted haplotype on chromosomes 1 and 7 found in the Northeast Arctic cod. The accumulation of tandemly arranged TEs in breakpoint regions suggests that they have driven the appearance of inversions through ectopic recombination, further supporting the potential of TEs in facilitating chromosomal reorganizations with large evolutionary implications.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

Allele frequency clines along environmental gradients, known as genotype-environment associations (GEA), are often used to detect potential loci causing local adaptation, but GEA are rarely followed by experimental validation. Here, we tested loci identified in three different moisture-related GEA studies on Arabidopsis. We studied 44 GEA-identified genes using t-DNA knockout lines under drought and tested for effects on flowering time, an adaptive trait, and genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions on performance and fitness. We found that wrky38 mutants had significant GxE effects for fitness; lsd1 plants had a significant GxE effect for flowering time, while 11 genes showed flowering time effects with no drought interaction. However, most GEA candidates did not exhibit GxE. In the follow-up experiments we found wrky38 caused decreased stomatal conductance and specific leaf area under drought, indicating potentially adaptive drought avoidance. Additionally, we found that GEA identified natural putative LoF variants of WRKY38 associated with dry environments, as well as alleles associated with variation in LSD1 expression. While only a few GEA putative drought-adapted genes were validated for GxE interactions for fitness under drought, we likely overlooked some genes because experiments might not well represent natural environments and t-DNA insertions might not well represent natural alleles. Nevertheless, GEAs apparently identified some genes contributing to local adaptation. GEA and follow-up experiments are straightforward to implement in model systems and thus demonstrate prospects for GEA discovery of new local adaptations.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

Homologous recombination (HR) is a high-fidelity DSB repair pathway that copies the sequence spanning the DNA break from a homologous template, most commonly the sister chromatid. How both DNA ends, and the sister chromatid are held in close proximity during HR is unknown. Here we demonstrate that the PST repeat region of MDC1 is a mutlivalent nucleosome binding domain, sufficient to tether chromatin in multiple contexts. In mitotic cells the affinity of the PST repeats for chromatin is downregulated by phosphorylation to prevent chromosome missegregation, while still contributing to DNA break tethering by the MDC1-TOPBP1-CIP2A complex. In interphase, the PST repeat region is critical for RAD51 focus formation but not the recruitment of 53BP1 to DNA breaks, consistent with a chromatin tethering function. In total, this work demonstrates that the PST repeat region of MDC1 is a multivalent chromatin binding domain with tunable affinity that contributes to DNA break tethering during HR and in mitosis.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

However, the ubiquity of this trend over geological timescales remains unclear. One reason for this uncertainty is that palaeobiologists need Global Plate Models (GPMs) to estimate the latitudinal position of organisms' remains at time of deposition. However, as GPMs constitute hypotheses for how tectonic plates have moved over Earth's history, reconstructions of the latitudinal biodiversity gradient (LBG) might also vary based on the GPM used. Here, using the fossil record of five major marine invertebrate groups, we evaluate the impact of GPM choice on reconstructions of the LBG over the Phanerozoic. Our results show that GPM choice can lead to different conclusions about the shape and strength of LBGs in deep time, even at a coarse spatial scale. These findings suggest additional caution is needed when reconstructing deep-time biogeographic patterns and macroevolutionary events, such as the origin of the present-day LBG. We therefore advocate for future palaeobiogeographic studies to conduct sensitivity analyses investigating the impact of GPM choice on their conclusions, and for greater interdisciplinary collaboration between palaeobiologists and palaeogeographic modellers to avoid common issues in the use of GPMs.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

Marine microbes interact by exchanging metabolites, thus shaping marine microbial ecology, DOM composition, and global carbon cycling. To better constrain one set of microbe-metabolite interactions, we cultured the marine gammaproteobacterium Alteromonas macleodii MIT1002 on a range of compounds excreted by a sympatric cyanobacterium, Prochlorococcus. Alteromonas could assimilate the branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, as well as 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid (a branched chain ketoacid intermediate of valine metabolism), but not thymidine, kynurenine, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, or the other branched chain ketoacids. The assimilation of branched chain amino acids indicates that Alteromonas can metabolically process each corresponding ketoacid, suggesting that transporter specificity underlies the observed substrate specificity for 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid. These experiments show that even subtle changes in chemical structure can result in different microbial interactions and different fates for dissolved metabolites.

Significance StatementMicrobial interactions with dissolved organic matter are important controls on the marine carbon cycle. Dissolved organic matter is often considered in bulk, which leaves the specificity and nature of these interactions poorly constrained. Here we show that microbe-molecule interactions can be highly specific, distinguishing between molecules that are structurally and biochemically similar. This implies that small changes in this pool of carbon could have large impacts for the overall system function, and that measuring this pool of carbon with molecular-level resolution is important to characterizing microbe-molecule interactions. We further explore the mechanism underlying the observed substrate specificity and suggest that it is caused by transporter selectivity, meaning the ability of these microbes to selectively uptake specific dissolved organic molecules.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

Here, we identify a previously unrecognized CD20-expressing NK cell population and demonstrate its functional significance. CD56+CD20+ NK cells exhibit hallmarks of cellular activation, including elevated NKp46, CD69, and CD137 expression, enhanced proliferative capacity, and increased production of inflammatory cytokines (IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, IL-10). Functional analyses revealed enhanced cytotoxicity against K562 targets, correlating with increased expression of cytolytic mediators including granzymes A, B, and K, perforin, FASL, and TRAIL. Single-cell transcriptional profiling demonstrated that MS4A1-expressing NK cells possess a distinct molecular signature characterized by elevated granzyme K expression and memory-like features. These cells preferentially localize to secondary lymphoid organs and accumulate in inflammatory tissues. Notably, CD56+CD20+ NK cells are enriched in multiple inflammatory conditions, including multiple sclerosis, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis B infection, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung cancer. Treatment with rituximab depletes this population, suggesting potential therapeutic implications. Our findings establish CD20+ NK cells as a functionally distinct lymphocyte subset with enhanced effector capabilities and tissue-homing properties, providing new insights into immune regulation in inflammatory diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

Here, we conducted a comprehensive three-year longitudinal study examining T cell and antibody responses in 78 vaccinated individuals without reported symptomatic infections. We observed distinct dynamics in Spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses across multiple vaccine doses. While antibody titers incrementally increased and stabilized with each booster, T cell responses rapidly plateaued, maintaining remarkable stability across CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Notably, approximately 30% of participants showed CD4+ T cell reactivity to non-Spike antigens, consistent with asymptomatic infections. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a diverse landscape of Spike-specific T cell phenotypes, with no evidence of increased exhaustion or significant functional impairment. However, qualitative changes were observed in individuals with evidence of asymptomatic infection, exhibiting unique immunological characteristics, including increased frequencies of Th17-like CD4+ T cells and GZMKhi/IFNR CD8+ T cell subsets. Remarkably, repeated vaccinations in this group were associated with a progressive increase in regulatory T cells, potentially indicating a balanced immune response that may mitigate immunopathology. By regularly stimulating T cell memory, boosters contribute to a stable and enhanced immune response, which may provide better protection against symptomatic infections.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

By integrating taxonomic, genomic and predicted functional annotations, we uncover how Bifidobacterium adapts to host-specific environments, shaped by vertical transmission, dietary influences, and host phylogeny. Our findings reveal that host phylogeny is a major determinant of gut microbiota composition. Distinct microbial networks in mammalian and avian hosts reflect evolutionary adaptations to dietary niches, such as carnivory, and ecological pressures. At a strain-resolved level, we identify strong co-phylogenetic associations between Bifidobacterium strains and their hosts, driven by vertical transmission and dietary selection, underscoring the intricate co-evolutionary dynamics between these microbes and their hosts. Functional analyses highlight striking host-specific metabolic adaptations in Bifidobacterium, particularly in carbohydrate metabolism and oxidative stress responses. In mammals, we observe an enrichment of glycoside hydrolases (GH) tailored to complex carbohydrate-rich diets, including multi-domain GH13_28 -amylases featuring diverse carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM25, CBM26, and the novel CBM74). These adaptations emphasise the ecological flexibility of Bifidobacterium in breaking down -linked glucose polysaccharides, such as resistant starch. Together, our study provides new insights into the evolutionary trajectories and ecological plasticity of Bifidobacterium, revealing how host phylogeny and dietary ecology drive microbial diversity and function.

They are derived from embryonic as well as hematopoietic progenitors. However, the functional impact of their diverse origin and the control networks defining different subsets remain unclear. Here, using multidimensional analysis of dermal macs, we reveal that the absence of circulating monocytes in interferon regulatory factor 8 (Irf8) deficient mice delays mac renewal during the steady state. Yet, the functional mosaic of dermal macs remains largely intact, i.e., major dermal mac subsets develop independently of monocyte replenishment. Thus, the tissue microenvironment is sufficient to induce alternative differentiation pathways and functional specialization of resident cells. Mycobacterial skin infection induces a steep increase in mac density due to monocyte-derived macs which execute urgent antibacterial functions and differentiate into site-adapted mac subsets in wildtype but not Irf8-/- mice, while long-term resident macs are required to initiate a tissue repair program already in early stages of infection. In summary, we introduce a model, where an intricate network of specialized mac subsets develops to meet microanatomical needs and external cellular input is required only during immunological emergency situations.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

Accurate prediction of TFBSs is essential for understanding gene regulation, disease mechanisms, and drug discovery. These studies are therefore relevant not only in humans but also in model organisms and domesticated and wild animals. However, current tools for the automatic analysis of TFBSs in gene promoter regions are limited in their usability across multiple species. To our knowledge, no tools currently exist that allow for automatic analysis of TFBSs in gene promoter regions for many species.

Methodology and FindingsThe TFBSFootprinter tool combines multiomic transcription-relevant data for more accurate prediction of functional TFBSs in 124 vertebrate species. In humans, this includes vertebrate sequence conservation (GERP), proximity to transcription start sites (FANTOM5), correlation of expression between target genes and TFs predicted to bind promoters (FANTOM5), overlap with ChIP-Seq TF metaclusters (GTRD), overlap with ATAC-Seq peaks (ENCODE), eQTLs (GTEx), and the observed/expected CpG ratio (Ensembl).

TFBSFootprinter analyses are based on the Ensembl transcript ID for simplicity of use and require minimal setup steps. Benchmarking of the TFBSFootprinter on a manually curated and experimentally verified dataset of TFBSs produced superior results when using all multiomic data (average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.881), compared with DeepBind (0.798), FIMO (0.817) and traditional PWM (0.854). The results were further improved by selecting the best overall combination of multiomic data (0.910). Additionally, we determined combinations of multiomic data that provide the best model of binding for each TF. TFBSFootprinter is available as Conda and Python packages.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

Previous studies have used the assumption that the linear momentum of the body center of mass (CoM) is controlled to analyze how gait is stabilized. In these studies, the position of the center of pressure (CoP) or of the foot relative to the COM is often used as an indicator of corrections of the CoM state. Mechanically, neither of these variables is directly related to changes in linear momentum, whereas they do directly affect whole-body angular momentum (WBAM), which has also been suggested to be a controlled variable. We show that, in human walking, linear and angular momentum follow quasi-periodic functions with similar periodicity and phase. Combining the equations of linear and rotational motion for a system of linked rigid segments shows that, in this case, the horizontal distance between CoP and CoM is a good predictor of horizontal forces in the corresponding direction. This suggests that linear and angular momentum are simultaneously controlled to follow similar quasi-periodic functions and may explain the success of preceding studies that correlated CoM states to CoP or foot locations. We developed feedback models to predict the ground reaction force and its moments along the sagittal and transverse axes from the preceding CoM state and WBAM respectively. These models were fitted to experimental data of participants walking at normal and slow speeds. The consistent, good fit of both models supports that linear and angular momentum are controlled simultaneously in human walking.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) proteins represent a key component of the plant immune system that mediate plant immune responses. We cataloged the NLR diversity in 32 hexaploid sweetpotato genotypes and three diploid wild relatives using resistance gene enrichment sequencing (RenSeq) to capture and sequence full NLRs. A custom designed NLR bait-library enriched NLR genes with an average 97% target capture rate. We employed a curated database of cloned and functionally characterized NLRs to assign sequenced sweetpotato NLRs to canonical phylogenetic clades. We identified between 800 to 1,200 complete NLRs, highlighting the expanded diversity of coiled-coil NLRs (CNLs) across all genotypes. NLRs among sweetpotato genotypes exhibited large conservation across genotypes. Phylogenetic distance between 6X (hexaploid) and 2X (diploid) genotypes revealed that a small repertoire of I. batatas CNLs diverged from the sweetpotato wild relatives. Finally, we obtained chromosome coordinates in hexaploid (Beauregard) and diploid (Ipomoea trifida) genomes and recorded clustering of NLRs on chromosomes arms. Our study provides a catalog of NLR genes that can be used to accelerate breeding and increase our understanding of evolutionary dynamics of sweetpotato NLRs.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

We performed sequencing at >4,000x depth of coverage for CHIP mutations in 6,986 postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative at two timepoints approximately 15 years apart. Among 3,685 mutations detected at baseline (VAF [&ge;] 0.5%), 50% progressed to CHIP (VAF [&ge;] 2%) at follow-up. We confirmed that clonal expansion is highly dependent on initial clone size and CHIP driver gene, with SF3B1 and JAK2 mutations exhibiting the fastest growth rate. We identified germline variants in TERT, IL6R, TCL1A, and MSI2 that modulate clonal expansion rate. Measured baseline leukocyte telomere length showed differential effects on incident CHIP risk, with shorter baseline leukocyte telomere length predisposing to incident PPM1D mutations and longer baseline leukocyte telomere length favoring incident DNMT3A mutations. We discovered that the IL6R missense variant p.Asp358Ala specifically impairs TET2 clonal expansion, supported by direct measurements of soluble interleukin-6 receptor and interleukin-6. Faster clonal growth rate was associated with increased risk of cytopenia, leukemia, and all-cause mortality. Notably, CHIP clonal expansion rate mediated 34.4% and 43.7% of the Clonal Hematopoiesis Risk Score's predictive value for leukemia and all-cause mortality, respectively. These findings reveal key biological determinants of CHIP progression and suggest that incorporating growth rate measurements could enhance risk stratification.","NA","medrxiv",1736892493551

The methods were compared on proteomic depth, reproducibility, linearity, tolerance to lipid interference, and limit of detection/quantification. In total we performed 618 LC-MS/MS experiments and 93 Olink Explore HT assays. The Seer method achieved the greatest proteomic depth (~4,500), while Olink detected ~2,600 proteins. Other MS-based methods ranged from ~500-2,200. Neat, Mag-Net, Seer, and Olink had strong reproducibility, while PreOmics and Acid showed higher variability. All MS methods showed good linearity with spiked-in C-Reactive Protein (CRP); CRP was surprisingly not in the Olink assay. None of the methods were affected by lipid interference. Seer had more than double the number of quantifiable proteins (4,800) for both LOD and LOQ than the next best method. Olink was comparable to Neat and Mag-Net for LOD, but worse for LOQ.

For example, when cells encounter starvation, to maintain genomic integrity they should harbour robust mechanisms to stop DNA replication. Mechanisms regulating the progression of DNA replication when bacterial cells encounter starvation remain largely unclear. Herein, we identify the role of IncA -- a AAA+ ATPase homologous to the prokaryotic RarA and eukaryotic WRNIP1/Mgs1 -- in inhibiting the progression of chromosome replication in nutrient-starved stationary phase cells of Caulobacter crescentus. We show that the starvation-induced alarmone (p)ppGpp ensures the confinement of IncA production to the stationary phase cells. At the mechanistic level, IncA directly interacts with the {beta}-sliding clamp protein DnaN and disassembles DnaN from the replisome, thereby stalling the progression of DNA replication. Furthermore, we reveal the requirement of IncA's ATPase activity for disassembling DnaN. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the IncA homolog from E. coli is capable of inhibiting DNA replication in Caulobacter. We propose that IncA homologs serve a stress-dependent role in inhibiting DNA replication across diverse domains of life.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

While the literature suggests that these pathways cooperate to build the primitive streak, their individual contributions remain poorly understood, largely due to pleiotropic effects observed when key pathway components are knocked out in mouse embryos. In this study, we used gastruloids - a non-integrated stem cell model of mammalian gastrulation - to dissect the roles of Wnt and Nodal signalling. We found that Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling drives a genetic program characteristic of the late primitive streak, promoting the development of posterior body structures in a time and dose-dependent manner. Conversely, Nodal signalling activates a distinct developmental module resembling the early primitive streak. By engineering gastruloids with elevated Nodal signalling, we demonstrate that the decreasing temporal gradient of Nodal activity in the mouse primitive streak likely plays a pivotal role in establishing the anterior body plan, with higher Nodal levels producing more anterior structures in a concentration-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that rather than cooperating, Nodal and Wnt signalling act antagonistically, initiating distinct developmental modules within the primitive streak. This antagonism is likely the core mechanism driving the early body plan in mammals. Additionally, our results also lead to the suggestion that the gastruloid system models the primitive streak and reveals its self-organizing potential.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

Among bodily rhythms, respiration emerges as a key modulator of sensory processing. Multisensory integration, the non-linear combination of information from multiple senses to reduce environmental uncertainty, may be influenced by respiratory dynamics. This study investigated how respiration modulates reaction times and multisensory integration in a simple detection task. Forty healthy participants were presented with unimodal (Auditory, Visual, Tactile) and bimodal (Audio-Tactile, Audio-Visual, Visuo-Tactile) stimuli while their respiratory activity was recorded. Results revealed that reaction times systematically varied with respiration, with faster responses during peak inspiration and early expiration but slower responses during the expiration-to-inspiration transition. Applying the race model inequality approach to quantify multisensory integration, we found that Audio-Tactile and Audio-Visual stimuli exhibited the highest integration during the expiration-to-inspiration phase. These findings conceivably reflect respiration phase-locked changes in cortical excitability which in turn, orchestrates multisensory integration. Interestingly, participants also tended to adapt their respiratory cycles, aligning response onsets preferentially with early expiration. This suggests that, rather than a mere bottom-up mechanism, respiration is actively adjusted to maximise the signal-to-noise balance between interoceptive and exteroceptive signals.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is important early in metastasis to enable cancer cells to detach from neighboring cells, become migratory, and escape the primary tumor. While different phases of metastasis expose cells to variable nutrient environments and demands, the metabolic requirements and plasticity of each step are uncertain. Here we show that EMT and primary tumor escape are stimulated by disrupted oxidative metabolism. Using Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) patient samples, we identified the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor NDUFA4L2 as upregulated in cells undergoing EMT. Deletion of NDUFA4L2 enhanced oxidative metabolism and prevented EMT and metastasis while NDUFA4L2 overexpression enhanced these processes. Mechanistically, NDUFA4L2 suppressed oxidative phosphorylation and caused citric acid cycle intermediates to accumulate, which modified chromatin accessibility of EMT-related loci to drive primary tumor escape. The effect of impaired mitochondrial metabolism to drive EMT appeared general, as renal cell carcinoma patient tumors driven by fumarate hydratase mutations with disrupted oxidative phosphorylation were highly metastatic and also had robust EMT. These findings highlight the importance of dynamic shifts in metabolism for cell migration and metastasis, with mitochondrial impairment driving early phases of this process. Understanding mitochondrial dynamics may have important implications in both basic and translational efforts to prevent cancer deaths.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

To contextualize the genetic diversity in All of Us, we analyzed [~]2 million common variants from 230,016 unrelated whole genomes using classical population genetics methods, alongside reference panels such as the 1000 Genomes Project, Human Genome Diversity Project, and Simons Genome Diversity Project. Our analysis reveals that participants within self-identified race and ethnicity groups exhibit a gradient of genetic diversity rather than discrete clusters. The distributions of continental and subcontinental ancestries show considerable variation within race and ethnicity, both nationally and across states, reflecting the historical impacts of U.S. colonization, the transatlantic slave trade, and recent migrations.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US and it is important to monitor changes in pain during and after the pandemic.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential contributing factors.

MethodsWe analyze a nationally representative sample of 88,469 community-dwelling Americans aged 18 and older from three cross-sectional waves of the National Health Interview Survey before (2019), during (2021), and after (2023) the COVID-19 pandemic.

Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; fully controlled models include 19 additional covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of long COVID. Outcomes are CP and HICP using measures proposed by the US National Pain Strategy; we also present findings for six site-specific pain measures.

ResultsBetween 2019 and 2023, CP and HICP prevalence increased by 18% and 13%, respectively. Specifically, CP prevalence was 20.6% (95%CI: 19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9%(20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP prevalence declined from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019 to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021, before rising sharply to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023. The increases occurred in all examined body sites except for tooth/jaw pain, and in all major population groups. Approximately 13% of the increase in CP and HICP was attributable to long COVID.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before and during the pandemic but has surged substantially since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1736892493551

At the behavioral level, results showed more errors in avoidance behavior following sedentary stimuli than physical activity stimuli. At the brain level, avoidance behavior following sedentary stimuli was associated with more activation of the motor control network (dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex, primary and secondary motor cortices, somatosensory cortex). In addition, increased activation of the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus -- and structural deformation of the right hippocampus - were associated with a tendency toward approaching sedentary stimuli. Together, these results suggest that avoiding sedentary stimuli requires higher levels of behavioral control than avoiding physical activity stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1736892493551

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1736892493551

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1736892493551
