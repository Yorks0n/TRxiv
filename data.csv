Using polymer simulations and high-resolution live-cell microscopy, we identify rare but long-lived chromatin encounters arising from cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. These events occur when cohesin loads near the midpoint between two loci and extrudes them through a defined spatial radius, producing encounter durations that exceed those of random collisions. We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors. Our findings support a time-gated model of distal enhancer-promoter communication in which only rare, long-lived and mostly extrusion-driven encounters are productive, offering a unifying framework for how chromosome dynamics control transcription in single cells.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_192642;TMCG-3_213782;320030-236070;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 1305-2024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071479

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (esr1+) as well as from local esr1- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071479

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting 'spacetime attractor' excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219525/Z/19/Z;225926/Z/22/Z;219627/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GAT3955;GAT3755;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0040/2024-L;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 651-2023;""},{""name"":""Fondation Fyssen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071479

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of 'partial remapping'. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus' ability to support high-capacity memory storage.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071479

How its chromosome is dynamically reorganized across these contrasting states remains unclear. Here, we used synchronized predatory infections combined with time-resolved RNA-seq, Hi-C, ChIP-seq, and quantitative microscopy to map transcriptional activity and chromosome architecture across seven key stages of the predatory lifecycle. We uncover a dramatic shift in nucleoid organization - from an ultra-compact, transcriptionally restricted state in attack-phase cells to a progressively decompacted, ori-centered conformation during intracellular replication. Notably, distinct transcriptional and chromosome folding states not only mark the canonical attack and growth phases, but also critical transitions such as prey invasion, replication onset, and predator division. Temporal gene expression profiles reflect the coordinated regulation of core cellular functions across the predatory cycle. Furthermore, spatial localization of RNA polymerase, ribosomes, DNA-binding proteins, and freely diffusing proteins highlight the tight, cell cycle-dependent coupling between nucleoid compaction, chromosome accessibility, and transcriptional activity. Altogether, our findings reveal the intricate dynamics and coordination of genome folding and gene expression in a complex bacterial cell cycle driven by prey-predator interactions.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PREDATOR STG #802331;VAMPIRE COG #101171143;""},{""name"":""F.R.S.-FNRS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Crédit de Recherche &#34;PREDATOR NUCLEOID&#34;;""},{""name"":""Conseil Interuniversitaire de la Communauté Française de Belgique"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Actions de Recherche Concertées &#34;PACHIDERM&#34;;""},{""name"":""WEL Research Institute"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""WELBIO Starting Grant &#34;ARSENAL&#34;;""},{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-23-CHBS-0002;""},{""name"":""France Génomique"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-10-INBS-09;""},{""name"":""Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03356n642"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Fellowship;""},{""name"":""Institute Strategic Program Harnessing Biosynthesis for Sustainable Food and Health"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X01097X/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

Although pain states increase vulnerability to opioid use disorders, the neural mechanisms underlying this interaction remain incompletely understood. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a key site for opioid actions, and emerging evidence suggests that pain states and opioid experience both induce transcriptional, molecular, and circuit adaptations in the VTA that contribute to motivated behaviors. However, the transcriptional responses of distinct VTA cell types to each of these factors (alone or in combination) have not been identified. Here, we employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to comprehensively define transcriptional alterations in the rat VTA to acute morphine administration in a chronic inflammatory pain model. We report that morphine induces gene expression changes primarily in glial cells and dopamine neurons, with minimal effects in other neuronal cell types. Surprisingly, VTA astrocytes and oligodendrocytes exhibited the most robust transcriptional responses to opioid exposure, despite lacking detectable opioid receptor expression. Among the most highly regulated glial genes was Fkbp5, which encodes a co-chaperone protein that acts in concert with heat shock proteins to modulate stress responses. Using pharmacological and CRISPR-based approaches in rat glial cells and human astrocytes, we demonstrate that regulation of Fkbp5 is mediated indirectly through glucocorticoid signaling rather than direct opioid receptor activation. These findings reveal that glial cells within reward circuits undergo profound transcriptional reprogramming in response to opioids through indirect, stress-hormone mediated mechanisms, highlighting a previously unappreciated non-neuronal contribution to opioid-induced neural adaptations.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01DA053743;R01DA054714;K99MH127244;""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Neurobiology of Brain Disorders Award;""},{""name"":""UAB Center for Addiction and Pain Prevention and Intervention"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pilot Award;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

Why these chaperones were recruited is unclear, as they are absent and not required in other prokaryotic autotrophs. By retracing the evolution of Rubisco-chaperone interactions, we find that Rubiscos dependence on chaperones evolved neutrally and not by adaptive optimization, and that this may be reversed without compromising catalytic function.

In sum, this platform provides a comprehensive 3D atlas of early neoplastic transformation, yielding mechanistic insights into tumor initiation and informing clinical screening strategies for detecting cancer precursors in whole organs at cellular resolution.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U54CA268083;RO1CA300052;UG3CA275681;P50CA228991;R01GM149976;U01AI167892;5R01NS111039;R21NS125395;U54 HL165443;U54 DK 134301;R01 HL170107;U2CCA271891;""},{""name"":""Sloan research fellow award, a CZI Scialog award, and UCSD Startup funds"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Johns Hopkins University and Instituto Superior Técnico student exchange program (HOPTEC and FLAD)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Richard W.

This necessitates continuous RBC production, resulting in [~]200 billion new RBCs made per day to maintain oxygen delivery. Despite this enormous biosynthetic demand, the metabolic pathways supporting erythropoiesis are poorly understood. We profiled metabolites across four independent models of elevated erythropoiesis and a consistent increase in aspartate levels emerged when compared to controls. This suggested a potential role for aspartate metabolism in RBC production. To test this, we deleted the aspartate aminotransferases Got1 or Got2 globally or in an erythroid-specific manner. Loss of either enzyme resulted in anemia, with Got2 deficiency producing a more severe phenotype. Individual loss of either Got or dual Got deletion led to an erythroid defect, where early progenitors accumulated. In human and mouse models of erythropoiesis, GOT1 and GOT2 loss had opposing impacts on aspartate despite exhibiting similar anemic phenotypes, suggesting an aspartate-independent function for these enzymes. GOT1 and GOT2 are also components of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), which regulates NAD(H) homeostasis. However, conditional deletion of another MAS enzyme, Mdh1, did not cause anemia, and alleviating NADH reductive stress in GOT2-deficient cells with cytoplasmic bacterial NADH oxidase (LbNOX) failed to restore erythropoiesis. Instead, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses revealed dysregulation of chromatin histone modifications in GOT-deficient erythroid cells, implicating epigenetic dysfunction as a driver of defective erythropoiesis. Collectively, these findings identify a previously unrecognized role for GOT1 and GOT2 as a central link between metabolism and epigenetic regulation during erythroid development. These insights may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies for anemia.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R37 CA015910;RO1 CA025560;R01 CA001120;R01 CA148828;R01 CA245546;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00adh9b73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 DK095201;U2C DK129445;""},{""name"":""National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Division of Intramural Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/023ny1p48"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 HL148333;R01 HL157062;F31 HL172674-02.;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

However, behavioral evidence demonstrating links between image properties and memorability and revealing image specificity of visual memory suggests an important role for mid-level visual cortex. We tested the hypothesis that area V4 contains signals that could support recognition memory. Our task increased difficulty, allowing comparisons of neuronal population responses on correct and error trials. We observed signatures of several proposed memory mechanisms including magnitude coding, repetition suppression, sparse coding, and population response consistency, but only sparse coding and population response consistency predicted behavior. Familiar images also evoked faster dynamics, consistent with pattern completion. These findings demonstrate that the building blocks of fast, high-capacity memory are present in mid-level sensory cortex, highlighting its role in distributed memory networks.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Drug Abuse"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00fq5cm18"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5T90DA059109-03;""},{""name"":""National Eye Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wkg3b53"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01EY034723;R01EY022930;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RF1NS121913;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""542961SPI;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

Despite pioneering techniques to parameterize rhythmic and arrhythmic neural components based on power spectra, the methodology for quantifying rhythmic activity remains in its infancy. Variation in analytical choices for isolating brain rhythms from background arrhythmic activity makes interpreting findings across studies difficult. Whether current approaches can accurately recover the independent contribution of these neural signal elements remains to be established. Here, using simulation and parameter recovery approaches, we show that standard analytic methods for quantifying rhythmic activity conflate these two neurophysiological components, yielding spurious correlations between spectral model parameters. We propose an alternative approach to overcome these limitations and demonstrate effective separation of rhythmic and arrhythmic components in simulated neural time series. We validate these methods using resting-state recordings from a large cohort. Our recommendations for spectral parameterization enable the robust independent quantification of rhythmic and arrhythmic signal components for cognitive neuroscience.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

We present Spacelink, a unified framework that models spatial variability of a gene at both whole-tissue and cell-type resolution using an adaptive mixture of data-driven spatial kernels and summarizes it using an Effective Spatial Variability (ESV) metric. Spacelink achieved up to 3.2x higher detection power over eight existing global SVG and cell-type SVG methods while showing consistently superior FDR control across 34 different simulation settings and also showed superior cross-platform concordance in matched tissue Visium and CosMx datasets. Applied to 3 healthy CosMx human tissues (brain cortex, lymph node, liver), Spacelink revealed that SVGs are highly informative for 113 complex traits and diseases (average N = 340,406). Spacelink showed up to 2.2x higher disease informativeness over competing methods in tissue-relevant complex diseases and traits, conditional on putative non-spatial expression-level confounders. Applied to a mouse organogenesis Stereo-seq atlas (8 developmental stages), Spacelink identified 145 genes with stage-associated ESV within brain independent of mean expression, that are enriched in pathways like Wnt signaling and Rap1 signaling characterizing early and late development, respectively. Integration with in vivo Perturb-seq targeting 35 de novo ASD risk genes revealed that perturbations in excitatory neurons and astrocytes preferentially altered spatially structured downstream gene programs (1.7-2.2x higher average ESV across stages than other cell types), many of which were enriched for polygenic autism GWAS loci. In neurodegeneration, analysis of 32 Visium dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples spanning Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology stages identified 334 genes with decreasing ESV along amyloid burden (enriched for glycolysis) and 216 genes with decreasing ESV along tau tangle accumulation (enriched for apoptotic pathways). Several AD risk genes (PKM, CLU, GPI) showed conserved reductions in spatial variability with AD pathology in both human and 5xFAD mouse, with PKM linking to a colocalized splicing QTL and amyloid burden QTL variant. These results highlight the utility of Spacelink in decoding spatially variable gene programs that connect tissue architecture to disease genetics.","[{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R00HG012203;R01HG014008;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30CA008748;""},{""name"":""Amazon (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04mv4n011"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02yrq0923"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Alzheimer's Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0375f4d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ADSF-21-816675;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30AG10161;P30AG72975;""},{""name"":""National Institute on Aging"",""id"":""https://ror.org/049v75w11"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AG17917;R01AG015819;U01AG072572;U01AG046152;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

B-ALL is a malignant disease displaying considerable phenotypical and functional heterogeneity, yet the underlying cellular organization remains largely elusive. This study aims to investigate the hierarchical landscape of B-ALL by combining barcoding and multiome single cell data to unveil the differentiation architecture and temporal dynamics of leukemic differentiation at clonal and single cell resolution in vivo.

Single-cell transcriptome and AbSeq analysis of lentiviral barcoded and transplanted patient-derived B-ALL cells revealed interconnected subpopulations, which could be prospectively isolated via surface markers and exhibited distinct leukemogenicity. Barcode tracking demonstrated the ability of cells to differentiate from a source cluster into differentiated progeny. Using machine learning we identified expression patterns predicting their differentiation potential of each barcoded cell within the immature cell compartment. To determine the dynamical properties of clones, we have designed a mathematical model that simulates the development of these subpopulations from a clonally diverse stem cell compartment. The model confirmed the most likely cluster of origin, supporting our functional data, and revealed the variability in dynamical properties between clones, while largely excluding plasticity. Hence, our work demonstrates a unidirectional differentiation in B-ALL with an immature population exhibiting a high leukemogenic potential.

Using {Delta}zorABE,{Delta} druHE, and {Delta}armABCD single system deletion mutants in EDL933 {Delta}stx1/2, we showed that Druantia III and ARMADA II protect to different extents against a broad spectrum of phages, including the Drexlerviridae, Siphoviridae, Demerecviridae, Vequintavirinae and Autographiviridae, but not against hypermodified Tevenvirinae. Additionally, Zorya II caused strong protection only against Autographiviridae. Furthermore, EOP assays of combined system mutants revealed strong synergistic interactions of Druantia III and ARMADA II to provide more robust immunity against a similar phage spectrum than the additive protection of the individual systems. In contrast, Druantia III and Zorya II act only weakly synergistically against a few phages. Altogether, our results revealed that Druantia III and ARMADA II are responsible for most of the phage resistance of EDL933 {Delta}stx1/2, whereas Zorya II provides additional immunity against podoviruses. Future studies are underway to elucidate the molecular basis of the synergistic interactions between the Druantia III and ARMADA II systems.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

The predicted structures are used for a variety of downstream tasks such as pose-scoring functions or as a starting point for binding free energy estimation. The accuracy of downstream models depends on how well predicted poses match experimentally-validated poses. Although the ideal input to these downstream tasks would be experimental structures, the time and cost required to collect new experimental structures for synthesized compounds makes obtaining this structure for every input intractable. Thus, leveraging available structural data is required to efficiently extrapolate new designs. Using data from the open science COVID Moonshot project---where nearly every compound synthesized was crystallographically screened---we assess several popular strategies for generating docked poses in a structure-enabled discovery program using both retrospective and prospective analyses. We explore the tradeoff between the cost of obtaining crystal structures and the utility for accurately predicting poses of newly designed molecules. We find that a simple strategy using molecular similarity to identify relevant structures for template-guided docking is successful in predicting poses for the SARS-CoV-2 main viral protease. Further efficiency analysis suggests template-based docking of a scaffold series is a robust strategy even when the quantity of available structural data is limited. The resulting open source pipeline and curated datasets should prove useful for automated modeling of bound poses for downstream scoring, machine learning, and free energy calculation tasks for structure-based drug discovery programs.","[{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRQ-14-22;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99CA286801;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM152017;P30CA008748;T32GM115327;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2139291;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

Numerous foundation models have been developed, building upon early efforts such as Geneformer and scGPT. Hyperparameter optimization also results in multiple variants which require comparative analysis. Current benchmarking approaches focus on feature-based assessments or intuitive biological and statistical tasks, which may not align with the models' training objectives. A recent study proposed a systematic benchmarking framework; however, its scope was limited to pre-trained (zero-shot) models. To address these limitations, we propose Single-Cell Foundation Model Evaluation (scFME)-a systematic method designed to benchmark fine-tuned foundation models for insilico perturbation (ISP). scFME ensures comprehensive and robust assessment by requiring sufficient separation between control and perturbed cells at the outset and by quantifying ISP accuracy against zero and random perturbation baselines. Furthermore, scFME enables exploration of model performance across distinct gene categories, facilitating biological interpretation and functional relevance. Using this framework, we evaluated several commonly used models (and some of their variants) and demonstrated that the methodology effectively characterizes their performance in ISP studies. Our results position scFME as a versatile and rigorous methodology for evaluating and comparing current and future foundation models.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

However, tubulin conservation presents challenges in understanding the origins of diverse microtubule architectures. The mechanisms by which microtubule architecture varies through the life cycle of the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium are not understood and provide a valuable framework for exploring how intrinsic properties of tubulin contribute to architectural variety. Using parasite-purified tubulin, we determined structures of P. falciparum microtubules by cryo-electron microscopy. Parasite-specific sequences change the tubulin dimer structure, thereby modifying drug susceptibility and polymer mechanical properties. Within the P. falciparum microtubule, lateral contacts are smaller but stronger, and the lattice is stiffer than in mammalian microtubules. Non-canonical microtubule architectures found in parasites are highly similar to those observed in vitro, validating the physiological relevance of these properties. Our findings show how evolutionary adaptation of tubulin modulates the material properties of the microtubule cytoskeleton.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""528483508 – FIP 12;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/Y000633/1;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""227774/Z/23/Z;""},{""name"":""Office of Basic Energy Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mg91w61"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-SC0023318;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

From segmentations and trajectories, we extracted dynamic features-cell and nuclear shape, movement, position-to create a time-resolved morphodynamic dataset spanning the full course of differentiation. While single features showed high noise and low separability of ground-truth cell types, supervised machine learning revealed that integrating time-resolved features robustly predicts final cell fate. Gradient-boosted trees and multinomial logistic regression achieved moderate but consistent accuracy, especially for abundant epithelial lineages. Key discriminants included normalized Z-position, membrane-nucleus offset, and absolute experimental time, whereas movement contributed minimally to the results.

However, the mechanism of UVR8 nuclear import has remained unclear1,2. Here, we identified HOS1, a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), as a key mediator of UVR8 nuclear translocation under UV-B conditions. HOS1 directly interacts with UVR8 specifically in response to UV-B, facilitating its efficient import into the nucleus. Consistent with this role, HOS1-deficient mutants exhibit reduced HY5 protein accumulation, compromised UV-B tolerance, and impaired expression of HY5-regulated genes, including those involved in anthocyanin synthesis. These findings reveal a novel role of HOS1 in bridging UV-B perception in the cytoplasm and gene transcriptional activation in the nucleus by enabling UVR8 nuclear import.

By studying the schooling glassfish Danionella cerebrum, here we demonstrate that escape from danger is enhanced by visual perception of other escaping fish. We found that neural populations in the midbrain optic tectum and dorsal thalamus are activated by the rapid escape of social partners. These neurons are also driven by the sudden disappearance of virtual social partners, yet unaffected by disappearing stimuli without social relevance. Virtual fish schools that escape or disappear were sufficient to cause observers to escape, even in the absence of direct threats. These results demonstrate that rapid social-off detection in visual circuits enables the detection of socially transmitted threat information, which may be a particularly effective strategy for animals capable of rapid movement but limited visual range. These results show how neural computations in individuals enables rapid information sharing in animal collectives.","[{""name"":""UC San Diego J.

We evaluated the accuracy, including plasmid reconstruction, of Nanopore long-read only genome assemblies of Enterobacterales.

We sequenced 92 genomes from clinical Enterobacterales isolates, collected in England under a national surveillance program, with long-read Nanopore (R10.4.1, Dorado v5.0.0 super-high-accuracy basecalled) and short-read Illumina (NovaSeq) sequencing approaches. Genomes were assembled using three long-read only (Flye; Hybracter long; Autocycler), and three hybrid assemblers (Hybracter hybrid; Unicycler normal; bold). Three polishing modalities (Medaka v2 with subsampled or un-subsampled long-reads; Polypolish + Pypolca with short-reads) were investigated.

Autocycler circularised the most chromosomes (87/92 [95%]). Plasmid sequence reconstruction was comparable between all assemblers except Flye, all recovering 90-96% of plasmids, although the  ground truth was uncertain. Flye performed worse than other assemblers on almost all metrics. Autocycler + Medaka (un-subsampled long-reads) was the most accurate long-read only assembler/polisher combination, comparable to hybrid assemblies (median 0 [IQR:0-0] SNPs and 0 [IQR:0-1] indels per genome; quality value/Q score, 100 [IQR: 64-100]), with only 4/92 genome sequences having >10 SNPs/indels. Medaka polishing with un-subsampled long-reads resulted in small improvements in indels but not SNPs for both Flye and Autocycler assemblies. Seven-locus MLST, antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and stress gene annotation was equivalent across assembler/polisher combinations.

Nanopore long-read only bacterial genome assembly with Autocycler combined with Medaka polishing (using un-subsampled reads) is similarly accurate and possibly more complete than hybrid assemblies, representing a viable alternative for incorporating high-quality genomic data, including plasmids, into Enterobacterales surveillance.

Impact StatementNanopore long-reads have historically been too error-prone to use alone for accurate bacterial genome assembly, necessitating additional Illumina short-reads to achieve structurally complete and accurate  hybrid genome assemblies for public health surveillance. This increases cost and complexity. Previous studies have shown that recent improvements in Nanopore chemistry (R10.4.1 flowcell) and basecalling (super-high accuracy) allow high-quality long-read only assemblies on a small number of laboratory reference strains. This is the first evaluation, to our knowledge, to assess Nanopore long-read only genome assembly compared with hybrid assembly on a large number of clinical isolates. In addition, this is the first large-scale evaluation of the recently released automated consensus long-read assembly tool, Autocycler.

We show that Autocycler long-read only assemblies are more structurally complete for chromosomal sequences, while reconstructing a similar number of plasmids to other long-read and hybrid assemblers. Most long-read polished, Autocycler-assembled genome sequences have 0 errors (median: 0 SNPs/indels) relative to a short-read polished (hybrid) Autocycler assemblies, enabling accurate annotation of key genes.","[{""name"":""National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR207397;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

This approach enables rapid and large-scale in vitro affinity profiling and machine learning-based predictions, providing a valuable tool for studying emerging variants.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""198412;182019;PMPDP3_171383;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""723106;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

LP.8.1 was designated a Variant Under Monitoring by the WHO in January 2025 due to its potential to displace prior circulating variants. Informed by early growth modeling and antigenic analysis, we selected LP.8.1 as a candidate strain for the 2025-2026 vaccine season. Here, we describe the development of updated LP.8.1-matched mRNA vaccine compositions encoding either the full-length spike protein for mRNA-1273 (monovalent) or the membrane-anchored receptor-binding and N-terminal domains for the mRNA-1283 vaccine. Initial in vitro characterization, including structural analysis, demonstrated robust antigen expression and intact antigenic features. Immunogenicity of both vaccines were evaluated in murine models following immunization as either a primary series in naive animals or as a booster dose. LP.8.1-matched vaccines elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses against the homologous LP.8.1 strain and more recently emerging JN.1-lineage subvariants, including XFG and NB.1.8.1. Notably, the mRNA-1283 vaccine expressing LP.8.1 induced higher mean neutralization titers than the mRNA-1273 version across multiple variants. These data demonstrate the immunogenicity and breadth of both LP.8.1-based mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1283 vaccines in the context of ongoing JN.1 lineage evolution and support the selection of LP.8.1 as the updated vaccine antigen for the 2025-2026 season.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

This Gram-negative bacterium establishes pathogenicity through formation of multicellular communities, known as biofilms, that result in significant resistance to antibiotics and host immune systems. In Pa, the motile-to-biofilm transition is regulated through an interconnected signaling network known as the Gac Multikinase Network (Gac-MKN). This network comprises two regulatory branches: the HptB signaling network and GacS/A signaling network. In the Gac-MKN, several histidine kinases converge to regulate the activity of the post-transcriptional regulator protein, RsmA. Although previous studies have assessed the role of individual kinases in this network, the role of each Gac-MKN kinase in regulating RsmA activity has not been quantitatively characterized and compared in side-by-side experiments in the same reference strain, which is presented here. In this study, we show that kinases NahK and RetS are the predominant regulators of the Gac-MKN. Through controlled testing of RsmA-dependent phenotypes, we demonstrate loss of nahK or retS leads to complete inactivation of RsmA, triggering biofilm formation. Our results support previous findings that RetS regulates RsmA through the GacS/A network but present the new finding that NahK is the central kinase involved in HptB phosphorylation; previous studies have attributed HptB phosphorylation to PA1611 and SagS. Our findings demonstrate that NahK signaling controls RsmA activity to rapidly transition between the motile and biofilm states. We anticipate the results of this study will facilitate the use of targeting the Gac-MKN to trigger biofilm dispersal for improved antibiotic treatment.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM118894;T32GM136572;K12GM102778;""},{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CHE-2050541;""},{""name"":""Marcus and Kimberley Boehm"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

One of the major threats to genome integrity is Transposable Elements (TEs), which can be post-transcriptionally silenced through small RNAs (sRNAs) and argonaute proteins. Recent work suggests TE-derived sRNAs may also act as virulence factors in host-pathogen interactions. During infection, the intestinal parasite Heligmosomoides bakeri secretes a single argonaute protein (exWAGO) and a wide variety of TE-derived sRNAs. Although exWAGO is highly expressed, conserved, and secreted by parasitic nematodes, its function and sRNA guide preference remain unclear. Using comparative transcriptomics of the sRNAs bound to exWAGO within parasites of rodents, livestock and humans, and its orthologs in C. elegans, we found that exWAGO is capable of loading sRNAs produced from all classes of TEs in addition to some protein-coding and non-coding transcripts. However, our results suggest that the ancestral endogenous function of exWAGO was likely linked to LTR retrotransposon regulation. To understand how this relates to potential extracellular functions of exWAGO we also examined the sRNAs bound to exWAGO secreted by H. bakeri in both vesicular and non-vesicular forms. Extracellular exWAGO preferentially loads sRNA guides derived from non-autonomous and fragmented LTRs, suggesting the existence of adaptable reservoirs of regulatory sRNAs with potential roles in cross-species RNA communication. Together, our results show that exWAGO is part of an evolutionarily conserved pathway for LTR retrotransposon regulation, while preferentially utilising degenerated elements as sources of secreted sRNAs.","[{""name"":""The Darwin Trust of Edinburgh"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00fzhcx31"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT) MX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""896776;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust PhD Programme"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""108905/Z/15/Z;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101002385;""},{""name"":""Leverhulme Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012mzw131"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RPG-2019-404;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

Such same-sample multi-omics can reveal, for instance, when changes observed in the transcriptome share distinct but coordinated signals in epigenetics and proteomics, relationships otherwise unclear. Here, we apply a data-driven multi-omic framework to integrate epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and cell-type-specific population data from up to 1,358 aged human brain samples from the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We demonstrate the existence of sprawling cross-omics cross-system biological factors that also relate to AD phenotypes. The strongest AD-associated factor (factor 8) involved elevated immune activity at the epigenetic level, decreased expression of heat shock genes in the transcriptome, and disrupted energy metabolism and cytoskeletal dynamics in the proteome. We also showed immune-related factors (factors 2 and 3) with discordant enrichments, reflecting reactive-like glial subpopulations and protective contributions from surveillance microglia. Both were negatively associated with AD pathology, suggesting potential immune resilience mechanisms. Finally, unsupervised clustering of participants revealed eleven molecular subtypes of the aging brain, including three clusters strongly associated with AD but displaying distinct molecular signatures and phenotypic characteristics.

The literature is extensive and heterogeneous, making it challenging to synthesise current knowledge, identify evidence gaps, and inform research priorities. Methods: We performed a bibliometric review of long COVID publications indexed in Scopus from January 2020 to March 2025. Records were analysed using VOSviewer and Biblioshiny to assess publication trends, country and institutional contributions, authorship networks, citation impact, and thematic clusters. Results: Publications on long COVID grew at an annual rate of 19.81%, peaking in 2024, reflecting intensified global attention. The United States, China, and the United Kingdom were the most significant contributors. Thematic mapping revealed three dominant clusters: clinical research on manifestations and diagnostics; psychological research on mental health and cognitive sequelae; and social and rehabilitation research addressing disability, return to work, and service delivery. Prominent institutions and key authors played a central role in knowledge production and collaboration networks. Notable gaps included limited studies on paediatric long COVID, scarce long-term outcome data from diverse populations and settings, and few rigorous evaluations of interventions and service models. Conclusions: The long COVID research landscape from 2020 to 2025 is dynamic and increasingly collaborative, yet exhibits geographic and topical imbalances. To advance understanding and improve patient outcomes, stakeholders should support inclusive international collaborations, prioritise funding for underexplored populations and intervention trials, and accelerate translation of findings into clinical guidelines and integrated care models. Continued bibliometric monitoring will help target research investments and policy responses.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758838071480

Specifically, reversing an ancestral mutation bias (e.g., in Escherichia coli, shifting from a transition-biased to a transversion-biased mutation spectrum) enhances access to under-sampled variants, increasing the supply of beneficial mutations. However, the effect of mutation bias relative to other factors influencing adaptation remains unclear. By experimentally evolving wild type and mutator E. coli strains in different growth media, we show that mutation bias reversal facilitates early adaptation, altering the genetic basis of adaptation and the type of mutations accumulated under selection. Together, mutation bias, mutation rate, and initial fitness correctly predicted relative adaptation rates for any pair of strains. Our results highlight multiple ways in which mutational processes can shape genetic and phenotypic outcomes of adaptation.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04reqzt68"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IA/S/23/2/506989;""},{""name"":""National Centre for Biological Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03gf8rp76"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RTI 4006;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

Although single-cell RNA-sequencing studies have characterized immune cellular features of COVID-19, they have not shown how tocilizumab treatment changes these features at single-cell resolution, or which features might persist into convalescence. In this study, we analyzed 2.5 million circulating immune cells from 428 patients across time points (840 PBMC samples), encompassing three contemporaneous SARS-CoV-2 cohorts: acutely infected patients across five WHO disease severity levels and three time points, patients from the first randomized control trial to study the efficacy of tocilizumab in the management of COVID-19, and convalescent patients three months after infection. We used linear modeling to integrate multiple data types - including single-cell RNA-seq, CITE-seq, TCR and BCR sequencing, viral load measurements, viral neutralization assays, detection of 75 autoantibodies, HLA genotype data, and serum proteomics covering 1,463 targets - to derive the most comprehensive view to-date of the biological features of COVID-19 disease severity. Our findings show that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) act as a key immunologic pivot point in severe COVID-19. Myeloid dysfunction, which is marked by impaired antigen presentation, drives a non-productive adaptive immune response, as reflected by reduced expression of B and T cell gene programs involved in antigen recognition, immune synapse formation, and cytotoxicity. Severe disease is also linked to autoantibodies targeting type I interferons, influenced by specific HLA-DQB1 allelic variants, and strongly correlated with serum IL-6 levels. Tocilizumab treatment eliminates CLU-expressing MDSCs and ISG-positive myeloid subsets, restores antigen presentation, and reactivates productive adaptive immunity. These changes align with improved clinical outcomes and better clinical laboratory measures, including reduced CRP. While many immunologic abnormalities in acute severe COVID-19 resolve during convalescence 3-months post-infection, we observed persistently high ICOS expression in regulatory T cells, potentially linking acute infection to chronic post-COVID syndromes. Overall, we define distinct innate and adaptive host immune responses associated with acute, IL-6-responsive, and convalescent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our multimodal and high-dimensional dataset with curated clinical metadata provides a foundational and clinically relevant resource for modeling host immune response biology in health and disease.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758838071480

Leveraging recent findings that place its center of diversity in the cool, high-elevation forests of Hawaii, we performed an intensive survey of the Caenorhabditis fauna of Pohnpei, a high island in Micronesia that is home to the largest patch of high-elevation forest between Hawaii and East Asia. We found nine species of Caenorhabditis, five of them new, but not C. elegans. Most species were limited to the hot lowlands but three spanned the elevational range and one was found only in the cloudforest. Using the distribution of Caenorhabditis nematodes among habitat patches - individual rotting fruits or flowers - we parameterized simple models that capture key aspects of the population biology of these animals. We generated transcriptomes for the new species and inferred a phylogeny for 70 species of Caenorhabditis, based on 2955 genes. This phylogeny allowed us to perform the first quantitative biogeographic analysis for the group. Our analysis suggests that the deep ancestors of the Elegans Supergroup of species lived in the Americas, and that the Supergroup's subsequent diversification occurred in Remote Oceania. The ancestors of the Supergroup gave rise to a diverse Oceanian fauna and ultimately to multiple lineages that moved into Asia, Africa, Australasia, and back into the Americas. Though biogeographic inferences are limited by the lack of information from key regions of the southwest Pacific, the data are consistent with a model of trans-Pacific migration, with the islands of Oceania serving as sources rather than sinks for biodiversity.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM141906;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

Current pathological models emphasize defects in nuclear mechanics and transcription regulation. Yet these models do not fully explain the complexity of EDMD or other laminopathies. Here, we uncover an emerging pathway linking nuclear lamina defects to the reorganization of cytoplasmic biophysics, revealing how nuclear dysfunction cascades throughout the cell. Using Caenorhabditis elegans EDMD models, we demonstrate that lamin mutations dramatically alter cytoplasmic organization, reducing macromolecular crowding and increasing diffusivity of 40 nm Genetically Encoded Multimeric (GEM) nanoparticles. These striking biophysical changes coincide with nuclear positioning defects and collapsed endoplasmic reticulum architecture, mirroring phenotypes associated with ribosome depletion. We propose a mechanism where mutations in the C. elegans lamin lmn-1 disrupt nucleolar density and ribosome biogenesis, creating a nucleolar-ribosomal axis that propagates defects from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Genetic interactions between lmn-1 and ribosomes support this regulatory relationship. While individual depletion of other nuclear envelope proteins produces minimal effects, combined loss of the functionally redundant emerin ortholog emr-1 and LEM-domain protein lem-2 phenocopied lmn-1 mutants, demonstrating that cytoplasmic biophysical disruption lies at EDMD's pathogenic core.

However, standard gLMs adapted from natural language processing often require extremely large model sizes and computational resources, yet still fall short of classical evolutionary models in predictive tasks. Here, we introduce GPN-Star (Genomic Pretrained Network with Species Tree and Alignment Representation), a biologically grounded gLM featuring a phylogeny-aware architecture that leverages whole-genome alignments and species trees to model evolutionary relationships explicitly. Trained on alignments spanning vertebrate, mammalian, and primate evolutionary timescales, GPN-Star achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of variant effect prediction tasks in both coding and non-coding regions of the human genome. Analyses across timescales reveal task-dependent advantages of modeling more recent versus deeper evolution. To demonstrate its potential to advance human genetics, we show that GPN-Star substantially outperforms prior methods in prioritizing pathogenic and fine-mapped GWAS variants; yields unprecedented enrichments of complex trait heritability; and improves power in rare variant association testing. Extending beyond humans, we train GPN-Star for five model organisms - Mus musculus, Gallus gallus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Arabidopsis thaliana - demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the framework. Taken together, these results position GPN-Star as a scalable, powerful, and flexible new tool for genome interpretation, well suited to leverage the growing abundance of comparative genomics data.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35-GM134922;3P40-OD011102-24S1 7772;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

Synteny, the conservation of gene order along a chromosome, presents a promising alternative source of phylogenetic information that is potentially less prone to these issues. Here we compare sequence and synteny phylogenetic phylogenomic approaches to unravel the evolutionary history of Cypriniformes, one of the most species-rich lineages of freshwater fishes. This clade has been plagued by uncertainty, particularly concerning the phylogenetic relationships between its four major subclades: Gyrinocheilidae (algae eaters), Catostomidae (suckers), Cobitoidei (loaches), and Cyprinoidei (minnows and carps). Phylogenomic approaches require high-quality genomic resources, which have been lacking for the family Gyrinocheilidae, a key lineage for understanding cypriniform evolution. To address this, we generated the first chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation for the Chinese Algae Eater (Gyrinocheilus aymonieri). We utilized this new genome along with 42 other fish genomes to conduct comprehensive phylogenomic analyses and compare results from sequence-based methods with a microsynteny-based approach. Although chromosome-level macrosynteny is broadly conserved among cypriniforms, we demonstrate that microsynteny has impressive power to resolve deep phylogenetic nodes. Both sequence-based and microsynteny-based analyses find that Gyrinocheilidae is the sister lineage to all other cypriniforms, resolving a long-standing phylogenetic point of contention. However, while sequence-based analyses provided weak support for the relationships among the remaining subclades, our microsynteny analysis revealed a novel and strongly supported sister relationship between Catostomidae and Cyprinoidei. This conclusion is supported by a 3- to 12-fold greater number of shared microsynteny clusters (synapomorphies) compared to the alternative topologies. We also demonstrate that microsynteny synapomorphies often arise from gene family expansions. Conservation of synteny concentrated in specific genomic regions may harbor the genomic underpinnings of the unique aspects of these clades and have played an important role in the evolutionary history of these taxa. Together, these results provide a robust phylogenomic backbone for Cypriniformes. More broadly, our findings highlight the power of microsynteny to resolve recalcitrant phylogenetic nodes where sequence data is uninformative, while also underscoring the critical importance of high-quality reference genomes, as our work also shows that including fragmented assemblies can lead to spurious results. Beyond phylogenomics, our results also provide a functional genomics glimpse into how conserved, clade-specific blocks of collinear genes (synteny synapomorphies) might contribute to what makes this hyperdiverse clade so unique and evolutionarily successful.","[{""name"":""University at Buffalo, State University of New York"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01y64my43"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TJK laboratory startup funds;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

For example, someone talking about their hand is not referring to the other speakers hand, but the word ""hand"" still carries speaker-general information (e.g., having five fingers). These two requirements impose a cross-speaker generalization / differentiation dilemma that is not well addressed by existing theories. We hypothesized that the brain resolves the dilemma by use of a vectorial semantic code that blends collinear and orthogonal coding subspaces. To test this hypothesis, we examined semantic encoding in populations of hippocampal single neurons recorded during conversations between epilepsy patients and healthy partners in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU). We found clear semantic encoding for both spoken and heard words, with strongest encoding just around the time of utterance for production, and just after it for reception. Crucially, hippocampal neurons codes for word meaning were poised between orthogonalized and collinearized. Moreover, different semantic categories were orthogonalized to different degrees; body parts and names were most differentiated between speakers; function words and verbs were least differentiated. Finally, the hippocampus used the same coding principle to separate different partners in three-person conversations, with greater orthogonalization between self and other than between two others. Together, these results suggest a new solution to the problem of binding word meanings with speaker identity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

In the brain parenchyma, it is executed by microglia, which are encumbered by large numbers of apoptotic debris generated during development, in adult neurogenic niches, aging, and brain diseases. Emerging evidence suggest that phagocytosis is not limited to garbage disposal, but triggers adaptations in the phagocytes that may have a functional impact. To test it we developed an in vivo model of superphagocytosis induced by low cranial irradiation (LCI, 2Gy) that specifically induced apoptosis in the neurogenic niche of the adult hippocampus, synchronizing microglia in a phagocytic state within 6h and leading to full clearance by 24h. Single cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics revealed an unexpected oxidative stress in post-phagocytic microglia, accompanied by catabolic shutdown, mitochondrial remodeling, increased expression of galectin 3, and production of polyamines that led to cell death and compensatory proliferation. To test whether these changes impaired subsequent microglial phagocytosis, we used a glioblastoma model treated with sequential irradiation to induce tumor cell apoptosis. The phagocytosis efficiency of tumor-associated microglia/macrophages was comparable in the first and second apoptotic challenge, suggesting that the metabolic remodeling induced by phagocytosis was adaptive and destined to sustain their functionality. Finally, we assessed the functional impact of post-phagocytosis adaptations using galectin 3 deficient mice under LCI. We found that the recovery of the neurogenic niche after LCI strongly depended on galectin 3, demonstrating the regenerative capacity of post-phagocytic microglia. Overall, our data unveils the complexity of post-phagocytosis adaptations in microglia, underscoring their unexplored therapeutic potential in brain disorders.","[{""name"":""Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation Competitiveness"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RTI2018-099267-B-I00;PID2022-136698OB-I00;RYC-2013-12817;""},{""name"":""Basque Government"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00pz2fp31"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IT1473-22;PIBA 2020_1_0030;""},{""name"":""Tatiana Foundation Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P-048-FTPGB 2018;""},{""name"":""Alzheimer's Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0375f4d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AARG-NTF-24-1304352;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

Here we show that the prevalence of sideways locomotion in true crabs reflects a single evolutionary origin from a forward-moving ancestor. Our behavioral analysis of 50 live crab species indicates that crab locomotion can be separated into two distinct types, sideways and forward locomotion, with no intermediates. The phylogenetic comparative analysis revealed a single origin of sideways locomotion, with multiple independent reversions to forward locomotion in ecologically specialized groups. The species richness data show that the lineage in which sideways locomotion originated is far more diverse than its nearest outgroups. These results suggest that sideways locomotion acted as a key innovation, potentially promoting adaptive radiation by enabling true crabs to exploit a wide range of ecological niches. Such a rare but innovative behavioral trait provides a framework for understanding how locomotor modes shape evolutionary diversification in animals.","[{""name"":""Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from The Japan Science Society"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-4086;2025-4060;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

Interleaving the two tasks hindered performance when their structures were similar, compared to when they were different.

However, the conditions and mechanisms that lead to the robust induction of respiratory IgA responses following mucosal vaccination remain poorly understood. It is also currently debatable whether mucosal vaccination is still warranted given that most individuals in developed countries have established a hybrid immunity from vaccination and infection. Here we characterized respiratory mucosal immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination or both in humans. We found that hybrid immunity resulted in moderately increased respiratory IgA and neutralizing antibody responses compared to infection or vaccination alone. However, a direct comparison of hybrid immunity and a mucosal adenovirus-based booster vaccination in animal models revealed that respiratory booster immunization elicited markedly stronger and more durable respiratory IgA, T cell response, and protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, supporting the promise of respiratory mucosal vaccination. Mechanistically, we found that mucosal booster immunization induced local IgA- secreting cells in the respiratory mucosa, aided by pulmonary CD4+ T cells in situ. Strikingly, local IL-21-producing Blimp-1+ Th1 effector cells were critical in mediating the CD4+ T cell help for respiratory IgA production. Furthermore, lung macrophages were important for this respiratory IgA response via the production of TGF-{beta}. Consequently, we demonstrated delivery of adenoviral booster to the lower airway was necessary to generate robust upper and lower airway IgA responses. Collectively, our results uncover a local cellular network supporting enhanced respiratory IgA responses, with implications for the development of optimal mucosal immunization strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

Moreover, the success of this curriculum is well supported by theories of operant conditioning and reinforcement learning.

In this study, we enriched immune cells from 32 term and preterm placentas (chorionic villi, decidua basalis, and cord blood) and conducted single cell transcriptomics to evaluate the state and putative function of innate and adaptive immunity accompanying fetal trophoblast cells. Gestational age was a major driver of pro-labor pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1B and TNF that in some cases were elevated too early by preterm complications. Similarly, term placentas exhibited notable expansion of TCR clones, which were gestational age-dependent except in pathologies like chorioamnionitis and vasa previa. We used genome-wide SNP calling to deconvolute the origin of fetal cells and maternal cells, finding that both mother and fetus contribute substantially to all major immune cell lineages within the placental villi.

To gain further insight into the events that drive longitudinal growth, we combined BONCAT-based labeling of newly synthesized proteins with high-resolution imaging and determined that the in-series addition of sarcomeres is mediated by a process that involves transverse splitting at the Z-lines of pre-existing sarcomeres. Collectively, our findings not only challenge the long-standing view that mechanically induced growth is uniformly governed by mTORC1, but they also lay the framework for a new understanding of the molecular and structural events that drive this process.

To account for the brains anatomically nested structure, we developed and applied a hierarchical statistical framework that detects region-specific changes in activity and outperforms conventional methods that treat brain regions as individual, unrelated units. These distributed signals formed ensembles with consistent and anatomically structured patterns of activity, both within subregions and across multiple connected brain areas. By combining TRAP2-based activity tagging with acute whole-brain c-Fos staining, we identified morphine- and withdrawal-activated ensembles and found that they are largely non-overlapping at the single-cell level, even within the same brain region. Integration with existing spatial transcriptomics datasets identified molecular markers for these state-specific ensembles in key brain areas such as the nucleus of accumbens, amygdala and ventral tegmental areas. Lastly, by integrating Allen mouse whole-brain transcriptional datasets, we identified the molecular identity of the morphine- administration and withdrawal ensembles. These findings define dissociable neuronal ensembles that encode opposing drug states and introduce a scalable framework for linking whole-brain activity to molecular and circuit-level mechanisms.

Unfortunately, only minimal scientific information on the effects of 6-MN is available.

ObjectiveTo determine the extent to which 6-MN produces nicotine-like effects on body temperature, wheel activity and nociception in laboratory rodents.

MethodsMiddle-aged (starting at Post Natal Day 425) female Wistar rats were evaluated for rectal temperature, voluntary wheel activity, and nociceptive responses (warm water tail-withdrawal) to subcutaneous injection of nicotine (0.0, 0.8 mg/kg) or 6-methyl nicotine (6-MN; 0.0, 0.4, 0.8 mg/kg). Temperature and nociceptive responses to vapor inhalation of 6-MN [0-30 mg/mL in the propylene glycol (PG) vehicle] were assessed. Finally, the self-administration of 6-MN vapor was compared with nicotine vapor self-administration.

Results6-MN decreased rectal temperature, suppressed wheel activity and induced modest nociceptive effects. The magnitude of the effect of 0.8 mg/kg 6-MN and 0.8 mg/kg nicotine were similar across all three assays. Vapor self-administration of 6-MN and nicotine was likewise comparable at a 10 mg/mL concentration.

Conclusion6-MN administered by injection or by vapor inhalation produces behavioral and physiological effects that are very similar to those produced by nicotine in rats. It is therefore likely that detrimental health effects of 6-MN will be quite similar to those established for nicotine.","[{""name"":""Tobacco Related Disease Research Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T33IR6653;""},{""name"":""National Institute on Drug Abuse"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00fq5cm18"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R01 DA057423;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

A new assay captures a specific population of Golgi-derived vesicles at the bud neck, thereby revealing which resident Golgi proteins are carried as cargo in those vesicles. This method supplies evidence for at least three classes of intra-Golgi vesicles with different cargo compositions. Consistent with our previously published data, one class of vesicles mediates a late pathway of intra-Golgi recycling with the aid of the AP-1 and Ent5 clathrin adaptors, and a second class of vesicles mediates an early pathway of intra-Golgi recycling with the aid of the COPI vesicle coat. Here, we identify another COPI-dependent pathway of intra-Golgi recycling and show that it operates kinetically between the two previously known pathways. Thus, intra-Golgi recycling is mediated by multiple COPI-dependent pathways followed by a clathrin-dependent pathway.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 GM144050;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors1-5, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

Genetic deletion of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in mice resulted in weakened uterine contractions and severe parturition defects. Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either the uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects, whereas combined loss significantly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing showed that loss of PIEZO reduced expression of connexin43 (Gja1), a gap junction protein in uterine smooth muscle cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to impaired contraction.

To this end, large-scale CRISPR screens have been conducted to perturb thousands of candidate enhancers. Using these data, predictive models have been developed that aim to generalize such findings to predict which enhancers regulate which genes across the genome. However, existing CRISPR methods and large-scale datasets have limitations in power, scale, or selection bias, with the potential to skew our understanding of the properties of distal regulatory elements and confound our ability to evaluate predictive models. Here, we develop a new framework for highly powered, unbiased CRISPR screens, including an optimized experimental method (Direct-Capture Targeted Perturb-seq (DC-TAP-seq)), a random design strategy, and a comprehensive analytical pipeline that accounts for statistical power. We applied this framework to survey 1,425 randomly selected candidate regulatory elements across two human cell lines. Our results reveal fundamental properties of distal regulatory elements in the human genome. Most element-gene regulatory interactions are estimated to have small effect sizes (<10%), which previous experiments were not powered to detect. Most cis-regulatory interactions occur over short genomic distances (<100 kb). A large fraction of the discovered regulatory elements bind CTCF but do not show chromatin marks typical of classical enhancers. Housekeeping genes have similar frequencies of distal regulatory elements compared to other genes, but with 2-fold weaker effect sizes. Comparisons to the predictions of the ENCODE-rE2G model suggest that, while performance is similar across two cell types, new models will be needed to detect elements with weaker effect sizes, regulatory effects of CTCF sites, and enhancers for housekeeping genes. Overall, this study describes the first unbiased, perturbation-based survey of thousands of distal regulatory element-gene connections, and provides a framework for expanding such efforts to build more complete maps of distal regulation in the human genome.","[{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Genomic Mechanisms of Disease"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF21SA0072102;""},{""name"":""NHGRI Impact of Genomic Variation on Consortium"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UM1HG011972;""},{""name"":""NHLBI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HL159176;""},{""name"":""NHGRI Genomic Innovator Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35HG011324;""},{""name"":""NSF Graduate Research Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DGE-1656518;""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG011664;""},{""name"":""AHA Postdoctoral Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""821920 and 23POSTCHF1019753;""},{""name"":""NSF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DMS-2113072 and NSF DMS-2310654.;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

To address this gap, we developed GFP-based recombination reporter assays to study the formation of L1 retrotransposition-mediated rearrangements. Using these reporters combined with long-read sequencing approaches, we find that L1 retrotransposition intermediates can recombine with distal DNA breaks to generate chromosomal rearrangements. We also find that two distinct L1 insertion intermediates can recombine with each other to generate chromosomal rearrangements. Both types of rearrangements depend on L1-encoded ORF2p endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities.

Although limited zoonotic cases have resulted from the current epizootic outbreak, the wide diversity of influenza viruses in avian hosts means the emergence of new strains that could transmit to humans more readily cannot be ruled out. There is therefore a need to anticipate zoonotic potential before spillover occurs.

Here, we develop a novel zoonotic prediction model for avian influenza viruses, building upon ""host-predictor"" machine learning methods that estimate host potential given only a viral genome sequence. We construct a machine learning framework combining individual sub-models of influenza genome segments, each trained on many genomic and proteomic traits (e.g., k-mer composition, codon biases, protein physicochemistry).

To prevent over-fitting to heavily sampled lineages and ensure models generalise to phylogenetically distant viruses, we pre-process training data by considering clusters of shared sequence identity. Curated training sets cover [~]4,000 representative, complete genome sequences of avian influenza from 120 subtypes including 9 containing known zoonotic viruses.

We combine best-performing models into a single ensemble that can distinguish zoonotic capability of sequences held out from training with strong performance (AUROC = 0.95, F1 score = 0.90), including sequences of rarely-sampled subtypes, e.g., H10N8. Interrogating ensemble model decisions also allows us to identify influential genomic motifs most associated with human infection.

These findings suggest specific genomic traits that are key to understanding and monitoring evolution of influenza viruses that circulate within bird populations. Our ensemble model can estimate zoonotic potential for new sequence inputs, offering a means to quickly risk-assess emerging avian influenza strains as soon as a sequence becomes available.","[{""name"":""Seqirus (United Kingdom)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022 – 2027 Framework Research Collaboration Agreement Influenza Research Partnership collaboration plan 002;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

Using this approach, we screened over 1,750 opsins from a range of families. We discovered that the F240A mutation of the light-gated potassium channel WiChR abolished potassium selectivity, turning it into a sensitive excitatory channel that we dubbed ""WAChR"". We systematically mutated WAChR and identified variants that expand the frontier of speed-sensitivity tradeoffs. Multiple WAChR variants produced large inward currents in response to indoor ambient office light, and responded to irradiances as low as 15 nW/mm2, something that we did not observe with other ultra-sensitive opsins.

Oral microbiome species diversity fell within the range previously observed among other northern European populations over the past 7,000 years, suggesting that a royal lifestyle and a rich diet did not substantially shift his oral microbiome composition. Reconstructed Tannerella genomes contained many virulence factors found today among periopathogens, including Tannerella forsythia. Insufficient plant and animal DNA was recovered to investigate diet, suggesting that dental calculus may not be a sufficient source of dietary DNA for dietary reconstruction, even when well-preserved.

Although ""correlation does not imply cau-sation"" has become a cliche, leveraging correlations effectively--and understanding their inferential pitfalls--remains a nuanced challenge. Correlation-based analyses are typically not able to yield causal conclusions, yet they are fre-quently used to underpin causal narratives in neuroscience research and especially in clinical contexts, which represent a problematic case of overinterpretation.

Using causal inference reasoning, simulations and analytic methods, we address three critical questions when performing resting-state fMRI:

O_LIHow reliable are correlation estimates for capturing cross-regional synchrony?
C_LIO_LIWhat are the consequences of inaccuracies in estimated correlations?
C_LIO_LITo what extent do estimated correlations reflect causal neural interactions?
C_LI

We identify two principal pitfalls. First, correlation estimates are systematically distorted by diverse noise sources, including variability in neurovascular coupling, which can generate spurious, suppressed, or even reversed effects. Second, graph-based approaches lack causal interpretability, meaning that even large samples and strong statistical evidence may obscure fundamental ambiguities in what the correlations represent. In light of these challenges, we advocate for three priorities: (1) cautious interpretation that avoids causal overreach, (2) multimodal validation to cross-check findings against independent measures, and (3) enhanced methodological rigor, particularly in biomarker discovery and clinical trials, to ensure that resting-state fMRI provides meaningful insights.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ZICMH002888;ZIAMH002783;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

However, it remains unclear how the nutrients released during cell lysis affect the growth dynamics of the remaining bacterial population. Addressing this gap, we built a controlled system consisting of two Escherichia coli lysogenic strains: one carrying a wild-type{lambda} prophage and the other a temperature-inducible variant that can be induced to lyse at 38 {degrees}C. Using this system, we selectively induced phage lysis in a defined fraction of the population and quantified both total biomass and the biomass of surviving, non-lysed cells. We observed that the biomass loss was consistently smaller than expected based on the fraction of lysed cells, supporting the idea that some of the released biomass is rapidly recycled by the non-lysed population. To formalize the observed dynamics and obtain quantitative insight, we developed a mathematical model showing that nutrients released during lysis can transiently enhance the growth rate of the surviving, non-lysed cells. This effect emerges on a short timescale of minutes, consistent with the rapid onset of biomass compensation observed experimentally. The growth rate increase was confirmed in single-cell experiments using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, where we cultured wild-type lysogens in lysate-containing culture supernatants. In summary, the results suggest that nutrients released through lysis are rapidly consumed, leading to an acceleration in the growth rate of non-lysed cells. The consequent partial compensation for cell loss can substantially influence the population dynamics, highlighting phage lysis as a direct modulator of bacterial growth. Overall, our findings provide quantitative insights into how phage-mediated lysis affects the physiology of non-lysed bacterial cells, extending beyond its well-established role in biomass recycling.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""180575;225148;188642;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

Here, we used the dTAG system to titrate the cellular dosage of human RPB1, the largest RNAPII subunit, to more generally assess the importance of RNAPII levels. Unexpectedly, cells are extremely sensitive to RPB1 dosage, with a mere 30% reduction sufficient to perturb cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and global transcription. Importantly, alterations in RPB1 abundance trigger hierarchical gene expression changes that are highly organized rather than stochastic. Using a combination of sequencing and proteomic approaches, we uncover the existence of multiple feedback loops between transcriptional initiation, promotor-proximal pause release, transcript elongation, splicing, and mRNA half-life, which together establish RNAPII abundance as a crucial systems-level regulator of transcriptional homeostasis.","[{""name"":""Danish National Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00znyv691"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DNRF166;""},{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04txyc737"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF19OC0055875;""},{""name"":""The Francis Crick Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04tnbqb63"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FC001166;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480

Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions.

Human participants learned sequences of environments in immersive virtual reality. They then learned novel environment transitions connecting previously separate sequences. During subsequent fMRI, participants predicted multiple steps into the future in both the newly connected sequence and control sequences that remained separate. The hippocampus integrated representations of the connected sequence, such that activity patterns became more similar across trials for the connected sequence vs. the unconnected sequences. These integrated sequence representations in the hippocampus emerged soon after learning, incorporated representations of the initial sequences as well as new activity patterns not previously present in either sequence, and predicted participants ability to update their predictions in behavior.

It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse.

This study identified more than 421 million single-nucleotide variants and indels and more than 600 million copy-number and structural variants. Small variants had 756 million molecular effects annotated. Of 7.7 million polymorphic variants having an allele frequency (AF) of more than 5% in EGP, 1,348 have a predicted deleterious effect on a protein. Characterization with respect to global variation shows that EGP represents a genetic continuum encompassing the range of African, Asian, and European populations. It is best described by two Arabian, an Eurasian, and an African component, with the predominant Arabian component linked to mitochondrial haplogroups J and T that are commonly attributed to the Middle East. Various aneuploidies of sex chromosomes were detected in 93 individuals overall, and aneuploidy of chromosome 21 was identified in 41 individuals. Median inbreeding coefficient and cumulative runs of homozygosity (ROHs) lengths were increased due to extensive consanguinity, were largest in the groups with Arabian main ancestry components, and were higher than reported for Qatar. Families were identified based on genetic relatedness and classified into 264 families with unrelated parents and 247 families with third- and fourth-degree consanguineous parents. Representative consanguineous pedigrees of families in EGP were outlined. Cumulative ROHs were affected by the main ancestry component and significantly increased in offspring of consanguineous parents, with a pronounced difference between 3rd and 4th-degree relatedness. Investigation of cumulative AFs of variants causing Mendelian diseases highlighted genes related to alpha- and beta-thalassemia (HBB, HBA2) and showed a high burden of variants causing severe recessive diseases, metabolic and retinal disorders, and hearing loss. In summary, EGP represents a landmark effort in characterizing the genetic diversity of the Emirati population, leveraging the largest Middle Eastern cohort reported to date.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1758838071480

Primary sensory cortices receive topographically segregated information from first-order thalamic nuclei, which process distinct sensory modalities. In contrast, higher-order cortical regions integrate information from multiple information channels. While such hierarchical processing and integration of information is the foundation for neural computations in the mammalian cortex, the fundamental principles of thalamocortical computations in non-mammalian vertebrates remains unexplored. The zebrafish pallium, located in the dorsal telencephalon, is regarded as the homolog of the mammalian cortex. However, it remains unclear how the zebrafish pallium receives and processes sensory information, and how the architecture and function of these processes compare to the thalamocortical circuits in other vertebrates. Using anatomical tracing, electrophysiological circuit mapping, and in vivo Ca2+ imaging, we revealed a thalamocortical-like pathway in the zebrafish brain. We found that the preglomerular nucleus (PG) is the primary source of visual and mechano-vibrational information to the zebrafish pallium. We demonstrated that PG neurons and their pallial projections exhibit sensory-specific and topographically organized responses. In contrast, the sensory responses of pallial neurons display multiple layers of topographically organized hierarchies, ranging from simple sensory-specific responses to multimodal and coincidence-detecting nonlinear responses. Notably, we observed a progressive increase in the complexity of sensory computations, which is organized topographically along the posterior-anterior axis of the zebrafish pallium. Collectively, our results suggest that hierarchical sensory processing across topographically organized pallial regions is a conserved functional feature of the vertebrate pallium.","[{""name"":""JSPS KAKENHI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JP24K02008;""},{""name"":""European Horizon Marie-Curie individual postdoctoral fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101066743;""},{""name"":""NFR FRIPRO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""239973;314212;""},{""name"":""RCN Centres of Excellence scheme"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""332640;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1758838071480
