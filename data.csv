We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1719871704772

We assessed relations between brain entropy and plasma psilocin, brain serotonin 2A receptor occupancy, and a subjective drug intensity rating using linear mixed-effects models. We observed significant positive associations for Shannon entropy of path-length, instantaneous correlation distributions, and divergent associations of sample entropy at varying time-scales.

Here, we used multi-omics, molecular and functional assays in three model systems (C. elegans, human retinal cells and mouse brain) to identify the DREAM complex as a ubiquitous health repressor acting downstream of clock impairment. We show that clock dysfunction aberrantly activates DREAM leading to simultaneous de-regulation of multiple cellular processes. The affected activities including translation, stress responses and OXPHOS are basic and ubiquitous, explaining pan-cellular decline induced by impaired clock and sleep. Accordingly, inhibition of DREAM restores healthy homeostasis and alleviates de-regulation of adaptive mechanisms in clock-impaired nematodes and human cells. This restorative effect occurs amid persisting clock dysfunction, suggesting that DREAM ablation uniquely uncouples circadian clock impairments from their negative effects on health. Our study coins DREAM as a new therapeutic target for preserving organismal fitness under re-current circadian dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

This study aimed to comprehensively profile the gut microbiome among Ugandan COVID-19 patients and infer potential implications. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs, stool, clinical and demographic data were collected from COVID-19 confirmed cases at the COVID-19 isolation and treatment centers in Kampala and Entebbe, Uganda, during the first and second waves of the pandemic in Uganda (i.e., 2020 and 2021, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 presence in the swab samples was confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays. 16S rRNA metagenomic next-generation sequencing was performed on the DNA extracted from the stool samples, followed by bioinformatics analysis. Machine learning was used to determine microbes that were associated with disease severity. Results: We observed varied gut microbial composition between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Klebsiella oxytoca, Salmonella enterica and Serratia marcescens had an increased presence in COVID-19 disease states, especially severe cases. Enrichment of opportunistic pathogens, such as Enterococcus species, and depletion of beneficial microbes, like Alphaproteobacteria, was observed between mild and severe cases. Machine learning identified age and microbes such as Ruminococcaceae, Bacilli, Enterobacteriales, porphyromonadaceae, and Prevotella copri as predictive of severity. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the microbiome plays a role in the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in African patients. The shift in abundance of specific microbes can moderately predict severity of COVID-19 in this population. Their direct or indirect roles in determining severity should be investigated further for potential therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

This abnormality poses a hurdle for using pluripotent cell lines in biomedical applications and underscores the need to identify the causes of imprint instability in these cells. We show that nPSCs from inbred mouse strains exhibit pronounced strain-specific susceptibility to locus-specific deregulation of imprinting marks during reprogramming to pluripotency and upon culture with MAP kinase inhibitors, a common approach to maintain naive pluripotency. Analysis of genetically highly diverse nPSCs from the Diversity Outbred (DO) stock confirms that genetic variation is a major determinant of epigenome stability in pluripotent cells. We leverage the variable DNA hypomethylation in DO lines to identify several trans-acting quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that determine epigenome stability at either specific target loci or genome-wide. Candidate factors encoded by two multi-target QTLs on chromosomes 4 and 17 suggest specific transcriptional regulators that contribute to DNA methylation maintenance in nPSCs. We propose that genetic variants represent candidate biomarkers to identify pluripotent cell lines with desirable properties and might serve as entry points for the targeted engineering of nPSCs with stable epigenomes.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

However, the genetic mechanisms driving pathogen variation remain poorly understood. Here, we determined the extent to which Starships-giant transposons capable of mobilizing numerous fungal genes-generate genetic and phenotypic variability in the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. We analyzed 519 diverse strains, including 12 newly sequenced with long-read technology, to reveal 20 distinct Starships that generate genomic heterogeneity over timescales impacting experimental reproducibility. Starship-mobilized genes encode diverse functions, including biofilm-related virulence factors and biosynthetic gene clusters, and many are differentially expressed during infection and antifungal exposure in a strain-specific manner. These findings support a new model of fungal pathogenesis wherein Starships mediate variation in virulence-related gene content and expression. Together, our results demonstrate that Starships are a foundational mechanism generating disease-relevant genotypic and, in turn, phenotypic heterogeneity in a major human fungal pathogen.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

S17, a polyextremophile isolated from modern stromatolites in a High-Altitude Andean Lake, exhibits a remarkable multi-resistance profile against toxic arsenic concentrations, high levels of UV radiation (UV), and elevated salinity. Here, we perform a comprehensive characterization of the mechanisms underlying the UV resistance of S17 (UV-resistome/UVres) through comparative genomics within the Exiguobacterium genus. Additionally, we describe the morphological and ultrastructural changes in the strain when exposed to different levels of UV. UVres in Exiguobacterium species ranges from 112 to 132 genes, with a median of 117. While we anticipated Exiguobacterium sp. S17 to lead the non-HAAL UVres, it ranked eleventh with 113 genes. This larger UVres in Exiguobacterium spp. aligns with their known adaptation to extreme environments. Morphological and ultrastructural analyses using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) demonstrated significant changes in response to UV exposure in S17 cells. We observed the formation of nanotubes (NTs), a novel finding in Exiguobacterium spp., which increased with higher UV-B doses. These NTs, confirmed to be membranous structures through sensitivity studies and SEM/TEM imaging, suggest a role in cellular communication and environmental sensing. Genomic evidence supports the presence of essential NT biogenesis genes in S17, further elucidating its adaptive capabilities. Our study highlights the complex interplay of genetic and phenotypic adaptations enabling Exiguobacterium sp. S17 to thrive in extreme UV environments. The novel discovery of NTs under UV stress presents a new avenue for understanding bacterial survival strategies in harsh conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Its global production amounts to more than 50 million tons per year, and it constitutes an environmental pollutant of increasing concern. Although it is generally accepted that bacteria oxidize ethylene glycol to use it as growth substrate, the enzymes involved in this process are not well understood. Here we show that the soil bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans is able to assimilate ethylene glycol efficiently via NAD-dependent alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases. Using comparative proteome analysis, we identify a previously unknown gene cluster that is strongly expressed in the presence of ethylene glycol. We report the kinetic parameters and cryo-EM structures of EtgB and EtgA, the key enzymes encoded by this etg gene cluster. These novel biocatalysts pave the way for more efficient biotechnological conversion of ethylene glycol. We furthermore show that the transcriptional activator EtgR controls expression of the etg gene cluster. Directed evolution of P. denitrificans on ethylene glycol results in faster growing strains, which is enabled by increased activities of EtgB and EtgA. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that the etg gene cluster and variants thereof are widely distributed among Proteobacteria, suggesting a previously underappreciated role of NAD-dependent dehydrogenases in microbial ethylene glycol assimilation.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

The World Health Organization has recently endorsed new regimens for the treatment of MDR-TB that rely on the new and repurposed drugs bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid with or without moxifloxacin (BPaL(M)). As BPaL(M) is being rolled-out, resistance to these new drugs is already emerging, leading to acquired XDR-TB. Importantly, instances of transmitted XDR-TB have been reported. The spread of highly drug-resistant M. tuberculosis (MTB) strains pose at risk novel TB treatments that took decades to develop. In this study, we analyzed 6,926 MTB genomes from a 13-year nationwide study in Georgia, a known geographical hotspot of MDR-TB, together with more than 80,000 MTB genomes from public sources to estimate the relative contribution of transmission to the burden of XDR-TB. We show that XDR-TB is already geographically widespread, occurring in at least 27 countries across four continents. Moreover, we estimated that a quarter of the XDR-TB cases identified are likely the consequence of transmission.

However, the technology is limited by inherent biases and its inability to capture full-length transcripts. Long-read RNAseq overcomes these issues by providing reads that can span multiple exons, resolve complex repetitive regions and the capability to cover entire transcripts. Unfortunately, this technology is still prone to higher error rates. Noncoding RNA transcripts are highly specific to different cell types and tissues and remain underrepresented in current reference annotations. This problem is exacerbated by the dismissal of sequenced reads that align to genomic regions that do not contain annotated transcripts, resulting in approximately half of the expressed transcripts being overlooked in transcriptional studies.

ResultsWe have developed a pipeline, named HyDRA (Hybrid de novo RNA assembly), which combines the precision of short reads with the structural resolution of long reads, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of custom transcriptome assemblies. Deep, short- and long-read RNAseq data derived from ovarian and fallopian tube samples were used to develop, validate and assess the efficacy of HyDRA. We identified more than 50,000 high-confidence long noncoding RNAs, most of which have not been previously detected using traditional methods.

ConclusionsHyDRAs assembly performed more than 40% better than a similar assembly obtained with the top-ranked stand-alone de novo transcriptome short-read-only assembly tool and over 30% better than one obtained with the best-in-class multistep short-read-only approach. Although long-read sequencing is rapidly advancing, the vast availability of short-read RNAseq data will ensure that hybrid approaches like the one implemented in HyDRA continue to be relevant, allowing the discovery of high-confidence transcripts within specific cell types and tissues. As the practice of performing hybrid de novo transcriptome assemblies becomes commonplace, HyDRA will advance the annotation of coding and noncoding transcripts and expand our knowledge of the noncoding genome.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Human Accelerated Regions (HARs) exhibit a significant excess of human-specific sequence changes and have been implicated in human brain evolution. Multiple studies support that HARs include neurodevelopmental enhancers with novel activities in humans, but their biological functions in NSCs have not been empirically assessed at scale. Here we conducted a direct-capture Perturb-seq screen repressing 180 neurodevelopmentally active HARs in human iPSC-derived NSCs with single-cell transcriptional readout. After profiling >188,000 NSCs, we identified a set of HAR perturbations with convergent transcriptional effects on gene networks involved in NSC apicobasal polarity, a cellular process whose precise regulation is critical to the developmental emergence of basal radial glia (bRG), a progenitor population that is expanded in humans. Across multiple HAR perturbations, we found convergent dysregulation of specific apicobasal polarity and adherens junction regulators, including PARD3, ABI2, SETD2, and PCM1. We found that the repression of one candidate from the screen, HAR181, as well as its target gene CADM1, disrupted apical PARD3 localization and NSC rosette formation. Our findings reveal interconnected roles for HARs in NSC biology and cortical development and link specific HARs to processes implicated in human cortical expansion.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Memory consolidation occurs offline and often involves transfer of memories from one brain site to another. For many motor memories, consolidation is thought to involve early learning in cerebellar cortex that is subsequently transferred to the cerebellar nuclei. Here we report that in mice, engaging in locomotor activity during training in a classical conditioning task shifts the critical time window for memory consolidation, from just after training sessions, to between trials, within sessions. This temporal shift requires natural patterns of cerebellar granule cell activity during intertrial intervals and is accompanied by earlier involvement of the downstream cerebellar nucleus.

DNA repair is especially understudied in nondividing cells like neurons, which must withstand decades of DNA damage without replicating. This lack of knowledge limits the efficiency and precision of genome editing in clinically relevant cells. To address this, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neurons to examine how postmitotic human neurons repair Cas9-induced DNA damage. We discovered that neurons can take weeks to fully resolve this damage, compared to just days in isogenic iPSCs. Furthermore, Cas9-treated neurons upregulated unexpected DNA repair genes, including factors canonically associated with replication. Manipulating this response with chemical or genetic perturbations allowed us to direct neuronal repair toward desired editing outcomes. By studying DNA repair in postmitotic human cells, we uncovered unforeseen challenges and opportunities for precise therapeutic editing.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Centromere fragility can drive tumorigenesis, but protective mechanisms preventing fragility are still not fully understood. The PBAF chromatin remodelling complex is frequently misregulated in cancer, but its role in cancer is still not fully characterized. Here, we identify PBAF as a protector of centromere and pericentromere structure with profound consequences for genome stability. A conserved feature of isogenic cell lines lacking PBRM1, a subunit of PBAF, is compromised centromere and pericentromere integrity. PBAF is present at these regions, and the binding pattern changes when PBRM1 is absent. PBRM1 loss creates a dependence on the spindle assembly checkpoint, which represents a therapeutic vulnerability. Importantly, we find that even in the absence of any perturbations, PBRM1 loss leads to centromere fragility, thus identifying a new player in centromere protection.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

However, the variability different HRD assays has hampered the selection of oncology patients who may benefit from these therapies. Our study aims to assess the whole genome landscape to better define HRD in a pan-cancer cohort and to contribute to harmonization of HRD detection. Methods: We employed a whole-genome sequencing WGS HRD classifier that included genome-wide features associated with HRD to analyze 580 tumor/normal paired pan-cancer samples. The HRD results were correlated retrospectively with treatment responses and were compared with commercial HRD tests in a subset of cases. Results: HRD phenotype was identified in 62 samples across various cancers including breast (19%), pancreaticobiliary (17%), gynecological (15%), prostate (8%), upper gastrointestinal (GI) (2%), and other cancers (1%). HRD cases were not confined to BRCA1/2 mutations; 24% of HRD cases were BRCA1/2 wild-type. A diverse range of HRR pathway gene alterations involved in HRD were elucidated, including biallelic mutations in FANCF, XRCC2, and FANCC, and deleterious structural variants. Comparison with results from commercial HRD assays suggests a better performance of WGS to detect HRD, based on treatment response. Conclusion: HRD is a biomarker used to determine which cancer patients would benefit from PARPi and platinum-based chemotherapy. However, a lack of harmonization of tests to determine HRD status makes it challenging to interpret their results. Our study highlights the use of comprehensive WGS analysis to predict HRD in a pan-cancer cohort, elucidates new genomic mechanisms associated with HRD, and enables an accurate identification of this phenotype, paving the way for improved outcomes in oncology care.","NA","medrxiv",1719871704772

The precise origins of such insights are unknown. Some evidence has shown that sleep facilitates insights, while other work has not found such a relationship. One recent suggestion that could explain this mixed evidence is that different sleep stages have differential effects on insight. In addition, computational work has suggested that neural variability and regularisation play a role in increasing the likelihood of insight. To investigate the link between insight and different sleep stages as well as regularisation, we conducted a preregistered study in which N=90 participants performed a perceptual insight task before and after a 20 minute daytime. Sleep EEG data showed that N2 sleep, but not N1 sleep, increases the likelihood of insight after a nap, suggesting a specific role of deeper sleep. Exploratory analyses of EEG power spectra showed that spectral slopes could predict insight beyond sleep stages, which is broadly in line with theoretical suggestions of a link between insight and regularisation. In combination, our findings point towards a role of N2 sleep and aperiodic, but not oscillatory, neural activity for insight.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

However, genome engineering in bacteria is still a complex, multi-step process requiring a donor DNA template for homology-directed repair of DSBs. Prime editing circumvents this need as the repair template is provided within the prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA). Here, we developed make-or-break Prime Editing (mbPE) that allows for precise and effective genetic engineering in the opportunistic human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. In contrast to traditional prime editing in which a nicking Cas9 is employed, mbPE harnesses wild type Cas9 in combination with a pegRNA that destroys the seed region or protospacer adjacent motif. Since most bacteria poorly perform template-independent end joining, correctly genome-edited clones are selectively enriched during mbPE. We show that mbPE can be used to introduce point mutations, deletions and targeted insertions, including protein tags such as a split luciferase, at selection efficiencies of over 93%. mbPE enables sequential genome editing, is scalable, and can be used to generate pools of mutants in a high-throughput manner.

In this study we characterized the super enhancer (SE) landscape of human PDAC to identify novel, potentially targetable, drivers of the disease. Our analysis revealed that MICAL2 is a super enhancer-associated gene in human PDAC. MICAL2 is a flavin monooxygenase that induces actin depolymerization and indirectly promotes SRF transcription by modulating the availability of serum response factor coactivators myocardin related transcription factors (MRTF-A and MRTF-B). We found that MICAL2 is overexpressed in PDAC and correlates with poor patient prognosis. Transcriptional analysis revealed that MICAL2 upregulates KRAS and EMT signaling pathways, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis. In loss and gain of function experiments in human and mouse PDAC cells, we observed that MICAL2 promotes both ERK1/2 and AKT activation. Consistent with its role in actin depolymerization and KRAS signaling, loss of MICAL2 expression also inhibited macropinocytosis. Through in vitro phenotypic analyses, we show that MICAL2, MRTF-A and MRTF-B influence PDAC cell proliferation, migration and promote cell cycle progression. Importantly, we demonstrate that MICAL2 is essential for in vivo tumor growth and metastasis. Interestingly, we find that MRTF-B, but not MRTF-A, phenocopies MICAL2-driven phenotypes in vivo. This study highlights the multiple ways in which MICAL2 impacts PDAC biology and suggests that its inhibition may impede PDAC progression. Our results provide a foundation for future investigations into the role of MICAL2 in PDAC and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Despite their significance, the factors regulating their spatial distribution on the PM remain elusive. Inspired by observations in cardiomyocytes, where ER-PM contact sites concentrate on tubular PM invaginations known as transverse tubules (T-tubules), we hypothesize that the PM curvature plays a role in ER-PM contact formation. Through precise control of PM invaginations, we show that PM curvatures locally induce the formation of ER-PM contacts in cardiomyocytes. Intriguingly, the junctophilin family of ER-PM tethering proteins, specifically expressed in excitable cells, is the key player in this process, while the ubiquitously expressed extended synaptotagmin 2 does not show a preference for PM curvature. At the mechanistic level, we find that the low complexity region (LCR) and the MORN motifs of junctophilins can independently bind to the PM, but both the LCR and MORN motifs are required for targeting PM curvatures. By examining the junctophilin interactome, we identify a family of curvature-sensing proteins, Eps15-homology domain containing proteins (EHDs), that interact with the MORN_LCR motifs and facilitate the preferential tethering of junctophilins to curved PM. These findings highlight the pivotal role of PM curvature in the formation of ER-PM contacts in cardiomyocytes and unveil a novel mechanism for the spatial regulation of ER-PM contacts through PM curvature modulation.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

In ovarian cancers, epigenetically-driven resistance may be responsible for a large number of late-stage patient deaths. Here, we describe the first investigation into the role of G-quadruplex (G4) DNA secondary structures in mediating epigenetic regulation in drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Through genome-wide mapping of G4s in paired drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cell lines, we find that increased G4 formation is associated with significant increase in gene expression, with high enrichment in signalling pathways previously established to promote drug-resistant states. However, in contrast to previous studies, the expression-enhancing effects of G4s were not found at gene promoters, but intergenic and intronic regions, indicating that G4s promote long-range transcriptional regulation in drug-resistant cells. Furthermore, we discovered that clusters of G4s (super-G4s) are associated with particularly high levels of transcriptional enhancement that surpass the effects of super-enhancers, which act as well established regulatory sites in many cancers. Finally, we demonstrate that targeting G4s with small molecules results in significant down-regulation of pathways associated with drug-resistance, which results in resensitisation of resistant cells to chemotherapy agents. These findings indicate that G4 structures are critical for the epigenetic regulatory networks of drug-resistant cells and may represent a promising target to treat drug-tolerant ovarian cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Consequently, the benefit of NAC remains unclear for many patients due to the lack of reliable biomarkers predicting treatment response. In order to identify biomarkers and build an integrated and highly accurate model to predict NAC response, we performed a comprehensive transcriptomic and genomic profiling on tumors from 100 MIBC patients. Our results showed that the expression of the top genes associated with response, as well as the expression of growth factor genes and cell cycle regulators are highly correlated with NAC response. Most importantly, we found a novel signature related to the WNT signaling pathway that alone was highly correlated with NAC response and showed high accuracy in predicting NAC response (AUC=0.76). Additionally, mutations in the DNAH family genes (DNAH8, DNAH6 and DNAH10) and deletion in KDM6A were also highly correlated with NAC response.

We demonstrated the stretcher with Xenopus laevis organotypic explants, human umbilical endothelial cells, and mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes to highlight the stretcher's adaptability. These demonstrations underscore the potential of this stretcher to deepen our understanding of the mechanical cues governing tissue dynamics and morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

To overcome this challenge, we combine 1000-fold volumetric expansion with multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to create bacterial-MERFISH. This method enables high-throughput, spatially resolved profiling of thousands of operons within individual bacteria. Using bacterial-MERFISH, we dissect the response of E. coli to carbon starvation, systematically map subcellular RNA organization, and chart the adaptation of a gut commensal B. thetaiotaomicron to micron-scale niches in the mammalian colon. We envision bacterial-MERFISH will be broadly applicable to the study of bacterial single-cell heterogeneity in diverse, spatially structured, and native environments.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Here, we characterize the impact of the linkage disequilibria, which stabilizing selection generates on a rapid timescale, on the subsequent allele-frequency dynamics at individual loci, which proceed on a slower timescale. We obtain expressions for the expected per-generation change in minor-allele frequency at individual loci, as functions of the effect sizes at these loci, the strength of selection on the trait, its variance and heritability, and the linkage relations among loci. Using whole-genome simulations, we show that our expressions predict allele-frequency dynamics under stabilizing selection more accurately than the expressions that have previously been used for this purpose. Our results have implications for understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Modern-day pyrenoids are complex structures, which makes it impossible to study the function of EPYC1, especially whether EPYC1 alone confers carbon concentration, and how EPYC1 could have initiated the evolution of pyrenoids.

Using the hybrid electrophysiological and optical approach voltage-clamp fluorometry, we show that G{beta}{gamma} acts by selectively inhibiting a subset of the four different CaV2.2 voltage-sensor domains (VSDs I-IV). During regular ""willing"" gating, VSDs I and IV activation resemble pore opening, VSD III activation is hyperpolarized, and VSD II appears unresponsive to depolarization.

One strategy to negotiate this tradeoff is to perform local searches around the food but repeatedly return to feed. We studied this behavior in flies and used genetic tools to uncover the underlying mechanisms. Over time, flies gradually expand their search, shifting from primarily exploiting food sources to exploring the environment, a change that is likely driven by increases in satiety. We found that flies search patterns preserve these dynamics even as the overall scale of the search is modulated by starvation-induced changes in metabolic state. In contrast, search induced by optogenetic activation of sugar sensing neurons does not show these dynamics. We asked what navigational strategies underlie local search. Using a generative model, we found that a change in locomotor pattern after food consumption could account for repeated returns to the food, but failed to capture relatively direct, long return trajectories. Alternative strategies, such as path integration or sensory taxis could allow flies to return from larger distances. We tested this by individually silencing the flys head direction system, olfaction and hygrosensation, and found that the only substantial effect was from perturbing hygrosensation, which reduced the number of long exploratory trips. Our study illustrates that local search is composed of multiple behavioral features that evolve over time based on both internal and external factors, providing a path towards uncovering the underlying neural mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Here, we characterized the organization of N. gonorrhoeae division using a combination of fluorescent probes, genetics, and time-lapse microscopy. We found that the planes of successive cell divisions are orthogonal and temporally overlapping, thereby maintaining diplococcal morphology. Division takes place perpendicular to a subtle long-axis in each coccus. In keeping with the ParABS and the MinCDE systems reading the long-axis of rod-shaped bacteria, in the coccoid N. gonorrhoeae, ParB segregates along this subtle long-axis and cells lacking minCDE have severe morphological consequences, including an inability to perform orthogonal division and aberrant assembly of the division plane at the cell poles. Taken together, this stresses the central role of even slight dimensional asymmetry as a general organizational principle in bacterial cell division.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Unlike animal enhancers that are position-independent, plant regulatory elements depend on their position, as altering their location relative to the TSS significantly affects transcription. We highlight the importance of the region downstream of the TSS in regulating transcription by identifying a DNA motif that is conserved across vascular plants and is sufficient to enhance gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. The identification of a large number of position-dependent enhancers points to fundamental differences in gene regulation between plants and animals.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

We have developed an optimized bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing method, BaSSSh-seq, to study Staphylococcus aureus diversity during biofilm growth and transcriptional adaptations following immune cell exposure. We validated the ability of BaSSSh-seq to capture extensive transcriptional heterogeneity during biofilm compared to planktonic growth. Application of new computational tools revealed transcriptional regulatory networks across the heterogeneous biofilm subpopulations and identification of gene sets that were associated with a trajectory from planktonic to biofilm growth.

Classic ecological theory holds that these systems develop following a sequenced orderly process that generally proceeds from fast-growing to slow-growing taxa and depends on life-history trade-offs. However, it is also possible that this developmental order is simply the path with the least environmental resistance for survival of the component species and hence favored by probability alone. Here, we use theory and data to show that the order from fast-to slow-growing taxa is the most likely developmental path for diverse systems when local taxon interactions self-organize to minimize environmental resistance. First, we demonstrate theoretically that a sequenced development is more likely than a simultaneous one, at least until the number of iterations becomes so large as to be ecologically implausible. We then show that greater diversity of taxa and life histories improves the likelihood of a sequenced order from fast-to slow-growing taxa. Using data from bacterial and metazoan systems, we present empirical evidence that the developmental order of ecological systems moves along the paths of least environmental resistance. The capacity of simple principles to explain the trend in the developmental order of diverse ecological systems paves the way to an enhanced understanding of the collective features characterizing the diversity of life.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

The diversity of egoviruses already far exceeds that of all known poxviruses and animal-associated asfuviruses. Phylogenetic analyses and patterns of virus distribution across vertebrates suggest that egoviruses can be either specialists or generalists associated with a single or multiple vertebrate species, respectively. Notably, one egovirus clade is human-specific, evolutionarily constrained, and spread across continents, demonstrating a long-term association between Egovirales and the human population on the global scale.

This inferential task is notoriously challenging. The social networks of interest are generally not observed, but must be approximated from behavioural samples. Moreover, these data are highly dependent: the observed network edges correlate with one another, due to biological and sampling processes. Failing to account for the resulting uncertainty and biases can lead to dysfunctional statistical procedures, and thus to incorrect results. Here, we argue that these problems should be understood-- and addressed--as problems of causal inference. For this purpose, we introduce a Bayesian causal modelling framework that explicitly defines the links between the target interaction network, its causes, and the data. We illustrate the mechanics of our framework with simulation studies and an empirical example. First, we encode causal effects of individual-, dyad-, and group-level features on social interactions using Directed Acyclic Graphs and Structural Causal Models. These quantities are the objects of inquiry, our estimands. Second, we develop estimators for these effects-- namely, Bayesian multilevel extensions of the Social Relations Model. Third, we recover the structural parameters of interest, map statistical estimates to the underlying causal structures, and compute causal estimates from the joint posterior distribution. Throughout the manuscript, we develop models layer by layer, thereby illustrating an iterative workflow for causal inference in social networks. We conclude by summarising this workflow as a set of seven steps, and provide practical recommendations.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Objectives: To investigate whether Long COVID and its physio-affective phenome are linked to autoimmunity to the tight junction proteins zonulin and occludin (ZOOC) and immune reactivity to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and whether the latter are associated with signs of human herpes virus-6 reactivation (HHV-6) autoimmunity directed against oligodendrocyte and neuronal proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP). Methods: IgA/IgM/IgG responses to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) HHV-6, ZOOC and neuronal proteins C-reactive protein (CRP) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) were measured in 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls. The physio-affective phenome was conceptualized as a factor extracted from physical and affective symptom domains. Results: Neural network identified IgA directed to LPS (IgA-LPS) IgG-ZOOC IgG-LPS and IgA-ZOOC as the most important variables associated with Long COVID diagnosis with an area under the ROC curve of 0.755. Partial Least Squares analysis showed that 40.9% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome was explained by CRP, IgA-MPB and IgG-MBP. A large part of the variances in both autoimmune responses to MBP (36.3-39.7%) was explained by autoimmunity (IgA and IgG) directed to ZOOC. The latter was strongly associated with indicants of HHV-6 reactivation which in turn was associated with increased IgM-SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: Autoimmunity against components of the tight junctions and increased bacterial translocation may be involved in the pathophysiology of Long COVIDs physio-affective phenome.","NA","medrxiv",1719871704772

We recently identified 51 male- and female-specific compounds - many of which function as sex pheromones - in 99 drosophilid species1. Here, we report that despite many of these compounds being shared between species, their quantities differ significantly. For example, although 34 drosophilid species share the male-specific compound cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), which plays a critical role in regulating various social and sexual behaviors, the amount of cVA can differ by up to 600-fold between different species. Additionally, we found 7-tricosene, the cuticular hydrocarbon pheromone, present in 35 Drosophila species. Our findings indicate that 7-tricosene is equally present in both sexes of 14 species, more abundant in males of 14 species, and more abundant in females of 7 species. We provide raw data on the concentration of potential pheromone components in the 99 drosophilids, which can provide important insights for further research on the behavior and evolution of these species. Quantitative variations highlight species-specific patterns, suggesting an additional mechanism for reproductive isolation built on specific combinations of compounds at set concentrations.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Existing methods do not correct batch effects satisfactorily, especially with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. To address this challenge, we introduce fast-scBatch, a novel and efficient two-phase algorithm for batch-effect correction in scRNA-seq data, designed to handle non-linear and complex batch effects. Specifically, this method utilizes the inherent correlation structure of the data for batch effect correction and employs a neural network to expedite the process. It outputs a corrected expression matrix, facilitating downstream analyses. We validated fast-scBatch through simulation studies and on two scRNA-seq datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in batch-effect correction compared to current methods, as evidenced by visualization using UMAP plots, and metrics including Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI).

Notably, these include gastrointestinal dysfunction and alterations in the commensal microbiota in both patients and mouse models, which have been suggested to contribute to secondary infection and poor outcome following stroke. Strikingly changes in commensal microbial community composition occur rapidly in both humans and animal models following stroke and correlate with disease severity. Despite these observations the underpinning mechanisms that drive alterations in the microbiota post-stroke remain poorly understood. The gastrointestinal tract is home to a complex network of tissue-resident immune cells that act constitutively to maintain microbial community and prevent bacterial-driven inflammation. Here we demonstrate that mice subjected to ischaemic stroke exhibit alterations in the intestinal immune system, most notably in antibody secreting B cells and the production of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) - a major effector response against commensal microbes. Mice lacking secretory IgA binding to commensal bacteria exhibit a partial reversion of stroke-induced changes in microbiota composition. Notably we also report increases in B cell and IgA-producing plasma cell frequencies in the brain and meninges following stroke. Together these findings demonstrate stroke is associated with perturbations in antibody producing immune responses both in mucosal tissues and the CNS following stroke, which in part explain stroke-induced changes in the intestinal microbiota. A mechanistic understanding of the immunological basis of stroke-associated pathologies in the periphery may open new avenues to manage the secondary complications and long-term prognosis of patients suffering from neurological disease.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

The main building block of the long, external flagellar filament, flagellin, is secreted through the flagellar type-III secretion system at a remarkable rate of several tens of thousands amino acids per second, significantly surpassing the rates achieved by other pore-based protein secretion systems. The evolutionary implications and potential benefits of this high secretion rate for flagellum assembly and function, however, have remained elusive. In this study, we provide both experimental and theoretical evidence that the flagellar secretion rate has been evolutionarily optimized to facilitate rapid and efficient construction of a functional flagellum. By synchronizing flagellar assembly, we found that a minimal filament length of 2.5 {micro}m was required for swimming motility. Biophysical modelling revealed that this minimal filament length threshold resulted from an elasto-hydrodynamic instability of the whole swimming cell, dependent on the filament length. Furthermore, we developed a stepwise filament labeling method combined with electron microscopy visualization to validate predicted flagellin secretion rates of up to 10,000 amino acids per second. A biophysical model of flagellum growth demonstrates that the observed high flagellin secretion rate efficiently balances filament elongation and energy consumption, thereby enabling motility in the shortest amount of time. Taken together, these insights underscore the evolutionary pressures that have shaped the development and optimization of the flagellum and type-III secretion system, illuminating the intricate interplay between functionality and efficiency in assembly of large macromolecular structures.

Significance statementOur study demonstrates how protein secretion of the bacterial flagellum is finely tuned to optimize filament assembly rate and flagellum function while minimizing energy consumption. By measuring flagellar filament lengths and bacterial swimming after initiation of flag-ellum assembly, we were able to establish the minimal filament length necessary for swimming motility, which we rationalized physically as resulting from an elasto-hydrodynamic instability of the swimming cell. Our bio-physical model of flagellum growth further illustrates how the physiological flagellin secretion rate is optimized to maximize filament elongation while conserving energy. These findings illuminate the evolutionary pressures that have shaped the function of the bacterial flagellum and type-III secretion system, driving improvements in bacterial motility and overall fitness.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Previous studies indicate that this is likely due to some form of indirect assortative mating but there is not a consistent understanding of this process. Understanding indirect assortment is crucial for correctly adjusting for assortative mating, and for understanding intergenerational transmission. We attribute previous inconsistencies to idiosyncratic models and inconsistent use of relevant terms. In this paper, we develop a new framework for understanding indirect assortative mating and provide updated definitions of key terms. We then develop a model (the iAM-ACE-model) that can use partners of twins and siblings to distinguish the degree of assortment on genetic, social, and individual characteristics. We also expand this model to include children of twins and siblings (the iAM-COTS model), allowing us to explain parent-offspring similarity while accounting for indirect assortative mating and gene-environment correlations. We apply the models on educational attainment using 1,529,144 individuals in 209,792 extended families from Norwegian registry data and the Norwegian Twin Registry. The analysis suggests that partners correlate .67 (95% CIs: .66, .70) on a latent sorting factor associated with educational attainment, which we estimate to be about 30% (26%, 35%) heritable, 42% (37%, 47%) sibling-shared environment, 8% (4%, 13%) twin-shared environment, 17% (16%, 19%) gene-environment correlations, and 3% (2%, 5%) non-shared environment. The implied genotypic correlation between partners (r = .33) is comparable to earlier studies, and higher than expected under direct assortment. Most of the parent-offspring correlation (r = .33) was attributable to passive genetic transmission (62%), with the rest attributable to passive environmental transmission (23%) and direct phenotypic transmission (15%). Environmental transmission was estimated lower in alternative models that assumed direct assortment, but these did not fit the data well.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Decades of electrophysiological studies provide compelling evidence that persistent neural activity in prefrontal cortex is a key mechanism for working memory 2. Surprisingly, sophisticated human neuroimaging studies have convincingly demonstrated that the contents of working memory can be decoded from primary visual cortex (V1) 3,4. The necessity of this mnemonic information remains unknown and contentious. Here, we provide causal evidence that transcranial magnetic stimulation to human V1 disrupted the fidelity of visual working memory. Magnetic stimulation during the retention interval of a visuospatial working memory task caused a systematic increase in memory errors. Errors increased only for targets that were remembered in the portion of the visual field disrupted by stimulation, and were invariant to when in the delay stimulation was applied. Moreover, concurrently measured electroencephalography confirmed that stimulation disrupted not only memory behavior, but a standard neurophysiological signature of working memory. These results change the question from whether V1 is necessary for working memory into what mechanisms does V1 use to support memory. Moreover, they point to models in which the mechanisms supporting working memory are distributed across brain regions, including sensory areas that here we show are critical for memory storage.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Here, we report a molecular characterisation of full-length, phosphorylated MORC2, demonstrating its preference for binding open chromatin and functioning as a DNA sliding clamp. We identified a phosphate interacting motif within the CTD that dictates ATP hydrolysis rate and cooperative DNA binding. The DNA binding impacts several structural domains within the ATPase region.

Human participants estimated the source of a sequence of visual-spatial evidence samples while we measured cortical population activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Halfway through the sequence, participants were prompted to judge the more likely source category. Their processing of subsequent evidence depended on its consistency with the previously chosen category, but the encoding of evidence in cortical activity did not. Instead, the encoded evidence in parietal and primary visual cortex contributed less to the estimation report when that evidence was inconsistent with the previous choice.

Aging-associated loss of stemness is posited to suppress tumorigenesis5,6, but this hypothesis has not been tested in vivo. Here, using physiologically aged autochthonous genetically engineered mouse models and primary cells7,8, we demonstrate aging suppresses lung cancer initiation and progression by degrading stemness of the alveolar cell of origin. This phenotype is underpinned by aging-associated induction of the transcription factor NUPR1 and its downstream target lipocalin-2 in the cell of origin in mice and humans, leading to a functional iron insufficiency in the aged cells. Genetic inactivation of the NUPR1--lipocalin-2 axis or iron supplementation rescue stemness and promote tumorigenic potential of aged alveolar cells. Conversely, targeting the NUPR1-- lipocalin-2 axis is detrimental to young alveolar cells via induction of ferroptosis. We find that aging-associated DNA hypomethylation at specific enhancer sites associates with elevated NUPR1 expression, which is recapitulated in young alveolar cells by inhibition of DNA methylation. We uncover that aging drives a functional iron insufficiency, which leads to loss of stemness and tumorigenesis, but promotes resistance to ferroptosis. These findings have significant implications for the therapeutic modulation of cellular iron homeostasis in regenerative medicine and in cancer prevention. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with a model whereby most human cancers initiate in young individuals, revealing a critical window for such cancer prevention efforts.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

The majority of these mutations mainly target the spike protein, allowing the new variants to escape the immunity previously raised by vaccination and/or infection by earlier variants of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we investigated the neutralizing capacity of antibodies against emerging variants of interest circulating between May 2023 and March 2024 using sera from representative samples of the Kenyan population. From our genomics data, we identified the most prevalent Kenyan and global variants and performed pseudoviruses neutralization assays with the most recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our data show that antibodies from individuals in the general population in Kenya were less effective against the recent prevalent SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants (i.e. EG.5.1, FY.4, BA.2.86, JN.1, and JN.1.4) compared to the ancestral wildtype strain. Although there was increased neutralization following multiple doses of vaccine, antibodies from >40% of the vaccinated individuals did not neutralize the omicron variants, suggesting that individuals were susceptible to infection by these variants.","NA","medrxiv",1719871704772

Here, we use cryo-EM to explore the molecular basis of gene activation by MntR and report a structure of four MntR dimers bound to four 18-base pair sites across an 84-base pair regulatory region of the mneP promoter.

Epigenetic clocks attempt to quantify differential aging between individuals, but they typically summarize aging as a single measure, ignoring within-person heterogeneity. Our aim was to develop novel systems-based methylation clocks that, when assessed in blood, capture aging in distinct physiological systems. We combined supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to link DNA methylation, system-specific clinical chemistry and functional measures, and mortality risk. This yielded a panel of 11 system-specific scores- Heart, Lung, Kidney, Liver, Brain, Immune, Inflammatory, Blood, Musculoskeletal, Hormone, and Metabolic. Each system score predicted a wide variety of outcomes, aging phenotypes, and conditions specific to the respective system. We also combined the system scores into a composite Systems Age clock that is predictive of aging across physiological systems in an unbiased manner. Finally, we showed that the system scores clustered individuals into unique aging subtypes that had different patterns of age-related disease and decline. Overall, our biological systems based epigenetic framework captures aging in multiple physiological systems using a single blood draw and assay and may inform the development of more personalized clinical approaches for improving age-related quality of life.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Our study aims to assess the association between COVID-19 infections and subsequent kidney diseases, using influenza as a positive control and incorporating a negative control to establish clearer associations.

MethodsA large retrospective cohort study with strata matching was conducted using the MarketScan database with records from Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. We used the international classification of 10th revision (ICD-10) codes to identify individuals and build three cohorts, (1) COVID-19 group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of COVID-19; (2) Influenza but no COVID-19 (positive control) group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of Influenza; and (3) no COVID-19 / Influenza (negative control) group, with randomly assigned index dates between Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. The main outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To evaluate the association between COVID-19 and the new onset of kidney diseases relative to both control groups, we employed multivariable stratified Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.

ResultsThe study included 939,241 individuals with COVID-19, 1,878,482 individuals in the negative control group, and 199,071 individuals with influenza. After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and medication histories, COVID-19 was significantly associated with increased risks of AKI (adjusted hazards ratio, aHR: 2.74, 2.61-2.87), CKD (aHR: 1.38, 1.32-1.45), and ESRD (aHR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.67-3.88), while influenza was associated with a modestly increased risk of AKI (aHR: 1.24, 1.11-1.38) and had no impact on CKD (aHR: 1.03, 0.92-1.14), and ESRD (aHR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.55-1.29). Time-specific analyses indicated that while the HR for AKI declined from 0-180 days to 0-540 days, the HR for CKD and ESRD remained stable, with COVID-19s risk surpassing influenzas risk throughout follow-up. Exploratory analysis also found significant impacts of COVID-19 on glomerular diseases (aHR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50).

ConclusionIn this large real-world study, COVID-19 infections were associated with a 2.3-fold risk of developing AKI, a 1.4-fold risk of CKD, and a 4.7-fold risk of ESRD compared to influenza. Greater attention needs to be paid to kidney diseases in individuals after contracting COVID-19 to prevent future adverse health outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1719871704772

Here, we test this hypothesis by recording from individual neurons in the human hippocampus during a reading task. We found that cells that are selective to a particular noun are later reactivated by pronouns that refer to the cells preferred noun.

Although a few natural products have been shown to protect bacteria from phage infection, the prevalence and diversity of chemical anti-phage defense remain largely unexplored. Here, we uncover a novel family of over 2000 lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters from Actinobacteria that participate in anti-phage defense, which we named lanthiphages. Lanthiphages colocalize with other anti-phage systems in defense islands. We demonstrate that native lanthiphage expression protects the model strain Streptomyces coelicolor against diverse phages. Heterologous expression of four additional lanthiphage pathways shows that the anti-phage function is conserved across this family of biosynthetic gene clusters. Finally, we demonstrate that lanthiphage expression leads to the production of a novel compound and alters phage transcription. Our findings highlight that biosynthetic gene clusters with anti-phage functions can be successfully identified through genomic analysis. This work paves the way for the systematic mining of anti-phage natural products, which could constitute a novel reservoir of antiviral drugs.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

Most of these proteins are synthesized with N-terminal presequences which serve as mitochondrial targeting signals. Presequences consistently form amphipathic helices, but they considerably differ in respect to their primary structure and length. Here we show that presequences can be classified into seven different groups based on their specific features. Using a test set of different presequences, we observed that group A presequences endow precursor proteins with improved in vitro import characteristics. We developed IQ-Compete (for Import and de-Quenching Competition assay), a novel assay based on fluorescence de-quenching, to monitor the import efficiencies of mitochondrial precursors in vivo. With this assay, we confirmed the increased import competence of group A presequences. Using mass spectrometry, we found that the presequence of the group A protein Oxa1 specifically recruits the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) containing protein TOMM34 to the cytosolic precursor protein. TOMM34 apparently serves as a presequence-specific targeting factor which increases the import efficiency of a specific subset of mitochondrial precursor proteins. Our results suggest that presequences contain a protein-specific priority code that encrypts the targeting mechanism of individual mitochondrial precursor proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Examples are reiki, aromatherapy, and reflexology. Salaried practitioners are employed to deliver these therapies, which are provided as palliative care, although they lack evidence of effectiveness. Such practices seem to conflict with efforts to make health care evidence based.

AimTo estimate the extent of certain pseudoscientific practices in NHS Trusts, and to evaluate the rationale for such provision.

DesignRelevant documents were requested from NHS Trusts under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). Main outcome measures were: number of trusts offering pseudoscientific practices in cancer departments, time to full FOIA response, presence and content of practice governance documents, and presence and quality of evidence for practices.

Setting/ParticipantsCancer care departments in NHS hospitals in England. No patient participants were involved in the survey.

Results13.6% of eligible NHS trusts were offering pseudoscientific clinical practices. No trust provided a valid business case, or any robust evidence for the practices. The governance documents included claims about chakras, meridians, and invisible ""energy"". Ten trusts required that informed consent be obtained from patients. This could not have been obtained because information given was misleading.

They speak a Niger-Congo language called Fulfulde or Pulaar and live in scattered locations across the Sahel/Savannah Belt, from the Atlantic Ocean to Lake Chad. According to historical records, their ancestors spread from Futa Toro in the Middle Senegal Valley to Futa-Jallon in Guinea, and then eastward into the Sahel belt over the past 1500 years. However, the earlier history of this traditionally pastoral population has not been well studied. To uncover the genetic structure and ancestry of this widespread population, we gathered genome-wide genotype data from 460 individuals across 18 local Fulani populations, along with comparative data from both modern and ancient worldwide populations. This represents the most geographically wide-scaled genome-wide study of the Fulani to date. We revealed a genetic component closely associated with all local Fulani populations, suggesting a shared ancestral component possibly linked to the beginning of African pastoralism in the Green Sahara.

Unexpectedly, the successful recovery of rVSVs bearing the spike from SHC014, a SARS-like bat CoV, was associated with the acquisition of a novel substitution in the S2 fusion peptide-proximal region (FPPR). This substitution enhanced viral entry in both VSV and coronavirus contexts by increasing the availability of the spike receptor-binding domain to recognize its cellular receptor, ACE2. A second substitution in the spike N-terminal domain, uncovered through forward-genetic selection, interacted epistatically with the FPPR substitution to synergistically enhance spike:ACE2 interaction and viral entry.

The viruses are carried by large fractions of the human population and can integrate into the human genome, leading to a wide range of clinical manifestations of varied severity. Here, we present the first nine full and two partial ancient genomes of HHV-6A and 6B, dating as far back as the Italian Iron Age (ca. 1100-600 BCE). We demonstrate that large fractions of the current HHV-6 diversity were already well established in the human population by the 14th century CE. Our data suggests that HHV-6B integrated into the human genome at the latest before the 1st-6th century CE, with two integrated clades being populated by ancient DNA genomes in our phylogeny, which further supports that they originated from likely much older ancient founder events. Additionally, we show that all known inherited chromosomally integrated (ici-)HHV-6A clades were already represented in European historical populations, confirming that ici-HHV-6A no longer integrates into the human germline within populations of European ancestry and likely endogenized in early human history.

Here, we use a long-term experiment to examine how excluding herbivores, a proxy for biodiversity loss, restructures dominant plant ecological strategies within and across species.

2) We measured twelve functional traits of four dominant annual plant species in the semi-arid shrublands of Chile. We evaluated changes in trait distributions within and across species and changes in the coordination between above- and below-ground strategies in response to vertebrate herbivore exclusion.

3) Our study reveals three dominant ecological strategies characterizing trait variation within and across species, with an increase in the coordination between above- and below-ground strategies in the presence of herbivores. Our results show that herbivores induce shifts in ecological strategies, leading to conservative resource use, increased herbivore tolerance, reduced collaboration with soil microorganisms, and greater intraspecific diversity, facilitating species coexistence.

4) We empirically demonstrate how herbivores shape ecological strategies within and across species, and demonstrate that the absence of herbivores alters the diversity of adaptation strategies of plants and leads to a decoupling of resource acquisition strategies above- and below-ground. These results advance understanding of annual plant responses to herbivore loss.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

We then undertook mechanistic studies to test causality for the observed associations using the zebrafish larval Mycobacterium marinum infection model. Transcriptional profiling of human immune recall responses to tuberculin skin test (TST) challenge, a surrogate for immune responses to TB in the lung, revealed that type I interferon activity in the TST transcriptome was inversely associated with radiological disease severity. Abrogation of type I interferon signalling, achieved by CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of stat2, led to increased susceptibility of zebrafish larvae to M. marinum infection, as a result of reduced recruitment of myeloid cells required to restrict mycobacterial growth, to the site of disease. Our data support a host protective role for type I interferon responses in mycobacterial infection, with potential applications for risk-stratification of adverse outcomes and development of a host-directed therapy to mitigate against severe disease.

We designed CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs to enrich for the human pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae, by targeting multi-locus sequence type (MLST) and transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, as well as common antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and the resistance-associated integron gene intI1. We validated enrichment performance in bacterial isolates before comparing enriched and unenriched sequencing of three human faecal samples spiked with K. pneumoniae at varying abundance. Enriched sequencing generated 56x and 11.3x the number of AMR and MLST reads respectively compared to unenriched sequencing and required approximately one third of the computational storage space. Targeting the intI1 gene often led to detection of 10-20 proximal resistance genes due to the long reads produced by ONT sequencing.

Student females selected the same male genotype that a teacher female mated at higher frequently than expected by chance.

Insufficient abundance of energy carriers -as caused by the additional burden of artificial genetic circuits-shifts a cells priority to survival, also harming the functionality of the genetic circuit. Moreover, recent works have shown the importance of energy expenditure in information transmission. Despite living organisms being non-equilibrium systems, non-equilibrium models capable of accounting for energy dissipation and non-equilibrium response curves are not yet employed in genetic design automation (GDA) software. To this end, we introduce Energy Aware Technology Mapping, the automated design of genetic logic circuits with respect to energy efficiency and functionality. The basis for this is an energy aware non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) model of gene expression, capturing characteristics like energy dissipation -which we link to the entropy production rate- and transcriptional bursting, relevant to eukaryotes as well as prokaryotes. Our evaluation shows that a genetic logic circuits functional performance and energy efficiency are disjoint optimization goals. For our benchmark, energy efficiency improves by 37.2% on average when comparing to functionally optimized variants. We discover a linear increase in energy expenditure and overall protein expression with the circuit size, where Energy Aware Technology Mapping allows for designing genetic logic circuits with the energy efficiency of circuits that are one to two gates smaller. Structural variants improve this further, while results show the Pareto dominance among structures of a single Boolean function. By incorporating energy demand into the design, Energy Aware Technology Mapping enables energy efficiency by design. This extends current GDA tools and complements approaches coping with burden in vivo.

Software designed for transcript-level differential expression analyses account for the uncertainty of transcript quantification, the read-to-transcript ambiguity (RTA), in statistical analyses via resampling methods. Bootstrap sampling is a popular resampling method that is implemented in the RNA-seq quantification tools kallisto and Salmon. However, bootstrapping is computationally intensive and provides replicate counts with low resolution when the number of sequence reads originating from a gene is low. For lowly expressed genes, bootstrap sampling results in noisy replicate counts for the associated transcripts, which in turn leads to non reproducible and unrealistically high RTA overdispersion for those transcripts. Gibbs sampling is a more efficient and high resolution algorithm implemented in Salmon. Here we leverage the latest developments of edgeR 4.0 to present an improved differential transcript expression analysis pipeline with Salmons Gibbs sampling algorithm. The new bias-corrected quasi-likelihood method with adjusted deviances for small counts from edgeR, combined with the efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm from Salmon, provides faster and more accurate DTE analyses of RNA-seq data. Comprehensive simulations and test data show that the presented analysis pipeline is more powerful and efficient than previous differential transcript expression pipelines while providing correct control of the false discovery rate.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

By metagenome sequencing, we demonstrate that VMT provided a significant increase in combined Lactobacillus species in the active arm and strain-level genetic analysis confirmed Lactobacillus engraftment. Moreover, VMT was well tolerated and showed a good safety profile. Furthermore, a shift toward increased Lactobacillus was associated with a change in the expression profile of genes in the complement pathway to a more anti-inflammatory profile. Vaginal microbial and immune profile restoration using VMT may have a positive impact on a wide range of conditions in womens health.","NA","medrxiv",1719871704772

As such its measurement is crucial for understanding many aspects of animal behaviour, ecology and evolution, along with many more applications in fields ranging from optical physics, agriculture/plant sciences, human psychophysics, food science, architecture and materials sciences. The escalating threat of artificial light at night (ALAN) presents unique challenges for measuring the visual impact of light pollution, requiring measurement at low light levels across the human-visible and ultraviolet ranges, across all viewing angles, and often with high within-scene contrast.

Here I present a hyperspectral open-source imaging system (HOSI), an innovative and low-cost solution for collecting full-field hyperspectral data. The system uses a Hamamatsu C12880MA micro spectrometer to take single-point measurements, together with a motorised gimbal for spatial control. The hardware uses off-the-shelf components and 3D printed parts, costing around {pound}350 in total. The system can run directly from a computer or smartphone with a graphical user interface, making it highly portable and user-friendly.

The HOSI system can take panoramic hyperspectral images that meet the difficult requirements of ALAN research, sensitive to low light around 0.001 cd.m-2, across 320-880nm range with spectral resolution of [~]9nm (FWHM) and spatial resolution of [~]0.2 degrees. The independent exposure of each pixel also allows for an extremely wide dynamic range that can encompass typical natural and artificially illuminated scenes, with sample night-time scans achieving peak-to-peak dynamic ranges of >50,000:1.

This systems adaptability, cost-effectiveness, and open-source nature position it as a valuable tool for researchers investigating the complex relationships between light, environment, behaviour, ecology, and biodiversity, with further potential uses in many other fields.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Perhaps the most fundamental and far-reaching finding from this work is that the storage of new memories implies the partial erasure of already-stored ones. This overwriting leads to a decorrelation of sensory-driven activity patterns over time, even if the input patterns remain similar. Representational drift (RD) should therefore be an expected and inevitable consequence of ongoing memory storage. We tested this hypothesis by fitting a network model to data from long-term chronic calcium imaging experiments in mouse hippocampus. Synaptic turnover in the model inputs, consistent with the ongoing encoding of new activity patterns, accounted for the observed statistics of RD. This mechanism also provides a parsimonious explanation for the recent finding that RD in CA1 place cells has two distinct components: one which depends only on the passage of time, and another which depends on the time spent exploring a given environment. Furthermore, in the context of ongoing learning, the drift rate of any one memory depends on its repetition rate, a mechanism which can reproduce the diverse effects of experience on drift found in experiment. Our results suggest that RD should be observed wherever neuronal circuits are involved in a process of ongoing learning or memory storage.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

This sensitization depends on new gene expression that is primarily regulated via transcriptional and translational control mechanisms. The relative roles of these mechanisms in regulating gene expression in the clinically relevant chronic phase of neuropathic pain are not well understood. Here, we show that changes in gene expression in the spinal cord during the chronic phase of neuropathic pain are substantially regulated at the translational level. Downregulating spinal translation at the chronic phase alleviated pain hypersensitivity. Cell-type-specific profiling revealed that spinal inhibitory neurons exhibited greater changes in translation after peripheral nerve injury compared to excitatory neurons. Notably, increasing translation selectively in all inhibitory neurons or parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, but not excitatory neurons, promoted mechanical pain hypersensitivity. Furthermore, increasing translation in PV+ neurons decreased their intrinsic excitability and spiking activity, whereas reducing translation in spinal PV+ neurons prevented the nerve injury-induced decrease in excitability. Thus, translational control mechanisms in the spinal cord, particularly in inhibitory neurons, play a role in mediating neuropathic pain hypersensitivity.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Here, we present a mathematical model to understand how a virus infection of the petals can lead to stripes, thereby solving a 350 year old mystery. The model, which describes the viral inhibition of pigment expression (anthocyanins) and their interaction with viral reproduction, incorporates a pattern formation mechanism identified as an activator-substrate mechanism, similar to the well-known Turing instability, working together with a Wolperts positional information mechanism. The model is solved on a growing tulip petal shaped domain, whereby we introduce a new method to describe the tulip petal growth explicitly. This work contributes to the theory of pattern formation of reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains applied to the fields of virology and botany.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

We defined a set of adverse kidney outcomes for each stratum and examined the outcomes within the post-acute and chronic phases after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In each stratum, compared with the non-infected group, patients with COVID-19 had a higher risk of adverse kidney outcomes. For patients without pre-existing CKD, there were increased risks of CKD stage 2+ (HR 1.20; 95% CI: 1.13-1.28) and CKD stage 3+ (HR 1.35; 95% CI: 1.15-1.59) during the post-acute phase (28 days to 365 days) after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Lay abstractThis study examined the impact of COVID-19 on kidney health in children and adolescents under 21 years old in the United States. Using data from the RECOVER program, we analyzed the health records of 1,864,637 young individuals from 19 hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and May 2023. The study focused on three groups: those with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD), those who experienced acute kidney injury (AKI) during the initial COVID-19 infection, and those without any prior kidney issues. The results showed that children and adolescents who had COVID-19 were at a higher risk of developing serious kidney problems later on, even if they had no previous kidney conditions. This research highlights the long-term effects of COVID-19 on kidney health in young people and underscores the importance of monitoring kidney function in pediatric COVID-19 patients.","NA","medrxiv",1719871704772

Human genetic studies established a causal role for protein assembly in neurodegeneration2. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown, which is limiting progress in developing clinical tools for these diseases. Recent advances in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled the structures of the protein filaments to be determined from patient brains1. All diseases studied to date have been characterised by the self-assembly of a single intracellular protein in homomeric amyloid filaments, including that of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) Types A and B3,4. Here, we used cryo-EM to determine filament structures from the brains of individuals with FTLD-TDP Type C, one of the most common forms of sporadic FTLD-TDP. Unexpectedly, the structures revealed that a second protein, annexin A11 (ANXA11), co-assembles with TDP-43 in heteromeric amyloid filaments. The ordered filament fold is formed by TDP-43 residues G282/284-N345 and ANXA11 residues L39-L74 from their respective low-complexity domains (LCDs). Regions of TDP-43 and ANXA11 previously implicated in protein-protein interactions form an extensive hydrophobic interface at the centre of the filament fold. Immunoblots of the filaments revealed that the majority of ANXA11 exists as a [~]22 kDa N-terminal fragment (NTF) lacking the annexin core domain. Immunohistochemistry of brain sections confirmed the co-localisation of ANXA11 and TDP-43 in inclusions, redefining the histopathology of FTLD-TDP Type C. This work establishes a central role for ANXA11 in FTLD-TDP Type C. The unprecedented formation of heteromeric amyloid filaments in human brain revises our understanding of amyloid assembly and may be of significance for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

SWI/SNF subunits are among the most frequently mutated genes in cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. These mutations are often heterozygous loss-of-function alleles, indicating a dosage-sensitive role for SWI/SNF subunits in chromatin regulation. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate SWI/SNF subunit dosage to ensure proper complex assembly remain largely unexplored. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR KO screen, using epigenome editing in mouse embryonic stem cells, and identified Mlf2 and Rbm15 as regulators of SWI/SNF complex activity. First, we show that MLF2, a poorly characterized chaperone protein, regulates a subset of SWI/SNF target genes by promoting chromatin remodeling activity. Next, we find that RBM15, part of the m6A RNA methylation writer complex, controls m6A modifications on specific SWI/SNF mRNAs to regulate protein levels of these subunits. Misregulation of m6A methylation causes overexpression of core SWI/SNF subunits leading to the assembly of incomplete complexes lacking the catalytic ATPase/ARP subunits. These data indicate that targeting modulators of SWI/SNF complex assembly may offer a potent therapeutic strategy for diseases associated with impaired chromatin remodeling.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Here, we used cryo-EM to determine the translational activity of 80S monosomes across different tissues in Drosophila melanogaster. We discovered that while head and embryo 80S monosomes are highly translationally active, testis and ovary 80S monosomes are translationally inactive. RNA-Seq analysis of head monosome- and polysome-translated mRNAs, revealed that head 80S monosomes preferentially translate mRNAs with TOP motifs, short 5-UTRs, short ORFs and are enriched for uORFs. Overall, these findings highlight that regulation of translation initiation, and that protein synthesis is mostly performed by monosomes in head and embryo, whilst polysomes are the main source of protein production in testis and ovary.

Actinoporins are a family of -pore-forming proteins that bind specifically to sphingomyelin-containing lipid membranes, where they oligomerize and form transmembrane pores. The numerous contacts they form with the lipid membrane make them an exemplary object for studying the different roles that lipids play in the structure and function of membrane proteins. Through a comprehensive cryo-electron microscopic analysis of a pore formed by an actinoporin Fav from the coral Orbicella faveolata, we show that the octameric pore interacts with 112 lipids in the upper leaflet of the membrane. The structures of Fav pores formed on different lipid membranes reveal the different roles of lipids and demonstrate that the actinoporin surface is perfectly suited for binding multiple receptor sphingomyelin molecules. When cholesterol is present in the membrane, it forms nanodomains associated with the pore, leading to a tighter arrangement of lipids, which in turn increases the stability of the pores. Atomistic simulations support the structural data, show that the protein-bound lipids are not mobile, and reveal additional effects of the pore on the lipid membrane. Overall, these data reveal a complex network of protein-lipid and lipid-lipid interactions, and an underrated role of lipids in the structure and function of transmembrane protein complexes.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

These events constitute a nationwide trauma with major ramifications for public mental health. This article presents an evidence-based model for the prediction of the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to the terrorist attack and the war.

Main bodyThe creation of the model consisted of several steps. Firstly, the Israeli population was divided into six groups based on the intensity, context, and type of traumatic exposure (direct exposure to terror, close proximity to terror, soldiers in combat and support units, intense exposure to rocket attacks, moderate exposure to rocket attacks, and indirectly affected communities), and the population size of each group was assessed using official national databases. Secondly, an estimation of the expected prevalence of PTSD in each of the exposure groups was based on a review of the relevant literature. A random-effects meta-analysis of the prevalence rates was conducted separately per each exposure group. Finally, the predicted number of PTSD causalities in the population was calculated by multiplying the group size and the PTSD prevalence estimation. Based on population size and estimated PTSD prevalence within each exposure category, the model predicts that approximately 5.3% (N=519,923) of the Israeli population (95% prediction interval, 160,346-879,502), may develop PTSD as a result of the terrorist attack and the war.

ConclusionsThe predicted number of individuals with PTSD following mass trauma is expected to be considerable.

This is especially the case in challenging listening conditions, such as in real-life social environments. Autism has been associated with atypicalities in integrating audio-visual information, potentially underlying social difficulties in this population. The present study investigated multisensory integration (MSI) in speech processing among autistic (N=35) and neurotypical (N=35) adults. Participants performed a speech-in-noise task in a realistic multispeaker social scenario with audio-visual, auditory, or visual trials while their brain activity was recorded using EEG. The neurotypical group demonstrated a non-linear audio-visual interaction in alpha suppression, whereas the autistic group showed merely additive processing of these same inputs. Despite these differences in neural correlates, both groups achieved similar behavioural audio-visual facilitation outcomes. These findings suggest that although autistic and neurotypical brains might process multisensory cues differently, they achieve comparable benefits from audio-visual speech. These results contribute to the growing body of literature on MSI atypicalities in autism.","NA","medrxiv",1719871704772

These communication patterns can be comprehensively mapped using noninvasive functional imaging, resulting in functional connectivity (FC) networks. Despite its popularity, FC is a statistical construct and its operational definition is arbitrary. While most studies use zero-lag Pearsons correlations by default, there exist hundreds of pairwise interaction statistics in the broader scientific literature that can be used to estimate FC. How the organization of the FC matrix varies with the choice of pairwise statistic is a fundamental methodological question that affects all studies in this rapidly growing field. Here we comprehensively benchmark the topological and geometric organization, neurobiological associations, and cognitive-behavioral relevance of FC matrices computed using a large library of 239 pairwise interaction statistics. We comprehensively investigate how canonical features of FC networks vary with the choice of pairwise statistic, including (1) hub mapping, (2) weight-distance trade-offs, (3) structure-function coupling, (4) correspondence with other neurophysiological networks, (5) individual fingerprinting, and (6) brain-behavior prediction. We find substantial quantitative and qualitative variation across FC methods. Throughout, we observe that measures such as covariance (full correlation), precision (partial correlation) and distance display multiple desirable properties, including close correspondence with structural connectivity, the capacity to differentiate individuals and to predict individual differences in behavior. Using information flow decomposition, we find that differences among FC methods may arise from differential sensitivity to the underlying mechanisms of inter-regional communication, with some more sensitive to redundant and some to synergistic information flow. In summary, our report highlights the importance of tailoring a pairwise statistic to a specific neurophysiological mechanism and research question, providing a blueprint for future studies to optimize their choice of FC method.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

To address this question, we combined an immortalised mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) line with adjustable Piezo1 expression with soft (400 Pa) and stiff (25 kPa) viscoelastic hydrogels with independently tuneable Youngs modulus and stress relaxation. We demonstrate that Piezo1 is a mechanosensor of viscoelasticity in soft ECMs, consistent with the molecular clutch model.

Using electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we investigated how interactions between GABAARs and nAChRs influence dopaminergic axon excitability. Direct axonal recordings showed that benzodiazepine application suppresses subthreshold axonal input from cholinergic interneurons (CINs). In imaging experiments, we used the first temporal derivative of presynaptic calcium signals to distinguish between direct- and nAChR-evoked activity in dopaminergic axons. We found that GABAAR antagonism with gabazine selectively enhanced nAChR-evoked axonal signals. Acetylcholine release was unchanged in gabazine suggesting that GABAARs located on dopaminergic axons, but not CINs, mediated this enhancement. Unexpectedly, we found that a widely used GABAAR antagonist, picrotoxin, inhibits axonal nAChRs and should be used cautiously for striatal circuit analysis. Overall, we demonstrate that GABAARs on dopaminergic axons regulate integration of nicotinic input to shape presynaptic excitability.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1719871704772

T2D is a multifaceted disease, its treatment requires a holistic approach, beyond single target medications with high efficacy. There is a dire need to explore and invent new and effective therapeutic modalities for T2D.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

In conclusion, our results suggest that consumption of combined CBD and probiotics could be used as a natural, practical, affordable, and safe alternative and complementary therapeutic modality to treat T2D.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1719871704772

Applying this blueprint to Canadas extensive coastline, we find kelp forests store an estimated 1.4 Tg C in short-term biomass and produce 3.1 Tg C yr-1 with modest carbon fluxes to the deep ocean. Arctic kelps had the highest carbon stocks and production capacity, while Pacific kelps had greater carbon fluxes overall due to their higher productivity and export rates.

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

Here, we report the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle herds across several states in the U.S. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory distress, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state. These results demonstrate the transmission of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus at a non-traditional interface and to a new and highly relevant livestock species, underscoring the ability of the virus to cross species barriers.","NA","biorxiv",1719871704772

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.
