However, in practice it is difficult to discover these eQTLs, and their cumulative effects on gene expression and complex traits are yet to be fully understood. Here, we assess how properties of the genetic architecture of gene expression constrain the space of plausible gene regulatory networks. We describe a structured causal model of gene expression regulation and consider how it interacts with biologically relevant properties of the gene regulatory network to alter the genomic distribution of expression heritability. Under our model, we find that the genetic architecture of gene expression is shaped in large part by local network motifs and by hub regulators that shorten paths through the network and act as key sources of trans-acting variance. Further, simulated networks with an enrichment of motifs and hub regulators best recapitulate the distribution of cis and trans heritability of gene expression as measured in a recent twin study. Taken together, our results suggest that the architecture of gene expression is sparser and more pleiotropic across genes than would be suggested by naive models of regulatory networks, which has important implications for future studies of complex traits.","[{""name"":""Microsoft (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00d0nc645"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T15LM007033;R01HG008140;R01HG014005;U01HG012069;R01GM115889;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092486

While much of the existing research has focused on reward-based learning, the contribution of reward-independent learning processes to this imbalance remains unclear. To address this gap, the present study investigated the interaction between statistical learning (SL), a form of reward-free learning, and cognitive flexibility, a key goal-directed function, in a non-clinical population. By adopting a dimensional approach to obsessive-compulsive (OC) tendencies, this work aims to overcome the limitations of categorical diagnoses and better capture the continuous, nuanced variability of symptoms, while clarifying how specific neurocognitive processes relate to OC tendencies. A total of 402 participants from the non-clinical population completed an online study involving the Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task to assess SL and a Card Sorting Task to measure cognitive flexibility. Our findings revealed a competitive relationship between SL and cognitive flexibility. Critically, this inverse association weakened as OC tendencies increased, suggesting that even at non-clinical levels, OC tendencies may interfere with the typical interplay between automatic and goal-directed processes. Notably, SL performance remained intact, and the observed effects were not attributable to reward sensitivity, as learning occurred without external feedback. These findings emphasize the value of examining non-clinical OC tendencies and highlight the importance of investigating neurocognitive system interactions, rather than isolated functions, in advancing our understanding of OCD.","[{""name"":""French National Grant Agency"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-22-CPJ1-0042-01;ANR-24-CE37-5807;""},{""name"":""National Brain Research Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NAP2022-I-2/2022;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092486

A wealth of studies indicate that dopamine activity encodes discrepancy between actual and predicted reward, leading to the reward prediction error (RPE) hypothesis. Specifically, it has been claimed that mesolimbic dopamine activity conforms to temporal-difference reward prediction error (TD RPE), a teaching signal in machine learning algorithms. Recently, there is growing evidence suggesting that dopamine is also involved in learning during aversive situations. However, the fundamental computation of dopamine activity in aversive situations is still unknown. A plausible but untested hypothesis is that dopamine activity in aversive situations also encodes TD RPE. Here, we tested this hypothesis by using mice in virtual reality. Mice were trained to avoid electrical tail shocks by running out of a virtual shock zone. Using probe conditions with speed manipulation or teleportation, we revealed that the dopamine signal in the ventral striatum follows the temporal derivative form of a value function. Delivering a reward at the end of the track enabled us to observe the integration of aversion and reward in a derivative form. Moreover, the value functions unbiasedly estimated from the recorded signal is consistent with the initial hypothetical form, with a realistic reflection of a received shock distribution. Taken together, our results show that mesolimbic dopamine activity can operate as a unified teaching signal in natural situations with positive and negative valences.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092486

Here, we repurposed the FDA approved cancer drug, sorafenib identified by in silico screening of compounds targeting the bacterial Serine/Threonine kinase protein StkP, an essential regulator of cell division and peptidoglycan synthesis conserved across many bacterial pathogens. Sorafenib interacts with the StkP-kinase domain and exhibited broad spectrum activity against diverse pneumococcal serotypes including multi drug resistant clinical isolates. Ectopic expression of StkP in both wild type and isogenic mutant strains conferred partial resistance to sorafenib, confirming on target activity. Scanning electron microscopy revealed aberrant cell wall morphology, and differential viability staining demonstrated increased membrane permeability. Consistently, sorafenib treated bacteria showed significantly higher complement C3 deposition and consequent killing in human serum. In human lung epithelial cells, sorafenib reduced bacterial adherence and invasion without detectable host cytotoxicity. Serial passaging at sub-microbicidal concentrations indicated a low propensity for resistance development in vitro. In vivo, sorafenib administration reduced mortality and lung bacterial load in a mouse model of pneumonia. Taken together, our data identify StkP as target of sorafenib in S. pneumoniae and justify its continued preclinical development for therapeutic intervention.","[{""name"":""Department of Science and Technology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0101xrq71"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DST/INSPIRE/04/2019/002238;""},{""name"":""Department of Biotechnology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03tjsyq23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BT/RLF/Re-entry/46/2020;""},{""name"":""Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05sdqd547"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Thematic institutional intrmural funding;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092486

Functional redundancy, the capacity of different microbes to perform the same function, is considered a key mechanism underpinning the stability and resilience of the ocean microbiome. Although the extent of functional redundancy remains debated, investigating its manifestation in environmentally similar and interconnected microbial communities may provide critical insights into its role in shaping microbial community dynamics. We hypothesized that examining the long-term synchrony and rhythmicity of temperate microbial communities in such locations could provide insight into the role of functional redundancy. High functional redundancy at the community level would manifest as rhythmic and synchronous metabolic functions across sites, even in the absence of synchrony or rhythmicity at finer organizational levels, such as individual genes or taxa, thereby contributing to community resilience. Conversely, low functional redundancy would imply that synchrony and rhythmicity extend to both the contributing genes and taxa, suggesting a greater vulnerability of the community to environmental variability. To test this framework, we analyzed the long-term synchrony and rhythmicity of two marine-coastal microbiomes in the Mediterranean Sea, separated by approximately 150 km and connected by a dominant southwest current. Monthly collected metagenomes from a seven-year period were examined at the levels of metabolic functions (e.g., KEGG pathways), predicted genes (open reading frames), and taxa. We found functions, genes, and taxa exhibiting high, low, or anti-synchrony, as well as displaying rhythmic or non-rhythmic patterns. Although rhythmic behavior was observed on average across all organizational levels, consistent with the seasonal dynamics expected in temperate Mediterranean waters, average synchrony across microbiomes remained low. Focusing specifically on 45 markers of key biogeochemical functions, we revealed that several functions exhibited high synchrony and rhythmicity, in sharp contrast to the low synchrony and rhythmicity among the most abundant genes and taxa contributing to those functions. This suggests that functional redundancy and complementary dynamics at lower organizational levels, with distinct taxa contributing to key metabolic functions at different times, lead to rhythmic and synchronous dynamics at higher levels through emergent self-organization. Together, our results highlight functional redundancy and emergent self-organized dynamics as key mechanisms supporting the stability and resilience of marine microbiomes under environmental change.","[{""name"":""Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PID2019-105775RB-I00;PID2022-136281NB-I00;PID2023-146919NB-C22;""},{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GA#101059915 - BIOcean5D;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092486

Astrocytes integrate metabolic and hormonal cues and sustain cell-autonomous rhythms, implicating them as candidate links between energy state and central circadian control. Here we show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in hypothalamic astrocytes exhibits intrinsic, calcium-dependent rhythmicity that persists under constant darkness and without feeding cues. This glial rhythm sustains time-of-day phosphorylation programmes in the hypothalamus and stabilises the clock protein PER2 via phosphorylation at a conserved serine residue, thereby linking metabolic state to period control beyond the canonical transcription-translation feedback loops. In the ventromedial hypothalamus, astrocytic AMPK-PER2 signalling is required for food-anticipatory activity, identifying a glial node within the food-entrainable timing system. Disrupting astrocytic AMPK rhythmicity alters circadian behaviour and energy homeostasis and shortens lifespan in a sex-dependent manner. These findings recast AMPK as a metabolically adaptive glial timekeeper that connects calcium signalling and phosphorylation rhythms to behaviour and metabolism. They also reveal a phosphorylation-based timing layer in central metabolic circuits, with implications for circadian-metabolic misalignment in contexts such as shift work and metabolic disorders.","[{""name"":""Xunta de Galicia"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0181xnw06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ED431F 2020/009;ED431C 2023/28;ED431G/05, 2020-2023;""},{""name"":""Agencia Estatal de Investigación"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PID2019-109556RB-I00;PID2022-138436OB-I00;PID2021-128145NB-I00;PDC2022-133958-I00;""},{""name"":""La Caixa Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LCF/PR/HR19/52160022;LCF/PR/HR20/52400013;LCF/PR/HR21/52410024;""},{""name"":""Fundación AECC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PRYGN234908LOPE;""},{""name"":""Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CEECINST/00018/2021;UIDB/50026/2020;UIDP/50026/2020;LA/P/0050/2020;""},{""name"":""BIAL Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""156/24;""},{""name"":""Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PRE2020-093614;PID2022-138436OB-I00;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092486

Mathematical modeling has been effective to describe the dynamics of the multiple intertwined feedback loops making up circadian clocks, however it is often delicate to adapt the complexity of the model to the question addressed and to the data available. Traditionally, two main modeling approaches have been followed, using either comprehensive models recapitulating most molecular actors involved, or minimal qualitative models highlighting the core mechanisms. However, analyzing the behavior of large models may be difficult, and small models often lack predictive power, questioning their relevance. Through a systematic reduction of a more complex model, we obtain a simple three-gene clock model, featuring the activator Bmal1, the repressor Reverb and the inhibitor Cry, that accurately describes the corresponding temporal expression profiles for the mouse hepatic clock. We characterize this model by carrying out a sensitivity analysis for its limit cycle, as well as by computing phase response curves for the different possible inputs. Predictions from the model are compatible with a number of synchronizing mechanisms from the literature.

SIGNIFICANCELiving systems adapt to the day/night cycle thanks to cellular clocks, which track the time of the day and orchestrate physiological processes throughout the 24 hours. The dynamics of these clocks is complex, due to the interaction of intertwined feedback loops generating the biochemical oscillations and ensuring their synchronization. Mathematical modeling has proved useful to unravel this complexity, however there is usually a difficult choice to be made between comprehensive and minimal models, with opposite strengths and weaknesses. Here, we propose a simple activator-inhibitor-repressor model reproducing surprinsingly well experimental data from mouse livers, whose analysis casts light on the roles of the main actors of the mammalian circadian clock.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0007;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092486

Using high-speed imaging and hydrodynamic modeling, we reveal that this beat plane reorientation is critical for Chlamydomonas to swim orthogonally to light as well as to dynamically modulate its trajectory curvature, enabling transitions between global exploration and localized searching in spatially structured light fields. Our results establish beat plane reorientation as a novel mechanism for curvature control in microswimmer navigation.","[{""name"":""Research Grants Council of Hong Kong through the General Research Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""No. 27208421;No. 17303423;""},{""name"":""Croucher Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04741mc34"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""No. 853560 EvoMotion;""},{""name"":""Springboard Award from the Academy of Medical Sciences and Global Challenges Research Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SBF0031160;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092486

However, recent studies have uncovered their role in antigen surveillance and immune signalling initiation. To investigate how membrane protrusions initiate and contribute to signalling, from the first cell-cell contact to immunological synapse formation, we performed dynamic imaging experiments of endogenously tagged signalling proteins in T cells. To quantitatively capture the early dynamics of cell-cell interactions, we employed HER2-CAR-expressing T cells targeting HER2+breast cancer cells. By harnessing live-cell imaging and super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy we were able to capture topological membrane changes and their correlation with mesoscale protein rearrangements over time. Our findings indicate that, prior to activation, key molecular players in T cell activation, including the kinase Lck, the phosphatase CD45 and the adaptor LAT, as well as the exogenously expressed CAR, lack any enrichment in actin-rich protrusions. However, upon initial contact of the T cell with the target cell, a dynamic and fast rearrangement of the surface receptors, phosphatases, and kinases occurs within the protrusions, ensuring a rapid and effective initiation of the immune signalling cascade. The rapid clustering of the HER2-CAR occurs preferentially within protrusions rather than flat membrane regions and is accompanied by enhanced recruitment of the kinase ZAP-70 and LAT. While the localisation of the kinase Lck remained unchanged, protrusion-cell contacts trigger a pronounced exclusion of the phosphatase CD45, an effect observed both with and without the cytosolic signalling domain of the CAR. Overall, the signalling machinery rearranged more rapidly and efficiently at contacts mediated by protrusive structures compared to non-protrusive regions. Together, our data provide a quantitative framework illustrating how signalling proteins are dynamically reorganised to facilitate CAR-mediated activation within these specialised structures.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092486

We find that this variant disrupts the activity of a previously unstudied antisense long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) located between HOXA7 and HOXA9, which we have named HOTSCRAMBL. The HOTSCRAMBL variant disrupts lncRNA function and reduces human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal.

Transported nucleotide-sugars serve as donors in post-translational modification of proteins/ lipids, and donate sugar moiety to growing carbohydrate chain on nascent protein/lipid molecule, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme glycosyltransferase.
C_LIO_LIHere we reported that a mutation in the Arabidopsis thaliana gene At3g11320 coding for NST protein causes defects in male gametophyte development including collapsed, nonviable pollen. This mutation also caused impairment in the female gametophyte progression by arresting it at the functional megaspore (FM) stage.

C_LIO_LIThe results suggest that AtNST (At3g11320) gene might be responsible for maintaining and regulating transport of nucleotide-sugars from cytoplasm to the Golgi lumen for the glycosylation of essential proteins/carbohydrates/lipids etc., which are necessary for both male and female gametophyte development stages. This study shed further light on the role of such nucleotide sugar transporters in plant reproductive development processes, at least in Arabidopsis.

While generally thought to be a vertebrate-specific innovation, homologous placodes are proposed to exist in non-vertebrate chordates as well. In Ciona robusta, a solitary tunicate, the adult mouth (the oral siphon) is derived from one such ""cranial-like"" placode in the larva, which we term the oral siphon placode (OSP). At embryonic and larval stages, the OSP consists of a small rosette of cells that forms from the neuropore at the anteriormost extent of neural tube closure. While the morphogenesis of the OSP and its physical separation from other surface ectoderm structures have been described in detail, how this is regulated at the molecular level is currently unknown. Here we show the involvement of protocadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in the segregation and structural cohesiveness of the OSP. Protocadherin.e (Pcdhe.e) is expressed specifically in the OSP but not in other surface ectoderm cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of Pcdh.e in these cells results in loss of OSP structural integrity and ability to physically separate from other structures derived from the same cell lineage. Overexpression of Pcdh.e throughout the anterior surface ectoderm results in similar loss of a physically separate and distinct OSP territory. Furthermore, we show that Pcdh.e expession in the OSP depends on oral placode-specific transcription factors such as Six1/2 and Pitx. Our results suggest that OSP integrity and morphogenesis require precise regulation of a homotypic cell-cell adhesion molecule, which might reflect a conserved mechanism for placode formation in chordates.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM158421;""},{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD104825;""},{""name"":""Division of Integrative Organismal Systems"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01rvays47"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1940743;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092486

In this study, we develop a conditional knock-in mouse model expressing a mitochondrially targeted variant of the bacterial toxin DarT (mitoAtDarT), which induces mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage without affecting the nuclear genome. Ubiquitous expression of mitoAtDarT leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, evidenced by reduced membrane potential and mitochondrial mass, resulting in early embryonic lethality. Employing high-resolution microCT and molecular markers, we demonstrate that mitoAtDarT-expressing embryos fail to undergo normal gastrulation, exhibiting disrupted mesodermal patterning and a complete absence of allantois formation. Surprisingly, defects in lineage specification were evident even earlier, during preimplantation development. Blastocysts expressing mitoAtDarT exhibited reduced total cell numbers, altered trophectoderm-to-inner cell mass ratios, and a striking increase in cells co-expressing lineage markers, indicating a failure in the first cell fate decision. Our findings demonstrate that mitochondrial integrity is essential not only for energy metabolism but also for the precise coordination of cell fate specification and morphogenesis. This work suggests developmental checkpoints are sensitive to mitochondrial genome damage and establishes mitoAtDarT as a powerful tool for dissecting the contributions of mitochondria to embryonic development.","[{""name"":""Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Project Identification No. RTI 4006;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGP0038/2021-102;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092486

To understand how this robust coordination occurs, we use the loss of robustness mutant development related myb-like1 (drmy1), which exhibits variable sepal initiation and growth, causing failure of the sepals to close the flower bud. Specifically, drmy1 has overgrown outer (abaxial) sepals and undergrown inner (adaxial) sepals, leading to a large discrepancy in the sizes of different sepals within individual flower buds. Using single cell and spatial RNA-seq, we found changes in expression of key genes related to brassinosteroid (BR) signaling in drmy1, particularly in cell types important to young flower bud development such as epidermal cells, boundary cells, and meristematic cells. Confocal imaging of a BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1 (BES1) ratiometric reporter confirms that BR signaling is upregulated and more variable in young drmy1 sepals. Subsequently, we found that altering BR signaling in drmy1 by crossing with BR mutants or adding brassinolide (a potent brassinosteroid) or brassinazole (a brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor) can partially rescue this elongation defect by differentially altering the relative growth of the inner and outer sepals. Increasing BR signaling rescues by increasing the growth of the inner sepal but not the outer sepal, while decreasing BR signaling rescues by decreasing the growth of the outer sepal but not the inner sepal. These results suggest that brassinosteroids mediate the robust coordination of the growth rates between inner and outer sepals during early development, ensuring proper flower bud closure.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EF-2222434;DGE-2139899;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM134037;S10OD032251;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092486

In the primate embryo, the amnion rather than the trophectoderm is directly juxtaposed to the epiblast and may play this role. To model the interactions between the amnion and epiblast, we differentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to amnion-like cells (AMLCs) and juxtaposed them in a controlled manner with undifferentiated hPSCs, which represent the epiblast. We found that juxtaposition between these cell types is sufficient to initiate a range of cell behaviors associated with gastrulation including organized differentiation to primitive streak and downstream mesendodermal cell fates and directed cell migration out of the primitive streak region. Performing knockout experiments specifically in either the epiblast or amnion compartment revealed intricate crosstalk that is required to properly initiate gastrulation. In particularly, using knockouts of NODAL we show that Nodal signaling in both the amnion and epiblast is required for gastrulation patterning. Finally, we show that inductive ability is a transient property acquired during amnion differentiation, and that cells that differentiate from this inductive state acquire an extraembryonic mesenchyme identity.

Many PA enzymes are regulated post-transcriptionally, making traditional transcript-based methods ineffective in determining their abundance, highlighting the need for alternative approaches to study PA homeostasis. Here, we refined a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based method to simultaneously quantify activities of two key PA synthesizing enzymes - arginine decarboxylase (ADC) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) - from plant tissues using stable isotope substrates. By optimizing substrate concentrations, we increased assay sensitivity >10-fold in tomato leaf tissue. We further adapted this protocol for Nicotiana benthamiana, a model plant widely used for transient recombinant protein expression. Expression of epitope-tagged ADCs in this system revealed a direct correlation between protein abundance and enzymatic activity, demonstrating that ADC activity can infer its protein abundance in native tissues. Proof-of-principle experiments with the N. benthamiana expression system, confirm substrate specificity of tomato ADC and ODC enzymes and essential catalytic residues of tomato ADCs. Beyond enzymatic activities, our LCMS-based method also permits quantification of 11 PA network metabolite concentrations from the same LCMS sample. Visualizing this data as a heatmap pathway diagram, alongside ADC/ODC activities provides a comprehensive overview of PA metabolism in plant tissues. We also studied tomato CRISPR-Cas9-induced mutants deficient in ADC or ODC, complemented by phenotypic analysis. LC-MS analysis of an adc1/adc2 double mutant - an embryo lethal genotype in Arabidopsis - had no detectable agmatine, the product of ADCs. Additionally, despite a reduction in putrescine, no impact on the downstream PAs, spermidine and spermine, was found. The adc1/adc2 double mutant showed severe developmental abnormalities, including complete flower loss, demonstrating the indispensable role of ADCs in flower development. In summary, our optimized LC-MS approach for simultaneous quantification of ADC/ODC enzyme activity and PA-pathway metabolites, the ability to transiently express and functionally analyze recombinant ADC/ODC proteins in planta, and a collection of tomato CRISPR mutants deficient in these enzymes collectively establish a versatile new experimental toolkit to dissect PA homeostasis and PA-dependent developmental processes in plants.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LA 1338/15-1;LA 1338/ 17-1;TRR356 (project number: 690 491090170, subproject B03);442641014;""},{""name"":""National Natural Science Foundation of China"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h0zpd94"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""32372485;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092486

Following LGR5+ stem cell depletion, most of the remaining epithelial cells entered a regenerative state characterized by fetal-like expression programs. Strikingly, this regenerative response was already initiated before stem cell loss, indicative of active communication between functional stem cells and progeny during homeostasis. We identified inactivation of retinoid X receptor (RXR) as a crucial trigger to initiate the regenerative response in colonocytes, with human colon stem cells being the producer of the RXR stimulus retinoic acid.

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B “Meiosis”;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092486

Prioritizing causal variants within these loci is critical for characterizing trait biology. Statistical fine mapping identifies causal variants at trait-associated loci, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited GWAS sample sizes prevent the resolution of many associations. Functionally informed approaches augment fine mapping by estimating variant prior causal probabilities based on overlap with trait-relevant functional annotations. However, functional enrichment provides only an indirect proxy for variant functional impact. Sequence-to-function models directly estimate variant effects on molecular phenotypes from underlying sequence context. Borzoi is a long-context model that predicts sequence determinants of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation across diverse tissues and cell types. Here we present Sniff, a Borzoi-informed fine-mapping approach that integrates broad genomic functional annotations with Borzoi-predicted variant effects via PolyFun to estimate variant prior causal probabilities. Applied to 15 UK Biobank traits, Sniff identifies 9.45% additional fine-mapped variants compared to PolyFun-Baseline at posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 0.8. Sniff-prioritized variants exhibit allele-specific activity in reporter assays and are predicted to have tissue-specific activity in trait-relevant tissues. For most traits, genes nominated by Sniff receive higher scores from the orthogonal gene prioritization method PoPS compared to genes nominated using functional annotations alone. Because differentially prioritized variants are driven by Borzoi predictions, we leverage attribution techniques to characterize sequence features underlying fine mapping and generate mechanistic hypotheses for GWAS associations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092486

To address this question, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the inner kinetochore (CCAN) from the silkmoth Bombyx mori, an insect that lacks the canonical centromere-specifying histone variant CENP-A and exhibits chromosome-wide centromeric activity (holocentric). Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour l’Education et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092486

Viruses can inhibit nucleotide immune signaling by producing proteins that sequester or cleave the immune signals. Here we analyzed evolutionarily unrelated signal-sequestering viral proteins, finding that they share structural and biophysical traits in their genetic organization, ternary structures and binding pocket properties. Based on these traits we developed a structure-guided computational pipeline that can sift through large phage genome databases to unbiasedly predict phage proteins that manipulate bacterial immune signaling. Numerous previously uncharacterized proteins, grouped into three families, were verified to inhibit the bacterial Thoeris and CBASS signaling systems. Proteins of the Sequestin and Lockin families bind and sequester the TIR-produced signaling molecules 3'cADPR and His-ADPR, while proteins of the Acb5 family cleave and inactivate 3'3'-cGAMP and related molecules. X-ray crystallography and structural modeling, combined with mutational analyses, explain the structural basis for sequestration or cleavage of the immune signals. Thousands of these signal-manipulating proteins were detected in phage protein databases, with some instances present in well-studied model phages such as T2, T4 and T6.

However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function.

MethodsPlacental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD091218-04S1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092487

The components differ in their representational attributes and plasticity, with evidence for sparser, more decorrelated activity and faster plasticity in regions higher up in the hierarchy. How and why did the brain arrive at this organization? We explore the principles that allow such an organization to emerge by simulating a hierarchy of learning subsystems in artificial neural networks (ANNs) using a meta-learning approach. As ANNs optimized weights for a series of tasks, they concurrently meta-learned layer-wise plasticity and sparsity parameters. This approach enhanced the computational efficiency of ANNs, promoting hidden activation sparsity while benefitting task performance. Meta-learning also gave rise to a brain-like hierarchical organization, with higher layers displaying faster plasticity and a sparser, more pattern-separated neural code than lower layers. Early layers peaked early in their plasticity and stabilized, whereas higher layers continued to develop and maintained elevated plasticity over time, mirroring empirical developmental trajectories. Moreover, when trained on dual tasks imposing competing demands for item discrimination and categorization, ANNs with parallel pathways developed distinct representational and plasticity profiles, convergent with the distinct properties observed empirically across intra-hippocampal pathways. These results suggest that the macroscale organization and development of heterogeneous learning subsystems in the brain may emerge in part from optimizing biological variables that govern plasticity and sparsity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092487

The persistent infections thought to give rise to these variants, however, have been difficult to identify at scale. This study sought to detect and characterize persistent infection cases in California using routine epidemiologic and genomic surveillance data. We identified 69 persistent infection cases with collection dates between January 2021 and July 2023 ranging from 21 to 400 days in duration, with an average of 44 days. Significant differences were identified in age distribution, sex, hospitalizations, and deaths between persistent infection cases and all sequenced California SARS-CoV-2 cases.

Underlying health conditions were identified for the majority of cases with available medical records. The mutations found in these cases were suggestive of positive selection in the Spike receptor binding domain and convergent evolution toward immune evasion and residues observed in previous persistent infections. We describe a 400-day B.1.429 infection that demonstrates substantial intra-host evolution, and a BA.5.11 persistent infection revealing apparent competition between two intra-host viral subpopulations. By establishing a framework for detecting persistent infections, this study lays the groundwork for other public health organizations to monitor and investigate highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

Author SummaryGenomic surveillance has been used to monitor the evolution and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants throughout the pandemic. When a new variant emerges, it is often due to the accumulation of mutations during a persistent infection, i.e. in an individual who was unable to clear the virus after an infection. Using genomic and epidemiologic surveillance data, we identify 69 of these persistent infections in California and provide demographic and clinical characteristics of these infections compared to the broader population of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The identification of risk factors for persistent infections provides important insight into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, while the identification of shared mutations between these infections enhances our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolution that may result in new variants. Ultimately, our work may help public health labs to better monitor persistent infections in the future, prior to the potential emergence and spread of novel variants into the community.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092487

How does the brain use such error signals for learning? While global error signals can be useful, their ability to learn complex computation at the scale observed in the brain is lacking. In comparison, more local, neuron-specific error signals enable superior performance, but their computation and propagation remain unclear. Motivated by the breakthrough of deep learning, this has inspired the  backpropagation and the brain hypothesis, i.e. that the brain implements a form of the error backpropagation algorithm.

In this work, we introduce a biologically motivated, multi-area cortical microcircuit model, implementing error backpropagation under consideration of recent physiological evidence. We model populations of cortical pyramidal cells acting as representation and error neurons, with bio-plausible local and inter-area connectivity, guided by experimental observations of connectivity of the primate visual cortex. In our model, all information transfer is biologically motivated, inference and learning occur without phases, and network dynamics demonstrably approximate those of error backpropagation.

We show the capabilities of our model on a wide range of benchmarks, and compare to other models, such as dendritic hierarchical predictive coding. In particular, our model addresses shortcomings of other theories in terms of scalability to many cortical areas. Finally, we make concrete predictions, which differentiate it from other theories, and which can be tested in experiment.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""225643;""},{""name"":""Volkswagen Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03bsmfz84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092487

Despite these limitations, phytoplasmas, which are parasitic, insect-transmitted plant pathogens maintain a diverse arsenal of secreted effectors that manipulate both plant and insect hosts to promote infection and transmission. These effectors can suppress immunity and reprogram plant development, including witchs broom and leaf-like flowers, through ubiquitin-independent degradation of key transcription factors. However, how phytoplasmas diversify and maintain these effectors in the absence of frequent genetic exchange remains unclear. To address this, we analysed the effectoromes of 239 phytoplasma genomes and identified a diverse set of secreted proteins, which we designated as Phytoplasma-Associated Molecular Effectors (PhAMEs). We found that PhAMEs targeting evolutionarily conserved and structurally constrained surfaces of host proteins are widespread across phytoplasmas. These effectors adopt compact, efficient folds. They often function as molecular scaffolds with dual interaction surfaces capable of linking host proteins or integrating signalling pathways. Such scaffolding PhAMEs have evolved multiple times independently, providing clear evidence of convergent evolution. Despite severe genomic constrains imposed by genome reduction and limited HGT, gene duplications, interface variations, domain fusions, and repeat expansions have helped the shaping effector fold and diversity. While the overall effector repertoire of phytoplasmas appeared largely unique, some PhAME domains share similarities with proteins from other mollicutes and pathogens. Collectively, our findings shed light on how genome-reduced bacteria innovate molecular functions and offer insights into phytoplasma biology, effector evolution, and host-pathogen dynamics. They also lay the groundwork for protein engineering approaches aimed at discovering or designing novel biomolecules with biotechnological potential.","[{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) EPSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X024415/1;""},{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) BBSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BBS/E/J/000PR9797;""},{""name"":""John Innes Centre"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""John Innes Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04kg99k11"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Gatsby Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092487

Instead, we find that these cells continually endoreplicate throughout the flys life, increasing their ploidy and cell volume, while at the same time nearby cells are lost into the gut lumen in an age-dependent process. These cells play a critical role in the synthesis of peritrophic membrane components, and we show that when endocycling in these cells is experimentally increased or decreased, nuclear and cellular volume as well as peritrophic membrane synthesis is concomitantly enhanced or reduced. Further, we show that blocking endocycling in these cells leads to functional defects in the peritrophic membrane, ultimately leading to increased susceptibility to orally infectious bacteria. Altogether, we show that continual endocycling of these cells is critical for maintaining tissue size and function over the course of the adult lifespan.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R24 OD031952;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092487

Upon activation, they oligomerize into inflammasome-like resistosomes to initiate immune signaling, yet the dynamics of resistosome assembly remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the virulence effector AVRcap1b from the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans suppresses immune activation by directly engaging oligomerization intermediates of the tomato helper NLR SlNRC3. Cryo-EM structures of SlNRC3 in AVRcap1b-bound and unbound states reveal that AVRcap1b bridges multiple protomers, stabilizing a stalled intermediate and preventing formation of a functional resistosome. Leveraging AVRcap1b as a molecular tool, we also capture an additional SlNRC3 resistosome intermediate showing that assembly proceeds in a stepwise manner from dissociated monomers. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized vulnerability in NLR activation and reveal a pathogen strategy that disrupts immune complex assembly. This work advances mechanistic understanding of resistosome formation and uncovers a previously unrecognized facet of pathogen-plant coevolution.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/V002937/1;BB/Y002997/1;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/Y032187/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755382092487
