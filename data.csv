Uniquely among plasma sandwich immunoassay tests, cf-nucleosomes are nucleoproteins with a complex electrochemistry. Formaldehyde crosslinking is common in the investigation of cellular nucleoproteins by chromatin immunoprecipitation. cf-nucleosome sandwich immunoassay similarly involves isolation from plasma by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We investigated immunoassay of crosslinked plasma cf-nucleosomes in human cancer samples. Experimental Design: Plasma cf-nucleosomes were covalently crosslinked by blood collection in tubes containing a formaldehyde-releasing agent. Plasma samples were collected from asymptomatic healthy volunteers, treatment-naive cancer patients diagnosed with one of 21 different cancer types, and hospitalized patients with non-cancer conditions. Samples were assayed for a variety of nucleosome species at two independent sites and using immunoassays available from different commercial manufacturers. The assay cutoff was set at the highest cf-nucleosome level measured for any asymptomatic control subject to obtain results for cancer patients at 100% observed specificity.Results: An elevated level of crosslinked plasma cf-nucleosomes was observed in 112 of 229 cancer patients tested (49% sensitivity), including 11 of 32 Stage I solid cancers (34% Stage I sensitivity). Elevated levels also occurred in hospitalized patients with non-cancer pathologies, but no false-positive results occurred among 150 asymptomatic control subjects. Conclusions: Immunoassay of crosslinked plasma cf-nucleosomes achieved clinically meaningful sensitivity for cancer at 100% observed specificity in asymptomatic subjects, and shows promise for the identification of asymptomatic individuals at high risk of an undetected cancer.","NA","medrxiv",1742594938969

Here, we identify fundamental patterns of white matter maturation by examining developmental variation along major, long-range cortico-cortical tracts in youth ages 5-23 years using diffusion MRI from three large-scale, cross-sectional datasets (total N = 2,710). Across datasets, we delineate two replicable axes of human white matter development. First, we find a deep-to-superficial axis, in which superficial tract regions near the cortical surface exhibit greater age-related change than deep tract regions. Second, we demonstrate that the development of superficial tract regions aligns with the cortical hierarchy defined by the sensorimotor-association axis, with tract ends adjacent to sensorimotor cortices maturing earlier than those adjacent to association cortices. These results reveal developmental variation along tracts that conventional tract-average analyses have previously obscured, challenging the implicit assumption that white matter tracts mature uniformly along their length. Such developmental variation along tracts may have functional implications, including mitigating ephaptic coupling in densely packed deep tract regions and tuning neural synchrony through hierarchical development in superficial tract regions - ultimately refining neural transmission in youth.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

We report that Prototaxites taiti was the largest organism in the Rhynie ecosystem and its anatomy was fundamentally distinct from all known extant or extinct fungi. Furthermore, our molecular composition analysis indicates that cell walls of P. taiti include aliphatic, aromatic, and phenolic components most similar to fossilisation products of lignin, but no fossilisation products characteristic of chitin or chitosan, which are diagnostic of all groups of extant and extinct fungi, including those preserved in the Rhynie chert. We therefore conclude that Prototaxites was not a fungus, and instead propose it is best assigned to a now entirely extinct terrestrial lineage.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Heart rate variability (HRV) can evaluate autonomic function and monitor overexertion, potentially helping to mitigate PEM. This study aimed to use continuous multi-day HRV recordings to monitor overexertion and study autonomic function in Long COVID. Method: Heart rate and HRV were continuously measured in 127 patients with long COVID (43+/-11 years, 32% male) and 21 healthy controls (42+/-13 years, 48% male), and daily life activities tracked in a logbook. Participants underwent a (sub)maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test to determine heart rate at the first ventilatory threshold (VT1) to study HRV responses to exercise at different intensities. Results: HRV was lower in patients with long COVID compared to healthy controls during various daily activities and sleep (p<0.027). HRV remained lower for 24 hours after exercise below, at or above VT1 in patients, but not in healthy controls (p=0.010). Nighttime HRV decreased with intense exercise and longer durations in patients with long COVID (p=0.018), indicative of exercise-induced diurnal disturbances of the autonomic nervous system in long COVID. Conclusion: Heart rate variability, assessed by wearables, confirms autonomic dysfunction in patients with long COVID. The delayed recovery of the sympathovagal balance after exercise close and above to VT1 suggests that VT1 can be practically interpreted as a PEM threshold. Application: These results confirm the applicability of wearables to assess autonomic function and manage overexertion in long COVID patients.","NA","medrxiv",1742594938969

Traditional community detection algorithms assign each node to one module, but this representation cannot capture integrative, multi-functional nodes that span multiple communities. Despite the increasing availability of overlapping community detection algorithms (OCDAs) to capture such integrative nodes, there is no objective procedure for selecting the most appropriate method and its parameters for a given problem. Here we overcome this limitation by introducing a data-driven method for selecting an OCDA and its parameters from performance on a tailored ensemble of generated benchmark networks, assessing 22 unique algorithms and parameter settings. Applied to the human structural connectome, we find that the `Order Statistics Local Optimization Method' (OSLOM) best identifies ground-truth overlapping structure in the benchmark ensemble and yields a seven-network decomposition of the human cortex. These modules are bridged by fifteen overlapping regions that generally sit at the apex of the putative cortical hierarchy---suggesting integrative, higher-order function---with network participation increasing along the cortical hierarchy, a finding not supported using a non-overlapping modular decomposition. This data-driven approach to selecting OCDAs is applicable across domains, opening new avenues to detecting and quantifying informative structures in complex real-world networks.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

In this study, we generated a comprehensive and curated TE library for the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) by integrating two bioinformatic pipelines (EDTA and DeepTE). Our annotation revealed that TEs account for approximately 37% of the F. vesca genome. Analysis of TE-derived inverted repeats (IRs) and miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) demonstrated their association with 24-nt small interfering RNA (siRNA) production and differential DNA methylation patterns across tissues, suggesting a role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, particularly during fruit ripening. This MITE-mediated epigenetic regulatory mechanism was confirmed by evaluating gene expression and chromatin organization at FvH4_7g18570, which encodes the alcohol acyl transferase (FvAAT1). Three MITEs located upstream or downstream of the FvAAT1 coding sequence were shown to influence epigenetically this gene expression. Furthermore, we analyzed 210 re-sequenced accessions from the F. vesca European germplasm collection to identify and annotate TE insertion and deletion polymorphisms. A principal component analysis (PCA) based on these polymorphisms revealed subpopulation structures that reflect geographic origins. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) uncovered significant associations between specific TE polymorphisms and economically important fruit traits, including aroma-related volatile compounds and fruit size. Among them, the insertion of a hAT MITE near FvH4_2g00610 correlated with increased levels of {gamma}-decalactone, a desirable aroma compound in strawberries. These findings underscore the functional significance of TE-derived elements as key contributors to phenotypic diversity through novel regulatory functions. By integrating TE polymorphisms into population-genomic and functional studies, this work provides valuable insights into strawberry fruit development and quality traits. It also highlights the potential of harnessing TE-mediated variation in breeding initiatives and genome editing strategies to improve fruit quality.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Our analyses revealed highly conserved euchromatin states at active gene promoters and gene bodies. In contrast, we observed diverse configurations of repressive heterochromatin states associated with silenced genes and transposable elements, characterized by various combinations of hPTMs such as H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and/or different H3K79 methylations. These findings suggest that while core hPTMs are ancient and broadly conserved, their functional readout has diversified throughout eukaryotic evolution, shaping lineage-specific chromatin landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Molecular glue degraders (MGD) are monovalent small molecules that accomplish this by redirecting E3 ubiquitin ligases to target proteins, offering the potential to degrade previously unliganded and ''undruggable'' proteins in cancer, neurodegenerative, and other diseases. While attractive due to their drug-like properties, MGDs are exceptionally hard to discover and have largely been identified serendipitously. The Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase is the second most widely used effector for TPD, though current VHL-based degraders are primarily large heterobifunctional PROTACs (proteolysis-targeting chimeras) designed using target-based ligands. Here, we have instead pursued target-agnostic discovery of VHL MGDs leveraging proprietary ultra-miniaturized microfluidics devices (Picowells) to facilitate unbiased RNA-seq screening of a biased E3-focused library. This resulted in dGEM3, a novel VHL molecular glue that targets the survival of motor neuron (SMN) complex member GEMIN3 for degradation. Through a combination of cellular, biochemical, and biophysical assays, we have characterized the GEMIN3 degron within its helicase ATP-binding domain, and how the kinetics of ternary complex formation impact degradation. These findings provide insights on the re-programmability of VHL for novel targets using drug-like molecular glues.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Here, we have used a top-down data-driven approach to develop a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model compatible with the CALVADOS protein simulation model to study the effects of serine and threonine phosphorylation on the global structural properties of disordered proteins. We parameterise the model using experimental data on the effects of phosphorylation on global dimensions. By comparing with baseline models and simulations using the phosphomimetics aspartate and glutamate, we show that the effect of phosphorylation on the global dimensions of disordered proteins is mostly driven by the additional charge. We envisage that our model can be applied to study the effects of phosphorylation of disordered proteins at the proteome scale as well as to study the important roles of protein phosphorylation on phase separation.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Instead, these elements encode a short transmembrane protein, sORF2, with structural features reminiscent of viral cell-cell fusogens. Through genetics, imaging, and electron microscopy, we show that sORF2 localizes to invasive somatic protrusions, enabling the direct transfer of retrotransposon capsids into the oocyte.

Here, we find that excessive activation of replication origins depletes chromatin-bound PCNA and lagging strand components, thereby limiting additional PCNA loading at new origins when checkpoint control is disrupted. PAF15 (PCNA-associated factor 15) emerges as a dosage-sensitive regulator of PCNA, delineating the dynamic range of global genome duplication and defining distinct roles for PCNA on the leading and lagging strands. Through its high-affinity PIP motif and interaction within the DNA encircling channel of PCNA, PAF15 stabilizes PCNA exclusively on the lagging strand, optimizing and rate-limiting lagging strand processing. On the other hand, misregulation of PAF15--whether by overexpression or mislocalization to the leading strand--impairs replication fork progression and leads to cell death. These defects are mitigated by TIMELESS and CLASPIN, which restrain PAF15-PCNA interactions beyond the lagging strand. E2F4-mediated repression orchestrates PAF15 expression in normal and cancer cells, maintaining its optimal dosage for lagging strand-specific interactions with PCNA. Thus, the S-phase checkpoint functions in concert to restrict origin activation when lagging strand PAF15-PCNA assembly is exhausted, linking a previously concealed strand-specific rate limitation to overall replication dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

To improve the efficiency of this process and accelerate the development of new mAbs, we characterized and isolated antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) from the spleen of immunized mice before cell fusion. This approach resulted in a high yield of hybridoma generation by increasing the probability of successive pairing between the most suitable cell fusion partners. Specifically, we developed an optimized workflow combining Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) with antibody secretion assays, using a panel of five cell-surface markers (CD3, TACI, CD138, MHC-II, and B220) that allowed us to identify a particular ASC subset with key characteristics. Such ASCs exhibited a plasmablast phenotype with high MHC-II expression and secreted high levels of Ag-specific antibodies in immunized mice. These features were also found in hybridomas, suggesting a preferential fusion of myeloma cells with this ASCs subset. Finally, the targeted electrofusion of TACI-high and CD138-high sorted ASCs led to a 100% fusion yield compared to a non-targeted approach.

To explore alternative sources, we analyzed ancient DNA from sediment samples collected from a burial site and a settlement site in Japan, both dating to around 1000 years ago. We found that ancient human mitochondrial DNA was obtained from sediments surrounding bones, particularly close to rib bones, while human DNA was rarely detected in the settlement site sediments. Furthermore, the mitochondrial haplogroups identified in the sediments were identical to those from human bones, confirming the reliability of this approach. Our findings suggest that genetic information about past human populations can be directly obtained from archaeological sediments in open-air sites. This method also provides a non-destructive alternative to bones and teeth, expanding possibilities for ancient DNA research in regions where skeletal remains are poorly preserved.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

However, high-efficiency editing requires careful optimization for each locus to be modified which can be tedious and time-consuming. In this work, we developed a simple, fast and cheap method for the Editing and Assembly of SYnthetic operons using CRISPR/Cas9-assisted recombineering (EASY-CRISPR) in Escherichia coli. Highly efficient editing of the different constitutive elements of the operons can be achieved by using a set of optimized guide RNAs and single- or double-stranded DNA repair templates carrying relatively short homology arms. This facilitates the construction of multiple genetic tools, including mutant libraries or reporter genes. EASY-CRISPR is also highly modular, as we provide alternative and complementary versions of the operon inserted in three loci which can be edited iteratively and easily combined. As a proof of concept, we report the construction of several fusions with reporter genes confirming known post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms and the construction of saturated and unbiased mutant libraries. In summary, the EASY-CRISPR system provides a flexible genomic expression platform that can be used both for the understanding of biological processes and as a tool for bioengineering applications.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Here, we investigate fern-pathogen interactions by characterizing novel pathosystems and analysing the diversity of fern immune receptors.

A collection of fern species was inoculated with a diverse set of microbes, and disease symptoms were assessed. We further leveraged published genome mining tools to analyse the diversity of RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASES, RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEINS (RLKs/RLPs) and NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING AND LEUCINE-RICH REPEATS (NLRs), along with key immune signalling components, in ferns.

Our results reveal that ferns exhibit a range of responses to pathogens, including non-host resistance and specific resistance mechanisms. Among ten ferns tested, Pteris vittata displays the broadest spectrum of pathogen compatibility. Genome mining indicates that ferns encode a diverse repertoire of putative immune receptors, antimicrobial peptides and mediators of systemic acquired resistance. Ferns possess numerous RLKs/RLPs, resembling those required for cell-surface immunity in angiosperms. They also encode diverse NLRs, including a previously undescribed class with a disordered N-terminal domain, termed disN-NLR.

These findings provide insights into disease resistance evolution and open promising perspectives for crop protection strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Some prior evidence for neural processing of perceived musical beat (periodic pulse) may be confounded by stimulus-driven neural activity. However, one study used frequency tagging, which measures electrical brain activity at frequencies present in a stimulus, to show increased brain activity at imagery-related frequencies when listeners imagined a metrical pattern while listening to an isochronous auditory stimulus (Nozaradan et al., 2011) in a manner that controlled for stimulus factors. It is unclear though whether this represents repeatable evidence for conscious perception of beat and whether the effect is influenced by relevant music experience, such as music and dance training. This registered report details the results of 13 independent conceptual replications of Nozaradan et al. (2011), all using the same vetted protocol. Listeners performed the same imagery tasks as in Nozaradan et al. (2011), with the addition of a behavioral task on each trial to measure conscious perception. Meta-analyses examined the effect of imagery condition, revealing smaller raw effect sizes (Binary: 0.03 {micro}V, Ternary: 0.03 {micro}V) than in the original study (Binary: 0.12 {micro}V, Ternary: 0.20 {micro}V) with no moderating effects of music or dance training. The difference in estimated effects sizes (this study: n = 152, p2 =.03 - .04; 2011 study: n = 8, p2 =.62 - .76) suggests that large sample sizes may be required to reliably observe these effects, which challenges the use of frequency tagging as a method to study (neural correlates of) beat perception. Furthermore, a binary logistic regression on individual trials revealed that only neural activity at the stimulus frequency predicted performance on the imagery-related task; contrary to our hypothesis, the neural activity at the imagery-related frequency was not a significant predictor. We discuss possible explanations for discrepancies between these findings and the original study and implications of the extensions provided by this registered report.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

A lack of standardized, large-scale experimental data has hindered obtaining a more predictive understanding of these motions. After curating >100 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) relaxation datasets, we realized an observable for s-ms motion was hiding in plain sight. Millisecond motions can cause NMR signals to broaden beyond detection, leaving some residues not assigned in the chemical shift datasets of ~10,000 proteins deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB). We made the bold assumption that residues missing assignments are exchange-broadened due to s-ms motions, and trained various deep learning models to predict missing assignments as markers for such dynamics. Strikingly, these models also predict s-ms motion directly measured in NMR relaxation experiments. The best of these models, which we named Dyna-1, leverages an intermediate layer of the multimodal language model ESM-3. Notably, dynamics directly linked to biological function--including enzyme catalysis and ligand binding--are particularly well predicted by Dyna-1, which parallels our findings that residues with s-ms motions are highly conserved. We anticipate the datasets and models presented here will be transformative in unlocking the common language of dynamics and function.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

While mechanisms governing root hair fate, polarity, and tip growth are well understood, the regulation of root hair longevity remains largely unknown. Here, we show that root hair cells employ high levels of autophagy to promote their lifespan. Loss-of-function mutations in the autophagy regulators ATG2, ATG5, or ATG7 induce a premature, cell-autonomous cell death program. This cell death is activated via a gene regulatory network downstream of the NAC transcription factors ANAC046 and ANAC087. Our findings uncover an antagonistic relationship between autophagy and developmentally controlled cell death in root hair lifespan regulation, with potential implications for optimizing plant nutrient and water uptake in crop breeding.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

This unregulated response to self is fuelled by heightened metabolic programmes, which offers a promising new direction to uncover novel treatment strategies. {beta}hydrolase domain-containing protein 11 (ABHD11) is a mitochondrial hydrolase that maintains the catalytic function of ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH), and its expression in CD4+ T cells has been linked to remission status in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the importance of ABHD11 in regulating T cell metabolism and function - and thus, the downstream implication for autoimmunity - is yet to be explored. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of ABHD11 dampens cytokine production by human and mouse T cells. Mechanistically, the anti-inflammatory effects of ABHD11 inhibition are attributed to increased 24,25-epoxycholesterol (24,25-EC) biosynthesis and subsequent liver X receptor (LXR) activation, which arise from a compromised TCA cycle. The impaired cytokine profile established by ABHD11 inhibition is extended to two patient cohorts of autoimmunity. Importantly, using a murine model of accelerated type 1 diabetes (T1D), we show that targeting ABHD11 suppresses cytokine production in antigen-specific T cells and delays the onset of diabetes in vivo. Collectively, our work provides pre-clinical evidence that ABHD11 is an encouraging drug target in T cell-mediated autoimmunity.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Bacterial Sec substrates fold outside the cell and often use DsbA-catalysed disulfide bond formation between cysteines to ensure correct folding. Extracellular protein misfolding triggers a stress response that involves production of dual function HtrA-family chaperone/proteases. In Gram-negative bacteria this is called the envelope stress response and in Gram-positive bacteria the secretion stress response, but the exact signals sensed by bacteria to trigger these stress responses are not well understood. In Streptomyces bacteria the secretion stress response is mediated by the CutRS and CssRS two-component systems which control the levels of four conserved HtrA-family chaperones. Here we show that the CutS sensor kinase contains two conserved cysteine residues in its extracellular sensor domain that control CutS activity. CssS also has two conserved and invariant cysteines in its sensor domain, and we propose that CutS and CssS detect the extracellular redox state and work together to ensure secreted proteins fold correctly in the fluctuating soil environment. Further analysis of ~12,800 genomes indicated that 98.9% of strains across all bacterial classes have at least one sensor kinase with two or more extracellular cysteine residues, suggesting that extracellular redox sensing by two-component systems is widespread in bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

We found that the two measurements: (1) declined proportionally with eccentricity; (2) covaried systematically with polar angle, but with variation in cortical magnification double that of preferred spatial frequency; and (3) covaried across individuals. These data reveal a link between V1 preferred spatial frequency and cortical magnification within observers -as a function of visual field location- and between observers -when summed over visual field location.

We identified two major IBD sharing patterns between Denmark and Great Britain: early coast-to-coast connections between South Jutland and eastern England, likely driven by Viking settlements, continuous trade and people movements across the North Sea from the Middle Ages through early modern times, and later city-to-city connections such as those between London and Kobenhavn likely influenced by urbanisation and Industrial Revolution.

Although sequence-based computational methods can excel at predicting TF binding sites, they often exhibit TF-specific performance biases and rely heavily on high-quality training data. Here, we propose a structure-guided approach using AlphaFold 3 (AF3) to model TF-DNA complexes for downstream biophysical evaluation with FoldX. We benchmark this method on a SNP-SELEX dataset in which reference and alternative DNA alleles are tested for differential TF binding in vitro. For each allele pair, we generate AF3 models and assess binding differences using FoldX-derived binding energy changes and AF3's interface predicted template modelling (ipTM) score. Across three TFs, SPIB, SF-1 (steroidogenic factor 1, encoded by NR5A1) and PAX5, differences in ipTM ({triangleup}ipTM) often align with SNP-SELEX results, slightly surpassing energy-based metrics, although performance varies by TF, with notably poorer performance for PAX5. We further apply this approach to clinically relevant non-coding SNVs from published studies, accurately recapitulating 5 of 6 reported effects. These findings highlight the promise of highly interpretable structural modelling for non-coding variant interpretation, which could even encompass complex homomeric or heteromeric TF assemblies. AF3 provides robust TF-DNA complex structures that can capture subtle differences in binding induced by single-nucleotide changes. Augmented by biophysical binding evaluation, such an integrative approach can elucidate how non-coding variants affect TF binding and regulatory function.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

In the present study, we developed novel Cetacea-specific primer sets to enhance the detection efficiency of cetacean species through environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding, while minimizing the amplification of non-target vertebrates, such as fish and humans. We retrieved 71 cetacean mitochondrial genomes from a public database and designed 20 candidate primer sets, which were assessed in silico for their specificity and capacity to differentiate cetacean sequences. Four primer sets with the best in silico performance were selected for empirical validation using DNA from tissue samples and eDNA from seawater collected from aquarium pools and Hong Kong coastal waters. All four primer sets effectively amplified cetacean DNA from tissue samples. However, in the aquarium pool tests, three primer sets failed to accurately identify one or more cetacean species due to a lack of interspecific variation within the amplified region. From these, we selected one primer set targeting 268 bp insert length in mitochondrial 12S rRNA region, named Ceta, and applied it to water samples collected from Hong Kong coastal waters, where the iconic Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) was observed.

In adult stem cells, epigenetic regulation maintains their identity and controls their differentiation during homeostasis or aging, but its direct role in tumorigenesis remains unclear. This work explores the function of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) in adult Drosophila intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Disrupting core PRC1 components in ISCs induces the formation of small cell clusters devoid of intestinal markers, a novel phenotype linked to premature mortality under stress. Notably, transient PRC1 loss is sufficient for cluster formation. These clusters overproliferate and exhibit immortality in serial transplantations, leading to their designation as tumor-initiating intestinal cells (TIICs). While JAK/STAT signaling promotes TIIC formation, the TOLL/IMD immune pathways restrict their expansion independently of cell death. Altogether, our results highlight PRC1 as an epigenetic tumor suppressor in adult intestinal stem cells.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Here, we conducted comprehensive GWAS analyses based on Estonian Biobank EHR data, focusing on 4,884 ICD-10-based disease phenotypes, in a cohort of 206,159 Estonian Biobank participants. By analysing their genotype data, altogether 18,977,777 SNV and indel variants (including common, low-frequency and rare variants), our analyses revealed 2,127 unique genome-wide significant loci, including 778 putatively novel locus-phenotype associations.

Further investigation into coding variants revealed 835 significant associations, including well-established ACMG pathogenic variants and multiple putatively novel associations. Notably, a missense variant in SCN11A, which encodes the Nav1.9 sodium channel involved in pain signalling, was associated with decreased migraine risk, while an Estonian-enriched GOT1 variant considerably affected aspartate transaminase enzymatic function.

By degrading damaged or unwanted components, autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis. While the organismal phenotypes of autophagy-deficient plants under stress are well-characterized, the contribution of cell-type-specific autophagy responses to whole-plant homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, we show that root hair-forming cells (trichoblasts) of Arabidopsis thaliana exhibit higher autophagic flux than adjacent non-hair cells (atrichoblasts). This differential autophagy is genetically linked to cell fate determination during early development. Mutants disrupting trichoblast or atrichoblast identity lose the autophagy distinction between these cell types. Functional analyses reveal that elevated autophagy in trichoblasts is essential for sodium ion sequestration in vacuoles--a key mechanism for salt stress tolerance. Disrupting autophagy specifically in trichoblasts impairs sodium accumulation and reduces plant survival under salt stress. Conversely, cell-type-specific complementation restores both sodium sequestration and stress tolerance. Our findings uncover a cell-type-specific autophagy program in root hairs and demonstrate how developmental cues shape autophagy to enhance stress resilience.

We imaged pyramidal cells (PCs), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST), and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons (INs) and found that locomotion reduced firing in PCs and VIP INs while increasing activity in SST and PV cells. Prolonged optical depolarization experiments and simulations revealed that intracellular theta oscillations are predominantly driven by inhibitory inputs in PCs and VIP cells. Firing rate-laser intensity (F-I) curves revealed distinct gain modulation across cell types, with a divisive gain reduction in PC bursting during locomotion, while simple spikes are unaffected.

Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we identify ddbABCDEF, a six-gene locus encoding secreted nucleases and an outer membrane transporter, essential for exogenous DNA metabolism in B. thetaiotaomicron. Colonization of gnotobiotic mice with ddbABCDEF mutants reveals that this pathway significantly alters nucleobase pools in the gut.

They hold promise in identifying individuals at increased risk for diseases, allowing earlier screening and interventions. Genotyping arrays, commonly used for PGS computation, are affordable and computationally efficient, while whole-genome sequencing (WGS) offers a comprehensive view of genetic variation. Using the same set of individuals, we compared PGS derived from arrays and WGS across multiple traits to evaluate differences in predictive performance, portability across populations, and computational efficiency. We computed PGS for 10 traits across the spectrum of heritability and polygenicity in the three largest genetic ancestry groups in All of Us (European, African American, Admixed American), trained on the multi-ancestry meta-analyses from the Pan-UK Biobank. Using the clumping and thresholding (C+T) method, we found that WGS-based PGS outperformed array-based PRS for highly polygenic traits but showed differentially reduced accuracy for sparse traits in certain populations. This may be attributable to the lower allele frequency observed in clumped variants from WGS compared to arrays. Using the LD-informed PRS-CS method, we observed overall improved prediction performance compared to C+T, with WGS outperforming arrays across most non-cancer traits. In conclusion, while PGS computed using WGS generally provide superior predictive power with PRS-CS, the advantage over arrays is context-dependent, varying by trait, population, and the PGS method. This study provides insights into the complexities and potential advantages of using different genotype discovery approach for polygenic predictions in diverse populations.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Using high-precision single-cell tracking, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and interference reflection microscopy (IRM), we reveal how diatoms achieve diverse path curvatures by dynamically modulating the location of raphe-substrate contact and switching between one- and two-raphe contact gliding. Our results show that local curvature variations along the raphes dictate trajectory shapes, with one-raphe contact gliding producing highly curved paths, while two-raphe contact gliding results in paths of lower curvature. IRM imaging further confirms that transitions between these gliding modes underlie abrupt changes in path curvature and cell reorientation. This dynamic-raphe-switching mechanism is conserved across cell sizes and correctly predicts the increased path curvatures observed in smaller cells according to their more pronounced local raphe curvature. By quantitatively linking raphe geometry, cell-substrate attachment dynamics and motility patterns, our study provides insights into a novel motility mechanism that allows diatoms to adapt their movement to complex environments.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

However, the neural correlates of aversive learning in the RE of rodents and humans remains unclear. To address this, we recorded RE activity in humans (BOLD fMRI) and rats (fiber photometry) during Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction. In both rats and humans, we found that conditioned stimulus (CS)-evoked activity in RE reflects the associative value of the CS. In rats, we additionally found that spontaneous neural activity in RE tracks defensive freezing and shows anticipatory increases in calcium activity that precede the termination of freezing behavior. Single-unit recordings in rats confirmed that individual RE neurons index both the associative value of the CS and defensive behavior transitions. Moreover, distinct neuronal ensembles in the RE encode fear versus extinction memories. These findings suggest a conserved role of the RE across species in modulating defensive states and emotional memory processes, providing a foundation for future translational re-search on fear-related disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Using long-reads, we generated a Capuchino Seedeater (Sporophila) pangenome, including 16 individuals from seven species, to investigate how SVs contribute to species and coloration differences. Leveraging this pangenome, we mapped short-read data from 127 individuals to perform FST scans and genome-wide association studies. Species divergence primarily arises from SNPs and indels (< 50 bp) in non-coding regions of melanin-related genes, as larger SVs rarely overlap with divergence peaks. One exception was a 55 bp deletion near the OCA2 and HERC2 genes, associated with feather pheomelanin content. These findings support the hypothesis that the reshuffling of small regulatory alleles, rather than larger species-specific mutations, accelerated plumage evolution leading to prezygotic isolation in Capuchinos.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Many of the Variovorax genomes in the NCBI database were generated using only short-read data and were assembled to the permanent draft stage. We acquired a set of these isolates and used the MinION long-read sequencing device to generate additional data to allow hybrid assemblies of these genomes.

The assembly and disassembly of these structures are intricately regulated to maintain cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of these structures has been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Identifying molecules that can disassemble these toxic assemblies is a promising approach to abrogate the associated disease phenotypes augmented by these condensates but is still poorly explored. In this study, we have identified a role for low-complexity peptide rich in arginine and glycine as a disassembly factor for mutant FUS and TDP43 condensates. Deletion of RGG-motif-containing yeast protein Sbp1 reduces the disassembly of FUS and TDP43 condensates and increases toxicity. Consistent with that, the expression of Sbp1 in human cells reduced the cytoplasmic condensates of FUS and TDP43 mutants (FUS-P525L and TDP43 lacking nuclear localization signal-{Delta}NLS) and increased nuclear localization of the FUS-P525L in an RGG-motif dependent manner. In accordance with the yeast data, we observed that the viability of cells expressing FUS-P525L improved upon the expression of Sbp1. In-cell sedimentation assay revealed that purified Sbp1 could partition FUS-P525L, but not the TDP43-{Delta}NLS mutant, from enriched insoluble condensates to soluble fraction. In-vitro sedimentation assay using a two-component purified system confirmed that partitioning of FUS, but not TDP43, increased to the soluble fraction in an RGG-motif-dependent manner. Finally, incubating the cells expressing FUS-P525L and TDP43-{Delta}NLS mutant with RGG-peptide resulted in a reduction of condensate size within the cells, suggesting the sufficiency of RGG peptides. Overall, our results identify a role of RGG-peptide in disassembling mutant FUS and TDP43 condensates implicated in ALS, projecting their possible therapeutic role in treating ALS.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Advances in ultrasensitive mass spectrometry-based spatial proteomics have provided a unique opportunity to uncover early molecular events in tumorigenesis and common dysregulated pathways with high therapeutic potential. Here, we present a comprehensive proteomic analysis of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), the HGSOC precursor lesion, covering more than 10,000 proteins from ultralow input archival tissue. We discovered that STICs and concurrent invasive carcinomas were indistinguishable at the global proteome level, revealing a similar level of phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity. Using cell-type resolved tissue proteomics, we revealed strong cell-of-origin signatures preserved in STICs and invasive tumors and identified early dysregulated pathways of therapeutic relevance. These include proliferation and DNA damage repair signatures, as well as onco-metabolic changes, such as increased cholesterol biosynthesis. Finally, we uncovered substantial remodeling of the co-evolving tumor microenvironment, affecting approximately one-third of the stromal proteome, and derived a common signature associated with progressive immunosuppression and ECM restructuring. In summary, our study highlights the power of spatially resolved quantitative proteomics to dissect the molecular underpinnings of early carcinogenesis and provides a rich proteomic resource for future biomarker and drug target discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Caspase cleaves hundreds of substrates throughout the cell to regulate apoptotic processes2, including phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization3-5. However, spatio-temporal regulation of caspase activity in dying cells remains unclear. Here, we show that caspase activity peaks earlier at the plasma membrane (PM) during apoptosis by establishing a Dual Forster resonance energy transfer (Dual FRET) imaging system that combines subcellularly targeted FRET-based caspase biosensors with a cytosolic reference counterpart6,7. Genetic analysis identified caspase-7, an executioner caspase considered an inefficient backup for caspase-3, the major executioner caspase8,9, as a caspase responsible for the Early-Peaking Caspase Activity at the PM (EP-CAP). Mechanistically, EP-CAP is mediated via electrostatic interactions between PS in the inner leaflet of the PM and polybasic residues in the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of caspase-7, which are liberated by the caspase-mediated removal of polyacidic residues. Physiologically, EP-CAP facilitates the efficient cleavage of phospholipid scramblases for the rapid externalization of PS and subsequent efferocytosis. Accordingly, we propose that caspase-7, but not caspase-3, is a bona fide immunologically silent death caspase reinforcing the non-inflammatory nature of apoptosis via EP-CAP.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

However, peripheral confounds pose a significant challenge to reliably implementing this technology. While auditory confounds during TUS have been studied extensively, the somatosensory confound has been overlooked thus far. It will become increasingly vital to quantify and manage this confound as the field shifts towards higher doses, more compact stimulation devices, and more frequent stimulation through the temple where co-stimulation is more pronounced. Here, we provide a systematic characterisation of somatosensory co-stimulation during TUS. We also identify the conditions under which this confound can be mitigated most effectively by mapping the confound-parameter space. Specifically, we investigate dose-response effects, pulse shaping characteristics, and transducer-specific parameters. We demonstrate that somatosensory confounds can be mitigated by avoiding near-field intensity peaks in the scalp, spreading energy across a greater area of the scalp, ramping the pulse envelope, and delivering equivalent doses via longer, lower-intensity pulses rather than shorter, higher-intensity pulses. Additionally, higher pulse repetition frequencies and fundamental frequencies reduce somatosensory effects. Through our systematic mapping of the parameter space, we also find preliminary evidence that particle displacement (strain) may be a primary biophysical driving force behind peripheral somatosensory co-stimulation. This study provides actionable strategies to minimise somatosensory confounds, which will support the thorough experimental control required to unlock the full potential of TUS for scientific research and clinical interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Such communities play pivotal roles in countless ecosystems from environmental to human health. Perturbations of these community structures have been implicated in disease processes such as Crohns disease and cancer. Disturbances to existing ecosystems often occur over time, making it essential to have robust methods for detecting longitudinal alterations in microbial interactions as they develop. Existing methods for identifying temporal microbial community alterations have focused on abundance alterations in individual taxa, rather than relationships between the taxa, known as microbial interactions. Identifying these interactions overtime provides a fuller understanding of how the microbial ecosystem changes as a whole. To fill this gap, we have developed a pipeline that handles the complicated nature of repeated compositional count data, LIMON, Longitudinal Individual Microbial Omics Networks. This novel statistical approach addresses key challenges of modeling temporal and microbial data including overdispersion, zero inflated count data, compositionality, repeated measure design sample covariates over time, and identification of individualized or sample specific networks. This approach allows users to denoise covariate effects from their data, return networks per time point, identify interaction changes between each time point, and return individual networks and network characteristics per sample per time point. In doing so, LIMON provides a platform to identify the relationship between network interactions and sample features of interest over time. Here we show LIMON, in simulation studies, can accurately remove covariate effects, render sample specific networks, and better recover underlying network edges from covariate confounded data. Analysis of a longitudinal infant microbiome and diet dataset illustrates LIMONs novel utility to identify key microbial interactions related to diet type across time.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

In this 7T-fMRI study we compared three methods of improving sensitivity in these areas: parallel transmit, which uses multiple transmit elements, controlled independently, to homogenise the flip angle experienced by the tissue; multi-echo, which entails collection of multiple volumes at different echo times following a single radiofrequency pulse; and multiband, in which multiple slices are acquired simultaneously. We found that parallel transmit and multi-echo increased the magnitude of the BOLD signal change, but only multi-echo increased BOLD magnitude in areas prone to susceptibility artefacts. Multiband and denoising of multi-echo data with independent components analysis (ICA) both improved precision of GLM fit. Exploratory results suggested that multi-echo and ICA denoising can both benefit multivariate analyses. In conclusion, a multi-echo, multiband sequence improved fMRI quality in areas prone to susceptibility artefacts while maintaining sensitivity across the whole brain.

Language models (LMs) provide a feasible framework for learning the complex interactions among genes from a large number of publicly available, unannotated bacterial genomes. However, applications of language models have mostly been limited to developing models trained on short genomic sequences.

To explore this, we used normative modeling to index regional patterns of variability in cortical thickness (CT) across individual patients.

ObjectiveTo use normative modeling in a large dataset from the ENIGMA MDD consortium to obtain individualised CT deviations from the norm (relative to age, sex and site) and examine the relationship between these deviations and clinical characteristics.

Design, setting, and participantsA normative model adjusting for age, sex and site effects was trained on 35 CT measures from FreeSurfer parcellation of 3,181 healthy controls (HC) from 34 sites (40 scanners). Individualised z-score deviations from this norm for each CT measure were calculated for a test set of 2,119 HC and 3,645 individuals with MDD. For each individual, each CT z-score was classified as being within the normal range (95% of individuals) or within the extreme range (2.5% of individuals with the thinnest or thickest cortices).

Main outcome measuresZ-score deviations of CT measures of MDD individuals as estimated from a normative model based on HC.

ResultsZ-score distributions of CT measures were largely overlapping between MDD and HC (minimum 92%, range 92-98%), with overall thinner cortices in MDD. 34.5% of MDD individuals, and 30% of HC individuals, showed an extreme deviation in at least one region, and these deviations were widely distributed across the brain. There was high heterogeneity in the spatial location of CT deviations across individuals with MDD: a maximum of 12% of individuals with MDD showed an extreme deviation in the same location. Extreme negative CT deviations were associated with having an earlier onset of depression and more severe depressive symptoms in the MDD group, and with higher BMI across MDD and HC groups. Extreme positive deviations were associated with being remitted, of not taking antidepressants and less severe symptoms.

Conclusions and relevanceOur study illustrates a large heterogeneity in the spatial location of CT abnormalities across patients with MDD and confirms a substantial overlap of CT measures with HC. We also demonstrate that individualised extreme deviations can identify protective factors and individuals with a more severe clinical picture.

Key points

QuestionCan z-scores derived from normative modelling shed light on the heterogeneous group-level findings of cortical thickness abnormalities in major depression and what characterises individuals at the extreme ends of cortical thickness abnormalities?

FindingWe confirmed a large overlap in z-score distributions between depressed individuals and healthy controls and a heterogeneous spatial distribution of extreme z-deviations across brain regions across individual patients. Lower z-scores for cortical thickness were related to more severe clinical characteristics.

MeaningOur findings confirm the heterogeneity in individual variation in the location and extent of CT abnormalities across patients with MDD and stress the importance of individualised predictions when examining cortical thickness abnormalities.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to reduce clinician burden by automating the time-intensive task of comprehensive measurement of echocardiographic parameters. Methods: We developed and validated open-sourced deep learning semantic segmentation models for the automated measurement of 18 anatomic and Doppler measurements in echocardiography. The outputs of segmentation models were compared to sonographer measurements from two institutions to access accuracy and precision. Results: We utilized 877,983 echocardiographic measurements from 155,215 studies from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) to develop EchoNet-Measurements, an open-source deep learning model for echocardiographic annotation. The models demonstrated a good correlation when compared with sonographer measurements from held-out data from CSMC and an independent external validation dataset from Stanford Healthcare (SHC). Measurements across all nine B-mode and nine Doppler measurements had high accuracy (an overall R2 of 0.967 (0.965 - 0.970) in the held-out CSMC dataset and 0.987 (0.984 - 0.989) in the SHC dataset). When evaluated end-to-end on a temporally distinct 2,103 studies at CSMC, EchoNet-Measurements performed well an overall R2 of 0.981 (0.976 - 0.984). Performance was consistent across patient characteristics including sex and atrial fibrillation status. Conclusion: EchoNet-Measurement achieves high accuracy in automated echocardiographic measurement that is comparable to expert sonographers.

Contemporary single-cell studies simultaneously measure genome-wide transcription levels for thousands of individual cells in a single experiment. While the characterization of cell population differences has often occurred through differential expression analysis, tiny effect sizes become statistically significant when thousands of cells are available for each population, compromising biological interpretation. Moreover, these large studies have spurred the development of methods to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) directly from the data, and GRN databases are becoming more comprehensive. In this work, we propose a statistical model for gene expression measures and an inference method that leverage GRNs to deconvolve transcription factor (TF) activity from gene expression, by probabilistically assigning mRNA molecules to TFs. This shifts the paradigm from investigating gene expression differences to regulatory differences at the level of TF activity, aiding interpretation and allowing prioritization of a limited number of TFs responsible for significant contributions to the observed gene expression differences. The inferred TF activities result in intuitive prioritization of TFs in terms of the (difference in) estimated number of molecules they produce, in contrast to other widely-used methods relying on arbitrary enrichment scores. Our model allows the incorporation of prior information on the regulatory potential between each TF and target gene through prior distributions, and is able to deal with both repressing and activating interactions. We compare our approach to other TF activity estimation methods using two simulation experiments and two case studies.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

These cells are heterogeneous, and there have therefore been many attempts to define functional populations. A recent study identified two classes of ALS neuron in mouse superficial dorsal horn (SDH) based on expression of the G protein-coupled receptors Tacr1 or Gpr83. It was reported that cells expressing these receptors formed largely non-overlapping populations, and that ~60% of ALS cells in SDH expressed Tacr1. An additional finding was that while Tacr1- and Gpr83-expressing ALS cells projected to several brain nuclei, their axons did not reach the ventral posterolateral (VPL) thalamic nucleus, which is reciprocally connected to the primary somatosensory cortex. These results were surprising, because we had reported that ~90% of SDH ALS neurons in the mouse possess the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1r), which is encoded by Tacr1, and in addition the VPL is thought to receive input from lamina I ALS cells. Here we use retrograde and anterograde labelling in Tacr1CreERT2 and Gpr83CreERT2 mice to reinvestigate the expression of the receptors by ALS neurons and to reassess their projection patterns. We find that ~90% of ALS neurons in SDH express Tacr1, with 40-50% expressing Gpr83. We also show that axons of both Tacr1- and Gpr83-expressing ALS neurons reach the VPL. These results suggest that ALS neurons in the SDH that express these GPCRs show considerable overlap, and that they are likely to contribute to the sensory-discriminative dimension of pain through their projections to VPL.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

However, preparing inputs for the locally installed software is not always straightforward, and the results of local runs are not always presented in an ideally accessible fashion. Furthermore, it is not yet clear whether the latest tools perform equivalently for all types of target.

ResultsABCFold facilitates the use of AlphaFold 3, Boltz-1, and Chai-1 with a standardised input to predict atomic structures, with Boltz-1 and Chai-1 being installed on runtime (if required). MSAs can be generated internally using either the JackHMMER MSA search within AlphaFold 3, or with the MMseqs2 API. Alternatively, users can provide their own custom MSAs. This therefore allows AlphaFold 3 to be installed and run without downloading the large databases needed for JackHMMER. There are also straightforward options to use templates, including custom templates. Results from all packages are treated in a unified fashion, enabling easy comparison of results from different methods. A variety of visualisation options are available which include information on steric clashes.

Availability and implementationABCFold is coded in Python and JavaScript. All scripts and associated documentation are available from https://github.com/rigdenlab/ABCFold or https://pypi.org/project/ABCFold/1.0.0/.

Inactivating USP7 mutations have been associated with Hao-Fountain Syndrome (HAFOUS), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder. Although a range of USP7 inhibitors have been developed over the last decade, in the context of HAFOUS as well as oncogene regulation, USP7 activators may represent a more relevant approach. To address this challenge, we report the discovery and characterization of a small-molecule activator of USP7 called MS-8. We showed that MS-8 activates USP7 by engaging the allosteric C-terminal binding pocket of USP7, thus mimicking the allosteric autoactivation by the USP7 C-terminal tail. We observed that MS-8 engages and activates mutant USP7 in a cellular context, impacting downstream proteins. Taken together, our study provides validation of the USP7 activator that paves the way towards novel activation-driven USP7 pharmacology.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Understanding oxidative stress responses requires identifying the key proteins involved and their cellular organization. Here, we combined proteomics and cryo-EM to investigate the response of the anaerobic hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus to oxygen exposure. Proteome analysis revealed a significant upregulation of the oxidoreductase Rubrerythrin (Rbr) under oxidative stress. Cryo-electron tomograms showed the formation of prominent oxidative stress-induced tubules (OSITs). Single-particle cryo-EM and mass spectrometry of enriched OSITs identified them as stacked rings of Rbr homotetramers. The 3.3 angstrom structure demonstrates that rubredoxin-like domains mediate homotetramer assembly, suggesting that their oxidation drives OSIT formation. Within OSITs, we discovered virus-like particles formed by a ferritin-like/encapsulin fusion protein with iron hydroxide cores, uncovering a sophisticated organelle that protects P. furiosus from ROS through advanced compartmentalization.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

The structure of such pedigrees is challenging to visualise. Being directed acyclic graphs, pedigrees can be represented as matrices. Common choices are the numerator relationship matrix, A, and the adjacency matrix T. With these matrices, the structure of pedigrees can then, in principle, be visualised via principal component analysis (PCA). However, the naive PCA of matrices for large pedigrees is challenging due to computational and memory constraints.

ResultsWe present the open-access R package randPedPCA for rapid pedigree PCA using sparse matrices and randomised linear algebra. Our rapid pedigree PCA builds on the fact that matrix-vector multiplications with the numerator relationship matrix can be carried out implicitly using the extremely sparse inverse Cholesky factor of the numerator relationship matrix. We demonstrate the utility of randPedPCA using several simulated datasets of pedigrees and SNPs. We then demonstrate the performance of randPedPCA by analysing the pedigree of the UK Labrador Retriever breeding population of almost 1.5 million individuals.

ConclusionsThe structure of pedigrees can be efficiently and rapidly visualised using scatter plots of principal component scores. For large pedigrees, this is considerably faster than rendering plots of a pedigree graph.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Bioinformatics, synthetic biology, and biochemical approaches were integrated to characterize PRRs from 285 plant species. We identified a receptor, named ""SCORE"", that perceives cold-shock protein (CSP) peptides. SCORE orthologs from multiple angiosperm lineages exhibit remarkable CSP recognition polymorphisms, indicating recurrent selection for pathogen recognition through substitutions at key amino acid residues.

To understand the broader implications of IFN-driven immune responses, we analyzed whole-blood transcriptomics, plasma proteomics, metabolomics, and immune cell profiling in COVID-19 patients and uninfected controls. Patients were stratified into low (LIS), moderate (MIS), and high (HIS) ISG expression clusters, independent of acute disease severity. HIS patients exhibited elevated inflammatory mediators (S100A8/A9, Neopterin) and altered metabolic profiles, yet immune activation patterns varied. Plasma from HIS cases induced differential activation in healthy neutrophils and monocytes, with severe HIS plasma showing reduced activation, suggesting the presence of suppressive soluble factors. Metabolomic analysis revealed widespread lipid metabolism dysregulation, including reductions in phospholipids, sphingolipids, and plasmalogens, which correlated with impaired immune activation. Branched-chain lipids and tryptophan metabolism products correlated strongly with monocyte and neutrophil activation, linking metabolic shifts to immune regulation. Despite IFN autoantibody detection in a subset of patients, no direct association with ISG expression was observed. These findings suggest that IFN-driven immune-metabolic dysregulation may persist beyond acute infection, contributing to post-viral inflammation, immune dysfunction, and susceptibility to long COVID or autoimmune-like sequelae. The interplay between IFN signaling, mitochondrial function, and lipid metabolism highlights novel therapeutic targets for immune modulation in viral infections and chronic inflammatory conditions. Understanding these immune signatures may inform precision medicine approaches in post-viral syndromes and immunometabolic disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Many condensates have internal subdomains with distinct compositional identities. A major challenge lies in dissecting the multicomponent logic that relates biomolecular features to emergent condensate organization. Nuclear paraspeckles are paradigmatic examples of multi-domain condensates, comprising core and shell layers with distinct compositions that are scaffolded by the lncRNA NEAT1, which spans both layers. A prevailing model of paraspeckle assembly proposes that core proteins bind directly and specifically to core-associated NEAT1 domains. Combining informatics and biochemistry, we unexpectedly find that the essential core proteins FUS and NONO bind and condense preferentially with shell-associated NEAT1 domains. The shell protein TDP-43 exhibits similar NEAT1 domain preferences on its own but forms surfactant-like shell layers around core protein-driven condensates when both are present. Together, experiments and physics-based simulations suggest that competitive RNA binding and immiscibility between core and shell proteins orders paraspeckle layers. More generally, we propose that sub-condensate organization can spontaneously arise from a balance of collaborative and competitive protein binding to the same domains of a lncRNA.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Heightened synaptic and structural plasticity of immature abDGCs is thought to govern their distinct contributions to circuit and network mechanisms of hippocampal-dependent memory operations. Protracted maturation or neoteny of abDGCs in higher mammals is hypothesized to offset decline in adult hippocampal neurogenesis by expanding the capacity for circuit and network plasticity underlying different memory operations. Here, we provide evidence for this hypothesis by genetically modelling the effective impact of neoteny of abDGCs on circuitry, network properties and social cognition in mice. We show that selective synchronous expansion of a single cohort of 4 weeks old immature, but not 8 weeks old mature abDGCs, increases functional recruitment of fast spiking parvalbumin expressing inhibitory interneurons (PV INs) in CA3/CA2, number of PV IN-CA3/CA2 synapses, and GABAergic inhibition of CA3/CA2. This transient increase in feed-forward inhibition in DG-CA2 decreased social memory interference and enhanced social memory consolidation. In vivo local field potential recordings revealed that the expansion of a single cohort of 4-week-old abDGCs increased baseline power, amplitude, and duration, as well as sensitivity to social investigation-dependent rate changes of sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) in CA1 and CA2, a neural substrate for memory consolidation. Inhibitory neuron-targeted chemogenetic manipulations implicate CA3/CA2 INs, including PV INs, as necessary and sufficient for social memory consolidation following neotenic expansion of the abDGC population and in wild-type mice, respectively. These studies suggest that neoteny of abDGCs may represent an evolutionary adaptation to support cognition by reconfiguring PV IN-CA3/CA2 circuitry and emergent network properties underlying memory consolidation.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

However, the ability of these ring-shaped DNA motors to navigate large DNA-bound obstacles, such as DNA/RNA polymerases and ribosomes in prokaryotes, has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a bacterial SMC Wadjet complex can efficiently bypass obstacles larger than the SMC coiled coil lumen if they are linked to the extruded DNA by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This process is mediated by the selective entrapment of the ssDNA linker within the SMC hinge channel, which acts as an obligate gate--permitting ssDNA passage while excluding double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). By threading the linker through the hinge gate as dsDNA is translocated through the SMC motor, the obstacle can follow a trajectory distinct from its associated dsDNA, remaining outside the SMC ring. This mechanism enables continuous dsDNA entrapment while successfully bypassing obstacles. We show that hinges of diverse SMC complexes including eukaryotic condensin and Smc5/6 also selectively accommodate ssDNA, suggesting that hinge bypass is a conserved feature across SMC proteins. We demonstrate that while the hinge domain is essential for obstacle bypass, it is dispensable for loop extrusion, showing that these functions are independent, provided by separate SMC modules. These findings uncover the long-sought function of the SMC hinge toroid and provide the first mechanistic explanation for how DNA-entrapping SMC complexes can extrude loops on chromosomal DNA densely populated with obstacles. Integrating hinge bypass into the DNA loop extrusion model, we propose that the hinge may also facilitate the passage of RNA and peptide, enabling bypass of transcription-associated ribonucleoprotein complexes and other SMC complexes.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

Astrocytes, the primary homeostatic cells of the central nervous system (CNS), exhibit species-specific characteristics, with human astrocytes specifically displaying unique structural and functional features. It is thus essential to investigate human-specific astrocytic responses to neuropathology using human-relevant models. Varicose projection (VP) astrocytes, traditionally considered specific to humans and apes, were suggested to reflect pathological burden, albeit direct evidence linking them to neurological diseases has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that VP astrocytes are present in mice and tigers (Panthera tigris) and we provide evidence from four distinct human-based models that VP astrocytes are not a distinct physiological astrocyte subtype but rather a novel class of reactive astrocytes associated with neuropathology. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astrocytes, mixed neural cultures, and cortical organoids, we showed that VP astrocytes are induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) or LPS. Notably, cytokine withdrawal reverses the VP phenotype of astrocytes, indicating that it is a transient, inflammation-dependent state. We characterized the distinctive components of varicosities, including markers for extracellular vesicles, mitochondria, Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum components, suggesting roles in cellular stress responses and metabolic dysregulation. We further validated the pathological relevance of VP astrocytes by documenting their significant enrichment in postmortem brain samples from patients with several neurodegenerative diseases including as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, as well as in surgical resections from patients with epilepsy due to hippocampal sclerosis or brain tumors, including previously unreported subcortical regions such as basal ganglia. Additionally, we identified a higher number of VP astrocytes also in mouse astrocytes upon treatment with pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that the formation of VP astrocytes is an evolutionarily conserved astrocytic response to neuroinflammation. Our findings point to VP astrocytes as a novel reactive astrocyte subtype closely linked to neuropathology, highlighting their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in neurological diseases. This study lays the groundwork for future investigations into the mechanisms driving VP astrocyte formation and their broader implications in neuropathology.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

While LC symptoms vary widely, neuropathy is one of the most prevalent symptoms and drastically affects patients quality of life. However, the underlying pathophysiology of LC neuropathy remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the prevalence and potential mechanisms of LC neuropathy in the largest LC neuropathy cohort to date.

MethodsWe conducted an observational study of 977 adults with LC at Dell Medical School. Participants underwent clinical assessments, skin punch biopsy, and comprehensive metabolic, endocrine and immunological profiling. A subset of patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

FindingsNeuropathic symptoms were reported by 55% (534/977) participants, with skin biopsy confirming small fiber neuropathy in 56.5% (48/85) cases, affecting both epidermal and autonomic nerve fibers. Common risk factors for neuropathy, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, did not fully explain neuropathic symptoms. While general immunological markers (lymphocyte, T cell, and B cell count and C reactive protein were unremarkable, unexpectedly, we detected anti-ganglioside antibodies (AGAs) in 25% of patients with LC neuropathy, a comparable rate to other AGA-associated neuropathies. Longitudinal testing revealed persistent AGA positivity, and multiple elevated AGAs in a subset of patients. In a pilot treatment cohort of eight patients, IVIG treatment resulted in improvement of patient reported neuropathic symptoms.

In this study, we developed an aptamer (Apt343) that targets IF3N with the goal of elucidating its contribution to translation initiation. Rapid kinetics assays revealed that Apt343 reduces the rate of IF3 association with the 30S ribosomal subunit by 13-fold, while inducing a pronounced rearrangement of both IF3 domains on the 30S. These changes compromise IF2-, mRNA-, and fMet-tRNAfMet-dependent movements of IF3, delaying 30S initiation complex (30S IC) formation by up to two orders of magnitude. Cryo-EM analysis suggests that Apt343 may sterically clash with fMet-tRNAfMet, thereby perturbing the canonical pathway by which the initiator tRNA is accommodated after IF2-dependent recruitment and prior to start codon decoding. However, once the 30S IC is formed, blocking IF3N does not prevent 50S subunit joining or 70S IC assembly. Collectively, these findings support a role for IF3N in enhancing an efficient path for fMet-tRNAfMet accommodation towards the 30S IC and promoting IF3C displacement to unlock 50S recruitment. Moreover, this aptamer-based strategy offers a valuable tool for dissecting domain-specific activities of multidomain factors within complex environments such as the initiating ribosome.

This study included 63,555 cases, 17,700 proxy cases with a family history of Parkinsons disease, and 1,746,386 controls, making it the largest investigation of Parkinsons disease genetic risk to date.

MethodsMeta-analyses were performed using standard fixed and random effect models for the European sub-populations, the case-control studies, and the population biobanks separately. Finally, all of the European ancestries for all study types as well as proxy cases were combined in our final cross-European meta-analysis. We estimated heritable risk across ancestry groups, investigated tissue and cell-type enrichment, and prioritized risk genes using public data to facilitate functional follow-up efforts.

ResultsThe final combined cross-European meta-analysis identified 134 risk loci (59 novel), with a total of 157 independent signals, significantly expanding our understanding of Parkinsons disease risk. Multi-omic data integration revealed that expression of the nominated risk genes are highly enriched in brain tissues, particularly in neuronal and astrocyte cell types. Additionally, we prioritized 33 high-confidence genes across these 134 loci for future follow-up studies.

ConclusionsBy integrating diverse European populations and leveraging harmonized data from the Global Parkinsons Genetics Program (GP2), we reveal new insight into the genetic architecture of Parkinsons disease. We identified a total of 134 risk loci, expanding the number of known loci associated with PD by approximately 24%. We also provided an initial layer of biological context to these results through follow-up analyses in an effort to facilitate follow-up studies and precision medicine efforts with the goal of advancing Parkinsons disease research.","NA","medrxiv",1742594938969

TIR domains encoded by plants and prokaryotes function as enzymes to produce diverse small molecule immune signals. Plant genomes can encode hundreds of TIR-domain containing proteins - many of which confer important agricultural disease resistance as TIR-NLR (nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat) immune receptors. Despite their importance, how natural variation influences TIR enzymatic output and immunity-associated cell death is largely unexplored. We assayed a complete collection of the TIR domains of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 (the ""AtTIRome"") to explore variation in TIR metabolite production and cell death signaling. Roughly half of the AtTIRome triggered cell death in transient assays. Artificial TIR proteins designed based on consensus sequences of the AtTIRomes cell death phenotypic classes revealed polymorphisms controlling variation in TIR cell death elicitation and metabolite production. Structure-function analyses of artificial TIRs revealed that natural variation in the ""BB-loop"", a flexible region overlying the catalytic pocket, determines differences in function across Arabidopsis TIR-containing proteins. We further demonstrate that artificial TIRs are functional on an NLR chassis and that BB-loop variation can tune the activity of a natural TIR-NLR protein. These findings shed light on the diversity of TIR outputs and reveal methods to design and engineer TIR-based immune receptors.

Significance StatementTIR (Toll/interleukin-1 receptors) domain proteins perform immune signaling across the Tree of Life. TIR domains are enzymes that can process NAD+ to generate diverse small molecule signals. In order to better understand TIR-based signaling, we leveraged Arabidopsis natural variation across [~]150 TIR proteins to inform the design of artificial TIRs, define features that control output, and tune the output of a natural TIR immune receptor. The engineering of plant immune pathways will enable the optimization of disease resistance to safeguard yields.","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

To clarify how human MRN binds generic and telomeric DNA ends and can separate DNA end sensing from nuclease activities, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of human MRN bound to DNA and to DNA and the telomere protection factor TRF2. MRN senses DSBs through a tight clamp-like sensing state with closed coiled-coil domains, but auto-inhibited MRE11 nuclease. NBS1 wraps around the MRE11 dimer, with NBS1s ATM recruitment motif sequestered by binding to the regulatory RAD50 S site, necessitating an allosteric switch for ATM activation. At telomeric DNA, TRF2 blocks the second S site via the iDDR motif to prevent nuclease and ATM activation. Our results provide a structural framework for topological DNA sensing and separation of sensing, signaling and processing activities of mammalian MRN.

Highlights- Human MRN senses DNA ends with an autoinhibited nuclease
- NBS1s C-terminus binds one RAD50 S site in the sensing state
- TRF2 binds MRNs second S site at telomeres
- RAD50 and ATM compete for the NBS1 C-terminus","NA","biorxiv",1742594938969

MethodsWe used nationwide data from Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, using 28- and 180-days risk periods following BNT162b2 vaccination or a positive test for SARS-Cov-2 infection. Individuals aged 5-19 years during the study period (1st January 2021-31st December 2022) were included. We used a common data model, using individual level data linked from nation-wide registers and a shared analysis script to harmonize data and analysis. Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) comparing outcome rates in risk windows to unvaccinated or uninfected follow-up rates. This was supplemented with self-controlled case series analyses. Results from different countries were analyzed jointly in a meta-analysis.

ResultsWe observed no clear association between BNT162b2 vaccination and new-onset AH, GBS or T1D. Neither did we observe any clear association with recurrent hospital visits following BNT162b2 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection. An association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and GBS was observed in both the 28-day and 180-day risk window (relative risk (RR) 15.10, 95% CI, 1.11-205.94, and RR 3.85, 1.33-11.14, respectively).

ConclusionsBNT162b2 vaccination was not associated with new-onset or recurrent hospital visits of these diseases in children and adolescents. Sars-CoV-2 infection was associated with new-onset GBS. Estimates were however uncertain due to the small number of cases.","NA","medrxiv",1742594938969

While highly processed food like packaged products, processed meat, and sweetened soft drinks have been increasingly associated with unhealthy diet, information on the degree of processing characterizing an item in a store is not straight forward to obtain, limiting the ability of individuals to make informed choices. Here we introduce GroceryDB, a database with over 50,000 food items sold by Walmart, Target, and Wholefoods, unveiling how big data can be harnessed to empower consumers and policymakers with systematic access to the degree of processing of the foods they select, and the potential alternatives in the surrounding food environment. The extensive data gathered on ingredient lists and nutrition facts enables a large-scale analysis of ingredient patterns and degrees of processing, categorized by store, food category, and price range. Our findings reveal that the degree of food processing varies significantly across different food categories and grocery stores. Furthermore, this data allows us to quantify the individual contribution of over 1,000 ingredients to ultra-processing. GroceryDB and the associated http://TrueFood.Tech/ website make this information accessible, guiding consumers toward less processed food choices while assisting policymakers in reforming the food supply.","NA","medrxiv",1742594938969
