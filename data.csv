Recent advances in pharmaceutical interventions, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (e.g., semaglutide, liraglutide) and dual gastric inhibitory polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GIP/GLP-1) receptor agonists (e.g., tirzepatide), have shown remarkable efficacy in weight loss. However, limited access to these medications due to high costs and insurance coverage issues restricts their utility in mitigating the obesity epidemic. We quantify the annual mortality burden directly attributable to limited access to these medications in the US. By integrating hazard ratios of mortality across body mass index categories with current obesity prevalence data, combined with willingness to take the medication, observed adherence to and efficacy of the medications, we estimate the impact of making these medications accessible to all those eligible. Specifically, we project that with expanded access, over 43,000 deaths could be averted annually, including more than 12,000 deaths among people with type 2 diabetes. These findings underscore the urgent need to address barriers to access and highlight the transformative public health impact that could be achieved by expanding access to these novel treatments.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158081

There are uncertainties about whether treatments in the acute or post-acute phase of infection can prevent PCC. We report an update to a previous systematic review on the effects of interventions to prevent PCC. Methods: We updated our previous peer-reviewed searches on February 9, 2024. We searched bibliographic databases and grey literature resources to identify trials and comparative observational studies reporting on any intervention provided during the acute (symptom onset to 4 weeks) or post-acute phase (4-8 weeks) of COVID-19 and our primary outcome of incidence of PCC, ascertained at 3 months or longer following infection and capturing, at a minimum, symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea and one or more aspects of cognitive function. Non-recovery from COVID-19 was included if necessary. Secondary outcomes included fatigue, breathlessness/dyspnea, post-exertional malaise, health-related quality of life, psychopathology, cognitive impairment, hospitalization, return to work/education, and adverse effects of the intervention. For screening we employed artificial intelligence to prioritize records and modified our methods to rely on single-reviewer screening after 50% of citations were screened in duplicate. Study selection and risk of bias assessments were conducted independently by two reviewers and data extraction relied on verification of another reviewers work. We grouped studies by intervention type and timing, and by acute-care setting, and performed meta-analysis where appropriate. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the primary outcome, excluding studies with high risk of bias, using non-recovery as a proxy outcome, and evaluating the outcome at more than 12 months of follow-up. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Results: Twenty-four studies (5 randomized and 19 non-randomized), all among adults, were included. The acute care setting in nine studies was outpatient and in 15 studies was in-patient; all but one intervention was administered during the acute-phase of illness. The use of convalescent plasma in outpatient acute COVID-19 care probably does not reduce the risk of PCC (relative risk [RR]: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.77-1.12; 1 RCT; moderate certainty). There was low-certainty evidence suggesting that probiotics (RR [95% CI]: 0.32 [0.13-0.78]; 1 RCT) and metformin (0.50 [0.25-0.99]; 1 RCT among individuals with a BMI >=25 kg/m2) reduce PCC to a small-to-moderate extent in outpatients, while ivermectin (outpatients), antivirals (outpatients), steroids (in-patients), and therapeutic-dose heparin (vs. prophylactic dose; in-patients) may not be effective. Evidence was very low certainty for several other acute-phase pharmacologic intervention and post-acute outpatient assessment and referrals. For outpatient antiviral treatment, while overall PCC risk may not decrease, there might be a slight reduction in psychopathology. Similarly, inpatient antiviral use may not prevent PCC but may offer a small reduction in prolonged general malaise after light exertion. Therapeutic-dose heparin may slightly reduce the risk of cognitive impairment compared to prophylactic-dose heparin among in-patients. The findings remained consistent across all these sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Evidence suggests that PCC can be prevented to some extent among outpatients with the use of probiotics and metformin during the acute phase of COVID-19. Effects from interventions used among in-patients and within the post-acute phase are uncertain at this time. Evidence on commonly recommended interventions including rehabilitation or multidisciplinary care was lacking. Protocol registration: CRD42024513247","NA","medrxiv",1727302158081

However, these dances have attracted little scientific attention and their structure and meaning remain largely obscure. Here we analyse close-range video recordings of captive crested gibbons, extracting descriptions of dance in four Nomascus species (N. annamensis, N. gabriellae, N. leucogenys, and N. siki). Additionally, we report results from a survey amongst relevant professionals clarifying behavioural contexts of dance in captive and wild crested gibbons. Our results demonstrate that dances in Nomascus represent a common and intentional form of visual communication restricted to sexually mature females. While primarily used as a proceptive signal to solicit copulation, dances occur in a wide range of contexts related to arousal and/or frustration in captivity. A linguistically informed view of this sequential behaviour demonstrates that dances follow a grouping organisation and isochronous rhythm - patterns not described for visual displays in other non-human primates. We argue that applying the concept of dance to gibbons allows us to expand our understanding of the communicative behaviours of non-human apes and develop hypotheses on the rules and regularities characterizing this behaviour. We propose that gibbons dances likely evolved from less elaborate rhythmic proceptive signals, similar to those found in siamangs. Although dance displays in humans and crested gibbons share a number of key characteristics, they cannot be assumed to be homologous. Nevertheless, gibbon dances represent a model behaviour whose investigation could be extended to the study of complex gestural signals in hominoid primates.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

We aimed to test whether epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) estimated using different epigenetic clocks predict long-term overall, cardiovascular or cancer mortality.

MethodsWe analyzed data from 2,105 participants to the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey aged [&ge;]50 years old who were followed for mortality through 2019. EAAs was calculated from the residuals of Horvath, Hannum, SkinBlood, Pheno, Zhang, Lin, Weidner, Vidal-Bralo and Grim epigenetic clocks regressed on chronological age. Using cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association of EAA (per 5-year) and the DunedinPoAm pace of aging (per 10% increase) with overall, cardiovascular and cancer mortality, adjusting for covariates and white blood cell composition.

ResultsDuring a median follow-up of 17.5 years, 998 deaths occurred, including 272 from cardiovascular disease and 209 from cancer. Overall mortality was most significantly predicted by Grim EAA (P < 0.0001; HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.32-1.71) followed by Hannum (P = 0.001; HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.07-1.27), Pheno (P = 0.001; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.21), Horvath (P = 0.007; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04-1.22) and Vidal-Bralo (P = 0.008; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.03-1.23) EAAs. Grim EAA predicted cardiovascular mortality (P < 0.0001; HR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.29-1.86), whereas Hannum (P = 0.006; HR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.07-1.44), Horvath (P = 0.02; HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.02-1.35) and Grim (P = 0.049; HR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.00-1.87) EAAs predicted cancer mortality. DunedinPoAm pace of aging was associated with overall (P = 0.003; HR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.08-1.38) and cardiovascular (P = 0.04; HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.01-1.55) mortality.

ConclusionsIn a U.S. representative sample, Horvath, Hannum, Pheno, Vidal-Bralo and Grim EAA all predicted overall mortality but only Grim EAA predicted cardiovascular mortality and Horvath, Hannum or Grim EAA predicted cancer mortality.

We performed a 48-week double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled decentralized study (Participatory Evaluation of Aging with Rapamycin for Longevity [PEARL]; NCT04488601; registration date 2020-07-28) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rapamycin in mitigating clinical signs of aging in a normative aging cohort. Participants received 5 or 10 mg / week of compounded rapamycin, or placebo for 48 weeks. Safety, adverse events (AEs) and blood biomarkers were collected. Efficacy was assessed using DEXA scan-based measures and standardized surveys assessing quality of life (QoL) and frailty. We did not detect significant differences in safety blood biomarkers, or moderate to severe AEs between the rapamycin treatment groups and placebo after 48 weeks. We detected dose-dependent (10 mg group) and sex-specific improvements in lean tissue mass, pain, social functioning, overall QoL, and overall osteoarthritis score in females, and in bone mineral content in men. Additionally, some individuals receiving rapamycin experienced significant improvements in body composition metrics that were associated with beneficial changes in gut health and lipid metabolism. We conclude that low-dose, intermittent rapamycin administration over the course of 48 weeks is safe and induces sex-specific improvements in multiple aspects of healthspan, with the most robust improvements in lean tissue mass in women taking 10 mg rapamycin/week. Future work will aim to identify biometric signatures of clinical effectiveness to inform personalized treatment strategies that more broadly maximize efficacy and minimize side effects.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158081

Targeted metabolomics provided a fingerprint of 189 intracellular metabolites, while transcriptomics offered insights into cellular programs modulated by SLC expression. Beyond the metabolic profiles of 102 SLCs directly related to their known substrates, we also identified putative substrates or metabolic pathway connections for 71 SLCs without previously annotated bona fide substrates, including SLC45A4 as a new polyamine transporter. By comparing the molecular profiles, we identified functionally related SLC groups, including some with distinct impacts on osmolyte balancing and glycosylation.

However, recent and heavily disputed debates on data quality have raised questions on the accuracy of demographic data at older ages. Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158081

All individuals had neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and 11 had RT-qPCR-positive respiratory swabs; one also had a positive rectal swab. Six of 11 respiratory swabs yielded infectious virus with replication kinetics of most samples displaying lower growth 24-48 h post infection in vitro when compared to Omicron lineages isolated from humans in Texas in the same period. However, virus growth was similar between groups by 72 h, suggesting no strong attenuation of deer-derived virus.

It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar.

MethodsTwo matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024.

ResultsThe adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.07) in the three-dose analysis. In the first six months of follow-up in the two-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.27-0.46); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.19-1.94). In the first six months of follow-up in the three-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.20-0.50); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02-1.85). The overall effectiveness of the primary series and third-dose vaccinations against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 95.9% (95% CI: 94.0-97.1) and 34.1% (95% CI: -46.4-76.7), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

ConclusionA strong healthy vaccinee effect was observed in the first six months following vaccination. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158081

Combination of variant effect data from several such experiments provides the opportunity to conduct large-scale analyses of variant effect scores measured across proteins, but can be complicated by variations in the phenotypes that are probed across experiments. Thus, using variant effect datasets obtained with similar MAVE techniques can help reveal general rules governing the effects of amino acid variation for a single molecular phenotype. In this work, we accordingly combined data from six individual variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq) experiments and analysed a total of 31,614 variant effect scores reporting solely on the impact of single amino acid residue substitutions on the cellular abundance of proteins. Using our combined variant effect dataset, we derived and analysed a collection of amino acid substitution matrices describing the average impact on cellular abundance of all residue substitution types in different structural environments. We found that the substitution matrices predict the cellular abundance of protein variants with surprisingly high accuracy when given structural information only in the form of whether a residue is buried or exposed. We thus propose our substitution matrix-based predictions as strong baselines for future abundance model development.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

In the Roman era, we document profound demographic transformation, with an influx of people with ancestry from the Central and Eastern Mediterranean in all the areas under study and of North Africans, especially in central and southern Iberia. Germanic (Buri, Suebi, Vandals & Visigoths) and Sarmatian (Alans) took over political control beginning in the 5th century, and although we identify individuals with Germanic-associated ancestry at sites with Germanic-style ornaments and observe that such individuals were closely related across large distances as in the case of two siblings separated by 700 km, for Iberia as a whole, we observe high continuity with the previous Hispano-Roman population. The demographic patterns in Iberia contrast sharply with those in Britain, which showed the opposite pattern of little change in the Roman period followed by great change in the Migration period, and also from demographic patterns in the central Mediterranean where both periods were associated with profound transformation, raising broader questions about the forces that precipitated change over this time.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

In contrast, cardiac activity was faster after local, but not global, deviants in Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep. Overall, our results demonstrate that cardiac responses to auditory irregularities inform about hierarchical information processing and its variations during sleep beyond cerebral activity. They highlight the embodiment of cognitive function and the value of cardiac signals to understand the variations of sensory processing during sleep.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158081

Previous studies have reported that overexpression of ASCL1 or combinations of proneural factors in Muller glia (MG) induces regeneration of functional neurons in the adult mouse retina. Recently, we applied the same strategy in dissociated cultures of fetal human MG and although we stimulated neurogenesis from MG, our effect in 2D cultures was modest and our analysis of newborn neurons was limited. In this study, we aimed to improve our MG reprogramming strategy in a more intact retinal environment. For this purpose, we used an in vitro culture system of human fetal retinal tissue and adult human postmortem retina. To stimulate reprogramming, we used lentiviral vectors to deliver constructs with a glial-specific promoter (HES1) driving ASCL1 alone or in combination with additional developmental transcription factors such as ATOH1 and NEUROD1. Combining IHC, scRNA-seq and electrophysiology, we show for the first time that human MG can generate new neurons even in adults. This work constitutes a key step towards a future clinical application of this regenerative medicine approach for retinal degenerative disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

We show here that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) redeploy intact cell surface proteins from cancer cells to their own cell surface. We initially observed the canonical epithelial cancer surface marker EPCAM on the surface of TAMs in primary human solid tumors but not paired peripheral blood macrophages. In a murine model of metastatic breast cancer, we also observed EPCAM on the surface of primary TAMs that have phagocytosed breast cancer cells. In a model of a myeloproliferative neoplasm, we again found engulfed cell-derived surface proteins on the surface of macrophages following phagocytosis. A co-culture system and proteomics assay that tags proteins based on their cell-of-origin revealed hundreds of cell surface proteins synthesized in cancer cells are present and fully intact on the surface of macrophages following phagocytosis. Furthermore, macrophages that redeploy a neutral amino acid transporter correspondingly show increased transport of an unnatural amino acid substrate. Widespread acquisition of proteins from engulfed cells may contribute to two critical TAM phenotypes: the inability to phagocytose and reprogrammed metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

This technique produces networks where each target node is associated with a set of source nodes that are capable of providing explanatory power for its dynamics. Multivariate Transfer Entropy (TE) has proven to be a popular and effective tool for inferring these networks. Recently, a continuous-time estimator of TE for event-based data such as spike trains has been developed which, in more efficiently representing event data in terms of inter-event intervals, is significantly more capable of measuring multivariate interactions. The new estimator thus presents an opportunity to more effectively use TE for the inference of effective networks from spike trains, and we demonstrate in this paper for the first time its efficacy at this task. Using data generated from models of spiking neurons - for which the ground-truth connectivity is known - we demonstrate the accuracy of this approach in various dynamical regimes. We further show that it exhibits far superior inference performance to a pairwise TE-based approach as well as a recently-proposed convolutional neural network approach. Moreover, comparison with Generalised Linear Models (GLMs), which are commonly applied to spike-train data, showed clear benefits, particularly in cases of high synchrony. Finally, we demonstrate its utility in revealing the patterns by which effective connections develop from recordings of developing neural cell cultures.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

Cladribine is a deoxyadenosine analogue that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier. It is used to treat multiple sclerosis. However, the mechanistic understanding of the effect of this highly effective therapy on B cells and plasma cells in the central nervous system compartment is limited. Objectives. The CLADRIPLAS study examined the effect of cladribine on peripheral and intrathecal B and plasma cell biology in people with MS. Methods. Thirty-eight people with progressive MS ineligible for- or rejecting- treatment with licenced therapies were recruited and supplied a baseline lumbar puncture. Those exhibiting gadolinium-enhancing or new/enlarging T2 magnetic resonance imaging lesions and/or elevated neurofilament levels were offered subcutaneous cladribine (Litak). Seven people were eligible; one person died before treatment, and only five completed the first year of treatment. Twenty-two ineligible people were willing to provide a repeat lumbar puncture twelve months later. Results. The CLADRIPLAS study found no evidence of a difference in the odds of a positive cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal band (cOCB) result between the cladribine-treated and untreated group. This is probably explained by microarray and in vitro studies, which demonstrated that plasmablasts and notably long-lived plasma cells are relatively resistant to the cytotoxic effect of cladribine compared to memory B cells at physiological concentrations. This was consistent with the loss of intracellular deoxycytidine kinase during antibody-secreting cell differentiation. Discussion. CLADRIPLAS indicates that cOCB are not rapidly eliminated in most people with MS. This may be explained by the relative lack of direct cytotoxic action of cladribine on long-lived plasma cells.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158081

This study aims to develop a rapid acquisition method that provides distortion-matched, artifact-mitigated structural reference data.

MethodsWe introduce an efficient sequence protocol termed T1234, which offers adjustable distortions. This approach involves a T1-weighted 2-inversion 3D-EPI sequence with four spatial encoding directions optimized for high-resolution fMRI. A forward Bloch model was used for T1 quantification and protocol optimization. Twenty participants were scanned at 7T using both structural and functional protocols to evaluate the utility of T1234.

ResultsResults from two protocols are presented. A fast distortion-free protocol reliably produced whole-brain segmentations at 0.8mm isotropic resolution within 3:00-3:40 minutes. It demonstrates robustness across sessions, participants, and three different 7T SIEMENS scanners. For a protocol with geometric distortions that matched functional data, T1234 facilitates layer-specific fMRI signal analysis with enhanced laminar precision.

ConclusionThis structural mapping approach enables precise registration with fMRI data. T1234 has been successfully implemented, validated, and tested, and is now available to users at our center and at over 50 centers worldwide.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

Here, we propose an 'on-demand release' model, wherein the formation of microvesicles, a specific group of extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing the eCB, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), is the rate-limiting step. A co-culture model system that combines a reporter cell line expressing the fluorescent eCB sensor, GRABeCB2.0, and neuronal cells revealed that neurons release EVs containing 2-AG, but not anandamide, in a stimulus-dependent process regulated by PKC, DAGL, Arf6, and which was sensitive to inhibitors of eCB facilitated diffusion. A vesicle contained approximately 2000 2-AG molecules. Accordingly, hippocampal eCB-mediated synaptic plasticity was modulated by Arf6 and transport inhibitors. This 'on demand release' model, supported by mathematical analysis, offers a cohesive framework for understanding eCB signaling at the molecular level and suggests that microvesicles carrying signaling lipids regulate neuronal functions in parallel to canonical synaptic vesicles.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

To date, it remains elusive how the duration of TN-DC interactions and integration of activation signals are controlled in vivo. Here, we report that lymphoid stroma-secreted ligands for CCR7 constrained interaction duration by gradually inducing CD8+ T cell release from DCs. At late time points of interactions, CCR7 ligands repositioned the F-actin-promoting factor DOCK2 away from the DC interface to enable CD8+ T cell detachment, proliferation onset and acquisition of cytotoxicity. Lack of CCR7 signaling, as during ex vivo activation or in chronically inflamed lymphoid tissue, caused sustained T cell-DC interactions, and generated dysfunctional TEFF with high expression of inhibitory receptors, impaired antimicrobial activity, and poor recall responses.

We also show that our SNP panel has the capability to identify first-order relatives and provides insights into the geographic origin of samples. This SNP panel will empower the snow leopard research community in their efforts to assess local and global snow leopard population sizes.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant form of glioma. NLRX1 is an innate immune pattern recognition receptor that exhibits tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting effects that may be cancer or cell-type, context-dependent, aided by differences in the microenvironment. Here, we report that NLRX1 is differentially expressed in microglia, astrocytes, GBM cell lines, and glioma patient tissues. siRNA-mediated silencing of Nlrx1 decreases the ability of the GBM cell line, LN-229, to proliferate and migrate. Nlrx1-/- GBM cells exhibit attenuated ability to generate 3D spheroids and enhanced capability to form tunneling nanotubes. Moreover, Nlrx1-/- GBM cells show decreased expression of autophagy markers, suggesting that NLRX1 plays a role in maintaining autophagy in GBM. In summary, our findings indicate that NLRX1 may modulate GBM pathophysiology by regulating GBM cell proliferation, migration, and metabolism. We believe our understanding of NLRX1 in GBM pathophysiology paves the potential development of GBM-targeting therapeutics that may delay disease progression and/or improve survival.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

Of the outbreak isolates, 292 (61.3%) had an identified epidemiological link. Among the outbreaks with interventions, 95.6% showed no further transmission on the intervened transmission route. The impact analysis estimated that, over the two-year period, 62 infections were averted, with gross cost savings of $1,011,146, and net savings of $695,706, which translates to a 3.2-fold return on investment. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed EDS-HAT was cost-saving and more effective in 98% of simulations.

ConclusionReal-time genomic surveillance enabled the rapid detection and control of outbreaks in our hospital and resulted in economic benefits and improvement in patient safety. This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating genomic surveillance into routine infection prevention practice, offering a paradigm shift in healthcare outbreak detection and control.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158081

To do this, we introduce Acquisition Free Periods (AFPs) that allow for the full recovery of the magnetization, followed by equal-length task or baseline acquisition blocks (AB) of fMRI volumes. An appropriately placed stimulus in the AFP produces a Blood Oxygenation-Level-Dependent (BOLD) response that peaks during the initial high tSNR phase of the AB, yielding an ~50% reduction in the number of trials (relative to conventional fMRI) needed to achieve a given statistical threshold. The AFP allows flexibility for the presentation of auditory stimuli, uncontaminated recording of electrophysiological activity, physiological gating, as well as the ability to average aperiodic fMRI data using stimulus or response-locked signal acquisition.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

These challenges stem from concerns about the quality, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of LLM-generated answers. Most existing work has focused on fine-tuning LLMs based on foundation models, which have not yet fully addressed accuracy and reliability issues. In this work, we propose an agent-based approach that aims to make LLM-based systems clinically deployable for precision oncology, while mitigating common pitfalls such as hallucinations, incoherence, and ""lost-in-the-middle"" problems. To achieve this, we implemented an agentic architecture, fundamentally shifting an LLM's role from a simple response synthesizer to planner. This agent orchestrates a suite of specialized tools that asynchronously retrieve information from various sources. These tools include curated document vector stores encompassing treatment guidelines, genomic data, clinical trial information, drug data, and breast cancer literature. The LLM then leverages its planning capabilities to synthesize information retrieved by these tools, generating comprehensive and accurate responses. We demonstrate GeneSilico Copilot's effectiveness in the domain of breast cancer, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.

However, our understanding of how sequence variation impacts the functional activity of RDs is limited. To address this gap, we generated a high-throughput mutational scanning dataset measuring the repressor activity of 115,000 variant sequences spanning more than 50 RDs in human cells. We identified thousands of clinical variants with loss or gain of repressor function, including TWIST1 HLH variants associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and MECP2 domain variants associated with Rett syndrome. We also leveraged these data to annotate short linear interacting motifs (SLiMs) that are critical for repression in disordered RDs. Then, we designed a deep learning model called TENet (Transcriptional Effector Network) that integrates sequence, structure and biochemical representations of sequence variants to accurately predict repressor activity. We systematically tested generalization within and across domains with varying homology using the mutational scanning dataset. Finally, we employed TENet within a directed evolution sequence editing framework to tune the activity of both structured and disordered RDs and experimentally test thousands of designs. Our work highlights critical considerations for future dataset design and model training strategies to improve functional variant prioritization and precision design of synthetic regulatory proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

Here, we show that commonly used CRISPRa systems can exhibit pronounced cytotoxicity. We demonstrate the toxicity of published and new CRISPRa vectors expressing the activation domains (ADs) of the transcription factors p65 and HSF1, components of the synergistic activation mediator (SAM) CRISPRa system. Based on our findings for the SAM system, we extended our studies to additional ADs and the p300 acetyltransferase core domain. We show that the expression of potent transcriptional activators in lentiviral producer cells leads to low lentiviral titers, while their expression in the transduced target cells leads to cell death. Using inducible lentiviral vectors, we could not identify an activator expression window for effective SAM-based CRISPRa without measurable toxicity. The toxicity of current SAM-based CRISPRa systems hinders their wide adoption in biomedical research and introduces selection bottlenecks that may confound genetic screens. Our results suggest that the further development of CRISPRa technology should consider both the efficiency of gene activation and activator toxicity.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

However, there are few analogous tools for manipulating the structure of neural circuits. Here, we introduce three rationally designed genetically encoded tools that use E3 ligase-dependent mechanisms to trigger the degradation of synaptic scaffolding proteins, leading to functional ablation of synapses. First, we developed a constitutive excitatory synapse ablator, PFE3, analogous to the inhibitory synapse ablator GFE3. PFE3 targets the RING domain of the E3 ligase Mdm2 and the proteasome-interacting region of Protocadherin 10 to the scaffolding protein PSD-95, leading to efficient ablation of excitatory synapses. In addition, we developed a light-inducible version of GFE3, paGFE3, using a novel photoactivatable complex based on the photocleavable protein PhoCl2c. paGFE3 degrades Gephyrin and ablates inhibitory synapses in response to 400 nm light. Finally, we developed a chemically inducible version of GFE3, chGFE3, which degrades inhibitory synapses when combined with the bio-orthogonal dimerizer, HaloTag ligand-trimethoprim.

However, the efficacy of editing outcomes is subject to various factors, with template format playing a crucial role. Currently, the predominant non-viral template format for inducing homology-directed repair (HDR) after nuclease-induced DNA breaks is double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which is toxic when transfected at high doses. Previous studies have demonstrated that using single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with flanking double-stranded Cas-target-sequences (CTS) as a repair template for Cas9-mediated gene editing can mitigate this toxicity and increase knock-in efficiency. Here, we investigate CTS design for AsCas12a Ultra by exploring PAM orientation and binding requirements of the Cas12a-crRNA complex. Additionally, we rule out in vitro ssDNase activity of AsCas12a Ultra under cell-physiological Mg2+ conditions. Finally, we showcase the advantage of using ssDNA with double-stranded CTS end modifications (ssCTS) at high doses for delivering clinically relevant transgenes of varying sizes into three T-cell receptor-CD3 complex genes (TRAC, CD3{zeta}, CD3{varepsilon}), achieving up to 90% knock-in rates for a 0.8kb insert at the CD3{varepsilon} locus.

Heterozygous pathogenic variants in SPTAN1 are exemplary for this diversity with phenotypes spanning almost the entire spectrum. Methods: Through international collaboration we identified 14 families with genetically unsolved distal weakness and unreported heterozygous SPTAN1 loss-of-function variants including frameshift, nonsense and splice-acceptor variants. Clinical data, electrophysiology, muscle CT or MRI and muscle biopsy findings were collected and standardized. SPTAN1 protein, mRNA expression analysis and cDNA sequencing was performed on muscle tissue from two patients. Results: All 20 patients presented with early childhood onset distal weakness. The severity varied both within families and between different families. Foot abnormalities ranged from hammer toes and pes cavus to distal arthrogryposis. Electrophysiology showed mixed myogenic and neurogenic features. Muscle MRI or CT in 10 patients showed fatty infiltration of the distal lower limb anterior compartment and/or selective involvement of the extensor hallucis longus muscle. Muscle biopsy revealed myopathic changes with mild dystrophic and chronic neurogenic changes in 7 patients. Finally, we provide proof for nonsense mediated decay in tissues derived from two patients. Conclusions: We provide evidence for the association of SPTAN1 loss-of-function variants with childhood onset distal myopathy in 14 families. This finding extends the phenotypic spectrum of SPTAN1 loss-of-function variants ranging from intellectual disability to distal weakness with a predominant myogenic cause.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158081

An important class of STING agonists are analogs of the endogenous STING agonist, cGAMP, and while transporters for these small molecules are known in some cell types, how they enter and kill T cells remains unknown. Here, we identify the cationic amino acid transporter SLC7A1 as the dominant transporter of cGAMP and its analogs in activated primary mouse and human T cells. T cells upregulate this transporter upon activation and rapid proliferation to meet their high metabolic demand, but this comes at the cost of enabling increased transport and toxicity of cGAMP. To circumvent the essentiality of SLC7A1 to proliferating T cells, we found that the residues responsible for cGAMP transport are separate from the arginine binding pocket allowing us to perturb cGAMP transport and STING-activation mediated killing without impacting arginine transport. These results suggest that SLC7A1 is a potential target for alleviating T cell toxicity associated with cGAMP and its analogs.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

Previous studies have shown that Orai3 seems to be involved in the development of acquired chemo-resistance of cisplatin in non-small cell lung cancer via ABC transporters that transport certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, out of the cells. Based on these studies, we hypothesize that Orai3 may be involved in the development of acquired chemo-resistance of pemetrexed. By using MTT assay, we show that pemetrexed is efficient and signiftcantly decreases cell viability in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate using siRNA-mediated Orai3 knockdown that Orai3 silencing has no effect on the chemoresistance against pemetrexed. Then, calcium imaging reveals that pemetrexed does not affect the activity of calcium channels like Orai3. As transcription factors are central to the regulation of gene expression, we wonder if pemetrexed could impact on Orai3 expression. To address the issue, Mn2+ -quench assays are performed in siOrai3 transfected A549 cells incubated with 1uM pemetrexed for 72h. Finally, RT-PCR is used in order to determine the mRNA expression proftle for Orai3 and ABC transporters in A549 cells. We demonstrate that pemetrexed increases Orai3 expression. Taken together, these results suggest that Orai3 is not involved in the development of acquired chemo-resistance of pemetrexed in non small cell lung cancer. Pemetrexed upregulates Orai3 expression but does not affect the activity of Orai3 channels. As Orai3 channels are known to be involved in the development of acquired chemoresistance of cisplatin in non-small cell lung cancer, pemetrexed could reduce the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin if Orai3 protein levels are linked to Orai3 mRNA levels. Moreover, cisplatin has been shown to increase both expression and function of Orai3, resulting in increased chemoresistance. Therefore, our results show that Orai3 could constitute a robust therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

Ubiquitylation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on cytosol-invading bacteria by the E3 ligase RNF213 creates 'eat-me' signals for antibacterial autophagy but whether and how cytosol-adapted bacteria avoid LPS ubiquitylation remains poorly understood. Here we show that Shigella flexneri, a professional cytosol-dwelling enterobacterium, actively antagonizes LPS ubiquitylation through IpaH1.4, a secreted effector protein with ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. IpaH1.4 binds to the LPS E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF213, ubiquitylates it, and targets it for degradation by the proteasome, thus preventing LPS ubiquitylation. To understand how IpaH1.4 recognizes RNF213, we determined the structure of their complex using cryogenic electron microscopy. The specificity of the interaction is achieved via the leucine rich repeat of IpaH1.4, which binds the RING domain of RNF213 by hijacking the conserved RING interface required for binding of ubiquitin-charged E2 enzymes. Interestingly, IpaH1.4 also targets the E3 ligase LUBAC - required for the synthesis of M1-linked ubiquitin chains on cytosol-invading bacteria downstream of RNF213 - as well as multiple other E3 ligases involved in inflammation and immunity - through binding to the E2-interacting face of their RING domains. We conclude that IpaH1.4 has evolved to antagonize multiple anti-bacterial and pro-inflammatory host E3 ligases.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

We therefore examined neural representations of alternative spatial locations in the rat hippocampus during navigation in a complex patch foraging environment with changing reward probabilities.

Critically, these representations were modulated in distinct patterns across successive trials: alternative paths were represented proportionate to their evolving relative value and predicted subsequent decisions, whereas distant alternatives were prevalent during value updating.

Although its effectiveness has been estimated to range between 36-86%, the persistence of protection is still unknown. Aims of this study is to assess the immune response one year after vaccination with MVA-BN. Methods Observational prospective study at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome. All people at high risk for mpox infection who received MVA-BN as pre-exposure prophylaxis were enrolled. People previously primed with smallpox vaccination received a single-dose course of MVA-BN, while non-primed received a two-dose course. Blood samples were collected at the time of each dose and one, six and 12 months after vaccination. MPXV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers were assessed by immunofluorescence and plaque neutralization tests, respectively. Interferon-gamma producing T-cell specific response to the MVA-BN vaccine was analyzed by ELISpot assay. Antibody titers at pre- and post-vaccination were compared using the Friedman tests. Mann Whitney test was used to compare antibody titers in PLWH vs PLWoH. Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests were used to compare T-cells specific response to the MVA-BN vaccine for intra and inter-group differences, respectively. Results Fifty high-risk people were included. All were men, with 94% self-reporting having sex with men. The median age was 50 years (IQR 45-57), and 21 (42%) were people living with HIV (PLWH), all on antiretroviral therapy, and 71% with a CD4 cell count higher than 500 mmc. 25 (50%) have been primed with previous smallpox vaccination. In non-primed people, anti-MPXV IgG titers significantly increased from T1 to T3 and, despite a slight reduction, were still higher than T1 up to T4 and then gradually decreased until T5, when 64% of sera were still reactive. MPXV-nAb titers peaked at T3 and then dropped, with 56% and 32% of sera reactive at T4 and T5, respectively. IFN-g; production by MVA-BN-specific T-cells progressively rose across time, peaked at T3, and remained significantly higher than the baseline after 6 and 12 months from vaccination. A single-dose course of MVA-BN vaccination in smallpox-primed participants elicited an early increase in IgG and nAb titers, which remained significantly higher than baseline after 6 and 12 months. MPXV-nAbs were detected in 80% and 72% of vaccinees at T4 and T5, respectively. A similar improvement and maintenance were observed for the MVA-BN-specific T-cell response. No evidence for a difference in both humoral and cellular responses was found between PLWH and PLWoH in our cohort. Conclusions One year after vaccination, our data showed the persistent detectability of low levels of nAb against MPXV in one-third of non-primed individuals. At the same time, humoral response was still detectable in most previously vaccinated participants.

In this exploratory analysis, we identified a cohort of pediatric (age <21) patients with evidence of Long COVID and no pre-existing complex chronic conditions using electronic health record data from 38 institutions and used an unsupervised machine learning-based approach to identify subphenotypes. Our method, an extension of the Phe2Vec algorithm, uses tens of thousands of clinical concepts from multiple domains to represent patients clinical histories to then identify groups of patients with similar presentations. The results indicate that cardiorespiratory presentations are most common (present in 54% of patients) followed by subphenotypes marked (in decreasing order of frequency) by musculoskeletal pain, neuropsychiatric conditions, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, and fatigue.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158081

Yet, technical limitations associated with short reads challenge their use for detection of disease-associated variation in complex regions of the genome. Long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies may overcome these challenges, potentially qualifying as a first-tier test for all rare diseases. To test this hypothesis, we performed LRS (30x HiFi genomes) for 100 samples with 145 known clinically relevant germline variants that are challenging to detect using short-read sequencing and necessitate a broad range of complementary test modalities in diagnostic laboratories.

We show that relevant variant callers readily re-identify the majority of variants (120/145, 83%), including [~]90% of structural variants, SNVs/InDels in homologous sequences and expansions of short tandem repeats. Another 10% (n=14) was visually apparent in the data but not automatically detected. Our analyses also identified systematic challenges for the remaining 7% (n=11) of variants such as the detection of AG-rich repeat expansions. Titration analysis showed that 89% of all automatically called variants could also be identified using 15-fold coverage.

Thus, long-read genomes identified 93% of pathogenic variants that are most challenging to detect using short-read technologies. Even with reduced coverage, the vast majority of variants remained detectable, possibly enhancing cost-effective diagnostic implementation. Most importantly, we show the potential to use a single technology to accurately identify all types of clinically relevant variants.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158081

We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the ability to recover co-occurrence estimates using standard and penalised likelihood under varying sample size and interaction scenarios while increasing model complexity in two dimensions: the number of interacting species and the number of covariates. We demonstrate that the ability to quantify interactions in species occupancy using these models is highly sensitive to sample size and interaction strength. Even in the simplest scenario, there is high bias and low coverage in natural parameters (used for inference) for sample sizes below 400 sites. Strong co-occurrence is detected consistently above 400 sites, but weak co-occurrence is never consistently detected even with 3000 sites. We demonstrate that mean predictive ability is less affected by sample size and complexity, with low bias in derived probabilities at 100 sites. We caution the use of these models for inference in small datasets or when co-occurrence is expected to be weak, but show they are suitable to detect strong co-occurrence in larger datasets and generate predictions of site occupancy states.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

Recent advancements in single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) techniques tailored for FFPE tissues have demonstrated their feasibility. However, isolation of high-quality nuclei from FFPE tissue with current methods remains challenging due to RNA cross-linking. We, therefore, proposed a novel strategy for the preparation of high-fidelity nuclei from FFPE samples, cryogenic enzymatic dissociation (CED) method, and performed snRandom-seq (snCED-seq) for polyformaldehyde (PFA) -fixed and FFPE brains to verify its applicability. The method is compatible with both PFA-based and FFPE brains or other organs with less hands-on time and lower reagent costs, and produced 10 times more nuclei than the homogenate method, without secondary degradation of RNA, and maximized the retention of RNA molecules within nuclei. snCED-seq shows 1.5-2 times gene and UMI numbers per nucleus, higher gene detection sensitivity and RNA coverage, and a minor rate of mitochondrial and ribosomal genes, compared with the nuclei from traditional method. The correlation gene expression of nucleus from the post-fixed and the frozen sample can be up to 94 %, and the gene expression of our nuclei was more abundant. Moreover, we applied snCED-seq to cellular heterogeneity study of the specimen on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) to demonstrate a pilot application. Scarce Cajal Retzius cells in older mice were robustly detected in our data, and we successfully identified two subpopulations of disease-associated in astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes, respectively. Meanwhile, we found that most cell types are affected at the transcriptional level by AD pathology, and there is a disease susceptibility gene set that affects these cell types similarly. Our method provides powerful nuclei for snRNA-seq studies for FFPE specimens, and even helps to reveal multi-omics information of clinical samples.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

Fiber-specific diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) models offer enhanced precision to measure specific features of white matter structure and may be more sensitive to individual differences in reading skills. However, fiber-specific models have not yet been applied to examine associations between reading ability and white matter microstructure over the course of reading acquisition. In this accelerated longitudinal study, we applied constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) and fiber-specific modelling to characterize developmental changes in fiber density of key white matter tracts of the reading network bilaterally, and investigated associations between tract-wise fiber density and children's phonological decoding abilities. Fiber density was measured from ages 2-13 years, and decoding ability (pseudoword reading) was assessed at ages 6 years and older. Higher decoding ability was associated with greater fiber density in the left arcuate fasciculus, and effects remained consistent over time. Follow-up analysis revealed that asymmetry changes in the arcuate fasciculus were moderated by decoding ability: good decoders showed leftward asymmetry from early childhood onward, while poorer decoders shifted toward leftward asymmetry over time. These results suggest that densely organized fibers in the left arcuate fasciculus serve as a foundation for the development of reading skills from the pre-reading stage through fluent reading. Ongoing developmental changes in fiber density and microstructural asymmetry throughout childhood may reflect a reciprocal relationship in which reading experience continues to refine and strengthen these pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

This is true across functional regions and species. Why do we have so many excitatory neurons? Little is known. Here we provide a normative answer to this question. We designed a task-agnostic, learning-independent and experiment-testable measurement of functional complexity, which quantifies the network's ability to solve complex problems. Using the first neuron level full connectome of a species - the larva Drosophila - we discovered the optimal Excitatory-Inhibitory (E-I) ratio that maximizes the functional complexity: 75-81% percentage of neurons are excitatory. This number is consistent with the true distribution observed via scRNA-seq. We found that the abundance of excitatory neurons confers an advantage in functional complexity, but only when inhibitory neurons are highly connected. In contrast, when the E-I identities are sampled uniformly (not dependent on connectivity), the optimal E-I ratio falls around equal population size, and its overall achieved functional complexity is sub-optimal. Our functional complexity measurement offers a normative explanation for the over-abundance of excitatory neurons in the brain. We anticipate that this approach will further uncover the functional significance of various neural network structures.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

Despite its significance in biology, there is a lack of conventional techniques suitable for studying biphasic samples in their biologically relevant form. Here, we present a label-free and non-invasive approach to characterize protein, RNA and water in biomolecular condensates termed LLPS REstricted DIFusion of INvisible speciEs (REDIFINE). Relying on diffusion NMR measurements, REDIFINE exploits the exchange dynamics between the condensed and dispersed phases to allow the determination of not only diffusion constants in both phases but also the fractions of the species, the average radius of the condensed droplets and the exchange rate between the phases. We can also access the concentration of proteins in both phases. Observing proteins, RNAs, water, and even small molecules, REDIFINE analysis allows a rapid biophysical characterization of multicomponent condensates which is important to understand their functional roles. In comparing multiple systems, REDIFINE reveals that folded RNA-binding proteins form smaller and more dynamic droplets compared to the disordered ones. In addition, REDIFINE proved to be valuable beyond LLPS for the determination of binding constants in soluble protein-RNA without the need for titration.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

Here we compile the shear force and stiffness values of whole and comminuted meats and meat analogs from the two most popular tests for meat, the Warner-Bratzler shear test and the double-compression texture profile analysis.

These methods decompose high-dimensional gene expression profiles into tractable factor representations and prototypical gene expression patterns (components), facilitating the study of cell type variation. However, integrating study covariates within linear DR frameworks remains a challenging task. We present scPCA, a flexible DR framework that jointly models cellular heterogeneity and conditioning variables, allowing it to recover an integrated factor representation and reveal transcriptional changes across conditions and components of the decomposition. We show that scPCA extracts an interpretable latent representation by analyzing unstimulated and IFN-beta-treated PBMCs, and showcase that the model may be employed to effectively address batch effects. We examine age-related changes in rodent lung cell populations, uncovering a previously unreported surge in Ccl5 expression in T cells. We illustrate how scPCA may be employed to identify coordinated transcriptional changes across multiple time-points in depolarized visual cortex neurons. Finally, we show that scPCA elucidates transcriptional shifts in CRISPR-Cas9 chordin knockout zebrafish fish single-cell data despite large difference cell abundance across conditions. Since scPCA introduces a general approach to account for conditioning variables in high-dimensional data, it may also be applicable to datasets other than scRNA-seq.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

Endogenous electric fields, generated by the disruption of the transepithelial potential across the skin, help to guide the movement of immune and skin cells toward the wound site. However, the mechanisms by which cells sense these physical cues remain largely unknown. Through a CRISPR-based screen, we identified Galvanin, a previously uncharacterized single-pass transmembrane protein that is required for human neutrophils to change their direction of migration in response to an applied electric field. Our results indicate that Galvanin rapidly relocalizes to the anodal side of a cell on exposure to an electric field, and that the net charge on its extracellular domain is necessary and sufficient to drive this relocalization. The spatial pattern of neutrophil protrusion and retraction changes immediately upon Galvanin relocalization, suggesting that it acts as a direct sensor of the electric field that then transduces spatial information about a cell's electrical environment to the migratory apparatus. The apparent mechanism of cell steering by sensor relocalization represents a new paradigm for directed cell migration.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

To address this issue, the healthcare sector requires rapid and accurate bacterial identification, which is currently not readily available for effective antimicrobial stewardship. In a UK national first, we implemented 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) in an NHS setting to enhance diagnostic capabilities, aiming to reduce antibiotic misuse and improve patient outcomes. Methods We implemented 16S rRNA sequencing via ONT, running samples from seven NHS hospitals across Cheshire and Merseyside. We focused on samples from sterile sites, such as 'pus', 'fluid', and 'tissue', typically collected from critical care units. The assay was validated against traditional methods including Sanger sequencing and MALDI-TOF, with a turnaround time of 24-72 hours. Clinical impact was measured by analysing changes in antibiotic regimens and patient outcomes based on 16S assay results over a period of several months post-launch. Findings ONT 16S rRNA sequencing significantly impacted antibiotic treatment in 34.2% of cases, reducing patient stays and outperforming traditional methods by detecting additional bacterial organisms and identifying bacteria missed by reference labs. It provided species-level identification and confirmed non-infectious conditions in 5.4% of cases, aiding alternative treatment decisions. Its speed, cost-effectiveness, and minimal training requirements contributed to its successful integration into clinical practice. Interpretation The integration of ONT 16S sequencing into routine NHS diagnostics has significantly improved antimicrobial stewardship by offering a faster, more sensitive, and accurate bacterial identification method. Earlier use of this assay in cases where routine cultures are likely to fail could enhance patient outcomes further by enabling timely, targeted antibiotic therapies, reducing hospital stays, and curbing unnecessary antibiotic use.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158081

Latin American samples are significantly underrepresented in global cancer genomics studies, which directly affects patients in these regions as it is known that cancer risk and incidence may be influenced by ancestry and environmental exposures. To address this, here we characterise the genome and transcriptome of 128 acral melanoma tumours from 96 Mexican patients, a population notable because of its genetic admixture. Compared with other studies of melanoma, we found fewer frequent mutations in classical driver genes such as BRAF, NRAS or NF1. While most patients had predominantly Amerindian genetic ancestry, those with higher European ancestry had increased frequency of BRAF mutations and a lower number of structural variants. These BRAF-mutated tumours have a transcriptional profile similar to cutaneous non-volar melanocytes, suggesting that acral melanomas in these patients may arise from a distinct cell of origin compared to other tumours arising in these locations. KIT mutations were found in a subset of these tumours, and transcriptional profiling defined three expression clusters; these characteristics were associated with overall survival. We highlight novel low-frequency drivers, such as SPHKAP, which correlate with a distinct genomic profile and clinical characteristics. Our study enhances knowledge of this understudied disease and underscores the importance of including samples from diverse ancestries in cancer genomics studies.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158081

However, the behavior of relative proportion of emerging variants is an understudied field. We investigated the emerging behavior of dominant COVID-19 variants using nonlinear statistical methods and calculated the time to dominance of each variant. Method: We used a phenomenological approach to model national- and regional-level variant share data from the national genomic surveillance system provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the best model to describe the emergence of two recent dominant variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus: XBB.1.5 and JN.1. The proportions were modeled using logistic, Weibull, and generalized additive models. Model performance was evaluated using the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and the root mean square error (RMSE).  Findings: The Weibull model performed the worst out of all three approaches. The generalized additive model approach slightly outperformed the logistic model based on fit statistics, but lacked in interpretability compared to the logistic model. These models were then used to estimate the time elapsed from emergence to dominance in the infected population, denoted by the time to dominance (TTD). All three models yielded similar TTD estimates. The XBB.1.5 variant was found to dominate the population faster compared to the JN.1 variant, especially in HHS Region 2 (New York) where the XBB.1.5 was believed to emerge. This research expounds on how emerging viral strains transition to dominance, informing public health interventions against future emergent COVID-19 variants and other infectious diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158081

Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce neurovirulence through microglial activation in the brains of patients and experimentally inoculated animals, which are models representative for moderate to severe respiratory disease. Here, we aimed to investigate the neuroinvasive and neurovirulent potential of SARS-CoV-2 in intranasally inoculated ferrets, a model for subclinical to mild respiratory disease. The presence of viral RNA, histological lesions, virus-infected cells, and the number and surface area of microglia and astrocytes were investigated. Viral RNA was detected in various respiratory tissue samples by qPCR at 7 days post inoculation (dpi). Virus antigen was detected in the nasal turbinates of ferrets sacrificed at 7 dpi and was associated with inflammation. Viral RNA was detected in the brains of ferrets sacrificed 7 dpi, but in situ hybridization nor immunohistochemistry did not verify evidence of infection.  Histopathological analysis of the brains showed no evidence for an influx of inflammatory cells. Despite this, we observed an increased number of Alzheimer type II astrocytes in the hindbrains of SARS-CoV-2 inoculated ferrets. Additionally, we detected an increased microglial activation in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus, and a decrease in the astrocytic activation status in the white matter and hippocampus of SARS-CoV-2 inoculated ferrets. In conclusion, although showed that SARS-CoV-2 has limited neuroinvasive potential in this model for subclinical to mild respiratory disease, there is evidence for neurovirulent potential. This study highlights the value of this ferret model to study the neuropathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and reveals that a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect both microglia and astrocytes in different parts of the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

While local adaptation does not manifest in obvious morphological changes, population genomic studies can reveal cryptic diversity and provide insights into local adaptive processes. In this study, we investigated the biogeographic history and genomic diversity across the range of the zebra longwing butterfly Heliconius charithonia, a species with a widespread distribution in the Neotropics, but which is phenotypically homogenous across its range. We examined whole genome sequence data from 55 individuals from the eight described subspecies. We infer that there were at least two distinct colonization events of the Caribbean islands from the mainland. The second colonization wave occurred relatively recently, accounting for the genetic homogeneity observed across the species' range. Despite low divergence across most of the genome, two large non-recombining genomic regions showed deeply divergent haplotypes that correspond to chromosomal inversions. Phylogenetic analyses indicate ancient origins of these inversion polymorphisms, and there is no evidence that they were introgressed from another extant lineage of Heliconius. These ancient polymorphisms are likely maintained by heterogeneous selection across the landscape, with the inversion on chromosome 19 likely playing a role in local adaptation to cold and desiccation. Our findings underscore the importance of genomic analysis in uncovering hidden diversity and adaptation in phenotypically homogenous species and highlight the significant role of chromosomal inversions in driving local adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

Most of the current approaches involve the knockout of T cell receptor (TCR) subunits via genome editing for preventing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). However, clinical translation of these methods faces challenges due to manufacturing complexities and emerging safety concerns like unintended long deletions and chromosomal loss. In this study, we explored an alternative approach by engineering synthetic CD3 subunits containing an endoplasmic reticulum retention (ERR) signal to suppress TCR surface expression by disrupting its trafficking to the plasma membrane. We screened multiple CD3-ERR candidate designs to identify the construct with the highest efficacy in TCR downregulation. The selected candidate, CD3{zeta}-ERR, was further characterized, demonstrating its ability to minimize TCR-mediated activation and alloreactivity without affecting T cell phenotype, cell cycle and cytokine-induced expansion. Subsequent assays revealed that CD3{zeta}-ERR CD19 CAR T cells retained their CAR-mediated cytotoxic function against CD19+ malignant cells. This study presents an alternative approach for TCR downregulation that circumvents genome editing. By using a transgene compatible with conventional viral vector delivery, this approach holds promise for scalable clinical-grade manufacturing of allogeneic CAR T cell therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

A transdiagnostic factor for psychopathology is emotion regulation, which is influenced by sex hormones, such as estradiol (E2), across the menstrual cycle on the behavioral and neural level. Whether this is also the case in the antepartum period remains unknown. For the first time, behavioral and neural emotion regulation were investigated in healthy primiparous pregnant females with extremely high E2 levels during the second trimester (N = 15) using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm. Results were compared with naturally-cycling females with high E2 levels (after E2-administration, N = 16) and low E2 levels (early follicular phase, N = 16). Although pregnant females reported the lowest trait use of cognitive reappraisal, all females successfully regulated their emotions by applying cognitive reappraisal in the scanner. On the neural level, all females had increased activity in the left middle frontal gyrus during downregulation of negative emotions. Pregnant females showed no significant differences in functional connectivity (psychophysiological interaction, resting-state) related to emotion regulation compared to the nonpregnant group. However, group differences emerged for amygdala activation. In pregnant females, increased amygdala activity predicted reduced regulation success and was positively associated with depression scores. This first fMRI study during pregnancy indicates that depression scores are reflected in heightened amygdala activity already observable in the antepartum period. Thus, through its association with reduced regulation success, increased amygdala activity suggests a neural risk marker for peripartum mental health. Future research needs to investigate emotion regulation in pregnant and postpartum women to further understand pregnancy-related changes and associations of mood, emotional and neural functions. Eventually, this will allow enhanced identification, prevention, and treatment of peri- and postpartum mental ill-health.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158081

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

C_LI

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

The data come from thirteen whole genome measurement technologies: Illumina paired-end, Element standard and long insert, Ultima UG100, PacBio (HiFi and Onso), Oxford Nanopore (standard and ultra-long), Bionano Optical Mapping, Arima and Phase Genomics Hi-C, G-banded karyotyping, directional genomic hybridization, and BioSkryb Genomics single-cell ResolveDNA. Most tumor data is from a large homogenous batch of non-viable cells after 23 passages of the primary tumor cells, along with some data from different passages to enable an initial understanding of genomic instability. These data will be used by the GIAB Consortium to develop matched tumor-normal benchmarks for somatic variant detection. In addition, extensive data from two different normal tissues from the same individual can enable understanding of mosaicism. Long reads also contain methylation tags for epigenetic analyses. We expect these data to facilitate innovation for whole genome measurement technologies, de novo assembly of tumor and normal genomes, and bioinformatic tools to identify small and structural somatic mutations. This first-of-its-kind broadly consented open-access resource will facilitate further understanding of sequencing methods used for cancer biology.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158081

Previously published in 2019, 57 HCM-associated genes were curated providing the first systematic evaluation of gene-disease validity. Here we report work by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel (HCVD-GCEP) to reappraise the clinical validity of previously curated and new putative HCM genes.

MethodsThe ClinGen systematic gene curation framework was used to re-classify the gene-disease relationships for HCM and related syndromic entities involving left ventricular hypertrophy. Genes previously curated were included if their classification was not definitive, and if the time since curation was >2-3 years. New genes with literature assertions for HCM were included for initial evaluation. Existing genes were curated for new inheritance patterns where evidence existed. Curations were presented on twice monthly calls, with the HCVD-GCEP composed of 29 individuals from 21 institutions across 6 countries.

ResultsThirty-one genes were re-curated and an additional 5 new potential HCM-associated genes were curated. Among the re-curated genes, 17 (55%) genes changed classification: 1 limited and 4 disputed (from no known disease relationship), 9 disputed (from limited), and 3 definitive (from moderate). Among these, 3 (10%) genes had a clinically relevant upgrade, including TNNC1, a 9th sarcomere gene with definitive HCM association. With new evidence, two genes were curated for multiple inheritance patterns (TRIM63, disputed for autosomal dominant but moderate for autosomal recessive; ALPK3, strong for autosomal dominant and definitive for recessive). CSRP3 was curated for a semi-dominant mode of inheritance (definitive). Nine (29%) genes were downgraded to disputed, further discouraging clinical reporting of variants in these genes. Five genes recently reported to cause HCM were curated: RPS6KB1 and RBM20 (limited), KLHL24 and MT-TI (moderate), and FHOD3 (definitive).

ConclusionsWe report 29 genes with definitive, strong or moderate evidence of causation for HCM or isolated LVH, including sarcomere, sarcomere-associated and syndromic conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158081

Whether axolotls display epigenetic hallmarks of ageing remains unknown. Here, we probe the axolotl DNA methylome throughout lifespan and present its first epigenetic clocks. Both at tissue-specific or pan-tissue levels, the clocks are biphasic, capable of predicting age during early life but not for the rest of its lifespan. We show that axolotls exhibit evolutionarily conserved features of epigenetic ageing during early life, yet their methylome is remarkably stable across lifespan, including at Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) target sites, suggesting that this species deviates from known patterns of epigenetic ageing. Lastly, we uncover structure-specific rejuvenation events upon regeneration.

These price caps may reduce revenue for the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) that negotiate the actual price paid for medicines in the US. To offset the resulting pressure on their profit margins, it is possible that PBMs would, in turn, increase patients out-of-pocket costs for medicines with capped prices. The model presented here evaluates how such increased out-of-pocket costs for the anticoagulants Eliquis (apixaban) and Xarelto (rivaroxaban) could impact patients financially and clinically.

MethodsCopay distributions for all 2023 prescription fills for Eliquis and Xarelto managed by the three largest PBMs were used to approximate current copay costs. Increased out-of-pocket costs were modeled as a shift of all Eliquis and Xarelto prescriptions to the highest copay tier. The known linear relationship between copay costs and treatment abandonment was used to calculate the potential resulting increase in treatment abandonment. Known rates of morbidity and mortality due to abandoning anticoagulants were used to estimate resulting increases in morbidity and mortality.

ResultsIf the three largest PBMs all shifted costs onto patients by moving all Eliquis and Xarelto prescriptions to the highest formulary tier, Tier 6, patients copay amount would increase by $235 to $482 million for Eliquis and $105 to $206 million for Xarelto. Such an increase could lead to 169,000 to 228,000 patients abandoning Eliquis and 71,000 to 93,000 abandoning Xarelto. The resulting morbidity and mortality could include up to an additional 145,000 major cardiovascular events and up to 97,000 more deaths.

ConclusionThe Medicare Price Negotiation Program could impact patients negatively if it causes PBMs to increase patients out-of-pocket costs for medicines. Policymakers should closely monitor changes in overall affordability, including all patient out-of-pocket expenditures, for medications in the program. Preemptive measures to ensure that the most vulnerable citizens are not placed in precarious situations leading to poorer health outcomes should be considered.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158082

This study analyzed over 26,000 genomes and their associated metadata collected between January and October 2021 to explore the introduction and dispersal patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in Greater Houston, a major metropolitan area noted for its demographic diversity. We identified more than a thousand independent introduction events, resulting in clusters of varying sizes, with earlier clusters presenting larger sizes and posing greater control challenges. Characterization of the sources of these introductions showed that domestic origins were more significant than international ones. Further examination of locally circulating clusters across different subregions of Greater Houston revealed varied transmission dynamics. Notably, subregions that served as primary viral sources sustained the local epidemic effectively, evidenced by: (1) a smaller proportion of new cases driven by external viral importations, and (2) longer persistence times of circulating lineages. Overall, our high-resolution spatiotemporal reconstruction of the epidemic in Greater Houston enhances understanding of the heterogeneous transmission landscape, providing key insights into regional response strategies and public health planning.

Significance StatementThe growing recognition of genome sequencing as critical for outbreak response has led to a rapid increase in the availability of sequence data. In this context, we put forward an analytical workflow within the Bayesian phylodynamic framework to identify and trace imported SARS-CoV-2 clusters using large-scale genome datasets. By utilizing metrics such as the Source-Sink Score, Local Import Score, and Persistent Time, our approach characterizes transmission patterns in each subregion and elucidates transmission heterogeneity. As new variants continue to emerge, the insights provided by our analysis are crucial for addressing the challenges of current and future pandemics effectively.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158082

Fluorogenic RNA aptamers are excellent candidates for live monitoring of burden because their production is expected to impose a negligible load on transcription resources. Here we characterise the performance of a library of aptamers when expressed from different promoters in E. coli. We find that aptamer relative performance is dependent on the promoter and the strain, and that, contrary to expectation, aptamer expression impacts host fitness. By selecting two of the aptamers with brighter output and lower impact, we then design an intracellular biosensor able to report on the activation of the burden response in engineered cells.

We investigated whether a diverse refugee committee could utilize participatory methods to identify health priorities and a research agenda to address them.

MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study with focus groups of current and former refugees, asylum claimants and evacuees from a specialized refugee clinic over a year. We collected sociodemographic data using standardized instruments, then utilized a four-step nominal group technique process (idea generation, recording, discussion, and voting) to identify and rank participants health and research priorities. Participants ranked their top five priorities across three time periods: Pre-migration/early arrival (0-3 months), post-migration (3 months-2 years), and long-term health (>2 years). Participants created overarching priorities and corroborated findings via a member checking step.

FindingsTwenty-three participants (median age 35 years) attended one or more of five focus groups. Twenty-one completed sociodemographic surveys: 16/21 (76%) were women, representing 8 countries of origin. Participants identified ""more family physicians"" and ""improving health system navigation"" (11/60 votes each) as top health and research priorities respectively across all resettlement periods. Participants also prioritized pre-departure healthcare system orientation and improved post-arrival and long-term mental health services. Twelve participants completed the member checking process, affirming the results with minor clarifications.

InterpretationThis proof-of-concept study illustrates how refugees can use a rigorous consensus process without external influence to prioritize their healthcare needs, direct a health research agenda to address those needs, and co-produce research. These low-cost participatory methods should be replicated elsewhere.

Here, we discovered and characterized rare coding alleles contributing to genetic dyslipidemia, a principal risk for coronary artery disease, among over a million individuals combining three large contemporary genetic datasets (the Million Veteran Program, n = 634,535, UK Biobank, n = 431,178, and the All of Us Research Program, n = 92,304) totaling 1,158,017 multi-ancestral individuals. Unlike previous rare variant studies in lipids, this study included 238,243 individuals (20.6%) from non-European-like populations.

Testing 2,997,401 rare coding variants from diverse backgrounds, we identified 800 exome-wide significant associations across 209 genes including 176 predicted loss of function and 624 missense variants. Among these exome-wide associations, 130 associations were driven by non-European-like populations. Associated alleles are highly enriched in functional variant classes, showed significant additive and recessive associations, exhibited similar effects across populations, and resolved pathogenicity for variants enriched in African or South-Asian populations. Furthermore, we identified 5 lipid-related genes associated with coronary artery disease (RORC, CFAP65, GTF2E2, PLCB3, and ZNF117). Among them, RORC is a potentially novel therapeutic target through the down regulation of LDLC by its silencing.

Here we draw on drug checking results from around the United States to report a rapid shift in the illicit drug supply with important implications for public health. Bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl) sebacate, or ""BTMPS"" is a hindered amine light stabilizer with various industrial applications. Animal studies indicate multiple kinds of adverse health effects.

MethodsDrug samples collected by community-based drug checking programs in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, along with drug residue samples from other jurisdictions in California, Delaware, Maryland, and Washington, were submitted to the National Institute on Standards and Technology. Samples were qualitatively tested with Direct Analysis in Real Time mass spectrometry, with reflex to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) for confirmatory testing. Quantitation - percent by mass - was performed using LCMS. At both sites where drug samples were collected, participants were asked to respond to a survey that included questions about what the substance was sold as and any unexpected effects.

ResultsBetween June 1, 2024 and August 31, 2024, a total of 178 samples sold as fentanyl were tested. Of these, 43 (24%) contained BTMPS, with the proportion per month rising from 0% in June to more than a third in August. An additional 23 residue samples from sites doing residue testing contained BTMPS. Fentanyl samples with BTMPS also contained many other compounds, including local anesthetics and alpha-2 agonists. Average fentanyl purity was significantly lower in samples with BTMPS compared to samples without.

ConclusionsThe introduction of an industrial chemical to the illicit drug supply at this speed and scale is unprecedented and concerning. Further research is urgently needed to determine why it is present in the fentanyl supply and characterize effects on human health.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158082

Herein, our goal was to map specific mucin glycoforms in diseased tissue, enabling correlation of the tumor glycan profile with malignant features. To this end, we developed a workflow implementing on-tissue digestion with mucinase StcE, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). To optimize our workflow, we analyzed four different mucinous carcinomas derived from colon, esophageal, and salivary gland tissue.

Using this technique, we deduced the spatial distribution of StcE-generated O-glycopeptides within mucinous tumors using MALDI-IMS. Subsequent LC-MS analyses revealed the identity of different species detected in imaging experiments, in addition to comprehensively characterizing the mucinome and proteome of each tissue. Our coupled MS approach unveiled a striking mucin 2 (MUC2) expression pattern in two colorectal mucinous adenocarcinomas, in which different glycoforms clearly stratified regions within the tumor. Notably, our LC-MS experiments obtained near-complete sequence coverage over the mucin domains of MUC2, enabling glycoproteomic mapping of this canonical mucin in unprecedented depth. MUC2 glycosylation was dominated by the T and Tn antigens, with surprisingly little sialylation detected. However, O-glycans containing mono- and di-O-acetylated sialic acid were detected in low abundance. Finally, we obtained spectral evidence for an endogenous O-acetylated GalNAc, an O-glycan structure not previously reported in the literature. Overall, this proof-of-concept work underscores the potential of this technique to generate new research avenues in oncology and beyond.

Significance StatementAberrant mucin expression and glycosylation are hallmarks of cancer, but how these changes promote malignant processes are not well understood. Solid tumors are highly heterogeneous in their cellular and molecular composition, and many advanced spatial techniques have emerged in recent years to study the tumor microenvironment (TME) for better understanding disease progression. Spatially resolved glycoprotein analyses typically detect either the protein or glycan components, but not both. We developed a workflow using a dual mass spectrometry approach to map the location of intact glycopeptides in mucinous tumors, enabled by on-tissue digestion with the mucin-specific protease StcE. Future applications of this method on larger patient cohorts will enhance our understanding of glycans in malignancy, identify disease biomarkers, and define therapeutic targets.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158082

Lesions damaging these neural pathways result in weakness of key muscles causing dysarthria and dysphagia, leading to profound social isolation and risk of aspiration and suffocation. Here we show that Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the motor thalamus improved speech and swallowing functions in two participants with dysarthria and dysphagia. First, we proved that DBS increased excitation of the face motor cortex, augmenting motor evoked potentials, and range and speed of motion of orofacial articulators in n=10 volunteers with intact neural pathways. Then, we demonstrated that this potentiation led to immediate improvement in swallowing functions in a patient with moderate dysphagia and profound dysarthria as a consequence of a traumatic brain lesion. In this subject and in another with mild dysarthria, we showed that DBS immediately ameliorated impairments of respiratory, phonatory, resonatory, and articulatory control thus resulting in a clinically significant improvement in speech intelligibility. Our data provide first-in-human evidence that DBS can be used to treat dysphagia and dysarthria in people with cerebral lesions.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158082

Previous research has demonstrated that targeting tissue senescence with senolytics can enhance tissue regeneration and repair by selectively eliminating SnCs in specific aged tissues. In this study, we focused on eliminating SnC skin cells in aged mice to assess the effects on subsequent wound healing. We applied ABT-263 directly to the skin of 24-month-old mice over a 5-day period. Following topical ABT-263, aged skin demonstrated decreased gene expression of senescent markers p16 and p21, accompanied by reductions in SA-{beta}-gal and p21-positive cells compared to DMSO controls. However, ABT-263 also triggered a temporary inflammatory response and macrophage infiltration in the skin. Bulk RNA sequencing of ABT-263-treated skin revealed prompt upregulation of genes associated with wound healing pathways, including hemostasis, inflammation, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, collagen synthesis, and extracellular matrix organization. Aged mice skin pre-treated with topical ABT-263 exhibited accelerated wound closure. In conclusion, topical ABT-263 effectively reduced several senescence markers in aged skin, thereby priming the skin for improved subsequent wound healing. This enhancement may be attributed to ABT-263-induced senolysis which in turn stimulates the expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and wound repair pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158082

While extensive research has examined the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on various surfaces, there is limited understanding of how efficiently it transfers to human skin, and how long it survives on the skin. This study investigates two key aspects of SARS-CoV-2 transmission: (1) the transfer efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 from non-porous (plastic and metal) and porous (cardboard) surfaces to a 3D human skin model (LabSkin), and (2) the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on the skin under different temperature conditions. First, we validated LabSkin as a suitable surrogate for human skin by comparing the transfer efficiency of the bacteriophage Phi 6 from surfaces to LabSkin and to human volunteers fingers. No significant differences were observed, confirming LabSkins suitability for these studies. Subsequently, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces to LabSkin was assessed, showing that plastic and metal surfaces had similar transfer efficiencies ([~]13%), while no transfer occurred from cardboard once the inoculum had dried on the surface. Finally, the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on skin was assessed, showing a rapid decay at higher temperatures, with a half-life ranging from 2.8 to 17.8 hours depending on the temperature. These findings enhance our understanding of viral transmission via fomites and inform public health strategies to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through surface contact.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158082

Limited research exists on the impact of School Distress on the parents/carers supporting these CYP. Using a case-control, concurrent embedded mixed-method design, we explored this lived experience. 947 parents of CYP with School Distress completed a bespoke online questionnaire, alongside two control parent groups (n=149, n=25) and one professional group (n=19).

Findings revealed a devastating impact on the mental health of parents, with parents displaying significantly heightened daily anxiety and significantly lower mood during, but not before, their childrens school attendance difficulties. In addition, parents with children experiencing School Distress reported significantly more negative emotion states and significantly fewer positive emotion states. Parents also reported overwhelmingly negative treatment from professionals, including being disbelieved or blamed for their childrens difficulties, threatened with fines and court action, and disempowered by the actions of professionals surrounding their child. Significant, deleterious impacts were also evident across all aspects of their lives, including their careers, finances, and other children. Perhaps unsurprisingly, half of these parents reported developing a new mental health condition since their childs difficulties began, with the experience itself rated as the second most threatening potential life event, superseded only by the death of a first-degree relative (including a child or spouse). On the other hand, professionals working with CYP with School Distress did not experience these deleterious mental health or wider life consequences. Despite understanding how threatening the experience is for parents, they were often quick to blame parents for their childrens difficulties. Professionals, like parents, expressed frustration with the lack of help available for these CYP and their families.

This study highlights a bleak, adversarial, and lonely picture for parents of CYP struggling to attend school. More specifically, the findings depict a system rife with parental blame; a system that appears to isolate parents through hostile, threatening, and punitive actions. A wider lack of societal understanding of the experience of School Distress further compounds this dearth of support for parents, placing parental mental health in further peril.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158082

MethodsThis study included all rheumatology RCTs published from 2009 to 2023. The gender of authors was determined using forenames and countries of affiliation via the gender API service. The percentage of women in RCT publications and its association with potential factors was assessed using generalized estimating equations, considering women gender as the main binary outcome and the RCTs continent, international collaboration status, industrial funding, intervention type, sample size, journal adherence to ICMJE recommendations, impact factor, publication year, authors non-academic affiliation, and author position as covariates.

ResultsAmong the 1,092 RCTs authored by 10,794 persons, women accounted for 34.1% of authors. Woman authorship was more frequent in African-based RCTs compared to North America, when the author had a non-academic affiliation and when the last author was a woman (1.83 [1.46, 2.29], +6.1 percentage points - pp). Woman authorship was less frequent in Asian and European-based RCTs, industry-funded RCTs (OR 0.64 [0.56-0.73]; -10.3pp). Women were less often in the last (0.63 [0.54-0.74]; -10.2 pp) and second to last author position (0.73 [0.62-0.85]; -7.3pp). There were no difference looking at international status or year of publication.

ConclusionThe overall presence of women authors was 34.1%. The stagnant year-over-year representation of women in RCTs, and the lower likelihood of a woman having a position as senior author, underscores the need for more effective strategies to bridge the gender gap. RCTs with a woman last author were more likely to have a woman first author, suggesting a potential role-model effect.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158082

ME diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME patients low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158082

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1727302158082

""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha).

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1727302158082
