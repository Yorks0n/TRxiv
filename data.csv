Despite its potential, LSFM has fragmented into multiple variants, each narrowly optimized for specific samples or imaging regimes, limiting its broad applicability. To overcome this barrier, we introduce the multi-immersion oblique plane microscope (miOPM), an adaptable LSFM platform for high-resolution imaging ranging from subcellular dynamics to whole organisms and cleared tissues. miOPM uniquely supports seamless interchangeability of oil, water, and air objectives, and maintains diffraction limited performance across a refractive index range of 1.33 - 1.51. It is compatible with standard sample mounting, current clearing protocols and high-throughput 3D imaging. We leverage miOPM to image diverse biological specimens at multiple spatial scales. By greatly expanding the adaptability and ease of use of LSFM, miOPM is poised to democratize advanced three-dimensional imaging.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM133522;R35GM119768;R35GM137894;RM1GM145399;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00372qc85"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01EB035538;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U54CA268072;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2MH119423;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

We have recently shown that mesothelin-targeting CAR T cells co-transduced with cytokine-binding synthetic velocity receptors (VRs, referred to as CAR TV cells) demonstrate increased motility, improved infiltration in solid primary tumors, and lead to a better anti-tumor effect compared to CAR T cells that do not express VRs. However, it is metastasis that causes the vast majority of cancer related deaths and is difficult to target clinically, indicating an urgent unmet need. We show that these CAR T cells engineered to be hyper-migratory using VRs are highly effective against liver metastasis of ovarian cancer along different stages of the metastatic cascade. Mesothelin-targeting CAR TV cells expressing synthetic or native receptors responsive to the cytokine Interleukin-5 improved the survival of mice bearing an extremely high or  terminal level of metastatic burden compared to CAR T cells that did not express VRs. Against newly established metastatic lesions and lesions undergoing metastatic outgrowth, CAR TV cells showed a robust anti-cancer effect resulting in an improved prognosis compared to control CAR T cells. Histopathological assessments showed a substantial reduction of metastasis number and lesion size with CAR TV treatment, concomitant with increased immune cell infiltration in the metastatic regions. Our work demonstrates the efficacy of high-motility CAR T cells in a metastatic setting and extends their scope to the treatment of metastasis of solid tumors.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U54CA143868;U54AR081774;U54CA268083;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U01AG060903;P30CA006973;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Here, we report the first evidence for a GPCR defining tuning properties of insect olfactory sensory neurons. Single-cell transcriptomics of the Drosophila melanogaster antenna identified selective expression of the G{gamma}30A subunit in acid-sensing Ir64a-DC4 neurons. G{gamma}30A is essential for broadening responses to long-chain acids, acting with Gs, G{beta}13F, adenylate cyclase Ac13E and the Cngl channel. We further discovered that Cirl, a latrophilin-family GPCR, is broadly-transcribed in the antenna but the protein is localized only in Ir64a-DC4 sensory cilia, dependent upon G{gamma}30A, but not Ir64a. Importantly, loss of Cirl also narrows Ir64a-DC4 tuning properties. Homologous neurons in Drosophila sechellia naturally exhibit narrow acid tuning, despite functional conservation of Ir64a; these differences correlate instead with lower expression of metabotropic components. Our findings reveal unexpected roles for GPCR/metabotropic signaling in olfactory detection and divergence in insects.","[{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization Long-Term Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 454-2019;""},{""name"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Actions Individual Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""836783;""},{""name"":""Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science Overseas Research Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""202360258;""},{""name"":""National Research Foundation of Korea"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013aysd81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RS-2023-00211007;""},{""name"":""ERC Advanced Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""833548;""},{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_219185;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Because of their intracellular nature, the establishment of these interactions requires tight regulation by the host plants. In particular, three genes - SYMRK, CCaMK and CYCLOPS - form the core of an ancestral common symbiosis pathway (CSP) for intracellular symbioses, and are conserved since the most recent common ancestor of land plants (Radhakrishnan et al. 2020; Delaux et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2010; Parniske 2008). Here, we describe EPP1 as a fourth gene committed to the CSP. Among land plants, EPP1 is conserved only in species able to associate with at least one type of intracellular symbiont. We found that loss-of-function epp1 mutants or EPP1 knock-down lines in four clades of land plants - legumes, Solanaceae, monocots and bryophytes - are all impaired in their ability to associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We discovered that the plasma membrane-localized receptor-like SYMRK phosphorylates EPP1 on a conserved serine residue and that this phosphorylation is essential for symbiosis. Using a gain-of-function approach, we demonstrate that EPP1 is upstream of the nuclear kinase CCaMK. We propose that EPP1 is an ancestral component of the essential pathway that has regulated plant symbiosis for half a billion years.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-10-LABX-41;ANR-18-EURE-0019;""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OPP1172165;""},{""name"":""Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office"",""id"":""https://ror.org/037wke960"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OPP1172165;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001675;""},{""name"":""European Union's Horizon 2020"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101105838;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Energy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01bj3aw27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""#DE-SC0018247;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Agriculture"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01na82s61"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""#WIS05052;""},{""name"":""Secretaría de Ciencia, Humanidades, Tecnología e Innovación"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CBF-2025-I-12;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

A central unresolved question, however, is whether lipidomic signatures identified in accessible peripheral biofluids faithfully recapitulate the pathogenic alterations within the central nervous system (CNS). This gap impedes the development of reliable biomarkers and constrains a comprehensive understanding of PD pathophysiology. To address this challenge, we employed a cross-species lipidomic approach. We modeled PD in both male and female mice by injecting human -synuclein preformed fibrils into the substantia nigra. Three months post-injection, lipidomic profiles of the midbrain and plasma were generated and compared. These findings were further validated in plasma from male and female PD patients and age-matched controls, enabling the identification of conserved alterations. We identified shared dysregulation of sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, and fatty acids in the brains and plasma of diseased mice as well as in plasma from PD patients. Notably, lipids associated with lipid droplet biogenesis, including triacylglycerols and monoacylglycerols, were elevated in diseased mouse brains and patient plasma. These alterations coincided with a marked accumulation of lipid droplets in the mouse midbrain and were further corroborated by increased lipid droplet abundance in macrophages derived from PD patients. Interestingly, lipid droplet accumulation exhibited sex-specific patterns: male mice displayed greater microglial accumulation, whereas female mice showed enhanced neuronal deposition. Together, these findings demonstrate that peripheral lipidomic signatures reflect CNS pathology in PD, highlighting new opportunities for biomarker discovery and therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, sex-specific lipid droplet accumulation in innate immune cells and neurons implicates these pathways as mechanistic contributors to PD and underscores the necessity of sex-stratified strategies in biomarker discovery and disease modeling.","[{""name"":""Cure Parkinson's Trust"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PT01;""},{""name"":""Parkinson's Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mx85j86"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PF-IMP-1437213;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04reqzt68"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IA/E/17/1/503664;""},{""name"":""Science and Engineering Research Board"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03ffdsr55"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SRG/2021/000981;""},{""name"":""Indian Council of Medical Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0492wrx28"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5/4-5/3/43/Neuro/2022-NCD-1;5/4-5Adhoc/Neuro/217/2020-NCD-1;""},{""name"":""SwarnaJayanti Fellowship, SERB"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SB/SJF/2021-22/01;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Intracellular Ca2+ signaling mediates a variety of macrophage functions. While diverse, ontogeny, transcriptional profiles, and phenotypes of meningeal macrophages have been described, little is known about their spatiotemporal Ca2+ signal dynamics in healthy and diseased states. We used two-photon Ca2+ imaging in a novel reporter mouse line, combined with an event-based signaling analysis pipeline, to comprehensively characterize the Ca2+ activity of meningeal macrophages both at steady state and in response to cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) - a pathophysiological brain hyperexcitability event, implicated in migraine, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. In homeostatic meninges of behaving mice, perivascular macrophages exhibit several Ca2+ activity features, including event duration and signal frequency spectrum, distinct from those of interstitial non-perivascular macrophages. The Ca2+ activity of dural perivascular macrophages is uniquely coupled to behaviorally driven diameter fluctuation of their associated vessels. Most perivascular and non-perivascular meningeal macrophages display propagating intracellular Ca2+ activity. Both macrophage subtypes also exhibit synchronized intercellular Ca2+ elevations, likely driven by an external factor. In response to CSD, the majority of perivascular and non-perivascular meningeal macrophages show a persistent decrease in their Ca2+ activity. Smaller subsets of both macrophage subtypes display either acute or persistent increases in Ca2+ activity, with the latter response mediated by CGRP/RAMP1 signaling. Collectively, our results highlight a previously unknown diversity of meningeal macrophage Ca2+ signaling at steady-state and in response to an aberrant brain hyperexcitability event.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R21NS130561;R01NS115972;R01NS133625;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

In this work, we develop a mechanistic within-host model, formulated in a system of coupled ordinary and delayed differential equations, to investigate the contributions of NK cell activity, interferon signaling, and pro-inflammatory cytokines to viral clearance and disease outcome. Model parameters are estimated from experimental data, and computational simulations are used to explore how dysregulated NK responses and cytokine feedback loops may drive divergent clinical outcomes. Local sensitivity analysis identifies the most influential parameters shaping host-pathogen dynamics, highlighting potential control points for intervention. In addition, knockdown simulations are performed to mimic potential therapeutic interventions, allowing us to evaluate their advantages and limitations in silico.

A crucial step in the development of computational tools for the objective and quantitative analysis of tissue sections has been color deconvolution. Color deconvolution functions by separating the absorption of colors corresponding to stained molecular or tissue compartments. The most widely used color deconvolution method in digital pathology, linear color deconvolution as described in Ruifrok 2001 et al., decomposes color images according to the absorbance values for individual stains. However, linear color deconvolution assumes that stains are linearly decomposable, and it relies heavily upon identifying optimal color vectors of stains, which is often challenging. Furthermore, linear deconvolution methods cannot deconvolve the image with more than three stains, further limiting their broader applicability. To combat the limitations of previous methods, we developed an intuitive and robust color deconvolution method that effectively and accurately separates more than three stain signals, does not rely on predetermined color vectors, and does not rely on identifying optimal stain vectors. The proposed method, NLTD 2.0, presents a robust and efficient solution to tackle color variations in histopathology images, enhancing the reliability and precision of computational pathology. Additionally, incorporating the method as an ImageJ plugin amplifies accessibility and usability, enabling researchers and pathologists to leverage its capabilities without specialized programming skills. The intuitive interface streamlines the application, fostering broader acceptance within the computational pathology community.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3CA275681;UH3CA275681;U54CA268083;R01CA300052;""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM157099;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

During heat shock, misfolded proteins accumulate in its granular component (GC), but whether this is passive or regulated has been unclear. We show that the ubiquitin ligase CHIP remodels the nucleolus into a reversible protein quality control (PQC) compartment by diverting HSP70 from refolding toward sequestration and transiently suppressing rRNA synthesis. This process requires the segregase VCP, which mediates ubiquitinated substrate flux and couples nucleolar PQC with nuclear and ER stress responses.

While plant cell-surface receptors initiate this process, the link between receptors and cytoplasmic signaling components remains unclear. Here we identify Early Phosphorylated Protein 1 (EPP1) as a central mediator of this pathway. EPP1 is recruited to the activated SYMRK receptor, where it is phosphorylated on a key serine residue, an event essential and sufficient to propagate symbiotic signaling. We provide structural and functional validation of the SYMRK-EPP1 signaling complex and demonstrate that EPP1 is required for root nodule formation. Synthetic engineering of the SYMRK-EPP1 interaction bypasses the need for symbiotic bacteria to initiate the pathway and triggers nodule organogenesis. These findings establish EPP1 as a crucial cytoplasmic component between receptor activation and intracellular signaling, advancing our understanding of nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Furthermore, it facilitates the inference of ion channel parameters from the responses to standard protocols.

While numerous studies have explored functions for the GlialCAM IgG-like domains in brain development and physiology, functions for its cytoplasmic signaling tail remain largely unknown. Therefore, we developed a mutant mouse model that expresses a truncated GlialCAM construct (GlialCAM -CT) that contains intact extracellular and transmembrane domains but lacks the cytoplasmic tail. Deletion of the GlialCAM cytoplasmic domain in glial cells of the brain results in vacuolization within white matter regions without disrupting neurovascular barrier integrity. Consequently, mutant mice exhibited selective deficits in motor coordination, muscular strength, and memory. Single cell transcriptome sequencing identifies GlialCAM-dependent defects in ECM remodeling pathways in white matter tracts. In situ spatial profiling revealed robust activation of astrocytes and microglia in the mutant brain. Proteomic analysis identified GlialCAM cytoplasmic tail interactors with links to MAPK signaling and cytoskeletal regulatory networks. These data reveal important functions for the GlialCAM cytoplasmic tail in homeostasis of white matter tracts in the adult murine brain. The GlialCAM -CT model may also be useful for studying the pathogenesis and possible treatment of neurological diseases linked to white matter degeneration.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01NS087635;R01NS122052;R01NS122143;""},{""name"":""Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0003xa228"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RP230093;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Methods for experimentally improving designed proteins and exploring their sequence-affinity landscapes could therefore streamline the development of high-affinity binders and inform future design strategies. Here, we use OrthoRep, a system for continuous hypermutation in vivo, to drive the evolution of computationally designed mini protein binders (""minibinders"") that target a mammalian receptor. Despite their small sizes (59-72 amino acids), we successfully affinity matured multiple minibinders through strong selection for improved binding and also sampled new regions of minibinder fitness landscapes through extensive neutral drift. One evolved minibinder variant was used to construct a combinatorially complete sequence-affinity map for its six affinity increasing mutations, which revealed nearly full additivity in their contributions to binding. Another minibinder was subjected to both deep mutational scanning and extensive evolution under weak selection, resulting in an evolutionarily diverged collection of binder sequences that revealed non-additive relationships among mutations. Our results highlight that the affinity of computationally designed binders can be rapidly increased through evolution and provide a scalable approach for the evolutionary exploration and subsequent mapping of sequence-affinity landscapes. We suggest that this work will complement protein binder design both as a reliable experimental optimization process and as a vehicle for generating new training data.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

We found that the anterior-most INT1 cells are a translationally distinct intestinal sub-compartment that is particularly enriched for immune- and stress-response genes. Functional assays using novel INT1-specific genes emerging from this study reveal that these specialized cells play a previously unappreciated role in pathogen avoidance and organismal survival. A second critical function of INT1 cells is their role in sensing and responding to the contents of the gut lumen.

Here, we use hiPSC-derived neuronal networks containing both excitatory and inhibitory neurons to show that excessive bursting activity in DS cultures is driven by excitatory neurons. This rise in bursting frequency is caused by the increased expression of HCN1 pacemaker channels in excitatory neurons, and bursting activity can be normalised using a channel blocker.

To compute these weights, we developed a novel convex optimization algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Moments. By using model performance metrics as the generalized moment functions in our GMM optimization, our algorithm also provides theoretical guarantees that the mixture weights are an optimal approximation of the importance weights that underlie domain adaptation theory. When tested on a large-scale brain decoding dataset (n=105 subjects), our new mixture model weighting framework achieved state-of-the-art performance--increasing accuracy up to 2.5% over baseline fine-tuning, double the performance gain compared to previous research in supervised source selection. Notably, these improvements were achieved using significantly less training data (i.e., 62% smaller effective sample sizes), suggesting that our performance gains stem from reduced negative transfer.

Despite their young age (<6 million years), HSD genes exhibit widespread regulatory divergence, with paralog-specific expression patterns documented across a variety of tissues and cell types. Using long-read expression and epigenomic data, we show that human-specific paralogs tend to have lower activity than the shared, ancestral ones. To systematically characterize the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) within HSDs and understand patterns of regulatory change in recently evolved gene families, we conducted a massively parallel reporter assay of 7,160 human duplicated and chimpanzee orthologous sequences in lymphoblastoid (GM12878) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell lines. A large proportion (14&ndash24%) of sequences exhibited differential activity relative to the chimpanzee ortholog (or between human paralogs), mostly with small fold-differences. Combining measured activity levels across all assayed sequences, predicted differences in cis-regulatory activity correlated with mRNA levels in SH-SY5Y. Differentially active CREs were validated for CHRFAM7A, HYDIN2, and SRGAP2C that may contribute to paralog-specific expression patterns and thereby to human-specific traits. While we find some changes in CRE activity shared between duplicate paralogs likely driving regulatory divergence in gene expression, consideration of non-shared adjacent sequences to duplications suggests a larger role for altered genome positional effects. In all, this work suggests that functional divergence of duplicated CREs contributes moderately to regulatory divergence of HSD genes and uncovers enhancers that are candidate drivers of human-specific regulatory patterns.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

In this paper we develop a spiking network that consists of populations of E, I and an additional interneuron type, the somatostatin (S) internerons that receive excitation from the E cells and inhibit both the E cells and the I cells. These S cells are modulated by a third inhibitory subtype, VIP neurons that receive inputs from other cortical areas. We reduce the spiking network to a system of nine differential equations that characterize the mean voltage, firing rate, and synaptic conductance for each population and using this we find many instances of multiple rhythms within the network.

Existing gene annotation pipelines often require complex installations, multiple steps, long runtimes, and produce variable results, which impede quality and the downstream usage of the annotations. We developed RAGNAROK (RApid GeNe Annotation ROcKs), a modular annotation pipeline built on Nextflow and Apptainer that integrates ab initio prediction, transcriptome and protein evidence, repeat annotation, functional assignment, and quality assessment into a single reproducible workflow. Moreover, RAGNAROK utilizes GPU acceleration and parallelization to produce high-quality gene annotations. We benchmarked against BRAKER3 across five diverse, reference-quality plant genomes and demonstrated that RAGNAROK achieved higher sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores at the exon, transcript, and gene levels. Furthermore, we demonstrated RAGNAROK's improvement in re-annotating a suite of five Rosaceae genomes that were previously annotated using MAKER. Overall, RAGNAROK produced more ideal mono:multi-exonic gene ratios, improved BUSCO completeness scores, and reduced missing gene content compared to other pipelines. Additionally, RAGNAROK consistently outperformed BRAKER3 in runtime, scaling efficiently from small to gigabase-scale genomes. RAGNAROK provides a flexible, rapid, scalable, and accurate solution for de novo and re-annotation of plant genomes. Its modular design and workflow scalability lay the foundation for future extensions to animal, fungal, and other eukaryotic genomes.

Recently, it was shown that some DNA lesions generated by a pulse of damage-inducing mutagen persist over multiple rounds of replication. Segregation of DNA lesions in the early genealogy of an expanding clone leaves a statistically interpretable footprint of cancer initiating events. Specifically, it allows for estimating the number of cell divisions between the initiating DNA lesion and the most recent common ancestor of the tumor. Here, we analyze footprints of segregating lesions from a previously published experimental mouse system, as well as post-chemotherapy human metastatic tumors and the blood of chemotherapy treated patients. In all contexts, clones tend to start early, usually within the span of 4 cell generations from mutagen exposure. Using a branching process model, we show that fitness advantage of early cancer drivers exceeds 30%, with each early division leading to at least 1.3 self-renewing cells. We highlight an example of a blood-derived single cell phylogeny with major subclones separated by just two cell divisions. Broadly, our approach allows inference of tumor initiation and growth parameters based on events preceding the most recent common ancestor of the initiating clone as opposed to characteristics of fully grown tumors.","[{""name"":""NIH National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""NIH National Institute of Medical Sciences"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Although PGS models have been generated for many traits, they are not broadly available for certain traits due to limited sample sizes in studies of infrequent outcomes. Often, prediction of these not well-studied traits (e.g., treatment/drug responses) would be of great clinical utility and have been underutilized due to statistical power limitations. To support more versatile trait prediction, we present a method of developing PGS models that can be used in studies of any size with genome-wide SNP data. Method: We first generate thousands of PGSs for each study participant in a given data set using their genome-wide SNP data and public resources. A PGS-wide scan involves evaluating the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of prediction for a binary trait (or the R-squared of association for a quantitative trait) at each PGS. We present two methods for the PGS model development, SECRET-Best, which selects the most predictive PGS from the PGS scan for prediction, and SECRET-WTSUM, which considers a combined score from multiple correlation-pruned PGSs. This algorithm is scalable and implemented in a user-friendly software tool, SECRET (Screen and Evaluate Catalogued Risk scores to Enhance Trait predictions). Results: We applied SECRET to a binary outcome (type 1 diabetes [T1D]) and a dataset of 2,100 samples, each with 12 laboratory test-related continuous traits. For nine traits with existing PGSs available in the PGS catalog, eight of the traits were predicted correctly, with the same trait-related PGS identified as the top predictor. We showed that the existing PGS methods had rather limited power to predict trait values in a validation set when only 1,500 samples were used to develop a PGS model, while the SECRET methods were able to maintain the prediction power for under-powered GWAS studies even when the sample size of the study was in hundreds. Conclusion: The SECRET methods and tool provide a valuable resource for studies with genomic data but of limited sample sizes. This approach enables systematic development and evaluation of PGS models.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Initial in vitro characterization, including structural analysis, demonstrated robust antigen expression and intact antigenic features. Immunogenicity of both vaccines were evaluated in murine models following immunization as either a primary series in naive animals or as a booster dose.

We find that nucleosome retention is probabilistic, with no locus universally occupied. Although promoters of spermatogenic genes preferentially harbor retained nucleosomes, the predominant carrier of paternal epigenetic information is protamine lacunae, accessible discontinuities in the protamine coat that preferentially mark critical regulatory elements. By contrast, centromere kinetochore binding regions robustly retain CENP-A mono-nucleosomes, providing a mechanism for the focal transmission of paternal centromeres. Finally, we find that paternal chromatin repackaging is altered in low-motility sperm.

Critically, simple vividness ratings can replace the protracted questionnaires commonly used for this purpose and reduce methodological issues with these instruments. We further find that vividness is closely linked with the experience of ""seeing"" mental images or projecting them into the external world. People who report seeing mental images with their eyes shut are also more likely to experience externally projected imagery.

Yet, the mechanisms by which lipid imbalances are sensed and corrected to establish and maintain homeostasis are, in most cases, unknown. Here we present an expanded view of plasma membrane (PM) phosphoinositide metabolism by revealing an unexpected metabolic connection between two key anionic lipids in this membrane, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and phosphatidic acid (PA). PM pools of PI4P are generated by PI 4-kinase Type III (PI4KIII/PI4KA), an essential enzyme whose partial dysfunction leads to numerous hereditary human diseases. We find that depletion of PI4P by pharmacological inhibition of PI4KA increases the activity of phospholipase Ds (PLDs) and the levels of their lipid product, PA, in the PM. Guided by RNA-seq analysis and proximity labeling proteomics, we elucidate how cells connect this PI4P decrease to a compensatory increase in PA levels. Loss of PM PI4P induces a concomitant decrease of phosphatidylserine (PS) levels, and this metabolic rewiring activates a reciprocal relationship between PS synthesis and PLD-mediated PA generation. These metabolic changes also lead to transcriptional and translational upregulation of the small GTPase RhoB, which enhances PLD-mediated PA synthesis and subsequent actin cytoskeletal remodeling. Our study reveals how disease-relevant perturbation of phosphoinositide synthesis induces an integrated response that ultimately boosts levels of PA, a key anionic lipid and metabolic intermediate in phosphoinositide resynthesis.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM151682;DP1GM142101;Intramural Research Program;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are central to cellular signalling and represent one of the largest classes of therapeutic targets, yet their functional modulation remains challenging. Here, we present RareFoldGPCR (RFG), a GPCR-specialised AI model for structure prediction and design that supports NCAAs. By applying transfer learning on high-resolution GPCR structures, RFG accurately models and rationally designs both linear and cyclic peptides that incorporate NCAAs and modulate GPCR activity. This is achieved without the model ever being trained on NCAA-based GPCR modulators. We showcase the capability of RFG by designing peptide agonists for the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) and validating their functional activity experimentally in cell-based assays. We investigate the precise capabilities of generating active agonists by expanding different regions of the native GLP-1 hormone, and further demonstrate the design of cyclic peptide agonists with entirely novel sequences and topologies, creating new agonist modes. We analyse how design metrics relate to pathway specificity, enabling precise modulation of pathway activity, such as activating the cAMP response without recruiting {beta}-arrestin to reduce receptor desensitisation. RFG shows how transfer learning on specific target classes enables generalisation to new chemistry and molecular topology, providing a broadly applicable strategy for designing functional ligands beyond the constraints of natural amino acid chemistry.

Behavioral Time-Scale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP), identified in vivo, holds a great potential for explaining instantaneous hippocampal selectivity emergence by long-term potentiation (LTP), yet the cellular and endogenous mechanisms are unknown, impeding broader conceptualization of this novel rule for its algorithmic, systems-level and theoretical implications. Here, we addressed this gap by in-vivo, ex-vivo, in-silico and computational approaches to seek neurophysiologically inspired protocols for synaptically evoking Ca2+ plateau potentials and inducing potentiation in the CA1. We found induction of BTSP-LTP is best explained by a theta-oscillation-paced, gradually developed cellular state being supported with precisely timed weak ramping inputs. Remarkably, the previously presumed one-shot LTP for in-vivo place-field formation is possible under the influence of muscarinic activation. Through modeling, the notion of acetylcholine-gated BTSP gave rise to a computational advantage for low-interference continual learning. We further demonstrated that biophysics of Transient Receptor Potential (TRPM) and NMDA receptor (NMDAR) channels powerfully shapes the cross-theta dynamics underlying BTSP. These results which cover pre-, post-synaptic and neuromodulatory factors and their timing suggest fundamental principles for graded plateau potentials and hippocampal LTP induction. Overall, our work dissects cellular mechanisms potentially important for a prominent in-vivo hippocampal plasticity phenomenon, and offers a biological basis for framing BTSP as an input-dynamics-aware, neuromodulation-tuned synaptic algorithm.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Compared with their male peers, female faculty members tend to produce fewer publications per year (even after controlling for career stage and university ranking), to publish in lower-impact factor journals, and to be less cited (even after controlling for career length, career stage, number of publications, average impact factor of the journals in which they publish, and university ranking). Despite their lower publication and citation rates, female faculty members in our dataset require the same amount of time to attain the rank of Professor as their male peers.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Better understanding of how this immunosurveillance operates could improve the treatment of neurological diseases. Here, using a novel genetically engineered mouse model of ZFTA-RELA ependymoma4-a childhood brain tumour-we characterised an immune circuit between the tumour and antigen presenting, haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the skull bone marrow. The presentation of antigens in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by HSPCs to CD4+ T cells, biased HSPC lineages toward myelopoiesis and polarised CD4+ T-cells to regulatory T cells (T- regs), culminating in tumour immunotolerance. Remarkably, a single infusion of antibodies directed against cytokines enriched in the CSF of mice bearing ZFTA-RELA ependymomas, choroid plexus carcinomas or Group-3 medulloblastoma-all aggressive childhood brain tumours-disrupted this process and caused profound tumour regression. These data unmask a mechanism by which skull bone marrow-derived HSPCs and CD4+ T cells cooperate to promote the immunotolerance of childhood brain tumours. Antibodies that disrupt this immunosurveillance could prove an effective therapy for these cancers that are less toxic than current treatments.","[{""name"":""Little Princess Trust"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""G128077;""},{""name"":""Brain Tumour Charity"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01k33dw46"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""G128417;""},{""name"":""Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ybzg123"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""G122225;G101107;""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""G118695;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Processes that govern species-specific aspects of human postnatal brain development are difficult to study in animal models. While human brain organoids offer a promising in vitro model, they have thus far been shown to largely mimic early stages of brain development. Here, we developed human brain organoids for an unprecedented 5 years in culture, optimizing growth conditions able to extend excitatory neuron viability beyond previously-known limits. Using module scores of maturation-associated genes derived from a time course of endogenous human brain maturation, we show that brain organoids transcriptionally age with cell type-specificity through these many years in culture. Whole-genome methylation profiling reveals that the predicted epigenomic age of organoids sampled between 3 months and 5 years correlates precisely with time spent in vitro, and parallels epigenomic aging in vivo. Notably, we show that in chimeric organoids generated by mixing neural progenitors derived from ""old"" organoids with progenitors from ""young"" organoids, old progenitors rapidly produce late neuronal fates, skipping the production of earlier neuronal progeny that are instead produced by their young counterparts in the same co-cultures. The data indicate that human brain organoids can mature and record the passage of time over many years in culture. Progenitors that age in organoids retain a memory of the time spent in culture reflected in their ability to execute age-appropriate, late developmental programs.","[{""name"":""Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01tm9b530"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Klarman Cell Observatory"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Some alterations correlated more closely with specific mutations (e.g., SF3B1, TP53) than clinical risk scores (IPSS-M).

While therapeutics have been developed to exploit these pH changes to modulate activity across different physiological environments, current approaches for generating pH-dependent binders, such as combinatorial histidine scanning and display-based selections, are largely empirical and often labor-intensive. Here we describe two complementary principles and associated computational methods for designing pH-dependent binders: (i) introducing histidine residues adjacent to positively charged residues at binder-target interfaces to induce electrostatic repulsion and weaken binding at low pH, and (ii) introducing buried histidine-containing charged hydrogen-bonding networks in the binder core such that the protein is destabilized under acidic conditions. Using these methods, we designed binders that dissociate at acidic pH against ephrin type-A receptor 2, tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, interleukin-6, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, and the interleukin-2 mimic Neo2. Fusions of the designs to pH-independent binders of lysosomal trafficking receptors function as catalytic degraders, inducing target degradation at substoichiometric levels.

Giraffe was fast and accurate for mapping short reads to human-scale pangenomes, but struggled with long reads. Long reads present a unique challenge to pangenome mapping algorithms due to their length and error profile, which allow them to take more topologically complex paths through the pangenome graph and increase the possible search space for the algorithm. We present updates to Giraffe that allow it to quickly and accurately map long reads to pangenome graphs. For both short and long reads, Giraffe mapping to a pangenome containing data from more than 450 human haplotypes, generated by the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, is comparable in speed to linear mappers to human reference genomes; Giraffe is also over an order of magnitude faster than GraphAligner, the current state-of-the-art long-read-to-pangenome mapper. Its alignments produce similar or improved small and structural variant calling results, compared to those from commonly used graph-based and linear mappers.

This coordination is inherently challenging for the brain. Effective coordination of multiple joints relies on intact feedforward control to predict movement dynamics in the initial phase of the movement, and on feedback control to fine-tune the execution in the final phase. However, the effect of aging on these specific control mechanisms remains controversial. In our experiment we investigated a pure elbow motion task using the KINARM exoskeleton. A group of 50 young (20-35 years old), 80 old (55-70 years old) and 30 older-old (80+ years old) healthy participants were recruited. Each participant performed 30deg elbow rotations while stabilizing the shoulder joint. Movements were directed toward two distinct targets in both flexion and extension directions. The task was performed under two controlled speed conditions to maximally challenge the motor system, as higher elbow velocities increase interaction torques at the shoulder, demanding greater neuromuscular effort for stabilization. The timing and magnitude of anticipatory EMG activity of the agonist shoulder muscle, necessary to counteract interaction torques, were preserved across all age groups. Moreover, increasing elbow velocity did not result in any performance differences between young and older old adults, indicating that shoulder stabilization during movement initiation remained intact with age. However, older adults exhibited reduced ability to stabilize the shoulder position until the end of the movement, leading to decreased reaching accuracy with older age. These results suggest that feedforward control, essential for movement planning, which is essential for shoulder stabilization during initiation, is preserved during healthy aging and remains resilient to increased motor demands, even in older old adults. In contrast, feedback control appears to deteriorate with age, potentially contributing to reduced movement precision in the final phase of the multi-joint movement.","[{""name"":""Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Vlaanderen (FWO)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""G095121N;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Although the nucleus is in mechanical equilibrium with the cell, we do not know whether and how chromatin reorganization actively regulates the mechanical properties and downstream behaviors of cells. Here, we tested the hypothesis that as a dynamic crosslinked polymer, chromatin directly impacts cell mechanics independently of transcription by studying NETosis: a transcription-independent process where chromatin decompacts and the plasma membrane (PM) ruptures. Using high resolution microscopy and ATAC-see, we found that chromatin accessibility progressively increases during NETosis suggesting that chromatin binding proteins (CBPs) dissociate from chromatin during NETosis. To determine the identity and dynamics of these dissociated CBPs, we used fluorescent recovery after photobleaching to measure the mobility and localization of the linker histone H1, the nucleosomal histone H3 and the heterochromatin binding protein HP1. We found that the mobile fraction of nuclear H1 increases during NETosis while fractions of HP1 and H3 diffuse outside of the nucleus suggesting that they become cytosolic osmolytes and potentially alter the mechanical state of cells. Consistently, we found that plasma membrane tension and cell volume increase as chromatin decompacts during NETosis. In non-NETing U2OS cells, we found that inducing chromatin decompaction increases plasma membrane tension, independently of the cytoskeleton, indicating a causal relationship between chromatin organization, cell volume and plasma membrane tension. Our findings reveal a novel non- genetic role of chromatin in cellular biophysics: regulating cell volume, PM tension, and thus, overall cell mechanics. Considering the critical role of cell mechanics in biological processes such as cell migration, proliferation and pathogen killing, our work broadens our understanding of how chromatin regulates cell physiology and pathology.

Significance StatementChromatin organizes our DNA inside the nucleus and is important for gene expression. However, chromatin is also a polymer which can passively regulate the rigidity of the nucleus, but whether and how chromatin can actively regulate the mechanical properties of the whole cell remains unknown. Here, we leverage the immune process of NETosis to show that the organization of chromatin inside the nucleus actively regulates the volume and tension of cells. Our work establishes chromatin as a long-range force generator in cells, broadening our understanding of the roles of this crucial polymer network in cells and opening the door to new strategies for controlling the mechanical properties of cells as needed by their physiology.","[{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Biohub San Francisco"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00knt4f32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""David and Lucile Packard Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/032atxq54"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Koret Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02efnsc68"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Stanford University"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00f54p054"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

The thalamus has long been divided into multiple discrete nuclei, based on cytoarchitecture, histochemical stains, and mesoscale connectivity. However, thalamic nuclei do not completely describe thalamic organization. For example, some boundaries between thalamic nuclei are disputed, whereas other nuclei are known to contain subdomains with distinct connectivity and function. Moreover, the correspondence between cellular gene expression and other properties of thalamic projection neurons remains to be established. Spatial analysis of single cell gene expression provides a basis for reevaluating thalamic organization. We present the THALMANAC, (THALamusMERFISH ANalysis and ACcess) a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable and Reproducible (FAIRR) resource for exploring and analyzing single-cell transcriptomic variation in the thalamus. The THALMANAC provides streamlined access to thalamic gene expression data registered to the common coordinate framework and tools for quantitative analysis and visualization of these data, all encapsulated in a reproducible, cloud computing platform. Using this resource, we find that gene expression generally supports the parcellation of thalamus into distinct nuclei. Some nuclei, such as the anteromedial nucleus, are additionally composed of discrete subdomains, while other nuclei share patterns of gene expression or are arrayed on a spatial gradient of gene expression. The THALMANAC establishes spatial transcriptomic data as a foundation for delineating thalamic organization.

Additionally, STAU2 regulates the expression of miRNA host genes and alters miRNA-mediated post- transcriptional control in progenitor cells, which exerts additional effects on STAU2 regulated gene regulatory networks. These changes result in neural progenitor exhaustion, unstructured neural rosettes, and reduced organoid size. Together, our work uncovers a previously unrecognized role for STAU2 as a central regulator of early human neurogenesis, acting through both miRNA-mediated and transcriptional pathways to coordinate progenitor maintenance and neuronal fate specification.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Here, we present chromosome-level genomes for the two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus) and the southern anteater (Tamandua tetradactyla), and investigate how retrotransposon-mediated gene duplications (retrocopies) have shaped xenarthran genome evolution. Comparative analyses revealed that xenarthran genomes harbor the highest number of retrocopies reported among mammals, with lineage-specific insertion dynamics. Anteater and armadillo genomes contain older LINE1 repertoires and species-specific older retrocopy insertions. In contrast, sloths retain both an abundance of young LINE1s and thousands of young retrocopies, alongside a large shared set that originated from an evolutionary burst of retroduplication in the branch leading to their last common ancestor ([~]30 Mya). In C. didactylus, approximately 50% of retrocopies are expressed, compared with 24% in Dasypus novemcinctus. Evolutionary analyses identified 38 retrocopies with strong hallmarks of domestication in C. didactylus. Many of these retrocopies derive from parental genes involved in mitochondrial and metabolic processes, suggesting a genomic mechanism underlying the physiological specialisations of sloths. Altogether, our findings identify retrotransposition as a major contributor to the genomic architecture of Xenarthra and highlight retrocopy origination as a mechanism for generating lineage-specific novelty and distinctive biological specialisations.","[{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020, Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""750747;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Grant 220540/Z/20/A, Wellcome Sanger Institute Quinquennial Review 2021–2026;""},{""name"":""São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) awarded to PAFG, HBC, and RLVM"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2018/15579-8;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Despite recent progress in de novo design of protein binders, there are no current methods for designing binders that recognize phosphorylated proteins and peptides; this is a challenging problem as phosphate groups are highly charged, and phosphorylation often occurs within unstructured regions. Here we introduce RoseTTAFold Diffusion 2 for Molecular Interfaces (RFD2-MI), a deep generative framework for the design of binders for protein, ligand, and covalently modified protein targets. We demonstrate the power and versatility of this method by designing binders for four critical phosphotyrosine sites on three clinically relevant targets: Cluster of Differentiation 3 (CD3{varepsilon}), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Insulin Receptor (INSR). Experimental characterization shows that the designs bind their phospho-tyrosine containing targets with affinities comparable to native binding sites and have negligible binding to non-phosphorylated targets or phosphopeptides with different sequences. X-ray crystal structures of generated binders to CD3{varepsilon} and EGFR are very close to the design models, demonstrating the accuracy of the design approach. RFD2-MI provides a generalizable all-atom diffusion framework for probing and modulating phosphorylation-dependent signaling, and more generally, for developing research tools and targeted therapeutics against post-translationally modified proteins.","[{""name"":""NIH NCI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1K99CA293001;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

In this work, we present mBER, an open-source protein binder design system capable of designing antibody-format binders with state-of-the-art experimental success rates. mBER builds on the ColabDesign framework, achieving successful antibody design primarily through the inclusion of informative sequence and structure conditioning information.

We experimentally screened the two libraries against 145 of these targets, resulting in a dataset of over 100 million binding interactions. We achieved specific and significant design success against 45% of targets. In a filtered set of designs, we detect binding rates to specific epitopes as high as 38%. Through mBER, we demonstrate that format-specific binder design is possible with no additional training of underlying folding and language models.

Today, images of biological structures can be acquired using different imaging technologies and at increasing resolutions. However, identifying relevant structural features in three-dimensional (3D) images remains a significant challenge. 3D image segmentation is usually performed using deep-learning segmentation models. Such models are trained on manually annotated and segmented, dataset-specific images. Consequently, they rarely generalize across datasets. Here, we overcome these limitations with TopoTome, an unsupervised 3D image segmentation and analysis algorithm. TopoTome is based on topological data analysis, and conceptually distinct from standard clustering and deep learning image analysis models. It encodes the 3D image directly in topological space. Then, it performs unsupervised clustering to detect and segment features represented by salient and spatially coherent voxel intensity gradients. We demonstrate on simple, complex, synthetic and real-world 3D image data that it outperforms all 3D clustering algorithms. Its segmentation ranks with or outperforms best-in-class deep learning 3D image segmentation software. Beyond image segmentation, it provides streamlined topological data analysis of 3D images, advancing 3D image analysis from conventional mesh volumetry to structural topology. Owing to its conceptually different topological data analysis core, TopoTome does not need prior information and tuning to generalize across different imaging modalities, including fluorescence microscopy and X-ray computed tomography. We show it also readily generalizes across biological subjects, such as different species, organs and cells. TopoTome is thus one of the most versatile and accurate unsupervised 3D image segmentation algorithms.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Studies of West African arthropod diversity can therefore help address important questions regarding conservation, ecosystem services, and insecticide use and other species-control interventions in agriculture and disease management. We intensively sampled arthropods in Ghana using complementary trapping methods, generated DNA barcodes, and classified sequences by Barcode Index Numbers (BINs, a species proxy). Using this dataset, we investigate assemblage composition, temporal activity patterns, and the state of regional biodiversity sampling.

ResultsSequencing DNA from 95,996 individuals captured using Malaise, yellow pan, pitfall, Heath and Centre for Disease Control (CDC) traps, we identified 10,120 unique BINs. The rate of species accumulation did not approach an asymptote for any taxonomic group or trap type, indicating high biodiversity. The different trap types sampled different subsets of the local community, with greatest similarity between yellow pan and pitfall traps. More insects and species (BINs) were trapped during the day than at night. Our dataset shared more BINs in the Barcode of Life Database with South Africa than with any other country, although this predominantly reflects the limited sampling and DNA sequencing campaigns in Africa.

ConclusionsThis study more than doubles the published BINs for West Africa, offering insights into the biodiversity of an ecologically important but understudied taxon and region. Using multiple trap types allowed a more complete assessment of the local arthropod assemblage. The public release of these data will support and stimulate further taxonomic and ecological work in the region.","[{""name"":""Open Philanthropy Project"",""id"":""https://ror.org/004d1k391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Our findings revealed gross vascular and lymphatic rarefaction in BRONJ, along with 4 endothelial subtypes uniformly exhibiting aberrant upregulation of Col2a1. Moreover, fibroblasts and macrophages emerged as key endothelial interactors, collectively underscoring dysregulation of the endothelium-matrix-immune axis. Unlike homeostatic Dmp1/Tfap2a fibroblasts and Stab1 macrophages, BRONJ lesions featured pathological Lrrc15/Chad fibroblasts and Il6 macrophages, which promote ectopic chondrogenesis and inflammation. Mechanistically, BRONJ activated the COL2A1-CD44 axis (EC-to-fibroblast/macrophage signaling) and COL2A1-SDC4 axis (EC-to-fibroblast signaling), whereas lineage tracing excluded endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), implicating extracellular matrix remodeling as the driver of dysfunction.

However, due to the challenges of differentiating goat remains from that of sheep using traditional archaeozoological approaches, there are few specimens specifically identified as goat. To address this we employed genetic, proteomics, and archaeozoological techniques to assess faunal remains from the Late Bronze assemblage of Haugheys Fort (Armagh) and medieval assemblage of Carrickfergus (Antrim). We identify these specimens as goats using proteomics and genetics, and additionally determine their molecular sex.

Genomic data recovered from a Haugheys Fort goat reveals a three-millenia genetic connection between herds in the Late Bronze Age, medieval period, and the indigenous Irish breed extant today, the Old Irish Goat. We additionally find varying levels of inbreeding within goats from the settlement of Carrickfergus, suggesting possible mixed use of herds within medieval Irish society. Our results demonstrate the continuing potential of combining archaeological and biomolecular techniques to clarify existing ambiguities and at the same time reveal new facets of the past.","[{""name"":""EPSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/K039660/1; EP/M028127/1;""},{""name"":""Northern Way Initiative"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""885729-AncestralWeave;101055195-ANSOC;""},{""name"":""Taighde Éireann – Research Ireland"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""21/PATH-S/9515(T);GOIPG/2023/4390;""},{""name"":""AHRC Northern Bridge Doctoral Training Partnership"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

A central question is how cell wall-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are recognized and integrated to trigger immune responses. We address this question by determining the structure of the multidomain receptor IGP1 in both apo form and bound to the cellulose-derived DAMP cellotriose. Structural analyses reveal that constitutive Leucine Rich Repeat-malectin interactions preconfigure IGP1 for ligand recognition and that the receptor features a highly specific sugar-binding pocket in the LRR domain capable of distinguishing fine variations in glycan structures. By directly sensing cello-oligomers, IGP1 acts as a cell wall sentinel that links pathogen-induced wall degradation to immune alerting, equipping plants to mount rapid and robust defense responses.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Testing the rhythmic properties of the adult visual system with periodic or broadband visual stimulation elicited neural resonance phenomena at [~]10Hz alpha rhythm. Here, we extend this approach to reveal the inherent rhythmic properties of the infant brain. Eight-month-olds (N = 42) were presented with visual stimuli flickering at discrete frequencies (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, and 30Hz) and broadband (i.e., aperiodic) stimulation, while recording a high-density electroencephalogram (EEG). As predicted, infants visual system entrained to the harmonics of the periodic stimulation frequencies (first to third). In addition, a 4Hz rhythm emerged independent of stimulation frequency. Critically, the impulse response function (IRF) of the broadband sequence revealed a perceptual echo of visual information at 4Hz. This echo lasted for about 1 second (i.e. four cycles), extended into frontal sensors, and selectively resonated the 4Hz component of the input signal. In a complementary adult assessment, we confirm an alpha response upon periodic and broadband stimulation in the present paradigm for the mature visual system. To conclude, perturbing the infant visual system elicited a neural response and resonant activity at the 4Hz theta rhythm, which contrasts with the 10Hz alpha rhythm found in the adult visual system. Neural processing dynamics are thus essential to understand early brain development in full.

Significance StatementThis study tested resonance properties of the infant visual system upon perturbation. For the visual stimulation at discrete frequencies between 2 and 30Hz, the infant brain responded at 4Hz independent of the stimulation frequency. Following broadband stimulation, a perceptual echo at 4Hz emerged - resonating the 4Hz component of visual information over several cycles. These findings reveal that the 4Hz theta rhythm is an inherent processing dynamic of the infant visual system, contrasting with the 10Hz rhythm found in adults. The processing dynamics of the human visual system undergo fundamental changes from infancy into adulthood.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""KO 6028/1-1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558337

Our model predicts hysteresis in pulling-recoiling cycles and out-of-equilibrium responses, consistent with recent single-chromosome stretching experiments. We further find that loop extrusion provides mechanical robustness to chromatin by promoting compaction while enabling rapid structural recovery after stress.

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting  spacetime attractor excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219525/Z/19/Z;225926/Z/22/Z;219627/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GAT3955;GAT3755;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0040/2024-L;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 651-2023;""},{""name"":""Fondation Fyssen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558338

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558338

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558338

It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558338

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558338

These events occur when cohesin loads near the midpoint between two loci and extrudes them through a defined spatial radius, producing encounter durations that exceed those of random collisions. We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors. Our findings support a time-gated model of distal enhancer-promoter communication in which only rare, long-lived and mostly extrusion-driven encounters are productive, offering a unifying framework for how chromosome dynamics control transcription in single cells.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_192642;TMCG-3_213782;320030-236070;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 1305-2024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558338

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification1 to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) as well as from local ER- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558338

While infection is known to impair mitochondrial function and enhance glycolysis, the role of viral accessory proteins in these alterations remains unclear. Here, we investigate the metabolic impact of the accessory protein ORF7a. Lentiviral expression of ORF7a in human lung epithelial (A549) and monocytic (THP1) cells, coupled with integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, revealed profound dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. ORF7a impaired oxidative phosphorylation, reducing basal and maximal respiration, inducing mitochondrial depolarization, and increasing reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, ORF7a upregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), promoting pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex phosphorylation and suppressing pyruvate oxidation. However, pharmacological PDK4 inhibition did not restore respiration. High-resolution respirometry in frozen samples revealed impaired complex I function, while Blue Native-PAGE demonstrated defective respiratory supercomplex assembly. By linking enzymatic inhibition with structural destabilization, our study uncovers a functional vulnerability of the mitochondrial respiratory chain to viral manipulation. These findings establish ORF7a as a key modulator of host metabolic reprogramming and highlight mitochondrial pathways as potential therapeutic targets in COVID-19.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558338

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558338

Recent advances in conventional single-particle techniques have enabled the determination of an in-creasing number of structures smaller than 100 kDa, achieving resolutions relevant to drug research. Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions. We envision that this method will further lower the molecular weight limit of single-particle cryo-EM, enabling its application to important drug-binding complexes that are below 50 kDa.","[{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759788558338

Whether chromatin assembly on newly replicated strands is also asymmetric remains unknown, as visualizing this short-lived state in cells is impossible. To circumvent this limitation, we combine in vitro reconstitution of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA and chromatin replication machineries with replication-aware single-molecule chromatin footprinting, to study how chromatin is re-assembled on replicated DNA. Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid. These pathways have implications for essential chromatin-templated processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and gene silencing at replication forks.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""851564;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04jsz6e67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Vidi.233.038;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2-HG012442;""},{""name"":""W.

Genetic deletion of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in mice resulted in weakened uterine contractions and severe parturition defects. Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either the uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects, whereas combined loss significantly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing showed that loss of PIEZO reduced expression of connexin43 (Gja1), a gap junction protein in uterine smooth muscle cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to impaired contraction.

We found that information from multiple innately aversive and attractive sensory modalities converges onto a common output neuron of the learning circuit, specifically the Mushroom Body output neuron, MBON-m1. We discovered that this neuron is required for navigating both attractive odor and aversive temperature cues and is activated by attractive cues, such as food odour and sugar, and inhibited by different aversive cues, such as cooling, salt, or non-food odors.
