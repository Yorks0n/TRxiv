ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1734473302830

Although these methods are conceptually similar, we show by analyzing association studies of 209 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank that they systematically prioritize different genes. This raises the question of how genes should ideally be prioritized. We propose two prioritization criteria: 1) trait importance -- how much a gene quantitatively affects a trait; and 2) trait specificity -- a gene's importance for the trait under study relative to its importance across all traits. We find that GWAS prioritize genes near trait-specific variants, while burden tests prioritize trait-specific genes. Because non-coding variants can be context specific, GWAS can prioritize highly pleiotropic genes, while burden tests generally cannot. Both study designs are also affected by distinct trait-irrelevant factors, complicating their interpretation. Our results illustrate that burden tests and GWAS reveal different aspects of trait biology and suggest ways to improve their interpretation and usage.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

Mormon Fritillary butterflies (Speyeria mormonia) exhibit a striking wing color polymorphism throughout their range: typical morphs bear silver spots on their ventral surfaces, and can co-occur with unsilvered morphs displaying a dull coloration. Through genome-wide association studies in two polymorphic populations, we fine-map this difference in silvering to the 3' region of the transcription factor gene optix. The expression of optix is confined to the unsilvered regions that surround the spots, and these patterns are transformed to a silver identity upon optix RNAi knockdown, implicating optix as a repressor of silver scales in this butterfly. We show that the unsilvered optix haplotype shows signatures of recent selective sweeps, and that this allele is shared with the monomorphic, unsilvered species Speyeria hydaspe, suggesting that introgressions facilitate the exchange of variants of adaptive potential across species. Remarkably, these findings parallel the role of introgressions and cis-regulatory modulation of optix in shaping the aposematic red patterns of Heliconius butterflies, a lineage that separated from Speyeria 45 million years ago. The genetic basis of adaptive variation can thus be more predictable than often presumed, even for traits that appear divergent across large evolutionary distances.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

We analysed primary and publicly available RNA libraries to extend the known diversity of tunicate-associated viruses and determine their relationship to viruses of other animals. We present evidence that influenza viruses, alphaviruses, and some mononegaviruses emerged prior to the evolution of vertebrates. We also show that the recombination of glycoproteins between different orders of RNA viruses, including between positive- and negative-sense viruses, may have shaped the evolution of multiple lineages.

The aim of the reCOVer trial was to investigate safety, tolerability and clinical effects of BC007 on fatigue, its severity and quality of life in PCS patients.

MethodsreCOVer is a prospective, exploratory, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover phase IIa clinical trial with 1350 mg BC007 at the University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany. Eligible participants were 18-80 years with GPCR-fAAb, whose PCS symptoms persisted [&ge;]3 months after PCR-confirmed COVID-19, with fatigue as the major symptom (Bell score [&le;]60) and at least three of eight defined PCS symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) according to a crossover design to either receive BC007 (sequence A) or placebo (sequence B) at day 0 and day 48 with a follow-up of 28 days, respectively. A crossover design was chosen to increase patient adherence. Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in comparison between sequence A and B from d0 to d28 and d0 to d70 were the primary and co-primary endpoint, respectively.

FindingsBetween 31.10.2023 and 12.06.2024, 30 PCS patients were randomised and analysed. The trial has been concluded. Summarising all AE rates, no statistically significant differences between sequence A und sequence B were observed within day 28 and day 70. One report of a serious adverse event, not related to treatment, was recorded. As a secondary endpoint, BC007 showed a significant improvement on self-reported fatigue and its severity, as well as quality of life.

InterpretationAs BC007 was well tolerated and showed a significant improvement of fatigue and quality of life, it might offer a therapeutic option for an autoimmune subgroup of PCS patients.

However, the X-ray crystallography (and cryo-EM) models deposited in the PDB are determined by a combination of refinement algorithms and manual modeling. The intervention of human modeling leads to the possibility that within a single structure, there can be differences in how well parts of a structure are modeled and/or fit the underlying experimental data. We identified that small molecule binding sites are more carefully modeled and better match the underlying experimental data than the rest of the protein structural model. This trend persisted regardless of the resolution or Rfree values of the structure. The variation of modeling has implications for how we interpret protein structural models and use structural models as truth in mechanisms, structural bioinformatics, simulations, docking, and structure prediction, especially when comparing binding sites to the rest of the protein.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

A common mechanism is copy number changes, which can affect single genes, larger genomic regions, or even entire chromosomes in the case of eukaryotes (aneuploidy). Bacterial species with genomes comprising more than one chromosome are common, yet the role of adaptive copy number changes affecting entire chromosomes is unknown. Here, by using a bacterium with two chromosomes (chrI and chrII) as model system and combining evolution experiments in the presence of severe nutrient stress with whole-genome sequencing, we show that chromosomal copy number changes can drive rapid adaptation. We detected increased copy number of the entire chrII in almost half of the sequenced clones, isolated from twelve independent populations. In most cases, copy number increases were driven by mutations in the replication protein of chrII. A higher chrII copy number is likely to be beneficial because chrII codes for the operon responsible for metabolizing D-gluconic acid, the only carbon source present in the medium. Our results revealed a novel mechanism for rapid adaptation in bacteria. Given the prevalence of bacteria with secondary chromosomes, and the enrichment of secondary chromosomes in genes associated with interaction with the environment, this may be an important mechanism for adapting to novel environments that has been overlooked.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

More recently, high rates of inflation, the resulting  cost-of-living crisis and reforms to alcohol taxation have affected the affordability of alcohol, but little is understood about how these changes have impacted on alcohol sales and consumption. We aimed gain insights into recent trends in alcohol sales by assessing changes in alcohol duty revenue collected by the UK government since 2020.

Design and SettingWe used published data on UK alcohol duty revenue to model trends from 2010-2019. We forecasted these trends through to October 2024 using a novel statistical approach and compared these forecasts to observed receipts.

MeasurementsMonthly inflation-adjusted alcohol duty receipts received by the UK Treasury in pounds sterling for beer, cider, spirits and wine.

FindingsDuring the pandemic, alcohol duty receipts fell during lockdowns and rose as restrictions were subsequently lifted. Since 2022 alcohol duty receipts have been consistently below the historical trend, with a gradually increasing deficit in wine receipts and comparable deficit in spirits receipts that began sharply in late 2022. The reforms to the alcohol duty system in August 2023 do not appear to have significantly affected these trends.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest that the  cost of living crisis in 2022/23 has led to a fall in alcohol sales relative to the pre-pandemic trend. The magnitude of this fall differs by beverage type, indicating that wine and spirits drinkers may have changed their behaviour more than beer and cider drinkers.","NA","medrxiv",1734473302830

Obtaining structural knowledge of protein-protein interactions between a pathogen and its host can inform pathogenic mechanisms and treatment or vaccine design. Currently, there are 52 nonredundant human-pathogen interactions with known structure in the PDB, although there are 21064 with experimental support in the HPIDB, meaning that only 0.2% of known interactions have known structure. Recent improvements in structure prediction of protein complexes based on AlphaFold have made it possible to model heterodimeric complexes with very high accuracy. However, it is not known how this translates to host-pathogen interactions which share a different evolutionary relationship. Here, we analyse the structural protein-protein interaction network between ten different pathogens and their human host. We predict the structure of 9452 human-pathogen interactions of which only 10 have known structure. We find that we can model 30 interactions with an expected TM-score of [&ge;]0.9, expanding the structural knowledge in these networks three-fold. We select the highly-scoring Francisella tularensis dihydroprolyl dehydrogenase (IPD) complex with human immunoglobulin Kappa constant (IGKC) for detailed analysis with homology modeling and native mass spectrometry. Our results confirm the predicted 1:2:1 heterotetrameric complex with potential implications for bacterial immune response evasion. We are entering a new era where structure prediction can be used to guide vaccine and drug development towards new pathogenic targets in very short time frames.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

Even well-annotated proteins are often poorly characterized in diverse biological contexts, disease states, and perturbations. We present ProCyon, a foundation model for modeling, generating, and predicting protein phenotypes across five interrelated knowledge domains: molecular functions, therapeutic mechanisms, disease associations, functional protein domains, and molecular interactions. To support this, we created ProCyon-Instruct, a dataset of 33 million protein phenotype instructions, representing a comprehensive resource for multiscale protein phenotypes. By co-training a large language model with multimodal molecular encoders, ProCyon integrates phenotypic and protein data. A novel architecture and instruction tuning strategy allow ProCyon to process arbitrarily interleaved protein-and-phenotype inputs, achieve zero-shot task transfer, and generate free-form text phenotypes interleaved with retrieved protein sequence, structure, and drug modalities in a single unified model. ProCyon achieves strong performance against single-modality models, multimodal models such as ESM3, as well as text-only LLMs on dozens of benchmarking tasks such as contextual protein retrieval and question answering. We extensively evaluate ProCyon for biological applications, including identifying protein domains that bind small molecule drugs, predicting peptide binding with enzymes, and assessing the functional impact of Alzheimer's disease mutations. ProCyon enables conditional retrieval of proteins linked to small molecules through complementary mechanisms of action. It generates candidate phenotypes for under-characterized proteins recently implicated in Parkinson's disease, facilitating hypothesis generation for poorly understood proteins and biological processes. ProCyon paves the way toward an effective, general solution for functional protein biology that can enable new insights into the human proteome.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

However, the high cost of NA fluorometers presents a barrier to eDNA sequencing in resource limited settings (RLSs). For instance, at ~$1.5-3.3k USD, current NA fluorometers present a greater capital cost than ONT's $1k USD portable MinION third-generation Nanopore sequencing platform. The collapse of international scientific device and consumable supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic also highlighted the need for distributed manufacturing of molecular research tools to mitigate the impact of increased pricing to RLSs. To address these challenges, we have developed the ""DIYNAFLUOR"" (DIY Nucleic Acid FLUORometer), a portable, open-source, <$40 USD NA fluorometer, designed using readily available off-the-shelf components, simple 3D-printed parts, and plug-and-play, solder-free assembly. The DIYNAFLUOR was primarily designed to be compatible with the popular DNA-centric Qubit High Sensitivity (HS) and Broad Range (BR) assay kits. Notably, the DIYNAFLUOR demonstrated an 'in-assay' Limit of Detection with the Qubit HS kit of 0.0028 ng/uL, and an average absolute bias of 0.018 ng/muL across a 0-10 ng/uL working range using a 2-point linear calibration methodology. Device verification was performed by comparative measurements with a Qubit 4 fluorometer in a busy biotechnology laboratory, and build instructions were validated through assembly and qualification of three DIYNAFLUOR devices by researchers outside the primary design team. We also describe a custom ""extreme"" low-cost assay, < 13 cent USD per-measurement, that uses SYBR Safe dye to quantify DNA across a working range of 0-0.5 ng/uL. This assay reports a lower sensitivity and accuracy than commercial kits but may be of use to RLSs in times of extreme resource constraints or as a teaching tool for STEM educators. To demonstrate its practical application for field-based eDNA analysis in RLSs, the DIYNAFLUOR was used to perform all quality control measurements throughout the preparation of a 16S and 18S metabarcoding library generated from eDNA extracted from Australian lake water, leading to the successful identification of Australian fauna via Nanopore sequencing. Finally, configurations of the DIYNAFLUOR for RNA and Protein quantification are briefly described.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

ProKAS is based on a tandem array of peptide sensors with amino acid barcodes that allow multiplexed analysis for spatial, kinetic, and screening applications. We engineered a ProKAS module to simultaneously monitor the activities of the DNA damage response kinases ATR, ATM, and CHK1 in response to genotoxic drugs, while also uncovering differences between these signaling responses in the nucleus, cytosol, and replication factories.

We demonstrate that CD39+ Treg-like and CD26hi Th22-like cells can be activated by cytokines in a TCR-independent manner during in vitro Ag stimulation, leading to non-specific upregulation of prototypical AIM readouts. Transcriptional analysis of memory CD4+ T cells that underwent TCR-dependent or -independent activation enabled discrimination of bona fide Ag-specific T cells from cytokine-activated Treg and Th22 cells. CXCR4 downregulation emerged as a hallmark of clonotypic expansion and TCR-dependent activation in memory CD4+ T cells and cTfh.

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk. Methods: The study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19). Results: The study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022. Conclusion: Vaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.","NA","medrxiv",1734473302830

In this perspective, we performed new molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the various spike RBD/hACE2 complexes corresponding to the WT, Delta and Omicron variants (BA.1 up to BA.4/5) over 1.5 {micro}s timescale. Then, carrying out a comprehensive analysis of residue interactions within and between the two partners, allowed us to draw the profile of each variant by using complementary methods (PairInt, hydrophobic potential, contact PCA). Main results of PairInt calculations highlighted the most involved residues in electrostatic interactions that represent a strong contribution in the binding with highly stable contacts between spike RBD and hACE2 (importance of mutated residues at positions 417, 493 and 498). In addition to the swappable arginine residues (493/498), the apolar contacts made a substantial and complementary contribution in Omicron with the detection of two hydrophobic patches, one of which was correlated with energetic contribution calculations. This study brings new highlights on the global dynamics of spike RBD/hACE2 complexes resulting from the analysis of contact networks and cross-correlation matrices able to detect subtle changes at point mutations. The results of our study are also consistent with alternative approaches such as binding free energy calculations but are more informative and sensitive to transient or low-energy interactions. Nevertheless, the energetic contributions of residues at positions 501 and 505 were in good agreement with hydrophobic interactions measurements. The contact PCA networks could identify the intramolecular incidence of the S375F mutation occurring in all Omicron variants and likely conferring them an advantage in binding stability. Collectively, these data revealed the major differences observed between WT/Delta and Omicron variants at the RBD/hACE2 interface, which may explain the greater persistence of Omicron.

Author SummaryThe evolution of SARS-CoV-2 was extremely rapid, leading to the global predominance of Omicron variants, despite the many mutations identified in the spike protein. Some of these were introduced to evade the immune system, but many others were located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) without affecting its efficient binding to hACE2 and preserving the high infectivity of this variant. To unravel the mechanism by which this protein-protein connection remains strong or stable, it is necessary to study the different types of interactions at the atomic level and over time using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Indeed, in contrast to crystal or cryo-EM structures providing only a fixed image of the binding process, MD simulations have allowed to unambiguously identify the sustainability of some interactions mediated by key residues of spike RBD. This study could also highlight the interchangeable role of certain residues in compensating for a mutation, which in turn allows the virus to maintain durable binding to the host cell receptor.

In this study, we systematically analyzed the entire human surfaceome, identifying approximately 4,500 targetable sites and introducing high-quality binder seeds tailored for protein design applications. To validate these seeds, we implemented two experimental approaches (protein scaffolding and peptide cyclization) on three representative targets (FGFR2, IFNAR2, and HER3). Our results revealed a high success rate, emphasizing the precision and therapeutic potential of these seeds, as well as the need for constant improvements of computational protein design pipelines utilizing machine learning and physics-based methods.

We report that gastruloids exhibit robust morphology and transcriptional profiles within a size range. However, size affects the dynamics, and, outside a range of robust morphogenesis, the precision of anterior-posterior (AP) axial elongation. Gastruloid axial elongation exhibits active cellular contractility, requires planar cell polarity (PCP), adhesion and cell-cell contact remodelling. Smaller gastruloids initiate elongation earlier, correlated with an earlier Brachyury polarisation. Brachyury expression increases tissue fluidity. Axis formation is regulated by the balance of Brachyury multifoci coalescence and the timing of initiation of the elongation programme. Sizes beyond the robust range can modify relative tissue composition. Very small aggregates have increased neural fate bias, accompanied by a loss of paraxial mesoderm mediated by differences in Nodal signalling activity.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

The whooping crane (Grus americana) experienced severe population declines in the 18th century, culminating into a collapse to 16 individuals in 1941. Legal protections and conservation actions have since increased the population to approximately 840 individuals, yet the impact on genomic diversity remains unclear. We analysed the temporal dynamics of genomic erosion by sequencing a high-quality genome reference, and re-sequencing 16 historical and 37 modern genomes, including wild individuals and four generations of captive-bred individuals. Genomic demographic reconstructions reveal a steady decline, accelerating over the past 300 years with the European settlement of North America. Temporal genomic analyses show that despite demographic recovery, the species has lost 70% of its genetic diversity and has increased their inbreeding. Although the modern population bottleneck reduced the ancestral genetic load, modern populations possess more realized load than masked load, possibly resulting in a chronic loss of fitness. Integrating pedigree and genomic data, we underscore the role of breeding management in reducing recent inbreeding. Yet ongoing heterozygosity loss, load accumulation, and background inbreeding argues against the species' downlisting from their current Endangered status on the IUCN Red List and the Endangered Species Act. The presence of private genetic variation in wild and captive populations suggests that wild-captive crosses could enhance genetic diversity and reduce the realized load.

Here we report on recordings of dopamine-dependent fluorescence using a high-sensitivity dopamine indicator. We deliver an array of rewarding, aversive and mixed valence stimuli, as well as stimuli without any obvious valence. We observe that stimuli without valence, as well as the omission of expected stimuli, do not lead to large changes in fluorescence, even when these stimuli and omissions are both novel and engaging. In contrast, both rewarding and aversive stimuli lead to increases in fluorescence, with the most rewarding and most aversive stimuli leading to the largest increases. We test the effect of adding an aversive component to a rewarding stimulus and find that the increases in fluorescence are consistent with a summation of the rewarding and aversive components. We propose that dopamine release in the PFC responds to the total valence of a stimulus, in contrast with the traditional view of basal ganglia dopamine release that depends on the net valence.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

In this work, we investigate the use of a pre-trained protein language model (PPLM) for getting a rich representation of amino acids which could be utilized for codon optimization. This leaves us with a simpler fine-tuning task over PPLM in optimizing ORF sequences. Results: The ORFs generated by our proposed models outperformed their natural counterparts encoding the same proteins on computational metrics for stability and expression. They also demonstrated enhanced performance against the benchmark ORFs used in mRNA vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein and the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). These results highlight the potential of adapting PPLM for designing ORFs tailored to encode target antigens in mRNA vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

Here, we developed a preclinical LUAD mouse model and demonstrated that targeted oncogenic KRAS degradation induces rapid tumor regression. Transcriptional, histological, and immunophenotypic analyses revealed a substantial remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Notably, disease relapse observed during long-term degrader treatment stems from proteolysis machinery dysregulation, indicating resistance mechanisms distinct from those reported upon KRAS inhibition.

The input area V1 contains neurons that encode basic visual features, whereas downstream in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) neurons acquire tuning for novel complex feature associations. It has been assumed that each cortical area is composed of repeatable neuronal subtypes, and variations in synaptic strength and connectivity patterns underlie functional specialization. Here we test the hypothesis that diversity in the intrinsic make-up of single neurons contributes to area specialization along the visual pathways. We measured morphological and electrophysiological properties of single neurons in areas V1 and LPFC of marmosets. Excitatory neurons in LPFC were larger, less excitable, and fired broader spikes than V1 neurons. Some inhibitory fast spiking interneurons in the LPFC had longer axons and fired spikes with longer latencies and a more depolarized action potential trough than in V1. Intrinsic bursting was found in subpopulations of both excitatory and inhibitory LPFC but not V1 neurons. The latter may favour temporal summation of spikes and therefore enhanced synaptic plasticity in LPFC relative to V1. Our results show that specialization within the primate visual system permeates the most basic processing level, the single neuron.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

Nitrogen fixation is regulated by microbial communities, which can be free-living in the soil and leaf litter (asymbiotic) or in symbioses with plants. [bullet] To investigate how warming affects asymbiotic and symbiotic components of the N cycle, we analyzed soil and leaf litter samples as well as annual seedling census data from an experimental warming field site in Puerto Rico. [bullet] 16S and nifH sequencing revealed that warming significantly altered bacterial composition. Asymbiotic N fixation rates were 55% greater in soil (0.004 nmol N2/g/hr) and 525% greater (0.217 nmol N2/g/hr) in leaf litter from warmed compared to ambient plots. This increase in fixation was associated with changes in the N-fixing bacterial community. Under warming, N fixers experienced a 4.4-fold increase in growth rate compared to non-fixers, yet competition with neighboring N fixers eventually reduced N fixer growth. Seedling growth, especially of N fixers, initially increased following hurricane disturbances before declining. [bullet] Together, our findings suggest that warming increases the flux of N from the atmosphere into this tropical forest, driving changes in both microbial and tree dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

DDT is orchestrated by ubiquitination of PCNA: Monoubiquitination (PCNA-Ub) initiates recruitment of TLS polymerases but also serves as substrate for K63-linked polyubiquitination that leads to HR-mediated bypass mechanisms. Recent work on USP1/UAF1 inhibition revealed that K48-linked chains are also formed on PCNA, resulting in its proteasomal degradation. USP1/UAF1 is established as deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) for PCNA-Ub, but little is known about deubiquitination of chains on PCNA. Here we show that USP1/UAF1 cleaves both K48 and K63-linked ubiquitin chains on PCNA efficiently, using an exo-cleavage mechanism. Kinetic analysis reveals that USP1/UAF1 prefers cleaving the ubiquitin-ubiquitin bond over cleavage of the ubiquitin-PCNA isopeptide bond and therefore treats poly- and monoubiquitinated PCNA as different substrates. A cryo-EM structure of USP1/UAF1 with a K63-diubiquitin and structure-based mutagenesis reveals that its mechanistic preference is maintained in evolution. Its kinetic mechanism results in relative enrichment of monoubiquitinated PCNA that could initially promote TLS over HR-like bypass. Taken together, these results suggest that USP1/UAF1 could be important in temporary protection of PCNA against K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitination and highlight this DUB as a potential regulator of DDT pathway choice.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

In each repeat, two glycans are O-linked to a 3,4-dihydroxyproline, and an additional glycan attaches to the adjacent Ser or Thr. The structure of the fibril is entirely maintained through glycan packing. Bioinformatic analysis confirms the conservation of the TLP-4 repeats across species, suggesting the existence of a large number of glycofibrils to be discovered.

Additionally, there has been a lack of tools to support clinician communication and shared decision-making to address CVD prevention in this important ""at-risk"" population. We developed the Heart Health Yarning Tool, an online shared decision-making resource co-designed with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, to be implemented alongside the new Australian guidelines for primary CVD risk assessment and management. This was a three phase project: Phase 1 consisted of a stakeholder consultation and co-design process, including consumer yarning workshops (n=21), individual yarning sessions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Workers/Practitioners (n=8), consumers (n=17), and interviews with general practitioners (n=5). Phase 2 involved a mapping process, where qualitative interview data was integrated into the conceptual framework of an existing culturally adapted shared decision-making model,  Finding Your Way, in order to tailor the model to the CVD context. Phase 3 involved developing and testing content for the new tool, based on findings from Phases 1 and 2, using evidence-based shared decision-making formats. The resulting tool supports health professionals to make shared decisions about heart health with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It can be used as a conversation guide in primary care consultations or as a training tool for health professionals.

Here, we present data which suggest that a particular subclass of fibroblast and mural cells may be implicated in the sensory neuron dysfunction that is characteristic of this pain state.

In a mouse model of traumatic painful neuropathy, we used RNA sequencing, cell sorting and nerve tissue clearing to study mesenchymal lineage cells. We show that Pdgfrb+ fibroblasts and mural cells are increased in number for at least two months post-nerve damage and express high levels of known and putative pro-algesic mediators, which are further upregulated in neuropathy.

We go on to demonstrate that a human nerve pericyte line releases a selection of these pro-algesic mediators at protein level. Moreover, conditioned media from stimulated human pericytes induces intra-cellular changes in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived sensory neurons; these changes (phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3) have been previously linked to sensory neuron activation.

In summary, our data indicate that mesenchymal cell abnormalities should be considered when developing novel strategies to tackle neuropathic pain.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

These introns are believed to be evolutionarily derived from group II introns, which are known to be widespread in bacteria. One prominent hypothesis is that the spliceosomal intron arose after the endosymbiotic origin of the mitochondrion, as a consequence of transfer of genes containing group II introns from the organelle to nuclear genome; in this model, transfer of group II introns into the ancestral eukaryotic genome set the stage for evolution of the spliceosomal form. However, the recent discovery and sequencing of asgard archaea -- the closest archaeal relatives of extant eukaryotes -- has shed significant light on the composition of the early eukaryotic genome and calls that model into question. Using sequence analysis and structural modeling, we show here the presence of group II intron maturases in the genomes of Heimdallarchaeia and other asgard archaea, and demonstrate by phylogenetic inference that these are closely related to both eukaryotic mitochondrial group II intron maturases and the spliceosome protein PRP8. This suggests that the first intron-containing eukaryotic common ancestor (FIECA) inherited selfish group II introns from its ancestral archaeal genome - the progenitor of the nuclear genome - rather than from the mitochondrial endosymbiont. These observations suggest that the spread and diversification of introns may have occurred independently of the acquisition of the mitochondrion. To better understand the context for intron evolution, we investigate the broader occurrence of group II introns in archaea, identify archaeal clades enriched in group II introns, and perform structural modeling to examine the relationship between the archaeal group II intron maturase and the eukaryotic spliceosome. We propose a model of intron acquisition and expansion during early eukaryotic evolution that places the spread of introns prior to the acquisition of mitochondria, possibly facilitated by the separation of transcription and translation afforded by the nucleus.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

While this is a respiratory virus, one feature of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was recognized to cause pathogenesis of other organs. Because the membrane fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, binds to its major host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that regulates a critical mediator of cardiovascular diseases, angiotensin II, COVID-19 is largely associated with vascular pathologies. In fact, we have previous reported that postmortem lung tissues collected from patients who died of COVID-19 exhibited thickened pulmonary vascular walls and reduced vascular lumen. The present study extended these findings by further characterizing the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients using larger sample sizes and providing mechanistic information through histological observations. The examination of 56 autopsy lung samples showed thickened vascular walls of small pulmonary arteries after 14 days of disease compared to H1N1 influenza patients who died before COVID- 19 pandemic started. Pulmonary vascular remodeling in COVID-19 patients was associated with hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer, perivascular fibrosis, edema and lymphostasis, inflammatory infiltration, perivascular hemosiderosis and neoangiogenesis. We found a correlation between the duration of hospital stay and the thickness of the muscular layer of pulmonary arterial walls.

In the present paper we test whether population differences in genetic nurture, assortative mating, or population stratification contribute to the fact that polygenic indices constructed based on GWAS results from European-descent samples predict more poorly in admixed populations with Native American and African ancestry. We do this by comparing the rates of decline in prediction accuracy of classical-GWAS-based PGIs versus within-family-based PGIs, each estimated in a population of European descent, as they are deployed in two samples of Latino Americans and African Americans. Within-family GWAS putatively eliminates the effects of parental genetic nurture, assortative mating, and population stratification; thus, we can determine whether without those confounding factors in the PGI construction, the relative prediction accuracy in the out-groups is ameliorated. Results show that relative prediction accuracy is not improved, suggesting that the differences across groups can be almost entirely explained by variation in genetic architecture (i.e. allele frequencies and short-range LD) rather than the aforementioned factors. Additional analysis of the impact of genetic architecture on the decline in prediction accuracy supports this conclusion. Future researchers should test within-family analysis at the prediction rather than the discovery stage.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

Despite this, their promise remains largely untapped due to the technical challenges inherent to profiling cell surface proteins. Here, we employed N-glycoproteomics to analyze 85 patient-derived xenografts (PDX), constructing Glyco PDXplorer - an in vivo pan-cancer atlas of cancer-derived cell surface proteins. We developed a target discovery pipeline to prioritize proteins with favorable expression profiles for immunotherapeutic targeting and validated FAT2 as a head and neck squamous cancer (HNSC) enriched surface protein with limited expression in normal tissue. Functional studies revealed that FAT2 is essential for HNSC growth and adhesion through regulation of surface architecture and integrin-PI3K signaling. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting FAT2 demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in HNSC models. This work lays the foundation for developing FAT2-targeted therapies and represents a pivotal resource to inform therapeutic target discovery for multiple cancers.

Here we present evidence for an age-specific practice at the Neolithic site of Catalhoyuk in Anatolia, dating to the 7th millennium BCE. Among ancient DNA libraries produced from 362 petrous bone samples, those of subadults contained three times higher average human DNA than those of adults. This difference in organic preservation was also confirmed by FTIR analysis. Studying similar datasets from seven prehistoric and historical sites, we found a similar age-related difference in only one cemetery. We propose that the organic preservation difference with age was caused by the special treatment of chosen corpses before interment, such as defleshing or drying, which was more frequently applied to Catalhoyuk adults and promoted organic decay.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

We characterized the epidemiological factors driving OROV spread in non-endemic Southeast Brazil, analyzing environmental and agricultural conditions contributing to viral transmission. Samples from 29,000 suspected arbovirus-infected patients were tested by RT-qPCR for Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika, Mayaro, and Oropouche virus. Between March and June 2024, OROV cases in the state reached 339, demonstrating successful local transmission.

Spatial analysis revealed that most cases clustered in municipalities with tropical climates and intensive cacao, robusta coffee, coconut, and pepper cultivation. Phylogenetic analysis identified the Espirito Santo OROV strains as part of the 2022-2024 Amazonian lineage. The rapid spread of OROV outside the Amazon highlights its adaptive potential and public health threat, emphasizing the need for enhanced surveillance and targeted control measures.","NA","medrxiv",1734473302830

We observe average runtimes to simulate detectable IBD segments around a locus that scale approximately linearly in sample size and take a couple of seconds for sample sizes less than ten thousand. In contrast, we find that existing methods to simulate IBD segments take minutes to hours for sample sizes exceeding a few thousand. When using IBD segments to study recent positive selection around a locus, our efficient algorithm makes feasible statistical inferences that would be otherwise intractable.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

Scotland records up to 6 different diagnostic codes for one inpatient episode, compared with up to 20 in England, and 14 in Wales. We assessed the impact of the variations in diagnostic coding among countries on observed disease incidence rates. Methods: We examined the number of diagnoses coded by each country, and then compared the incidence of three diseases between countries: Parkinson's disease (PD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and dementia. We constructed Cox models for each disease, adjusting for ""country"". Results: England appears to have the highest risk (hazard ratio, HR) for all three diseases, while Scotland appears to have the lowest risk: HR [95% CI] = 0.62 [0.54, 0.72] for PD, 0.49 [0.45, 0.54] for T2D, and 0.88 [0.78, 0.99] for dementia. Conclusions: The observed incidence of these diseases and the estimated effect of ""country"" in Cox models are likely influenced by the clinical coding variations among countries. Researchers need to be aware of this and account for these variations in their analyses.","NA","medrxiv",1734473302830

To address this, we developed the Taxonomy Time Machine: a datafor storing many snapshots of a taxonomic tree in a space-efficient manner. We have also created a web-based and programmatic (API) interface to make this data more accessible. This tool is capable of accurately reconstructing taxonomic lineages at any point in the history of the NCBI Taxonomy Database. We demonstrate that this tool is both perfectly accurate and significantly more efficient than loading and querying individual taxonomy snapshots, enabling its use on desktop computers as well as commodity web servers.

TFs often have drastically different regulatory behaviors depending on promoter context and interacting cofactors. However, the detailed mechanisms by which each TF affects transcription and produce promoter-dependent regulation is unclear. Here, we discover that a simple model explains the regulatory effects of E. coli TFs in a range of contexts. Specifically, we measure the relationship between basal promoter activity and its regulation by diverse TFs and find that the contextual changes in TF function are determined entirely by the basal strength of the regulated promoter: TFs exert lower fold-change on stronger promoters under a precise inverse scaling. Remarkably, this scaling relationship holds for both activators and repressors, indicating a universal mechanism of gene regulation. Our data, which spans between 100-fold activation to 1000-fold repression, is consistent with a model of regulation driven by stabilization of RNAP at the promoter for every TF. Crucially, this indicates that TFs naturally act to maintain homeostatic expression levels across genetic or environmental perturbations, ensuring robust expression of regulated genes.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830

The deposition of H3K36me3 occurs co-transcriptionally when the methyltransferase SETD2 associates with RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Here we present three cryo-EM structures of SETD2 bound to Pol II elongation complexes at different states of nucleosome passage. Together with functional probing, our results suggest a 3-step mechanism of transcription-coupled H3K36me3 deposition. First, binding to the elongation factor SPT6 tethers the catalytic SET domain in proximity to the upstream DNA. Second, Pol II nucleosome passage leads to the transfer of a hexasome from downstream to upstream, poised for methylation. Finally, continued transcription leads to upstream nucleosome reassembly, partial dissociation of the histone chaperone FACT and sequential methylation of both H3 tails, completing H3K36me3 deposition of an upstream nucleosome after Pol II passage.","NA","biorxiv",1734473302830
