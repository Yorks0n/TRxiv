ObjectiveThe primary objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the global prevalence of long COVID and its subtypes and symptoms in individuals with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, while the secondary objective is to assess risk factors for long COVID in the same population.

Data SourcesStudies on long COVID published from July 5, 2021, to May 29, 2024, searched from PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were used for this systematic review. Supplemental updates to the original search period were made.

Study SelectionThere were four inclusion criteria: (1) human study population with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis; (2) appropriate index diagnosis date; (3) outcome must include either prevalence, risk factors, duration, or symptoms of long COVID; and (4) follow-up time of at least two months after the index date. The exclusion criteria were: (1) non-human study population; (1) case studies or reviews; (2) studies with imaging, molecular, and/or cellular testing as primary results; (3) studies with specific populations such as healthcare workers, residents of nursing homes, and/or those living in long-term care facilities; and (4) studies that did not meet the sample size threshold needed to estimate overall prevalence with margin of error of 0.05.

Data Extraction and SynthesisTwo screeners independently performed screenings and data extraction, and decision conflicts were collectively resolved. The data were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis framework with a DerSimonian-Laird inverse variance weighted estimator.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary estimand (target population parameter of interest) was the prevalence of long COVID and its subtypes among individuals with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, and the secondary estimand was effect sizes corresponding to ten common risk factors of long COVID in the same population.

ResultsA total of 442 studies were included in this mega-systematic review, and 429 were meta-analyzed for various endpoints, avoiding duplicate estimates from the same study. Of the 442 studies, 17.9% of the studies have a high risk of bias. Heterogeneity is evident among meta-analyzed studies, where the I2 statistic is nearly 100% in studies that estimate overall prevalence. Global estimated pooled prevalence of long COVID was 36% among COVID-19 positive individuals (95% confidence interval [CI] 33%-40%) estimated from 144 studies. Geographical variation was observed in the estimated pooled prevalence of long COVID: Asia at 35% (95% CI 25%-46%), Europe at 39% (95% CI 31%-48%), North America at 30% (95% CI 24%-38%), and South America at 51% (95% CI 35%-66%). Stratifying by follow-up duration, the estimated pooled prevalence for individuals with longer follow-up periods of 1 to 2 years (47% [95% CI 37%-57%]) compared to those with follow-up times of less than 1 year (35% [95% CI 31%-39%]) had overlapping CI and were therefore not statistically distinguishable. Top five most prevalent long COVID subtypes among COVID-19 positive cases were respiratory at 20% (95% CI 14%-28%) estimated from 31 studies, general fatigue at 20% (95% CI 18%-23%) estimated from 121 studies, psychological at 18% (95% CI 11%-28%) estimated from 10 studies, neurological at 16% (95% CI 8%-30%) estimated from 23 studies, and dermatological at 12% (95% CI 8%-17%) estimated from 10 studies. The most common symptom based on estimated prevalence was memory problems estimated at 11% (95% CI 7%-19%) meta-analyzed from 12 studies. The three strongest risk factors for long COVID were being unvaccinated for COVID-19, pre-existing comorbidity, and female sex. Individuals with any of these risk factors had higher odds of having long COVID with pooled estimated odds ratios of 2.34 (95% CI 1.49-3.67) meta-analyzed from 6 studies, 1.59 (95% CI 1.28-1.97) from 13 studies, and 1.55 (95% CI 1.25-1.92) from 22 studies, respectively.

Conclusions and RelevanceThis study shows long COVID is globally prevalent in the COVID-19 positive population with highly varying estimates. The prevalence of long COVID persists over extended follow-up, with a high burden of symptoms 1 to 2 years post-infection. Our findings highlight long COVID and its subtypes as a continuing health challenge worldwide. The heterogeneity of the estimates across populations and geographical regions argues for the need for carefully designed follow-up with representative studies across the world.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the prevalence and patterns of long COVID and its subtypes, and what are the risk factors of long COVID?

ResultsMeta-analysis of 429 studies published from 2021-2024 estimated a pooled global long COVID prevalence of 36% in COVID-19 positive individuals. Variations in geographical regions showed that South America had the highest pooled prevalence of 51% (95% CI: 35%-66%), and the prevalence does not seem to diminish with extended follow-up (less than 1 year: 35%, 95% CI: 31%-39% vs. 1 to 2 years: 47%, 95% CI: 37%-57%). The estimated pooled prevalence of eight major long COVID subtypes in COVID-19 positive individuals were 20% (respiratory), 20% (general fatigue), 18% (psychological), 16% (neurological), 12% (dermatological), 10% (cardiovascular), 9% (musculoskeletal) and 5% (gastrointestinal).

MeaningQuantitative evidence shows a persistent prevalence of long COVID globally, with a significant burden of symptoms 1 to 2 years post-infection, underscoring the need for having accurate and standardized diagnostic tests and biomarkers for long COVID, a better understanding of the physiology of the condition, its treatment, and its potential effect on healthcare needs and workforce participation. The heterogeneity and wide range of the prevalence estimates call for representative samples in well-designed follow-up studies of long COVID across the world.","NA","medrxiv",1736460509095

We demonstrate that applying these approaches to Actinomycetota - a phylum largely unexplored for antiphage defenses, can accurately predict previously unknown functional defense mechanisms, leading to the discovery and experimental validation of six defense systems with novel antiphage proteins.

Here, we extend a new class of biosensors for receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity, the pYtag system, to visualize endogenous RTK activity in Drosophila. We build biosensors for three Drosophila RTKs that function across developmental stages and tissues. By characterizing Torso::pYtag during terminal patterning in the early embryo, we find that Torso activity differs from downstream ERK activity in two surprising ways: Torso activity is narrowly restricted to the poles but produces a broader gradient of ERK, and Torso activity decreases over developmental time while ERK activity is sustained. This decrease in Torso activity is driven by ERK pathway-dependent negative feedback. Our results suggest an updated model of terminal patterning where a narrow domain of Torso activity, tuned in amplitude by negative feedback, locally activates signaling effectors which diffuse through the syncytial embryo to form the ERK gradient. Altogether, this work highlights the usefulness of pYtags for investigating receptor-level regulation of developmental patterning.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

While mechanisms preventing oxidative damage to membrane phospholipids are established, the vulnerability of LD neutral lipids to peroxidation and protective mechanisms are unknown. Here, we identify LD-localized Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1 (FSP1) as a critical regulator that prevents neutral lipid peroxidation by recycling coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) to its lipophilic antioxidant form. Lipidomics reveal that FSP1 loss leads to the accumulation of oxidized triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters, and biochemical reconstitution of FSP1 with CoQ10 and NADH suppresses triacylglycerol peroxidation in vitro. Notably, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich triacylglycerols enhance cancer cell sensitivity to FSP1 loss and inducing PUFA-rich LDs triggers triacylglycerol peroxidation and LD-initiated ferroptosis when FSP1 activity is impaired. These findings uncover the first LD lipid quality control pathway, wherein LD-localized FSP1 maintains neutral lipid integrity to prevent the buildup of oxidized lipids and induction of ferroptosis.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

Three of these genomes corresponded to potentially novel coronavirus species belonging to the alphacoronavirus genus. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that some of these viruses are closely related to coronaviruses previously described in bats from other countries, suggesting the existence of a shared viral reservoir worldwide. Using viral pseudotypes, we investigated the receptor usage of the identified viruses and found that one of them can use human and bat ACE2, highlighting its zoonotic potential. However, the receptor usage of the other viruses remains unknown. This study broadens our understanding of coronavirus diversity and identifies research priorities for the prevention of zoonotic viral outbreaks.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

Using scRNA-sequencing we identify a type of deep layer near projecting neuron that is most robustly regulated in the medial prefrontal cortex of female mice 24h after psilocybin. We show that this cell-type specificity does not align with 5-HT2A receptor expression but is consistent with the integrated signaling via cell-type specific 5-HT receptor co-expression patterns. Cell-cell communication reveals that psilocybin also broadly suppresses GABAergic inhibition. Ultimately, psilocybin induces plasticity-related genes in subsets of excitatory neurons suggesting that psilocybin induces sustained increases in neuroplasticity in the mouse mPFC.

Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) are a major class of plant Ca2+ channels, with 20 homologs in Arabidopsis. These tetrameric plasma membrane (PM) proteins are activated by diverse stimuli, such as phytohormones, extracellular damage and cell wall integrity signals. Here, we identify a novel class of plant-specific proteins, Armadillo Repeat Only (ARO), as essential regulators of possibly all plant CNGC channels. Abrogation of functional sporophytic AROs results in a phenotypic pattern reminiscent of CNGC dysfunction, including defects in root gravitropism, root hair growth and morphology, stomatal movement, and responses to extracellular ATP and the phytohormone auxin. aro2/3/4 mutants are fully resistant to the toxic effects caused by overexpression of CNGCs. AROs colocalize and physically interact with multiple CNGCs and modulate CNGC-dependent currents in Xenopus oocytes. Structural modeling suggests that AROs form a tetramer surrounding the CNGC channel. These findings highlight AROs as key plant-specific players in plant CNGC function and Ca2+ signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

Different signals, including auxin, extracellular ATP and RALF1 peptide, all induce cytosolic calcium transients and apoplastic ROS bursts. Genetic and optogenetic manipulations identified calcium transients as necessary and sufficient for ROS bursts via activation of NADPH oxidases RBOHC and RBOHF. Apoplastic ROS bursts are not required but rather limit the gravity-induced root bending. Root bending is sensed by stretch-activated calcium channel MCA1 leading to NADPH oxidase activation at the stretched side. The resulting ROS production stiffens cell wall for better soil penetration. Apoplastic ROS thus provides a means to balance tissue flexibility and stiffness to efficiently navigate soil.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

Current methods for quantifying bacterial biomass in stool, such as flow cytometry, qPCR, or spike-ins (i.e., adding cells or DNA from an organism not normally found in a sample), can be labor-intensive, costly, and confounded by factors like water content, DNA extraction efficiency, PCR inhibitors, and other technical challenges that add bias and noise. We propose a simple, cost-effective approach that circumvents some of these technical challenges: directly estimating bacterial biomass from metagenomes using bacterial-to-host (B:H) read ratios. We compare B:H ratios to the standard methods outlined above, demonstrating that B:H ratios are useful proxies for bacterial biomass in stool and possibly in other host-associated substrates. We show how B:H ratios can be used to track antibiotic treatment response and recovery in both mice and humans, which showed 403-fold and 45-fold reductions in bacterial biomass during antibiotic treatment, respectively. Our results indicate that host and bacterial metagenomic DNA fractions in human stool fluctuate longitudinally around a stable mean in healthy individuals, and the average host read fraction varies across healthy individuals by < 8-9 fold. B:H ratios offer a convenient alternative to other absolute biomass quantification methods, without the need for additional measurements, experimental design considerations, or machine learning algorithms, enabling retrospective absolute biomass estimates from existing stool metagenomic data.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

This was echoed in Prof. Rita Contis September 17, 2024, Senate Finance Committee testimony.

MethodsTo test the IRAs impacts on early-stage investments targeting therapeutics for the Medicare-aged population, a longitudinal dataset of commercially sponsored clinical trials by companies with a market valuation < $2 billion was obtained from the BioMedTracker database from January 1, 2018, to May 6, 2024. These trials were filtered to match early-stage investments to lead assets undergoing clinical development.

ResultsFrom 161 lead assets with 897 investments, we find the aggregated total into large molecules in 2024 was 10 times larger than that for small molecules, which underwent a 70% decline after passage of the IRA. Individual investments made into small molecules decline by minus one-half as exposure to the Medicare-aged population increases after the passage of the IRA (p < 0.0018). Testing large molecule investments by their exposure to Medicare post IRAs passage is statistically inconclusive.

Research ConclusionsThis study presents evidence of a decline in the development of new therapies targeting the Medicare-aged population since the passage of the IRA. If these impacts were due to the economic downturn post-pandemic, we would observe statistically similar results in both large and small molecules. However, the results by molecule type diverge. Investors perceive large molecules to be of a lower investment risk relative to small molecules after IRAs passage.","NA","medrxiv",1736460509095

However, continued surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines is important to ensure the safety of newly formulated vaccines. This study evaluated the association between vaccination with 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccines and multiple health outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older in the United States.

MethodsThe study used health plan data from the Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) claims database and extended from September 2023 to April 2024. We monitored the uptake of 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax), and where case counts were available, we used a self-controlled case series design to assess the association between vaccination and prespecified health outcomes. We used conditional Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs), attributable risks (ARs) and corresponding 99% confidence intervals (CIs). Analyses were adjusted for outcome seasonality, event-dependent observation time for outcomes with high case fatality rates, and outcome misclassification where feasible.

ResultsApproximately 7.6 million Medicare FFS beneficiaries received a 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccination. There was an even distribution of people who received Pfizer-BioNTech (3,689,356; 48.80%) or Moderna (3,841,245; 50.80%) vaccinations and very few who received Novavax (30,171; 0.40%). There was a statistically significant elevation in anaphylaxis risk associated with 2023-2024 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in the seasonality-adjusted analysis (IRR: [99% CI: 1.07, 15.30]) that was no longer statistically significant after accounting for potential outcome misclassification (IRR: 3.90 [99% CI: 0.49, 30.90]). Anaphylaxis cases attributable to 2023-2024 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination were rare (AR per 100,000 doses: 0.09 [99% CI: -0.08, 0.25]). No other statistically significant elevations in risk were observed.

ConclusionThere were no new safety signals identified following 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccinations among U.S. Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. A potential, but rare, elevation in anaphylaxis incidence rates following 2023-2024 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination was observed.

Yet, deciphering their molecular language - that is, understanding how protein sequences and structures encode and determine biological functions - remains a cornerstone challenge in modern biology. Here, we introduce Evola, an 80 billion frontier protein-language generative model designed to decode the molecular language of proteins. By integrating information from protein sequences, structures, and user queries, Evola generates precise and contextually nuanced insights into protein function. A key innovation of Evola lies in its training on an unprecedented AI-generated dataset: 546 million protein question-answer pairs and 150 billion word tokens, designed to reflect the immense complexity and functional diversity of proteins. Post-pretraining, Evola integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to refine the model based on preference signals and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for external knowledge incorporation, improving response quality and relevance. To evaluate its performance, we propose a novel framework, Instructional Response Space (IRS), demonstrating that Evola delivers expert-level insights, advancing research in proteomics and functional genomics while shedding light on the molecular logic encoded in proteins.

Recent work has implicated three brain areas in posterior cerebral cortex -- the place memory areas (PMAs) that are anterior to the three visual scene perception areas (SPAs) - in this function. However, PMAs relationship to the broader cortical hierarchy remains unclear due to limited group-level characterization. Here, we examined the PMA and SPA locations across three fMRI datasets (44 participants, 29 female). SPAs were identified using a standard visual localizer where participants viewed scenes versus faces. PMAs were identified by contrasting activity when participants recalled personally familiar places versus familiar faces (Datasets 1-2) or places versus multiple categories (familiar faces, bodies, and objects, and famous faces; Dataset 3). Across datasets, the PMAs were located anterior to the SPAs on the ventral and lateral cortical surfaces. The anterior displacement between PMAs and SPAs was highly reproducible. Compared to public atlases, the PMAs fell at the boundary between externally-oriented networks (dorsal attention) and internally-oriented networks (default mode). Additionally, while SPAs overlapped with retinotopic maps, the PMAs were consistently located anterior to mapped visual cortex. These results establish the anatomical position of the PMAs at inflection points along the cortical hierarchy between unimodal sensory and transmodal, apical regions, which informs broader theories of how the brain integrates perception and memory for scenes. We have released probabilistic parcels of these regions to facilitate future research into their roles in spatial cognition.

Significance statementComplex behavior requires the dynamic interplay between mnemonic and perceptual information. For example, navigation requires representation of the current visual scene and its relationship to the surrounding visuospatial context. We have suggested that the place memory areas, three brain areas located anterior to the scene perception areas in visual cortex, are well-positioned to serve this role. Here, in a large group of participants, we show that the place memory areas are robustly localizable, and that their position at the interface of multiple distributed brain networks is uniquely suited to mnemonic-perceptual integration. We have released probabilistic regions-of-interest and localization procedure so that others can identify these areas in their own participants.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

Hippocampal place cell populations over-represent salient locations in an animals environment, including those associated with rewards; however, how the spatial uncertainties impact the cognitive map is unclear. We report a virtual spatial navigation task designed to test the impact of different levels and types of uncertainty about reward on place cell populations. When the reward location changed on a trial-by-trial basis, inducing expected uncertainty, a greater proportion of place cells followed along, and the reward and the track end became anchors of a warped spatial metric. When the reward location then unexpectedly moved, the fraction of reward place cells that followed was greater when starting from a state of expected, compared to low, uncertainty. Overall, we show that different forms of potentially interacting uncertainty generate remapping in parallel, task-relevant, reference frames.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

Although locomotor CPGs have been extensively characterized, it remains unknown how the neuronal populations composing them interact to generate adaptive rhythms. We explored the non-linear cooperation dynamics among the three main populations of ipsilaterally projecting spinal CPG neurons - V1, V2a, V2b neurons - in scratch reflex rhythmogenesis. Ablation of all three neuronal subtypes reduced the oscillation frequency. Activation of excitatory V2a neurons enhanced the oscillation frequency, while activating inhibitory V1 neurons caused atonia. These findings required the development of a novel neuromechanical model that consists of flexor and extensor modules coupled via inhibition, in which rhythm in each module is generated by self-bursting excitatory populations and accelerated by intra-module inhibition. Inter-module inhibition coordinates the phases of flexor and extensor activity and slows the oscillations, while facilitation mechanisms in excitatory neurons explain the V2a activation-driven increase in frequency.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

Two narrow host range plasmids, pbla and pConj, have contributed to ending penicillin and tetracycline therapy, respectively, and undermine current prevention strategies including Doxy-PEP. Here, we investigated the origin and evolution of the beta-lactamase plasmid, pbla. We show that the interplay between pbla and pConj influences their co-occurrence and the spread of pbla in the gonococcal population. We demonstrate that pbla was acquired by the gonococcus on at least two occasions from Haemophilus ducreyi, and describe the subsequent evolutionary pathways taken by the three major pbla variants. Changes that mitigate fitness costs of pbla and the emergence of TEM beta-lactamases which confer increased resistance have contributed to the success of pbla. In particular, TEM-135, which has arisen in certain pbla variants, increases resistance to beta-lactams and only requires one amino acid change to become an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). The evolution of pbla underscores the threat of plasmid-mediated resistance to current therapeutic and preventive strategies against gonococcal infection. Given the close relationship between pbla and pConj, widespread use of Doxy-PEP is likely to promote spread of pConj and pbla, and emergence of plasmid-mediated ESBL in the gonococcus, with dire public health consequences.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

ME/CFS symptoms can range from mild to severe, and include immune system effects alongside incapacitating fatigue and post-exertional disease exacerbation. In this study, we examined immunological profiles of people living with ME/CFS by flow cytometry, focusing on cytotoxic cells, to determine whether people with mild/moderate (n= 43) or severe ME/CFS (n=53) expressed different immunological markers. We found that people with mild/moderate ME/CFS had increased expression of cytotoxic effector molecules alongside enhanced proportions of early-immunosenescence cells, determined by the CD28-CD57- phenotype, indicative of persistent viral infection. In contrast, people with severe ME/CFS had higher proportions of activated circulating lymphocytes, determined by CD69+ and CD38+ expression, and expressed more pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN{gamma}, TNF and IL-17, following stimulation in vitro, indicative of prolonged non-specific inflammation. These changes were consistent across different cell types including CD8+ T cells, mucosal associated invariant T cells and Natural Killer cells, indicating generalised altered cytotoxic responses across the innate and adaptive immune system. These immunological differences likely reflect different disease pathogenesis mechanisms occurring in the two clinical groups, opening up opportunities for the development of prognostic markers and stratified treatments.

Current immunization-based, display-based, and computational approaches for discovering binders are laborious and time-consuming - taking months or more, suffer from high false positives - necessitating extensive secondary screening, and have a high failure rate, especially for disordered proteins and other challenging target classes. Here we establish Phage-Assisted Non-Continuous Selection of Protein Binders (PANCS-binders), an in vivo selection platform that links the life cycle of M13 phage to target protein binding though customized proximity-dependent split RNA polymerase biosensors, allowing for complete and comprehensive high-throughput screening of billion-plus member protein variant libraries with high signal-to-noise. We showcase the utility of PANCS-Binders by screening multiple protein libraries each against a panel of 95 separate therapeutically relevant targets, thereby individually assessing over 10^11 protein-protein interaction pairs, completed in two days. These selections yielded large, high-quality datasets and hundreds of novel binders, which we showed can be affinity matured or directly used in mammalian cells to inhibit or degrade targets. PANCS-Binders dramatically accelerates and simplifies the binder discovery process, the democratization of which will help unlock new creative potential in proteome-targeting with engineered binder-based biotechnologies.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

Lsr2 is a nucleoid-associated protein that interacts with DNA in vivo and regulates many genes. Purified Lsr2 forms nucleoprotein filaments with DNA molecules leading to highly compacted DNA conformations. However, the physical mechanism underlying Lsr2-mediated DNA compaction, resulting in gene regulation, remains elusive. We employed a combination of biochemical assay, single-molecule imaging, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the governing principles of Lsr2-mediated DNA compaction. We show that, while Lsr2 alone undergoes phase separation, addition of DNA substantially lowers the required concentration for its phase separation. Strikingly, our single-molecule and simulation data establish that Lsr2 forms condensates with long stretches of AT-rich DNA, providing strong evidence for sequence-dependent co-condensation. This observation is contrary to the classical view of sequence-dependent binding of individual protein molecules to DNA, our findings rather suggest that protein-DNA co-condensates  sense the average binding energy landscape. We present a physical model for Lsr2-mediated DNA compaction and gene regulation, describing a novel mechanism for NAP-mediated genome organization in bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

We evaluated the performance of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) guided by prompt instructions and chain of thought (CoT) for this task.

MethodsFrom consecutive transthoracic echocardiographies performed in our center, we utilized 200 random reports from 2019 for prompt optimization and 1000 from 2023 for evaluation. Five instruction-tuned LLMs (Qwen2.0-72B, Llama3.0-70B, Mixtral8-46.7B, Llama3.0-8B, and Phi3.0-3.8B) were guided by prompt instructions with and without CoT to classify prosthetic valve presence and VHD severity. Performance was evaluated using classification metrics against expert-labeled ground truth. Mean Squared Error (MSE) was also calculated for predicted severitys deviation from actual severity.

ResultsWith CoT prompting, Llama3.0-70B and Qwen2.0 achieved the highest performance (accuracy: 99.1% and 98.9% for VHD severity; 100% and 99.9% for prosthetic valve; MSE: 0.02 and 0.05, respectively). Smaller models showed lower accuracy for VHD severity (54.1-85.9%) but maintained high accuracy for prosthetic valve detection (>96%). CoT reasoning yielded higher accuracy for larger models while increasing processing time from 2-25 to 67-154 seconds per report. Based of CoT reasonings, the wrong predictions were mainly due to model outputs being influenced by irrelevant information in the text or failure to follow the prompt instructions.

ConclusionsOur study demonstrates the near-perfect performance of open-source LLMs for automated echocardiography report interpretation with purpose of registry formation and disease surveillance. While larger models achieved exceptional accuracy through prompt optimization, practical implementation requires balancing performance with computational efficiency.","NA","medrxiv",1736460509095

Changes in gene expression play a critical role in the cellular response to hypoxia, enabling cells to adapt to reduced oxygen availability by regulating metabolism, angiogenesis, and survival pathways. These changes are primarily mediated by the HIF family of transcription factors, however other transcription factors such as NF-kappaB, are also activated in the hypoxic response. Although NF-kappaB is known to be activated under hypoxic conditions the extent of NF-kappaB contributions to the hypoxic response remains poorly understood. In this study we analyse hypoxia-induced NF-kappaB dependent gene expression, to define the NF-kappaB-dependent hypoxic signature. Our analysis reveals that a significant proportion of hypoxia-induced gene expression changes are NF-kappaB dependent, with majority of the hypoxia downregulated genes requiring NF-kappaB for their repression. We show that, while the NF-kappaB-mediated hypoxic response may vary between cell types, there are a core subset of hypoxia inducible genes that require NF-kappaB across multiple cell backgrounds. We demonstrate that NF-kappaB is critical for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and regulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation under hypoxic conditions. This work highlights that NF-kappaB has a central role in hypoxia response, regulating a broader set of genes than previously thought, providing new understanding into the gene expression regulation by hypoxia and NF-kappaB.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

We used electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of NDH-2 from Mycobacterium smegmatis, a fast-growing non-pathogenic model for respiration in M. tuberculosis, both alone and in complex with a 2-mercapto-quinazolinone inhibitor. The structure shows that active mycobacterial NDH-2 is dimeric, with the dimerization interface stabilized by an extended C-terminal  helix not found in NDH-2 from other bacterial genera. The arrangement of monomers in the dimer differs from the arrangement described for other prokaryotic NDH-2 dimers, instead resembling dimers formed by NDH-2 in eukaryotes. Density for the 2-mercapto-quinazolinone in the menaquinone-binding site shows that the inhibitor blocks menaquinone reduction through direct interaction with the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor.

However, due to the non-linear relationship between disease liability and disease prevalence, risk variants have more severe phenotypic consequences in high-risk polygenic backgrounds. Consequently, selecting individuals with appropriate polygenic backgrounds may improve variant characterization experiments, as disease-relevant phenotypes may be masked or revealed in different genomic contexts. Simultaneously, selection has limited power to eliminate risk variants because they have minimal impact in low polygenic risk backgrounds, yet is more powerful with higher polygenicity because more individuals achieve genetic and phenotypic extremes. This dependence on polygenic background means that selection acting on an allele should be modeled as a distribution that differs across populations, time, environments, and individuals rather than as a single value.

However, systematic understanding remains limited due to the rarity, genetic heterogeneity, and complex genotype-phenotype relationships of these diseases. Primary ciliopathies are a diverse group of rare disorders caused by variants in genes associated with the cilium, a cellular organelle involved in signaling during development and cell homeostasis. These genetic variants result in a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes involving the brain, eye, kidney and skeleton. It remains unclear to what extent this phenotypic diversity can be attributed to the disease-causing genes and their specific roles in ciliary function. Here, we systematically compared human primary ciliopathies with each other and with mouse phenotypes by propagating known disease genes through a network of protein interactions. Network propagation improved the clustering of primary ciliopathies with shared clinical phenotypes and facilitated the identification of mouse phenotypes closely related to primary ciliopathies due to shared groups of proteins in the interaction network. By leveraging this phenotype-specific approach, we prioritized candidate genes for ciliopathies and identified likely pathogenic variants in CEP43, a novel candidate gene for human primary ciliopathies in three previously unsolved cases. This study demonstrates that network propagation enhances the genetic and phenotypic understanding of primary ciliopathies, aiding in the prioritization of candidate genes and identification of relevant mouse models for these rare disorders, and providing a framework for unraveling shared underlying mechanisms for other rare genetic diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

Using high-throughput dilution-to-extinction cultivation, we isolated and genome sequenced five new and diverse SAR116 isolates from the northern Gulf of Mexico. Here we present a comparative physiological analysis of these SAR116 isolates, along with a pangenomic investigation of the SAR116 clade using a combination of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs, n=258), single-amplified genomes (SAGs, n=84), previously existing (n=2), and new isolate genomes (n=5), totaling 349 SAR116 genomes. Phylogenomic investigation supported the division of SAR116 into three distinct subclades, each with additional structure totalling 15 monophyletic groups. Our SAR116 isolates belonged to three groups within subclade I representing distinct genera with different morphologies and varied phenotypic responses to salinity and temperature. Overall, SAR116 genomes encoded differences in vitamin and amino acid synthesis, trace metal transport, and osmolyte synthesis and transport. They also had genetic potential for diverse sulfur oxidation metabolisms, placing SAR116 at the confluence of the organic and inorganic sulfur pools. SAR116 subclades showed distinct patterns in habitat preferences across open ocean, coastal, and estuarine environments, and three of our isolates represented the most abundant coastal and estuarine subclade. This investigation provides the most comprehensive exploration of SAR116 to date anchored by new culture genomes and physiology.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

In Escherichia coli, the TonB-ExbBD motor complex energizes the TonB-dependent transporter FecA, facilitating ferric citrate import. FecA also functions as a sensor, transmitting signals to the cytoplasmic membrane protein FecR. We previously demonstrated that FecR undergoes a three-step cleavage process, culminating in the activation of the cytoplasmic sigma factor FecI, which drives fec gene transcription. Here, we describe the complete mechanism of FecR cleavage-mediated ferric citrate signaling involving FecA and TonB. The cleavage cascade begins with FecR autoproteolysis prior to membrane integration. The soluble C-terminal domain (CTD) fragment of FecR is co-translocated with the N-terminal domain (NTD) fragment through a Tat system-mediated process. In the periplasm, the interaction between the CTD and NTD fragments prevents further cleavage. This inhibition is lifted by TonB-mediated motor function, which releases the CTD, allowing the cleavage cascade to proceed. This process is essential for ferric citrate signal-induced activation of fec gene expression. Our findings reveal that the regulation of FecR cleavage, relying on the TonB-FecA axis, plays a central role in bacterial response to ferric citrate signals.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

Here, using live imaging of second trimester human fetal tissue and cortical organoids, we identify a two-step mode of translocation for bRG cell colonization of the human neocortex. bRG cells undergo a microtubule-dependent movement during interphase, called interphasic somal translocation (IST), and an acto-myosin dependent movement prior to cytokinesis, called mitotic somal translocation (MST). IST is controlled by the LINC complex that recruits the dynein motor and its activator LIS1 to the nuclear envelope for transport, and is altered in LIS1 patient organoids. MST occurs during prometaphase and is a mitotic spindle translocation event. It is controlled by the mitotic cell rounding molecular pathway, via ERMs and Vimentin, driving translocation. 85% of bRG cell translocation is due to IST, for a total movement of 0,67 mm per month of human fetal gestation. Our work identifies how bRG cells colonize the human fetal cortex, and further shows how these mechanisms are conserved in migrating glioblastoma cells.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

We find that different CAR/antigen sizes, which are generated by different CAR architectures and different target antigens, require a different CD2/CD58 size to optimise sensitivity. This extracellular size-matching improves antigen engagement and co-localisation of CAR/antigen and CD2/CD58 complexes. We also find that size-matching controls co-inhibition of CARs by PD-1/PD-L1.

Differential diagnosis is complicated in children and adolescents by their overlapping clinical features (signs, symptoms, and complete blood count results). Few studies have directly compared the three diseases. We assessed clinical features of cases aged 2-17 years experiencing these diseases.

MethodsWe characterized 1,405 dengue, 517 chikungunya, and 522 Zika pediatric cases occurring from January 2006 through December 2023 in a Nicaraguan cohort study. Clinical records and laboratory results across the first 10 days of illness were examined from a primary care health center. All cases were laboratory-confirmed. Data were analyzed with generalized additive models, generalized mixed models, and machine learning models.

FindingsThe prevalence of many clinical features exhibited by dengue, chikungunya, and Zika cases differed substantially overall, by age, and by day of illness. Dengue cases were differentiated most by abdominal pain, leukopenia, nausea/vomiting, and basophilia; chikungunya cases were differentiated most by arthralgia and the absence of leukopenia and papular rash; and Zika cases were differentiated most by rash and lack of fever and lymphocytopenia. Dengue and chikungunya cases exhibited similar temperature dynamics during acute illness, and their temperatures were higher than Zika cases. Sixty-two laboratory-confirmed afebrile dengue cases, which would not be captured by any widely used international case definition, presented very similarly to afebrile Zika cases, though some exhibited warning signs of disease severity. The presence of arthralgia, the presence of basophilia, and the absence of fever were the most important model-based predictors of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika, respectively.

InterpretationsThese findings substantially update our understanding of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in children while identifying various clinical features that could improve differential diagnoses. The occurrence of afebrile dengue warrants reconsideration of current case definitions.

Research in contextEvidence before this study: Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are mosquito-borne diseases that co-occur in tropical and subtropical settings and give rise to fever, rash, and a variety of other clinical features. We reviewed the most widely used international case definitions for the three diseases - established by either the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO); PAHOs 2022 report on differential diagnosis and treatment options for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika; and the 80 studies underlying PAHOs diagnostic recommendations. The available evidence suggests that dengue, chikungunya, and Zika have a broad and overlapping set of clinical manifestations that hamper differential diagnosis, and hence case management, in the absence of definitive laboratory testing. This similarity in disease presentation is believed to be especially characteristic of the first few days of illness. Most of the studies on the diseases clinical manifestations are in adult populations, and these studies constitute the main evidence base for the existing case definitions. For example, only one of the 80 studies summarized in PAHOs recent report provided direct comparisons of the clinical features across cases experiencing dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, and that study mainly focused on adults. Disease presentation is more non-specific in children and adolescents than in adults, further impeding differential diagnoses in pediatric populations. Current guidelines suggest that the presence of thrombocytopenia, progressive increases in hematocrit, and leukopenia tend to distinguish dengue from chikungunya and Zika; that arthralgia is more common in chikungunya; and that pruritis is more common in Zika. Fever is considered a defining feature of dengue, such that all case definitions in widespread use for the disease require that patients exhibit fever. However, existing but limited evidence suggests that dengue cases can very rarely present without fever.

Added value of this study: This study follows a cohort of Nicaraguan children through multiple dengue epidemics, two large chikungunya epidemics, and one explosive Zika epidemic. By synthesizing 18 years worth of primary care medical records, we find clinically meaningful differences in the prevalence of many clinical features, including by day of illness and across age, but not by sex. In addition to verifying the clinical features PAHO identified as key distinguishing features, we also identified others, including papular rash, nausea, hemorrhagic manifestations, abdominal pain, and basophilia, that could aid differential diagnoses. As the PAHO report is based on a multitude of studies with varied age ranges, health care accessibility, overall research quality, and patient populations, this study is a complementary and important counterpart that draws from a single, well-characterized source population.

Further, we identified 62 laboratory-confirmed cases of afebrile dengue (7{middle dot}2% of all dengue cases since we started testing any suspected case exhibiting afebrile rash). The disease manifestations of afebrile dengue cases were generally clinically indistinguishable from afebrile Zika, although several displayed warning signs of severity. We found that cases of the three diseases exhibited different temperature dynamics across the acute period of illness. Machine learning models were best able to distinguish chikungunya (an alphaviral disease) from dengue and Zika (flaviviral diseases) based on clinical features alone. Our dengue model performed well, especially in classifying febrile dengue cases. However, our Zika model struggled to properly distinguish afebrile dengue cases from afebrile Zika cases, likely due to their very similar and minimal disease presentation.

Implications of all the available evidence: Despite clinical overlap in the pediatric manifestations of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, we identify meaningful differences in their presentation and in laboratory markers that can be leveraged to improve diagnoses in the absence of definitive laboratory-based diagnostic testing. Afebrile dengue should be studied more and incorporated into future case definitions, as not accounting for its existence can impede surveillance, laboratory testing strategies, clinical management, and research efforts.","NA","medrxiv",1736460509095

After predicting their interaction using an in-silico model, we verified the direct interaction between ANGPTL3 and PCSK9 through co-immunoprecipitation. The ANGPTL3-PCSK9 complex persisted under fasting conditions and dissociated under feeding conditions. Treatment with human LDLs was sufficient to simulate the feeding response. Then, we observed that the overexpression of PCSK9 enhances the uptake of LDLs that are not further metabolized, while the overexpression of ANGPTL3 enhances LDL turnover. The overexpression of both proteins restored LDL uptake and degradation, which became comparable to those of control cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate the existence of an ANGPTL3-PCSK9 complex, which coordinately contributes to the regulation of intracellular lipid homeostasis, aiming to prevent cellular metabolic overload.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

However, the mechanisms linking mechanical cues to ECM remodelling and invasion remain incompletely understood. Here, using an in-situ stiffening model that allows for modulation of ECM stiffness around fully formed normal mammary acini embedded in their native ECM microenvironment, we identify critical steps in basement membrane (BM) and stromal ECM remodelling during invasion and discover the molecular mechanisms driving this process. We find that stiffening of the ECM around normal mammary acini results in rapid loss and degradation of laminin (LN) and upregulation of the fibronectin (FN) secretion around the acini. This priming phase is followed by the onset of invasion which requires localized upregulation of LN production and ECM remodelling. Mechanistically, ECM production and remodelling as well as invasion is mediated by {beta}1 integrin-FAK signalling, which activates mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs). Further, we identify Piezo1 as the MSC downstream of {beta}1 integrin-FAK that drives BM disruption and stromal ECM remodelling. Taken together, our results identify the mechanisms by which stiffness can trigger invasive phenotypes from normal tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

However, generating new spatial transcriptomics data is expensive and technically demanding, and analyzing such data requires advanced bioinformatics expertise. While publicly available datasets are growing rapidly, existing databases offer limited tools for interactive exploration and cross-sample comparisons.

Here, we introduce DeepSpaceDB, a next-generation spatial transcriptomics database designed to address these issues. DeepSpaceDB focuses on interactivity and advanced analytical functionality, enabling users to explore spatial transcriptomics data with unprecedented flexibility. DeepSpaceDB allows for interactive selection and comparison of gene expression across regions within a single tissue slice or between slices, such as comparing hippocampal regions of an Alzheimers model mouse and a control. It also includes quality indicators, database-wide trends, and advanced visualizations that provide real-time interactivity, such as zoomable plots and hover-based information display.

The current version of DeepSpaceDB focuses explicitly on samples of the 10X Genomics Visium platform, ensuring higher-quality analyses and enhanced exploration tools, including comparison between interactively selected regions of tissue sections. This tradeoff enables unique features like similarity-based sample embeddings and database-wide comparisons, setting it apart from other databases prioritizing broad platform coverage over functionality.

With its combination of advanced tools and interactive capabilities, DeepSpaceDB represents a transformative resource for spatial transcriptomics research, paving the way for deeper insights into tissue organization and disease biology.

In the post-synthetic steps specific to ergosterol biosynthesis, we find that successive modifications act to oscillate ordering capacity, settling on a level that supports phase separation while retaining fluidity of the resulting domains.

However, as single-cell FMs begin to train on increasingly large corpora, significant privacy and ethical concerns arise. Moreover, unlike text data, single-cell data is unordered and exhibits a unique tabular structure that most existing single-cell FMs overlook. In this study, we propose Tabula, a privacy-preserving and tabular-structure aware FM designed with federated learning (FL) and tabular modeling. Tabula combines the advantages of FMs and FL, enabling collaborative model training across multiple clients without compromising data privacy. In contrast to earlier single-cell FMs--which treat single-cell data like natural language (viewing cells as ""words"" defined by genes)--Tabula introduces a novel pretraining strategy that explicitly models the tabular structure of single-cell data. Extensive experimental results show that Tabula outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various downstream tasks (including cell type annotation, gene imputation, gene perturbation, multi-batch integration, and multi-omics integration) while requiring only half the data for pretraining and preserving data privacy. Furthermore, Tabula accurately reveals pairwise and even combinatorial regulatory logic across diverse biological systems, including hematopoiesis, pancreatic endogenesis, neurogenesis, and cardiogenesis.

To address this, we tagged engram cells in the auditory cortex during tone fear conditioning and compared their dendritic and somatic properties with neighbouring non-engram cells. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we show that tuft dendrites of engram cells had dampened, but synchronous, activity during recall. Ex vivo patch-clamp recordings illustrated that engram cells were preferentially connected with neighbouring engram cells and had decreased excitability due to a transient increase in Ih current.

Together with slow oscillations (SOs), they are thought to play a mechanistic role in the consolidation of learned information. The quantity and spatial distribution of spindles has been linked to brain activity during learning before sleep and to memory performance after sleep. If spindles are drawn to cortical areas excited through pre-sleep learning tasks, this begs the question whether the spatial distribution of spindles is flexible, and whether their regional expression can also be manipulated with experimental brain stimulation. We used excitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to stimulate the left and right motor cortex in a repeated-measures experimental design. After stimulation, we recorded high-density electroencephalography (EEG) during sleep to test how local stimulation modulated the regional expression of sleep spindles. Indeed, we show that excitatory tDCS of local cortical sites before sleep biases the expression of spindles to the excited locations during subsequent sleep. No effects of localised tDCS excitation were seen for SOs. These results demonstrate that the spatial topography of sleep spindles is neither hard-wired nor random, with spindles being flexibly directed to exogenously excited cortical circuits.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

The epidemic remains uncontrolled, with spillbacks into poultry, wild birds and other mammals including humans. Here, we present molecular and virological evidence that the cattle B3.13 genotype H5N1 viruses rapidly accumulated adaptations in polymerase genes that enabled better replication in bovine cells, as well as cells of other mammalian species including humans and pigs. We find evidence of several mammalian adaptations gained early in the evolution of these viruses in cattle including PB2 M631L, which is found in all cattle sequences, and PA K497R, which is found in the majority. Structurally, PB2 M631L maps to the polymerase-ANP32 interface, an essential host factor for viral genome replication. We show this mutation adapts the virus to co-opt bovine ANP32 proteins and thereby enhances virus replication in bovine and primary human airway cells. Importantly, we show that ongoing evolution during 2024 in the PB2 gene, including a convergently arising D740N substitution, further increases polymerase activity in a range of mammalian cells. Thus, the continued circulation of H5N1 in dairy cattle allows virus adaption improving replicative ability in cattle and increasing zoonotic spillover risk.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

Because they can separate metabolic tasks among different strains, synthetic microbial consortia have myriad applications in developing biomaterials, biomanufacturing, and biotherapeutics. However, synthetic consortia often require burdensome control mechanisms to ensure that the members of the community remain at the correct proportions. This is especially true in continuous culture systems in which slight differences in growth rates can lead to extinctions. Here, we present a simple method for controlling consortia proportions using cross-feeding in continuous auxotrophic co-culture. We use mutually auxotrophic \emph{E.\ coli} with different essential gene deletions and regulate the growth rates of members of the consortium via cross-feeding of the missing nutrients in each strain. We demonstrate precise regulation of the co-culture steady-state ratio by exogenous addition of the missing nutrients. We also model the co-culture's behavior using a system of ordinary differential equations that enable us to predict its response to changes in nutrient concentrations. Our work provides a powerful tool for consortia proportion control with minimal metabolic costs to the constituent strains.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

Most carbon fixation in these systems is thought to be driven by plant and microbial photosynthesis, whereas chemosynthetic processes are assumed to play a minor role. However, these ecosystems often contain anoxic environments ideal for chemosynthetic microbes such as acetogens. Here, we show that acetogens are abundant and active mediators of carbon sequestration in tidal wetland soils by pairing gene- and genome-resolved metagenomic analysis with isolation and analysis of gas-fermenting acetogens in bioreactors. Metagenomic profiling revealed that diverse microbes can mediate carbon fixation, primarily through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle and Wood-Ljungdahl pathways. These include various bacteria and archaea capable of reductive acetogenesis. On this basis, we grew bacterial enrichment cultures from tidal wetland soils using the gases hydrogen and CO2 as the sole energy and carbon sources. Bioreactor analysis revealed that these enrichments are dominated by clostridial acetogens that grow rapidly by converting CO2 into acetate and other products. Collectively, these results reveal Blue Carbon ecosystems harbour communities that can exclusively subsist by using CO2 as their sole electron acceptor and for carbon fixation, thereby providing evidence of a novel carbon sink pathway within these ecosystems beyond the known mechanisms of photosynthetic carbon fixation and soil sequestration. Additionally, the discovery and isolation of these chemosynthetic communities provide opportunities for developing further mechanisms of CO2 removal through industrial gas fermentation.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

Bioinformatic algorithms are widely used to analyze next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, but they face two major challenges. First, these pipelines are highly complex, involving multiple steps and the integration of various tools. Second, they generate features that are human-interpretable but often result in information loss by focusing only on predefined genetic properties. This limitation restricts the full potential of NGS data in biomarker extraction and slows the discovery of new biomarkers in precision oncology. Methods: We propose an end-to-end deep learning (DL) approach for analyzing NGS data. Specifically, we developed a multiple instance learning DL framework that integrates somatic mutation sequences to predict two compound biomarkers: microsatellite instability (MSI) and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). To achieve this, we utilized data from 3,184 cancer patients obtained from two public databases: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Clinical Proteome Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). Results: Our proposed deep learning method demonstrated high accuracy in identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. For predicting MSI status, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.98, a sensitivity of 0.95, and a specificity of 1.00 on an external validation cohort. For predicting HRD status, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.80, a sensitivity of 0.75, and a specificity of 0.86. Furthermore, the deep learning approach significantly outperformed traditional machine learning methods in both tasks (MSI accuracy, p-value = 5.11x10-18; HRD accuracy, p-value = 1.07x10-10). Using explainability techniques, we demonstrated that the model's predictions are based on biologically meaningful features, aligning with key DNA damage repair mutation signatures. Conclusion: We demonstrate that deep learning can identify patterns in unfiltered somatic mutations without the need for manual feature extraction. This approach enhances the detection of actionable targets and paves the way for developing NGS-based biomarkers using minimally processed data.

This niche diversity is mediated by bacterial effectors injected via the two type 3 secretion systems (T3SS). Salmonella resides either within membrane-bound Salmonella-containing vacuoles (SCV) or they grow rapidly within the cytosol upon SCV rupture. Recently, we identified a third intracellular subpopulation, dormant Salmonella within modified vacuoles in epithelial cells, which can survive for up to 7 days in vitro. To explore how bacterial effectors influence the balance of these three subpopulations, we constructed a panel of mutants lacking genes encoding key effectors and examined their intracellular behaviors at 6 and 24 hours post-infection (hpi). Deletion of the T3SS-2 effector SifA significantly increased the dormant subpopulation at later infection time points, identifying SifA as the first known effector regulating bacterial dormancy in epithelial cells. SifA-induced Salmonella-induced filaments (SIFs) characterize the mature Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV), and we observed that SIFs were needed for intravacuolar growth of Salmonella. We could show that SIF formation was critical for nutrient acquisition within the SCV; inhibition of SIF formation resulted in a higher proportion of dormant bacteria, akin to the effect of reduced glucose availability during infection. Both bacterial and host glycolysis pathways were required to prevent dormancy, as proper nutrient scavenging through SIF-mediated modification of the SCV is essential for maintaining a replicative, non-dormant state. These results underscore the importance of nutrient access, facilitated by reprogramming host endomembrane trafficking, for Salmonella to avoid dormancy and sustain active replication within its intracellular niche.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

A critical aspect of this defence relies on regulatory mechanisms that control the activation of immune responses, ensuring these are efficient yet do not compromise overall plant performance. Many pathogens secrete proteins called effectors to manipulate plant cellular functions, suppressing plant immunity and promoting infection. Here, we show that the bacterial effector RipAV, secreted by the soil-borne bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, hijacks a major immune signalling hub to suppress immune responses. RipAV targets members of the plant-specific ubiquitin ligase (PUB) family and calcium-dependent protein kinase 28 (CPK28), which has been shown to phosphorylate a set of PUBs to enhance their activity and regulate the stability of the key immune regulator BIK1. RipAV association enhances the CPK28-mediated phosphorylation of PUBs, inducing the proteasome-mediated degradation of BIK1 and the suppression of immunity. Importantly, we found that RipAV is required for maintaining a low accumulation of BIK1 during a R. solanacearum infection. These findings provide new insights into the sophisticated strategies employed by pathogens to subvert plant immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

Most previous studies profiling tandem repeats genome-wide have reduced the description of each locus to the singular value of the length of the entire repetitive locus. Here we introduce a comprehensive database of 3.6 billion tandem repeat allele sequences from over one thousand individuals using HiFi long-read sequencing. We show that the previously identified pathogenic loci are among the most variable tandem repeat loci in the genome, when incorporating nucleotide resolution sequence content to measure the longest pure motif segment. More broadly, we introduce a novel measure, ""tandem repeat constraint"", that assists in distinguishing potentially pathogenic from benign loci. Our approach of measuring variation as ""the length of the longest pure segment"" successfully prioritizes pathogenic repeats within their previously published linkage regions. We also present evidence for two novel pathogenic repeat expansion candidates. In summary, this analysis significantly clarifies the potential for short tandem repeat pathogenicity at over 1.7 million tandem repeat loci and will aid the identification of disease-causing repeat expansions.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

The rate of mutations depends on the mutation type (e.g., A-to-C, A-to-G, etc.) and can vary between sites in the viral genome. Understanding this variation can shed light on the mutational processes at play, and is crucial for quantitative modeling of viral evolution. Using the millions of available SARS-CoV-2 full-genome sequences, we estimate rates of synonymous mutations for all 12 possible nucleotide mutation types and examine how much these rates vary between sites. We find a surprisingly high level of variability and several striking patterns: the rates of four mutation types suddenly increase at one of two gene boundaries; the rates of most mutation types strongly depend on a site's local sequence context, with up to 56-fold differences between contexts; consistent with a previous study, the rates of some mutation types are lower at sites engaged in RNA secondary structure. A simple log-linear model of these features explains ~15-60% of the fold-variation of mutation rates between sites, depending on mutation type; more complex models only modestly improve predictive power out of sample. We estimate the fitness effect of each mutation based on the number of times it actually occurs versus the number of times it is expected to occur based on the model. We identify several small regions of the genome where synonymous or noncoding mutations occur much less often than expected, indicative of strong purifying selection on the RNA sequence that is independent of protein sequence. Overall, this work expands our basic understanding of SARS-CoV-2's evolution by characterizing the virus's mutation process at the level of individual sites and uncovering several striking mutational patterns that arise from unknown mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

This process is known as higher-order conditioning and can be measured using sensory preconditioning tasks in rodents. This behavioral paradigm requires the repeated and simultaneous presentation of two low-salience stimuli, such as a light and a tone, followed by a devaluation phase where one stimulus is paired with an unconditioned stimulus, such as a mild footshock. The outcome is a conditioned response (i.e. freezing response) to both the conditioned stimulus (direct learning) and the non-conditioned stimulus (mediated learning). In our study, we set up a successful light-tone sensory preconditioning task in male and female mice. Sex differences were seen on the number of conditioning sessions required to acquire mediated learning and in the behavioral responses observed in certain control experimental groups. We used in vivo calcium imaging to characterize the activity of hippocampal neurons in the dorsal and ventral subregions of the hippocampus when associations between low-salience stimuli and reinforcers occur. Finally, we combined our sensory preconditioning task with chemogenetic approaches to assess the role of these two hippocampal subregions in mediated learning. Our results indicate that dorsal, but not ventral, CaMKII-positive cells mediate the encoding of low-salience stimuli during the preconditioning phase.

In our pre-clinical model, sub-chronic stress exacerbated subsequently induced inflammatory pain and accelerated the development of comorbid anxiety. DNA methylation analysis of spinal cord tissue after stress exposure revealed hypomethylation in the Fkbp5 promoter site for the canonical FKBP51 transcript and other stress-related genes. However, most epigenetic changes in key regulatory regions did not correlate with changes in gene expression assessed by RNA sequencing, suggesting that stress exposure had remodeled the epigenome without altering gene activity and primed genes for hyper-responsiveness to future challenges. FKBP51 inhibition during stress exposure reduced the exacerbation of inflammatory pain by stress and reversed several stress-induced DNA methylation changes in promoter regions of genes associated with stress and nociception, including Rtn4, Cdk5 and Nrxn1, but not Fkbp5. These results indicate that sub-chronic stress leads to the hypomethylation of Fkbp5 and increased susceptibility to chronic pain driven by FKBP51, but reversing Fkbp5 hypomethylation is not necessary to prevent chronic pain vulnerability, which is likely driven by complex epigenetic regulation of multiple stress-regulated genes.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

To address this, we conducted a comparative analysis of denitrification genes in 48,284 genomes and assessed their environmental distribution in 3,991 metagenomes covering all major biomes. We determined that the genomic potential to initiate denitrification is more common than the potential to terminate it, particularly in high nitrate or nitrite environments, and that partial denitrifiers outnumber complete denitrifiers across the majority of biomes. Our results further indicate that complete denitrifiers are more likely to be fast-growing organisms compared to partial denitrifiers, indicating the former may grow opportunistically when conditions are favorable. Together, our results indicate an environmental footprint on the gain and loss of denitrification genes which favors the genomic potential for partial over complete denitrification in most biomes, in line with the scarcity of high carbon input rates that might favor organisms encoding complete denitrification.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

It is debated whether M1 actively participates in generating the activity pattern or it only passively reflects patterned inputs. Furthermore, it is unclear whether this learned activity pattern causally drives the learned movement. We addressed these issues using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging combined with holographic optogenetic stimulation of specific ensembles of M1 L2/3 neurons in mice engaged in a skilled lever-press task. We briefly and synchronously stimulated [~]20 neurons whose activity onset in voluntary trials precedes movement onsets. This stimulation, despite lacking temporal patterns, induced movements that resembled the learned movement, while producing spatiotemporal activity patterns in other M1 neurons not directly stimulated that resembled the activity during the voluntary learned movement. Trial-by-trial variability of optogenetically triggered population activity in the non-target neurons correlated with the variability in the induced movements. These trial-by-trial variabilities were predicted by the initial state of M1 population activity immediately preceding the optogenetic stimulation. Stimulation of the neurons whose activity followed voluntary movement onsets failed to induce the learned movement. Thus, the learned activity pattern in M1 L2/3 can be generated when the M1 network is prepared at the optimal initial state and receives precise triggering inputs, supporting the active role of M1 in learned activity generation. The resulting activity pattern then causally drives the learned movement.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

Recently, recurrent de novo variants in the U4 RNA, transcribed from the RNU4-2 gene, and in at least two other RNU genes were discovered to cause neurodevelopmental disorder. We detected inherited and de novo heterozygous variants in RNU4-2 (n.18_19insA and n.56T>C) and in four out of the five RNU6 paralogues (n.55_56insG and n.56_57insG) in 135 individuals from 62 families with non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a rare form of hereditary blindness. We show that these variants are recurrent among RP families and invariably cluster in close proximity within the three-way junction (between stem-I, the 5 stem-loop and stem-II) of the U4/U6 duplex, affecting its natural conformation. Interestingly, this region binds to numerous splicing factors of the tri-snRNP complex including PRPF3, PRPF8 and PRPF31, previously associated with RP as well. The U4 and U6 variants identified seem to affect snRNP biogenesis, namely the U4/U6 di-snRNP, which is an assembly intermediate of the tri-snRNP. Based on the number of positive cases observed, deleterious variants in RNU4-2 and in RNU6 paralogues could be a significant cause of isolated or dominant RP, accounting for up to 1.2% of all undiagnosed RP cases. This study highlights the role of non-coding genes in rare Mendelian disorders and uncovers pleiotropy in RNU4-2, where different variants underlie neurodevelopmental disorder and RP.","NA","medrxiv",1736460509095

The fusion process is driven by a large-scale conformational change in F, switching irreversibly from the metastable prefusion state to the stable postfusion conformation. Previous research has identified six distinct antigenic sites in RSV-F, termed sites O, I, II, III, IV, and V. Of these, only antigenic site I is fully specific to the postfusion conformation of F. A monoclonal antibody 131-2a that specifically targets postfusion F has been widely used as a research tool to probe for postfusion F and to define antigenic site I in serological studies, yet its sequence and precise epitope have remained unknown. Here we use mass spectrometry-based de novo sequencing of 131-2a to reverse engineer a recombinant product and study the epitope to define antigenic site I with molecular detail, revealing the structural basis for the antibodys specificity towards postfusion RSV-F.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

Furthermore, the evolution of this type of regeneration is enigmatic since it does not occur naturally. Here, we show that aggregate regeneration in Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus proceeds through several, consistent stages that include the formation of an epidermal layer, followed by migration, proliferation, and differentiation of adult pluripotent stem cells, known as i-cells. Migration of i-cells is controlled by sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed, surprisingly, that the newly regenerated individual derives nearly exclusively from i-cell progeny rather than from recycled somatic cells, as seen in other hydrozoans. Given the similarity of this phenomenon to embryogenesis, we propose that the ability of Hydractinia cell aggregates to regenerate is a side effect of the animals i-cell-mediated development.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

Methodological uncertainties currently limit the interpretability of non-invasive, extracranial traveling wave data, sparking debates about their cortical origin. Studies using EEG or MEG typically report waves that cover large portions of the sensor array which are often interpreted as reflecting long range cortical waves. Meanwhile, invasive, intracranial recordings in humans and animals routinely find both local, mesoscopic waves and large scale, macroscopic waves in cortex. Whether the global sensor-array waves found with EEG/MEG necessarily correspond to macroscopic cortical waves or whether they are merely projections of local dynamics remains unclear. In this study, we made use of the well-established retinotopic organization of early visual cortex to generate traveling waves with known properties in human participants (N=19, m/f) via targeted visual stimulation, while simultaneously recording MEG and EEG. The inducer stimuli were designed to elicit waves whose traveling direction in mesoscopic retinotopic visual areas depends on stimulus direction, while leaving macroscopic activation patterns along the visual hierarchy largely unchanged. We observed that the preferred direction of traveling waves across the sensor array was influenced by that of the visual stimulus, but only at the stimulation frequency. Comparison between single-trial and trial-averaged responses further showed considerable temporal variation in traveling wave patterns across trials. Our results highlight that under tight experimental control, non-invasive, extracranial recordings can recover mesoscopic traveling wave activity, thus making them viable tools for the investigation of spatially constrained wave dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

However, few biocontainment strategies can support the longer-term microbial survival that may be desired in a target environment without repeated human intervention. Here, we introduce the concept of an orthogonal obligate commensalism for the autonomous creation of environments that are permissive for survival of a biocontained microbe. We engineer one microbe to produce a non-standard amino acid (nsAA), and we engineer synthetic auxotrophy in a second microbe via reliance on this nsAA for growth. We show that this obligate commensalism is highly effective, with the survival of our commensal organism during co-culture dependent on the presence of our producer strain. We also show that this commensalism is orthogonal to a small microbial consortium isolated from maize roots, with survival of the synthetic auxotroph conditional upon the presence of the nsAA-producing strain in the consortium. Overall, our study demonstrates a transition from a chemical to a biological dependence for biocontained organisms that could lay the groundwork for biocontained synthetic ecologies.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

While we have substantial knowledge of the molecular parts and rules of cytoskeletal assembly, we know less about how structures are remodeled, for example to interconvert centrioles from the ciliary base to the centrosome. To study this in an evolutionary context we use the chytrid fungus, Rhizoclosmatium globosum, a member of the zoosporic fungi which have centrioles and cilia, lost in other fungal lineages. Chytrids undergo reorganization of their microtubule cytoskeleton as they cycle from zoospore to multinucleated coenocyte. We use comparative bioinformatics, RNA sequencing, and expansion microscopy to map the microtubule cytoskeleton over the chytrid lifecycle. We find that when zoospores encyst, cilia are retracted into the cytoplasm and degraded, and centrioles detach but are protected from degradation. A shortened proximal centriole then forms the mitotic centrosome and ultimately elongates to form cilia at the end of the mitotic cycles, driven by a conserved transcriptional program. Thus, structural remodeling of the chytrid centriole is coupled temporally to ciliated stages rather than mitotic cycles, which may serve as a mechanism to tune microtubule organization to meet the needs of different lifecycle stages.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

To help address this, the Genomics of Autism in Latin American Ancestries Consortium (GALA) was formed, presenting here the largest sequencing study of ASD in Latin American individuals (n>15,000). We identified 35 genome-wide significant (FDR < 0.05) ASD risk genes, with substantial overlap with findings from European cohorts, and highly constrained genes showing consistent signal across populations. The results provide support for emerging (e.g., MARK2, YWHAG, PACS1, RERE, SPEN, GSE1, GLS, TNPO3, ANKRD17) and established ASD genes, and for the utility of genetic testing approaches for deleterious variants in diverse populations, while also demonstrating the ongoing need for more inclusive genetic research and testing. We conclude that the biology of ASD is universal and not impacted to any detectable degree by ancestry.

In this study, we generated monoclonal antibodies from immunised cattle, primarily because of their ability to produce antibodies with ultra-long heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDRH3) domains. Such antibodies have been shown to have potent and cross-reactive neutralisation phenotypes in other virus infections. Following extended immunisation with different forms of spike protein and using single B-cell sorting and phage display techniques, we isolated 33 mAbs, including 10 with ultra-long CDRH3s (>50 amino acids). Of these, mAbs P7 and 99 exhibited remarkable neutralisation breadth and potency. Notably, mAb P7, which possessed an ultra-long CDRH3, neutralised all tested variants, including SARS-CoV-1, with IC50 values ranging from 0.01 {micro}g/mL to 1.06 {micro}g/mL. This antibody was also cross-reactive against a panel of RBDs from diverse sarbecovirus species. Structural studies revealed that mAb 99 targets a region of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein that overlaps with the ACE2 binding site. Although the structure of the P7 Fab-RBD complex was not resolvable, data suggest P7 induces trimer dissociation by binding to an occluded RBD epitope, likely mediated by the extended CDRH3 structure. Syrian hamster challenge experiments, using several VOCs, showed that mAbs P7 and 99 significantly reduced lung viral load. These findings highlight the potential of bovine-derived, especially those possessing ultra-long CDRH3s, as effective therapeutics against current and future sarbecovirus threats.

By screening a library of potential BRD9 targeted glue compounds, we have discovered a potent and selective, reversibly covalent BRD9 degrader, AMPTX-1. Co-immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry experiments demonstrated that cell treatment with AMPTX-1 induces selective recruitment of BRD9 to the E3 ligase DCAF16. Degradation is dependent on the engagement of the surface Cys58 of DCAF16 and formation of a covalent adduct to DCAF16 is facilitated by the ternary complex formation with BRD9. BRD9 degradation is achieved in vivo after oral dosing, demonstrating that covalent recruitment of DCAF16 is a viable strategy for targeted protein degradation and can be achieved with drug-like, orally bioavailable compounds with promising in vivo activity.","NA","biorxiv",1736460509095

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1736460509095
