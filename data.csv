In addition to impacting poultry, these HPAI viruses caused mortality events in wild bird species and wild mammals. Transmission in multiple host species raises the concern for mammalian adaptation. On March 25, 2024, HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was confirmed in a dairy cow in Texas in response to a multi-state investigation into milk production losses. Over one hundred positive herds were rapidly identified in Texas and eleven other U.S. states. The case description included reduced feed intake and rumen motility in lactating cows, decreased milk production, and thick yellow milk. The diagnostic investigation revealed detections of viral RNA in milk and mammary tissue with alveolar epithelial degeneration and necrosis, and positive immunoreactivity of glandular epithelium by immunohistochemistry. A single transmission event, likely from avian species to dairy cattle, followed by limited local transmission preceded the onward lateral transmission of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13. We sought to experimentally reproduce infection with genotype B3.13 in Holstein yearling heifers and lactating cows. The heifers were inoculated by an aerosol respiratory route and the cows by an intramammary route. Clinical disease was mild in the heifers, but infection was confirmed by virus detection, lesions, and seroconversion. Clinical disease in lactating cows included decreased rumen motility, changes to milk appearance, and production losses consistent with field reports of viral mastitis. Infection was confirmed by high levels of viral RNA detected in milk, virus isolation, lesions in mammary tissue, and seroconversion. This study provides the foundation to investigate additional routes of infection, transmission, and intervention strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

This paper aimed to assess a multitude of cardiac signs, symptoms, and conditions, as well as focused on patients with and without congenital heart defects (CHDs), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the post-acute cardiovascular outcomes among children and adolescents after COVID-19.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 19 US childrens hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and September 2023. Every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry. Absolute risks of incident post-acute COVID-19 sequelae were reported. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by contrasting COVID-19-positive with COVID-19-negative groups using a Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through propensity scoring stratification.

ResultsA total of 1,213,322 individuals under 21 years old (mean[SD] age, 7.75[6.11] years; 623,806 male [51.4%]) were included. The absolute rate of any post-acute cardiovascular outcome in this study was 2.32% in COVID-19 positive and 1.38% in negative groups. Patients with CHD post-SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks of any cardiovascular outcome (RR, 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-1.80), including increased risks of 11 of 18 post-acute sequelae in hypertension, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias), myocarditis, other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest), thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain and palpitations). Those without CHDs also experienced heightened cardiovascular risks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57-1.69), covering 14 of 18 conditions in hypertension, arrhythmias (ventricular arrhythmias and premature atrial or ventricular contractions), inflammatory heart disease (pericarditis and myocarditis), other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock), thrombotic disorders (pulmonary embolism and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and syncope).

ConclusionsBoth children with and without CHDs showed increased risks for a variety of cardiovascular outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the need for targeted monitoring and management in the post-acute phase.

Clinical Perspective sectionO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIWe investigated the risks of 18 post-acute COVID-19 cardiovascular outcomes in the pediatric population without Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in over 1 million patients, stratified by congenital heart defects (CHD) status.
C_LIO_LIWe extended the follow-up period beyond previous pediatric studies, ensuring every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry.
C_LIO_LIWe included a comprehensive cross-section of the US pediatric population across various healthcare settings including primary, specialty, and emergency care, as well as testing and inpatient facilities.
C_LI

What are the clinical implications?O_LIWithin the post-acute phase, children and adolescents previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at statistically significant increased risk of incident cardiovascular outcomes, including hypertension, ventricular arrhythmias, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, thromboembolism, chest pain, and palpitations. These findings are consistent among patients with and without CHDs.
C_LIO_LIAwareness of the heightened risk of cardiovascular disorders after COVID-19 can lead to a timely referral, investigations, and management of these conditions in children and adolescents.

However, how exactly the PT invades the receptive synergid is unknown as the spatial relationship between these two cells is unclear. To better understand this process we performed 3D live imaging of PT reception in Arabidopsis thaliana. Upon arrival at the filiform apparatus (FA), a region rich in membrane folds at the micropylar pole of the synergids, the PT gradually deforms the FA before it rapidly grows into the receptive synergid. Upon penetration, the membrane of the receptive synergid invaginates and envelopes the PT. We termed this newly discovered structure the peri-tubular membrane (PRM). We show that, in feronia mutants disrupting PT reception, the PT still enters the receptive synergid, forming a normal PRM. This results in extensive invagination of the synergid membrane without sperm release. We show that PRM formation is associated with a cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) spike of high amplitude in the PT and flooding of [Ca2+]cyt in the synergids. In PTs lacking AUTOINHIBITED Ca2+ ATPASE9 activity, PTs have lower amplitude [Ca2+]cyt spiking and the PTs frequently fail to penetrate the synergid. Our findings suggest that synergid penetration and the non-cell autonomous control of PT rupture are distinct regulated processes required for fertilization in flowering plants.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Organ age estimates are associated with future onset of heart failure (heart age HR=1.83), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (lung age HR=1.39), type II diabetes (kidney age HR=1.58), and Alzheimers disease (brain age HR=1.81) and sensitive to lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise, hormone replacement therapy, or supplements. Remarkably, the accrual of aged organs progressively increases mortality risk while a youthful brain and immune system are uniquely associated with disease-free longevity. These findings support the use of plasma proteins for monitoring organ health and the efficacy of drugs targeting organ aging disease.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Existing RNA sequencing methods have significant limitations: short-read (SR) sequencing provides high depth but struggles with isoform deconvolution, whereas long-read (LR) sequencing offers isoform resolution at the cost of lower depth, higher noise, and technical biases. Addressing this gap, we introduce Multi-Platform Aggregation and Quantification of Transcripts (MPAQT), a generative model that combines the complementary strengths of different sequencing platforms to achieve state-of-the-art isoform-resolved transcript quantification, as demonstrated by extensive simulations and experimental benchmarks. By applying MPAQT to an in vitro model of human embryonic stem cell differentiation into cortical neurons, followed by machine learning-based modeling of transcript abundances, we show that untranslated regions (UTRs) are major determinants of isoform proportion and exon usage; this effect is mediated through isoform-specific sequence features embedded in UTRs, which likely interact with RNA-binding proteins that modulate mRNA stability. These findings highlight MPAQT's potential to enhance our understanding of transcriptomic complexity and underline the role of splicing-independent post-transcriptional mechanisms in shaping the isoform and exon usage landscape of the cell.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

At the heart of gene regulation are promoters, yet their regulatory logic is still incompletely understood. Here, we report PARM, a cell-type specific deep learning model trained on specially designed massively parallel reporter assays that query human promoter sequences. PARM requires ~1,000 times less computational power than state-of-the-art technology, and reliably predicts autonomous promoter activity throughout the genome from DNA sequence alone, in multiple cell types. PARM can even design purely synthetic strong promoters. We leveraged PARM to systematically identify binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) that are likely to contribute to the activity of each natural human promoter. We uncovered and experimentally confirmed striking positional preferences of TFs that differ between activating and repressive regulatory functions, as well as a complex grammar of motif-motif interactions. For example, many, but not all, TFs act as repressors when their binding motif is located near or just downstream of the transcription start site. Our approach lays the foundation towards a deep understanding of the regulation of human promoters by TFs.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Notably, certain choanoflagellate species can engage in facultative multicellular development resembling the early stages of embryogenesis. In the past few years, Salpingoeca rosetta has emerged as a tractable model for choanoflagellate cell biology and multicellular development, notably through mutant screens and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout (KO). However, existing KO pipelines have variable and sometimes low efficiency, frequently requiring isolation and genotyping of hundreds of clones without guarantee to obtain a KO strain. Here, we present a robust method for gene inactivation in S. rosetta that relies on insertion by CRISPR/Cas9 of a single 1.9 kb cassette encoding both a premature termination sequence and an antibiotic resistance gene. We show that this approach allows robust, fast and efficient isolation of KO clones after antibiotic selection. As a proof of principle, we first knocked out all three genes previously proposed to regulate S. rosetta multicellular development in a published mutant screen (rosetteless, couscous and jumble), and confirmed all three KOs abolished multicellular development. Whole genome sequencing revealed a unique specific insertion of the termination/resistance cassette in KO strains. To showcase the potential of this method for de novo characterization of candidate developmental genes, we then inactivated three genes encoding homologs of components of the Hippo pathway, which controls cell proliferation and multicellular size in animals: hippo, warts and yorkie. Interestingly, warts KO rosettes were consistently about twice larger than their wild-type counterparts, indicating that our KO pipeline has the potential to rapidly reveal novel loss-of-function phenotypes of biological interest. We propose that this method has the potential to accelerate choanoflagellate functional genetics.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Hence, the described algorithms factorize the color sets into patterns that repeat across the entire collection and represent these patterns once, instead of redundantly replicating their representation as would happen if the sets were encoded as atomic lists of integers. Experimental results across a range of datasets and query workloads show that these representations substantially improve over the space effectiveness of the best previous solutions (sometimes, even dramatically, yielding indexes that are smaller by an order of magnitude).

While all immature and mature human NK cells co-express SYK and ZAP70, clonally driven memory or adaptive NK cells can methylate SYK genes and signaling is mediated exclusively using ZAP70. Here, we examined the role of SYK and ZAP70 in a clonal human NK cell line KHYG1 by CRISPR-based deletion using a combination of experiments and mechanistic computational modeling. Elimination of SYK resulted in more robust Ca++ influx after cross-linking of the CD16 and NKp30 receptors and enhanced phosphorylation of downstream proteins, whereas ZAP70 deletion diminished these responses. By contrast, ZAP70 depletion increased proliferation of the NK cells. As immature T cells express both SYK and ZAP70 but mature T cells often express only ZAP70, we transduced the human Jurkat cell line with SYK and found that expression of SYK increased proliferation but diminished TCR-induced Ca2+ flux and activation. We performed transcriptional analysis of the matched sets of variant Jurkat and KHYG1 cells and observed profound alterations caused by SYK expression. As depletion of SYK in NK cells increased their activation, primary human NK cells were transduced with a CD19-targeting CAR and were CRISPR edited to ablate SYK or ZAP70. Deletion of SYK resulted in more robust cytotoxic activity and cytokine production, providing a new therapeutic strategy of NK cell engineering for cancer immunotherapy.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

They can learn to vocalize on command and the activity of single neurons from the crow's associative telencephalic structure nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) is correlated with the execution of this vocal and many non-vocal skilled behaviors. However, it remains unknown if specific anatomical adaptations that directly link the crow NCL to any of the nuclei of the crow's 'song system' exist. To address this issue, we used fluorescent tracers along with histological staining methods (Nissl-, myelin-, and anti tyrosine hydroxylase) to characterize the connectivity of the crow's NCL in relation to its song system nuclei. We found that the NCL sends dense projections into the dorsal intermediate arcopallium (AID) directly adjacent to and engulfing the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), which is the telencephalic motor output of the song system. Similarly, we demonstrate dense NCL projections into the striatum surrounding the basal ganglia song nucleus 'area X'. Both of these descending projections mirror the projections of the nidopallial song nucleus HVC (proper name) into RA and area X, with extremely sparse NCL fibers extending into area X. Furthermore, we characterized the distribution of cells projecting from the lateral part of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (MAN) to NCL. Notably, a separate medial population of MAN cells projects to HVC. These two sets of connections - MAN to NCL and MAN to HVC - run in parallel but do not overlap. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that the NCL is part of a 'general motor system' that parallels the song system but exhibits only minimal monosynaptic interconnections with it.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

The key component of this system, ParB, loads and spreads along DNA to form a local protein-DNA condensate known as a partition complex. As bacterial chromosomes are heavily supercoiled due to the continuous action of RNA polymerases, gyrases, and nucleoid-associated proteins, it is important to study the impact of DNA supercoiling on the ParB-DNA partition complex formation. Here, we use an in vitro single-molecule assay to visualize ParB on supercoiled DNA. Unlike most DNA-binding proteins, individual ParB proteins are found to not pin plectonemes on supercoiled DNA, but freely diffuse along supercoiled DNA. We find that DNA supercoiling enhances ParB-DNA condensation which initiates at lower ParB concentrations than on DNA that is torsionally relaxed. ParB proteins induce a DNA-protein condensate that strikingly absorbs all supercoiling writhe. Our findings provide mechanistic insights that have important implications for our understanding of bacterial chromosome organization and segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

However, biologically contaminated pipette tips must undergo several washing and sterilization steps before being reused or recycled. Grenova Solutions provides such a decontamination station called TipNovus, which has been implemented by academic and government research labs to reuse pipette tips in sensitive biological assays. Despite this success, the high initial purchasing cost of these washing stations deter many laboratories from incorporating it into their workflow. Additionally, researchers are reluctant to reuse pipette tips due to concerns that the washing process may not thoroughly remove all contaminants. To mitigate these concerns, considering the University of Texas at Austin as an example, we performed a cost-benefit analysis of employing a university-wide washing station. We estimated that only single-time reuse of the pipette tips could result in a 100% return on investment from the equipment purchase cost within 3 months. Then, with our pilot experiments, we confirmed the TipNovus washing steps to be 100% efficient in sterilizing pipette tips contaminated with T7 bacteriophage, enabling their reuse in bacteriophage functionality assays. Finally, we proposed an alternative and more convenient autoclave-based sterilization method to decontaminate pipette tips.

They impose a huge health burden on human populations spreading parasites as disparate as protozoans (malaria), viruses (yellow fever and more), and nematodes (filariasis), which cause life-threatening conditions. In recent years, mating has been proposed as a putative target for population control. Mosquitoes mate mid-air in swarms initiated by males and triggered by a combination of internal and external stimuli. As the number of females in a swarm is limited, there is intense competition among males. Indeed, males  retune their physiology for this demanding behaviour but the underlying genetic changes are largely unknown. Interestingly, recent evidence indicates that the upregulation of circadian clock genes may be involved in the swarming of malaria mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. Here, we use whole-head RNA-seq to identify gene expression changes in Aedes aegypti males who are engaged in swarming in a laboratory setting. Our results suggest that swarming males tend to lower some housekeeping functions while increasing the remodelling of the cytoskeleton and neuronal connectivity; the transcription of circadian clock genes is unaffected.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Here we describe the rational conceptual design and test-case practical implementation of a photopharmacological paradigm to empower high-performance photomodulation studies in vivo. TRPC4/5 ion channels are involved in many spatiotemporally resolved circuits, from pain and anxiety, to reproductive signaling, digestion, and obesity. To unpick their biology requires spatiotemporally precise tools, which were lacking. We developed ""ideal efficacy photoswitch"" ligands to control their diverse functions in situ. These E{leftrightarrows}Z-photoswitchable ligands bias TRPC[4]/5 channel activity with exquisite photocontrol, from strong agonism under 360 nm, to low agonism at 385 nm, to strong antagonism at 410-460 nm. Cryo-EM structures of both TRPC4 and TRPC5 with both Z-agonists and E-antagonists support the rationale for efficacy switching through competitive E/Z-isomer binding. Crucially, since the E/Z ratio is exclusively determined by the light wavelength applied, their channel photocontrol is exclusively wavelength-dependent, yet drug-concentration-independent: so is reproducible from cell culture to >millimetre-depth tissues. Indeed, we were able to photocontrol both direct and downstream TRPC4/5 biology in cell lines or primary cells in culture, from calcium flux, to primary neuron excitability and adrenaline release; and even in tissues, photoswitching small intestine motility and peristalsis. The TRPC4/5 ligands we develop will thus unlock a range of high-precision investigations in TRP biology. More broadly, we propose that the success of this efficacy photoswitch program, from concept to tissue level translation, is mainly a consequence of how biology has evolved proteins for efficacy control. We therefore foresee that a variety of functionally responsive protein targets, not only sensory and signaling ion channels and receptors, will be amenable to similarly high-performance photocontrol even in vivo, if a new generation of reagent development adopts this paradigm of ideal efficacy photoswitching.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Some may represent novel viral species, but overall, the viral repertoire of Caspian seals is similar to available viromes from other pinnipeds. Among the sequences recovered were partial contigs for influenza B, representing only the second such molecular identification in marine mammals. This work provides a foundation for further studies of viral communities in Caspian seals, the diversity of viromes in pinnipeds more generally, and contributes data relevant for disease risk assessments in marine mammals.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Even with broad-scale efforts to characterize the effects of molecular perturbations and interpret gene coexpression, it remains challenging to infer the architecture of gene regulation in a precise and efficient manner. Key properties of GRNs, like hierarchical structure, modular organization, and sparsity, provide both challenges and opportunities for this objective. Here, we seek to better understand properties of GRNs using a new approach to simulate their structure and model their function. We produce realistic network structures with a novel generating algorithm based on insights from small-world network theory, and we model gene expression regulation using stochastic differential equations formulated to accommodate modeling molecular perturbations. With these tools, we systematically describe the effects of gene knockouts within and across GRNs, finding a subset of networks that recapitulate features of a recent genome-scale perturbation study. With deeper analysis of these exemplar networks, we consider future avenues to map the architecture of gene expression regulation using data from cells in perturbed and unperturbed states, finding that while perturbation data are critical to discover specific regulatory interactions, data from unperturbed cells may be sufficient to reveal regulatory programs.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Curiously, most colorectal tumours carry biallelic mutations that result in only partial loss of APC function, suggesting that a ""just-right"" level of APC inactivation, and hence Wnt signalling, provides the optimal conditions for tumorigenesis. Mutational processes act variably across the APC gene, which could contribute to the bias against complete APC inactivation. Thus the selective consequences of partial APC loss are unclear. Here we propose a mathematical model to quantify the tumorigenic effect of biallelic APC genotypes, controlling for somatic mutational processes. Analysing sequence data from >2500 colorectal cancers, we find that APC genotypes resulting in partial protein function confer about 50 times higher probability of progressing to cancer compared to complete APC inactivation. The optimal inactivation level varies with anatomical location and additional mutations of Wnt pathway regulators. We use this context dependency to assess the regulatory effect of secondary Wnt drivers in combination with APC in vivo, and provide evidence that mutant AMER1 combines with APC genotypes that lead to relatively low Wnt. The fitness landscape of APC inactivation is consistent across microsatellite unstable and POLE-deficient colorectal cancers and tumours in patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, suggesting a general ""just-right"" optimum, and pointing to Wnt hyperactivation as a potential cancer vulnerability.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

As organisms age, the ability of neurons to maintain their axons declines; hence aged axons are more susceptible to damage or dysfunction. Understanding what causes axonal vulnerability is crucial for developing strategies to enhance overall resilience of neurons, and to prevent their deterioration during ageing or in age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes oxidative stress, a hallmark of ageing and age-related diseases. Despite this association, a causal relationship between oxidative stress and neuronal ageing remains unclear, particularly how subcellular physiology is affected by ROS.

By using Drosophila-derived primary neuronal cultures and a recently developed in vivo neuronal model of ageing, which involves the visualisation of Drosophila medulla neurons, we investigated the interplay between oxidative stress, neuronal ageing and the microtubule cytoskeleton. We find that oxidative stress as a key driver of axonal and synaptic decay, including the appearance of axonal swellings, microtubule alterations in both axons and synapses and the morphological transformation of axonal terminals during ageing. We demonstrate that increased ROS sensitises the microtubule plus end binding factor, end-binding protein 1 (EB1), leading to microtubule defects, affecting neuronal integrity. Furthermore, manipulating EB1 proved to be a valuable therapeutic strategy to prevent ageing hallmarks observed in conditions of elevated ROS. In summary, we demonstrate a mechanistic pathway linking cellular oxidative stress, the microtubule cytoskeleton and axonal deterioration during ageing and provide evidence of the therapeutic potential of enhancing microtubule plus end physiology to improve the resilience of axons.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

The specific tissue factors governing the persistence and continuous differentiation of these cells remain undefined but could represent attractive therapeutic targets. In a model of chronic CNS autoimmunity, we find that oligodendrocyte-derived interleukin-33 (IL-33), an alarmin, is key for locally regulating the pathogenicity of self-reactive CD8+ T cells. The selective ablation of IL-33 from neo-self-antigen-expressing oligodendrocytes mitigates CNS disease. In this context, fewer self-reactive CD8+ T cells persist in the inflamed CNS, and the remaining cells are largely locked into a stem-like precursor program, failing to form TCF-1low effector progeny. Importantly, interventional IL-33 blockade by locally administered somatic gene therapy reduces T cell infiltrates and improves the disease course. Our study identifies oligodendrocyte-derived IL-33 as a druggable tissue factor regulating the differentiation and survival of self-reactive CD8+ T cell in the inflamed CNS.

Knockout (KO) alleles for 9 HD GWAS modifiers/MMR genes were crossed to the Q140 Huntingtin (mHtt) knock-in mice to probe such mechanisms. Four KO mice strongly (Msh3 and Pms1) or moderately (Msh2 and Mlh1) rescue a triad of adult-onset, striatal medium-spiny-neuron (MSN)-selective phenotypes: somatic Htt DNA CAG-repeat expansion, transcriptionopathy, and mHtt protein aggregation. Comparatively, Q140 cortex also exhibits an analogous, but later-onset, pathogenic triad that is Msh3-dependent. Remarkably, Q140/homozygous Msh3-KO lacks mHtt aggregates in the brain, even at advanced ages (20-months). Moreover, Msh3-deficiency prevents striatal synaptic marker loss, astrogliosis, and locomotor impairment in HD mice. Purified Q140 MSN nuclei exhibit highly linear age-dependent mHtt DNA repeat expansion (i.e. repeat migration), with modal-CAG increasing at +8.8 repeats/month (R2=0.98). This linear rate is reduced to 2.3 and 0.3 repeats/month in Q140 with Msh3 heterozygous and homozygous alleles, respectively. Our study defines somatic Htt CAG-repeat thresholds below which there are no mHtt nuclear (at 150-CAG) or neuropil aggregates (at 192-CAG). Mild transcriptionopathy can still occur in Q140 mice with stabilized Htt 140-CAG repeats, but the majority of transcriptomic changes are due to somatic repeat expansion. Our analysis reveals 479 genes with expression levels highly correlated with modal-CAG length in MSNs. Thus, our study mechanistically connects HD GWAS genes to selective neuronal vulnerability in HD, in which Msh3 and Pms1 set the linear rate of neuronal mHtt CAG-repeat migration to drive repeat-length dependent pathogenesis; and provides a preclinical platform for targeting these genes for HD suppression across brain regions.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

We find that over macroevolutionary time: 1) there has been strong stabilizing selection on protein abundances; 2) mutations impacting mRNA abundances have minimal influence on protein abundances; 3) mRNA abundances are under selection to track protein abundances, and 4) mRNA abundances adapt more quickly than protein abundances due to increased mutational opportunity. We find additional support for these findings by comparing gene-specific parameter estimates from our model to human functional genomic data. More broadly, our new phylogenetic approach provides a foundation for testing hypotheses about the processes that led to divergence in gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

How these regions communicate to organize retrieval-specific processing, however, remains unclear. Here, we elucidate the role of theta (3--8 Hz) synchronization, broadly implicated in memory function, during the spontaneous retrieval of episodic memories. Analyzing a dataset of 413 neurosurgical patients implanted with intracranial electrodes who completed a free recall task, we find that synchronous networks of theta phase synchrony span the brain in the moments before spontaneous recall, in comparison to periods of deliberation and incorrect recalls. Network hubs, which systematically synchronize with other regions, appear throughout the prefrontal cortex and lateral and medial temporal lobes, as well as other areas. The recall accuracy network, derived from a correct recall--intrusion contrast, includes synchronous hubs concentrated in the temporal lobe and desynchronous hubs in the parietal lobe. Theta synchrony increases appear more prominently for slow (3 Hz) theta than for fast (8 Hz) theta in the recall--deliberation contrast, but not in the encoding or recall--intrusion contrast, and theta power and synchrony positively correlate throughout the theta band. These results implicate diffuse brain-wide synchronization of theta rhythms, especially slow theta, in episodic memory retrieval.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

This enables advances in drug discovery and the design of therapeutic interventions. The collection of simulations stored in computers across the world holds immense potential to serve as training data for future Machine Learning models that will transform the prediction of structure, dynamics, drug interactions, and more. A need: Ideally, there should exist an open access repository that enables scientists to submit and store their MD simulations of proteins and protein-drug interactions, and to find, retrieve, analyze, and visualize simulations produced by others. However, despite the ubiquity of MD simulation in structural biology, no such repository exists; as a result, simulations are instead stored in scattered locations without uniform metadata or access protocols. A solution: Here, we introduce MDRepo, a robust infrastructure that supports a relatively simple process for standardized community contribution of simulations, activates common downstream analyses on stored data, and enables search, retrieval, and visualization of contributed data. MDRepo is built on top of the open-source CyVerse research cyber-infrastructure, and is capable of storing petabytes of simulations, while providing high bandwidth upload and download capabilities and laying a foundation for cloud-based access to its stored data.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

Some photosynthetic cyanobacteria can acclimate to growth in longer wavelength light by replacing five chlorophylls for long wavelength pigments in specific locations, including one in the reaction center (RC). However, the exact location and the nature of this long wavelength pigment still remain uncertain. Here we have addressed the color-tuning mechanism of the far-red light PSII (FRL-PSII) by excited state calculations at both the ab initio correlated (ADC2) and linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) levels in combination with large-scale hybrid quantum/classical (QM/MM) simulations and atomistic molecular dynamics. We show that substitution of a single chlorophyll pigment (ChlD1) at the RC by chlorophyll d leads to a spectral shift beyond the far-red light limit, as a result of the protein electrostatic, polarization and electronic coupling effects that reproduce key structural and spectroscopic observations. Pigment substitution at the ChlD1 site further results in a low site energy within the RC that could function as a sink for the excitation energy and initiate the primary charge separation reaction, driving the water oxidation. Our findings provide a basis for understanding color-tuning mechanisms and bioenergetic principles of oxygenic photosynthesis at the far-red light limit.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Here, we link this profile of functional reorganization to the development of ventral attention network connectivity across independent datasets. We demonstrate that maturational changes in cortical organization preferentially link to within-network connectivity and heightened degree centrality in the ventral attention network, while connectivity within network-linked vertices predicts cognitive ability. This connectivity is closely associated with maturational refinement of cortical organization. Children with low ventral attention network connectivity exhibit adolescent-like topographical profiles, suggesting that attentional systems may be relevant in understanding how brain functions are refined across development. These data suggest a role for attention networks in supporting age-dependent shifts in cortical organization and cognition across childhood and adolescence.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Additionally, environmental parameters such as thermal variability may promote tolerance, but how variability interacts with holobiont partners to shape responses to thermal challenge remains unclear. Here, we identified three cryptic lineages of Siderastrea siderea in Bocas del Toro, Panama that differ in distributions across inshore and offshore reefs, microbial associations, holobiont phenomes, and skeleton morphologies. A thermal variability experiment failed to increase thermal tolerance, but subsequent thermal challenge and recovery revealed one lineage maintained elevated energetic reserves, photochemical efficiency, and growth. Lastly, coral cores highlighted that this lineage also exhibited faster growth historically. Functional variation among cryptic lineages highlights their importance in predicting coral reef responses to climate change.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Mitochondrial dysfunction is widely considered a key contributing mechanism to muscle aging. However, mounting evidence position physical activity as a confounding factor, making unclear whether muscle mitochondria accumulate bona fide defects with aging. To disentangle aging from physical activity-related mitochondrial adaptations, we functionally profiled skeletal muscle mitochondria in 51 inactive and 88 active men aged 20-93. Physical activity status conferred partial protection against age-related decline in physical performance. A trend for reduced muscle mitochondrial respiration with aging was observed in inactive but not in active participants, indicating that aging per se does not alter mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was unaffected by aging and active participants displayed higher ROS production. In contrast, mitochondrial calcium retention capacity decreased with aging regardless of physical activity status and correlated with muscle mass, performance and the stress-responsive metabokine GDF15. Targeting mitochondrial calcium handling may hold promise for treating aging-related muscle impairments.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

However, whether individual neurons also embed information about their own anatomical location within their spike patterns remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that machine learning models can predict a neuron's anatomical location across multiple brain regions and structures based solely on its spiking activity. Analyzing high-density recordings from thousands of neurons in awake, behaving mice, we demonstrate that anatomical location can be reliably decoded from neuronal activity across various stimulus conditions, including drifting gratings, naturalistic movies, and spontaneous activity. Crucially, anatomical signatures generalize across animals and even across different research laboratories, suggesting a fundamental principle of neural organization. Examination of trained classifiers reveals that anatomical information is enriched in specific interspike intervals as well as responses to stimuli. Within the visual isocortex, anatomical embedding is robust at the level of layers and primary versus secondary but does not robustly separate individual secondary structures. In contrast, structures within the hippocampus and thalamus are robustly separable based on their spike patterns. Our findings reveal a generalizable dimension of the neural code, where anatomical information is multiplexed with the encoding of external stimuli and internal states. This discovery provides new insights into the relationship between brain structure and function, with broad implications for neurodevelopment, multimodal integration, and the interpretation of large-scale neuronal recordings. Immediately, it has potential as a strategy for in-vivo electrode localization.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

This has permitted the early detection of outbreaks but has been insufficient for single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-level analysis due to lower read accuracy than Illumina sequencing. This study aimed to determine whether Haplotype-aware ERRor cOrrection (HERRO) of ONT data could permit high-resolution comparison of outbreak isolates. Methods: We used ONT simplex reads from isolates involved in a recent outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in our neonatal unit. The raw sequence data were re-basecalled and adapter-trimmed using Dorado v0.7.0. The simplex reads then underwent HERRO correction. The resulting genome assemblies and phylogenies were compared with previous analyses (using Dorado v0.3.4, no HERRO correction and data generated by Illumina sequencing). Results: Five of nine outbreak isolates were included in the analysis. The remaining four isolates had insufficient read lengths (N50 values <10,000 bp) and did not provide complete chromosome coverage after HERRO correction. The average chromosome sequencing depth for nanopore data was 147 x (range: 44&-220x) with an average read N50 of 12,215 bp (interquartile range (IQR): 11,439-12,711 bp). The median pairwise SNV distance between outbreak isolates from the original investigation was 51 SNVs (range: 40-68), which decreased to 3 SNVs (range: 1-15) with HERRO correction. Illumina sequencing generated a median SNV distance of 2 (range: 0-13). The resulting standalone ONT HERRO-corrected phylogeny was almost indistinguishable from the standalone Illumina-generated phylogeny. Conclusions: The addition of HERRO correction meant isolates from this MRSA outbreak could be resolved to a level on par with Illumina sequencing. ONT data following HERRO correction represents a viable standalone option for high-resolution genomic analysis of hospital outbreaks, provided sufficient read lengths can be generated.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Typical MINFLUX microscopes localize the target molecule by scanning a zero-intensity focus around the molecule in a circular trajectory, with smaller trajectory diameters yielding lower localization uncertainties for a given number of photons. Since this approach requires the molecule to be within the scanned trajectory, MINFLUX typically relies on a photon-demanding iterative scheme with decreasing trajectory diameters. Although the iterative procedure does not substantially reduce the photon efficiency of MINFLUX, this approach is prone to misplacements of the trajectory and increases the systems complexity. In this work, we introduce ISM-FLUX, a novel implementation of MINFLUX using image-scanning microscopy (ISM) with a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array detector. ISM-FLUX provides precise MINFLUX localization within the trajectory while maintaining conventional photon-limited uncertainty outside it. The robustness of ISM-FLUX localization results in a larger localization range and greatly simplifies the architecture, which may facilitate broader adoption of MIN-FLUX.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

We uncover that only 94 LTR retrotransposons contain the functional epigenetic architecture required for mobilization within maize leaves. This epigenetic architecture degenerates with evolutionary age, resulting in solo TE enhancers being preferentially marked by simultaneous hyper-CpG methylation and chromatin accessibility, an architecture markedly divergent from canonical enhancers. We find that TEs shape maize gene regulation by creating novel promoters within the TE itself as well as through TE-mediated gene amplification.

Retinal vascular complexity obtained from retinal fundus photographs, and evaluated as fractal dimension (ie, Df), a measure of the geometric pattern of the retinal vasculature, has recently emerged as a valuable indicator of diseases and aging processes. The purpose of our study was to elucidate possible mechanisms underlying those relationships. By integrating retinal Df with genomic and plasma proteome biomarkers, we uncovered novel pathways involved in determining Df and its links with cardiometabolic diseases and longevity. First, we performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) of retinal vascular Df by meta-analysing signals from 74,434 participants from three large epidemiological cohorts, the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging (CLSA), the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland (GoDARTS), and the UK Biobank (UKBB). We replicated four known loci associated with Df, and identified one novel locus within or near DAAM1, as well as found seven suggestive associations within or near CSNK1A1L, MAST4, HIVEP1, LOC283038, FNDC3A, SP100, and SUGP1 genes. GWAS summary statistics confirmed a negative correlation between Df and cardiovascular disease, stroke, and inflammation, but a positive correlation with longevity. Next, employing Mendelian randomization which combined genetic determinants of Df, and cis-protein Quantitative Trait Loci from 1,159 circulating proteins from the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological (PURE) cohort (n=12,066), we identified eight causal mediators for Df, namely IgG Fc receptorIIb, BST1, LILRB2, IL16, MMP12, PON2, ALPP, and PDL2. Notably, MMP12 and IgG Fc receptorIIb have been suggested to connect Df to cardiometabolic outcomes (i.e., coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, and type 2 diabetes) and longevity, respectively. Pathway enrichment analyses highlighted the role of IgG Fc receptorIIb in immune and inflammatory responses to aging processes, referred to as inflammaging. This multi-pronged approach unveils IgG Fc recIIb and MMP12 as key mediators in immune and inflammation pathways, linking lower Df to a higher risk of cardiometabolic diseases and a shorter lifespan. Therefore, retinal Df may be a convenient way to estimate inflammaging, such that lower retinal Df, may indicate a higher inflammaging status. Targeting MMP12 and IgG Fc ReceptorIIb may promote healthy aging and mitigating the occurrence of cardiometabolic diseases in the elderly population.","NA","medrxiv",1721081313528

The global nutrient-sensory regulator DasR acts as the gatekeeper of development in streptomycetes, and its activity is modulated by aminosugar phosphates. Here, we report the discovery of a novel pathway in aminosugar metabolism that governs GlcNAc sensing. GlcNAc-6P is converted into a toxic metabolite via two new enzyme functions, namely dehydration of N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate by NagS to form 6P-Chromogen I, a reaction that has not yet been described in the textbooks, and its subsequent deacetylation by NagA producing a cytotoxic structural analogue of ribose. The latter reveals an unexpected promiscuous activity for GlcNAc-6P deacetylase NagA. The crystal structures of NagS apoenzyme and NagS in complex with its substrate GlcNAc-6P or its inhibitor 6-phosphogluconate were resolved at 2.3 A, 2.6 A, and 1.7 A resolution, respectively. Detailed in vivo and in vitro studies resolved the key residues of the NagS catalytic site. Thus, we have uncovered a novel pathway in aminosugar metabolism that sheds new light on nutrient-mediated control of development and antibiotic production in Streptomyces.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Here, we combined an efficient and accurate method using X-ray micro-tomography and deep-learning (DL) segmentation to estimate the volume of six main brain areas of wild lizards, Podarcis bocagei: olfactory bulbs, telencephalon, diencephalon, midbrain, cerebellum and brain stem. Through quantitative comparison, we show that a sufficient deep-learning neural network can be trained with as few as five data sets. From this, we applied the trained deep-learning algorithm to obtain volume data of the six brain regions from 29 brains of Podarcis bocagei. We provide a detailed protocol for our methods, including sample preparation, X-ray tomography, and 3D volumetric segmentation.

We used Mendelian randomisation (MR) to examine the independent effect of nicotine on depression, by adjusting the effect of nicotine exposure (via nicotine metabolite ratio [NMR]) for the overall effect of smoking heaviness (via cigarettes per day [CPD]) to account for the non-nicotine constituents of tobacco smoke.

DesignUnivariable MR and multivariable MR (MVMR) were used to explore the total and independent effects of genetic liability to NMR and CPD on major depressive disorder (MDD). Our primary method was inverse variance weighted (IVW) regression, with other methods as sensitivity analyses.

Setting and participantsFor the exposures, we used genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics among European ancestry individuals for CPD (n=143,210) and NMR (n=5,185). For the outcome, a GWAS of MDD stratified by smoking status was conducted using individual-level data from UK Biobank (n=35,871-194,881).

MeasurementsGenetic variants robustly associated with NMR and CPD.

FindingsUnivariable MR indicated a causal effect of CPD on MDD (odds ratio [OR]IVW=1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.04-1.23, P=0.003) but no clear evidence for an effect of NMR on MDD (ORIVW=0.98, 95% CI=0.97-1.00, P=0.134). MVMR indicated a causal effect of CPD on MDD when accounting for NMR (ORMVMR-IVW=1.19, 95% CI=1.03-1.37, P=0.017; ORMVMR-EGGER=1.13, 95% CI=0.89-1.43, P=0.300) and weak evidence of a small effect of NMR on MDD when accounting for CPD (ORMVMR-IVW=0.98, 95% CI=0.96-1.00, P=0.056; ORMVMR-EGGER=0.98, 95% CI=0.96-1.00, P=0.038).

ConclusionsThe causal effect of tobacco smoking on depression appears to be largely independent of nicotine exposure, which implies the role of alternative causal pathways.","NA","medrxiv",1721081313528

While the evolution of seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses to avoid humoral immunity is well characterized, relatively little is known about the evolution of innate immune antagonism phenotypes in these viruses. Numerous studies have established that only a small subset of infected cells is responsible for initiating the type I and type III interferon (IFN) response during IAV infection, emphasizing the importance of single cell studies to accurately characterize the IFN response during infection. We developed a flow cytometry-based method to examine transcriptional changes in IFN and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression at the single cell level. We observed that NS segments derived from seasonal H3N2 viruses are more efficient at antagonizing IFN signaling but less effective at suppressing IFN induction, compared to the pdm2009 H1N1 lineage. We compared a collection of NS segments spanning the natural history of the current seasonal IAV lineages and demonstrate long periods of stability in IFN antagonism potential, punctuated by occasional phenotypic shifts. Altogether, our data reveal significant differences in how seasonal and pandemic H1N1 and H3N2 viruses antagonize the human IFN response at the single cell level.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

However, some trypanosome lineages have simplified their lifecycle by escaping dependence on tsetse allowing an expanded geographical range, with direct transmission between hosts achieved via biting flies and vampire bats (Trypanosoma brucei evansi, causing the disease ""surra"") or through sexual transmission (Trypanosoma brucei equiperdum, causing ""dourine""). Concomitantly, stumpy formation is reduced or lost, and the isolates are described as monomorphic, with infections spread widely in Africa, Asia, South America and parts of Europe. Here, using genomic analysis of distinct field isolates, we identified and functionally confirmed molecular changes that accompany the loss of the stumpy transmission stage in monomorphic clades. Further, using laboratory selection for resistance to the parasites quorum-sensing signal, we identified reversible steps in the initial development of monomorphism. This study identifies a trajectory of events that simplify the life cycle in emergent and established monomorphic trypanosomes, with impact on disease spread, vector control strategies, geographical range and virulence.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Longitudinal studies supporting this hypothesis remain nonetheless scarce.

MethodsIn this study, we applied regional and global bivariate latent growth curve modelling (BLGCM) to longitudinal data from 436 cognitively unimpaired participants (DELCODE cohort; median age 69.70 [IQR 65.44, 74.49] years; 52.98% female) to examine the extent to which WMH and cortical thickness were interrelated over a four-year period.

ResultsOur findings were three-fold. First, at baseline, individuals with larger WMH volumes had lower mean cortical thicknesses over the entire brain. Second, individuals who experienced a steeper thinning of their cingulate and temporal cortices over time had larger baseline WMH volumes in the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Third, individuals with thinner cortices at baseline tended to undergo faster WMH progression over four years, particularly in the occipital and parietal lobes.

ConclusionsOur study suggests that cortical thinning and WMH progression could be mutually reinforcing rather than parallel, unrelated processes, which become entangled before cognitive deficits are detectable.

To identify functionally distinct senescent cell subpopulations, we employed high-content image analysis to measure senescence marker expression in primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts.

So far, a well-known mammalian mutation PB2-E627K has not been maintained in AIV in poultry, which limits the spread of AIVs from avian to humans. Here, we discovered a variant, PB2-627V, which combines the properties of avian-like PB2-627E and human-like PB2-627K, overcoming host restrictions and posing a risk for human pandemics. Specifically, by screening the global PB2 sequences, we discovered a new independent cluster with PB2-627V emerged in the 2010s, which is prevalent in various avian, mammalian, and human isolates of AIVs, including H9N2, H7N9, H3N8, 2.3.4.4b H5N1, and other subtypes. And, the increasing prevalence of PB2-627V in poultry is accompanied by a rise in human infection cases with this variant. Then we systematically assessed its host adaptation, fitness, and transmissibility across three subtypes of AIVs (H9N2, H7N9, and H3N8) in different host models, including avian and human cells, chickens, mice, and ferrets where infections naturally occur. We found that PB2-627V facilitates AIVs to efficiently infect and replicate in chickens and mice by utilizing both avian- and human-origin ANP32A proteins. Importantly, and like PB2-627K, PB2-627V promotes efficient transmission between ferrets through respiratory droplets. Deep sequencing in passaged chicken samples and transmitted ferret samples indicates that PB2-627V remains stable across the two distinct hosts and has a high potential for long-term prevalence in avian species. Therefore, the mutation has the ability to continue spreading among poultry and can also overcome the barrier between birds and humans, greatly enhancing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, it is crucial to closely monitor influenza viruses carrying PB2-627V to prevent a pandemic.

Author summaryAvian influenza viruses (AIVs) play a critical role in the evolution of pandemic influenza viruses. Adaptive changes in AIVs enable them to infect mammalian species by altering viral interactions with host-specific factors, and one well-known example is the PB2-E627K mutation. Fortunately, this mutation is sporadic and rare in AIVs, usually occurring after infecting humans, and AIVs with PB2-627E, which is prevalent in poultry, cannot easily infect humans. However, if an AIV manages to overcome this species barrier, the risk of a pandemic originating from an AIV will significantly increase. In our study, we identified a dual adaptive variant called PB2-627V that combines avian-like properties of PB2-627E and human-like properties of PB2-627K. This variant not only maintains viral fitness in chickens but also facilitates aerosol transmission of AIVs between ferrets. Mechanistically, PB2-627V utilizes both avian and human host protein ANP32A to support viral polymerase function. The mutation exhibited good fitness in both birds and humans, thereby greatly increasing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. The PB2-627V polymorphism has been found in birds, humans, and mammals worldwide across more than ten AIV subtypes. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, we recommend considering PB2-627V as a new molecular marker to assess the pandemic potential of AIVs.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

These assemblies often include novel species that are poorly represented in reference databases creating a need for a tool that can annotate both well-described and novel taxa, and can run at scale. Here, we present mettannotator - a comprehensive Nextflow pipeline for prokaryotic genome annotation that identifies coding and non-coding regions, predicts protein functions, including antimicrobial resistance, and delineates gene clusters. The pipeline summarises the results of these tools in a GFF (General Feature Format) file that can be easily utilised in downstream analysis or visualised using common genome browsers. Mettannotator has been tested on both novel and known taxa, and used across Ensembl Bacteria and MGnify. Here, we show how it works on 29 prokaryotic phyla, both isolate and metagenome-assembled genomes, and present metrics on its performance in comparison to other tools.

Here, we report the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle herds across several states in the U.S. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory distress, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state.

However, reproducibility has not been systematically assessed within the context of electrophysiological recordings during cognitive behaviors. To address this, we formed a multi-lab collaboration using a shared, open-source behavioral task and experimental apparatus. Experimenters in ten laboratories repeatedly targeted Neuropixels probes to the same location (spanning secondary visual areas, hippocampus, and thalamus) in mice making decisions; this generated a total of 121 experimental replicates, a unique dataset for evaluating reproducibility of electrophysiology experiments. Despite standardizing both behavioral and electrophysiological procedures, some experimental outcomes were highly variable. A closer analysis uncovered that variability in electrode targeting hindered reproducibility, as did the limited statistical power of some routinely used electrophysiological analyses, such as single-neuron tests of modulation by task parameters. Reproducibility was enhanced by histological and electrophysiological quality-control criteria. Our observations suggest that data from systems neuroscience is vulnerable to a lack of reproducibility, but that across-lab standardization, including metrics we propose, can serve to mitigate this.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

We have recently shown associations for CHIP with acute kidney injury and with kidney function decline in the general population, with stronger associations for CHIP driven by mutations in genes other than DNMT3A (non-DNMT3A CHIP). Longitudinal kidney function endpoints in individuals with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CHIP have been examined in two previous studies, which reported conflicting findings and were limited by small sample sizes.

MethodsIn this study, we examined the prospective associations between CHIP and CKD progression events in four cohorts of CKD patients (total N = 5,772). The primary outcome was a composite of 50% kidney function decline or kidney failure. The slope of eGFR decline was examined as a secondary outcome. Mendelian randomization techniques were then used to investigate potential causal effects of CHIP on eGFR decline. Finally, kidney function was assessed in adenine-fed CKD model mice having received a bone marrow transplant recapitulatingTet2-CHIP compared to controls transplanted wild-type bone marrow.

ResultsAcross all cohorts, the average age was 66.4 years, the average baseline eGFR was 42.6 ml/min/1.73m2, and 24% had CHIP. Upon meta-analysis, non-DNMT3A CHIP was associated with a 59% higher relative risk of incident CKD progression (HR 1.59, 95% CI: 1.02-2.47). This association was more pronounced among individuals with diabetes (HR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.03-1.62) and with baseline eGFR [&ge;] 30 ml/min/1.73m (HR 1.80, 95% CI: 1.11-2.90). Additionally, the annualized slope of eGFR decline was steeper among non-DNMT3A CHIP carriers, relative to non-carriers ({beta} -0.61 {+/-} 0.31 ml/min/1.73m2, p = 0.04). Mendelian randomization analyses suggested a causal role for CHIP in eGFR decline among individuals with diabetes. In a dietary adenine mouse model of CKD, Tet2-CHIP was associated with lower GFR as well as greater kidney inflammation, tubular injury, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.

ConclusionNon-DNMT3A CHIP is a potentially targetable novel risk factor for CKD progression.","NA","medrxiv",1721081313528

CpE binds selectively to membrane protein receptors called claudins on the apical surfaces of small intestinal epithelium. Claudins normally construct tight junctions that regulate epithelial paracellular transport but are hijacked from doing so by CpE and are instead led to form claudin/CpE ""small complexes"". Small complexes are building blocks for assembling oligomeric {beta}-barrel pores that penetrate the plasma membrane and induce gut cytotoxicity. Here we present structures of CpE in complexes with its native claudin receptor in humans, claudin-4, at 4.0 and 2.8 [A] using cryogenic electron microscopy. The structures reveal the overall architecture of the small complex, that the small complex can be kinetically trapped, and resolve its key features; like the residues used in claudin/CpE complex binding, the orientation of CpE relative to the membrane, and CpE-induced structural changes to claudin-4. Further, the structures allude to the biophysical procession from small complex to cytotoxic {beta}-barrel pore used by CpE during pathogenesis and the role of trypsin in this process. In full, this work elucidates the structure and mechanism of claudin-bound CpE pore assembly and provides strategies to obstruct its formation to treat CpE-induced gastrointestinal diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Yet, viral ecology and evolution remain understudied in these environments. Here, we identified 49,962 viruses from 52 globally distributed hydrothermal vent samples (10 plumes, 40 deposits, and 2 diffuse flow), and reconstructed 5,708 viral metagenome-assembled genomes (vMAGs), the majority of which were bacteriophages. Hydrothermal viruses were largely endemic. However, some viruses were shared between geographically separated vents, predominantly between the Lau Basin and Brothers Volcano in the Pacific Ocean. Geographically distant viruses often shared proteins related to core functions such as structural proteins, and rarely, proteins of auxiliary functions. Common microbial hosts of viruses included members of Campylobacterota, Alpha-, and Gammaproteobacteria in deposits, and Gammaproteobacteria in plumes. Campylobacterota- and Gammaproteobacteria-infecting viruses reflected variations in hydrothermal chemistry and functional redundancy in their predicted microbial hosts, suggesting that hydrothermal geology is a driver of viral ecology and coevolution of viruses and hosts. Our study indicates that viral ecology and evolution in globally distributed hydrothermal vents is shaped by endemism, and thus may have increased susceptibility to the negative impacts of deep-sea mining and anthropogenic change in ocean ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Homologous recombination (HR) is preferred to repair DSBs when a nearby sister chromatid ensures an error-free template. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this preference extends into anaphase and telophase (late mitosis; late-M), despite sister chromatids having been pulled apart. Previously, we identified the nuclear envelope (NE) protein Msc1 as important for late-M DSB repair. Here, we report that Msc1 faces the NE lumen, and its depletion leads to DSB-independent over-compartmentalization of the nucleus, which hampers approximation of sister loci after DSB. Depletion of Msc1 also leads to nuclear pore complex mislocation, a phenotype shared by the highly conserved NE healing complex ESCRT-III. Critically, we show that both Msc1 and ESCRT-III also ensure DSB repair in G2/M, and that there is synergism between Msc1 and the ESCRT-III subunit Snf7. These findings highlight the essential role of NE health in DSB repair.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Adaptor protein complexes (APs), which are recruited to membranes by the small GTPase ARF1, facilitate cargo selection and incorporation into trafficking intermediates. According to the classical model, small vesicles would facilitate bi-directional long-range transport between the Golgi, endosomes and plasma membrane. Here we revisit the intracellular organization of the vesicular transport machinery using a combination of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, live-cell high temporal (fast-confocal) or spatial (stimulated emission depletion (STED)) microscopy as well as correlative light and electron microscopy. We characterize novel tubulo-vesicular ARF1 compartments that harbor clathrin and different APs. Our findings reveal two functionally different classes of ARF1 compartments, each decorated by a different combination of APs. Perinuclear ARF1 compartments facilitate Golgi export of secretory cargo, while peripheral ARF1 compartments are involved in endocytic recycling downstream of early endosomes. Contrary to the classical model of long-range vesicle shuttling, we observe that ARF1 compartments shed ARF1 and mature into recycling endosomes. This maturation process is impaired in the absence of AP-1 and results in trafficking defects. Collectively, these data highlight a crucial role for ARF1 compartments in post-Golgi sorting.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Here, we discover an orphan antitoxin counter-defense element in T4-like phages that can overcome the bacterial toxin-antitoxin phage defense system, DarTG1. The DarT1 toxin, an ADP-ribosyltransferase, modifies phage DNA to prevent replication while its cognate antitoxin, DarG1, is an ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase that reverses these modifications in uninfected bacteria. The orphan phage DarG1-like protein, which we term anti-DarT factor NADAR (AdfN), removes ADP-ribose modifications from phage DNA during infection thereby enabling replication in DarTG1-containing bacteria. AdfN, like DarG1, is in the NADAR superfamily of ADP-ribosylglycohydrolases found across domains of life.

This study aims to quantitatively address the puzzle of how cells are influenced by gravity when they are suspended in bio-fluid. The Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) approach was used to model blood and the cell by applying gravity as an external force along the vertical axis and varied from 0g to 2g during parameter sweeps. It was observed that the cell undergoes shape change and spatially aligns under the influence of gravity, and this was quantified with metrics such as Elongation and Deformation indices, pitch angle, and normalized center of mass. The Elongation Index and the normalized center of mass declined linearly with the applied gravity. Correlation analysis showed a strong correlation between applied gravity and the aforementioned variables. Forces exerted on the solid, specifically drag, shear stress, and solid forces, declined in magnitude as the gravitational force exerted on the cell was increased. Further analysis showed that increasing gravity affected the cells velocity, leading to extended proximity near the wall and increased viscous interaction with the surrounding fluid particles, triggering a shape change.

ResultsWe show that AlphaFold3 is capable of producing amyloid-like assemblies that have a high similarity to experimental structures, although its results are impacted by the number of monomers in the predicted fibril. It produces structurally diverse models of some amyloid proteins, which could reflect their polymorphism observed in nature. We hypothesize that the lower emphasis on multiple sequence analysis (MSA) in AlphaFold3 improves the results quality, since for this class of proteins sequence homology is not necessary for their structural similarity. Notably, the structural landscape obtained from the modeling does not reflect the real one governed by thermodynamics, which does not hamper modeling amyloid proteins. Finally, AlphaFold3 opens the door to fast structural modeling of fibril-like structures, including their polymorphic nature.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

SARS-CoV-2 internalization occurs via S-protein-mediated cell binding followed either by direct fusion with the plasma membrane or endocytosis and subsequent fusion with the endosomal membrane. Despite the crucial role of virus internalization, the precise kinetics of the processes involved remains elusive. We developed a pipeline, which combines live-cell microscopy and advanced image analysis, for measuring the rates of multiple internalization-associated molecular events of single SARS-CoV-2-virus-like particles (VLPs), including endosome ingression, pH change, and nucleocapsid release. Our live-cell imaging experiments demonstrate that only a few minutes after binding to the plasma membrane, VLPs ingress into Rab5-negative endosomes via Dynamin-dependent scission. Less than two minutes later, the pH of VLPs drops below 5 followed by an increase in VLP speed, yet these two events are not interrelated. Nucleocapsid release from the VLPs occurs with similar kinetics to the pH drop, suggesting that VLP fusion occurs during endosome acidification. Neither Omicron mutations nor abrogation of the S protein polybasic cleavage site altered the rate of VLP internalization events, indicating that they do not affect these processes. Finally, we observe that VLP internalization occurs two to three times faster in VeroE6 than in A549 cells, which may contribute to the greater susceptibility of the former cell line to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, our precise measurements of the kinetics of VLP internalization-associated processes shed light on their contribution to the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cells.

A real-world, post hoc analysis, observational 2019nCoV-406 study, was conducted to examine reactogenicity within the first 2 days after vaccination with either a protein-based vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) or an mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) in individuals who previously completed a primary series. Propensity score adjustments were conducted to address potential confounding. The analysis included 1130 participants who received a post-primary series dose of NVX-CoV2373 (n = 303) or an mRNA vaccine (n = 827) during the study period. Within the first 2 days after vaccination, solicited systemic reactogenicity events (adjusted) were reported in 60.5% of participants who received NVX-CoV2373 compared with 84.3% of participants who received an mRNA vaccine; moreover, 33.9% and 61.4%, respectively, reported [&ge;]3 systemic reactogenicity symptoms. The adjusted mean (95% CI) number of systemic symptoms was 1.8 (1.6-2.0) and 3.2 (3.0-3.4), respectively. Local reactogenicity events (adjusted) were reported in 73.4% and 91.7% of participants who received NVX-CoV2373 and mRNA vaccines, respectively; the adjusted mean (95% CI) number of local symptoms was 1.5 (1.33-1.61) and 2.4 (2.31-2.52), respectively. These results support the use of adjuvanted, protein-based NVX-CoV2373 as an immunization option with low reactogenicity.","NA","medrxiv",1721081313528

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

Yet, unlike melanin, the genetics of pterin-based pigmentation has received relatively little attention in animal colouration studies. Here, we use a lineage of axanthic ball pythons (Python regius) found in captivity as a model system for studying pterin pigmentation in vertebrates. We crowd-sourced ball python shed skin from commercial breeders and applied a case-control study design. Using whole-genome pool sequencing (pool-seq) and variant annotation, we found a premature stop codon in GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (gch1) associated with the axanthic phenotype. The enzyme GCH1 plays a key role in pterin pigment biosynthesis as well as neurochemistry, catalyzing the first rate-limiting step of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) biosynthesis. Our work provides the first identification of an axanthism-associated gene in vertebrates and highlights the utility of ball pythons as a model system to study pterin-based pigmentation.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313528

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313529

However, central metabolism corresponds to only a small fraction of the biosynthetic potential of microbes: metabolites such as antimicrobial compounds, signaling molecules, and co-factors are underexplored forces shaping microbial communities. Here, we focus on B vitamin exchange in coastal marine bacterial communities that degrade particulate organic matter and find that natural seawater communities are vitamin limited. While almost a third of bacterial isolates from these communities are B vitamin auxotrophs, the pioneering degraders that first arrive on particles are vitamin producers that likely support auxotrophs through cross-feeding. However, combining experiments and a resource-explicit model, we show that auxotroph growth is often not restored by coculture with vitamin producers, but rather requires lysis and subsequent vitamin recycling. Our results highlight the importance of vitamin auxotrophies and lysis-mediated cross-feeding as important factors controlling microbial community assembly and succession on marine particles.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313529

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3, which convergently acquired S protein substitutions such as S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Furthermore, JN.1 subvariants such as LB.1 and KP.2.3, which convergently acquired S:S31del in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. Here we investigated the virological properties of KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313529

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1721081313529

The striped variety has attracted particular attention for its intricate and unpredictable patterns. A good understanding of the mechanism that drives the striped pattern formation of the broken tulips has been missing since the 17th century. It is known since 1928 that these patterned tulips suffer from a viral infection by the tulip breaking virus. Here, we present a mathematical model to understand how a virus infection of the petals can lead to stripes, thereby solving a 350 year old mystery. The model, which describes the viral inhibition of pigment expression (anthocyanins) and their interaction with viral reproduction, incorporates a pattern formation mechanism identified as an activator-substrate mechanism, similar to the well-known Turing instability, working together with a Wolperts positional information mechanism. The model is solved on a growing tulip petal shaped domain, whereby we introduce a new method to describe the tulip petal growth explicitly. This work contributes to the theory of pattern formation of reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains applied to the fields of virology and botany.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313529

Recent studies have shown that some archaea and bacteria contain alternative histones that exhibit different DNA binding properties, in addition to highly divergent sequences. However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1721081313529
