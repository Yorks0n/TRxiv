Here, we developed a new computational framework to minimize negative transfer for domain-adaptive brain decoding by reframing source selection as a mixture model parameter estimation problem, allowing each source subject to contribute through a continuous mixture weight rather than being outright included or excluded. To compute these weights, we developed a novel convex optimization algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Moments. By using model performance metrics as the generalized moment functions in our GMM optimization, our algorithm also provides theoretical guarantees that the mixture weights are an optimal approximation of the importance weights that underlie domain adaptation theory. When tested on a large-scale brain decoding dataset (n=105 subjects), our new mixture model weighting framework achieved state-of-the-art performance--increasing accuracy up to 2.5% over baseline fine-tuning, double the performance gain compared to previous research in supervised source selection. Notably, these improvements were achieved using significantly less training data (i.e., 62% smaller effective sample sizes), suggesting that our performance gains stem from reduced negative transfer. Collectively, this research advances toward a more principled and generalizable brain decoding framework, laying the mathematical foundation for scalable brain-computer interfaces and other applications in computational neuroscience.","[{""name"":""Schroeder Institute for Brain Innovation and Recovery"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392402

However, SARS-CoV-2 could introduce mutations in the viral proteins to confer resistance to antivirals. Thus, screening for drug-resistant SARS-CoV-2 mutants and elucidating their resistant mechanisms are critical for guiding the selection of effective antiviral therapies. Here, we utilized a luminescent attenuated SARS-CoV-2 ({Delta}3a7b-Nluc WT) to safely identify ensitrelvir drug-resistant mutants (DRM-E) without the need of using virulent forms of SARS-CoV-2. We isolated a DRM-E containing a G23 deletion (G23del) in Mpro with high resistance (>1,000 fold) to ensitrelvir, but not to the other Mpro inhibitor (nirmatrelvir) or to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor remdesivir. The contribution of G23del was confirmed by generating a recombinant luminescent attenuated SARS-CoV-2 containing G23del in the non-structural protein 5 (NSP5) gene ({Delta}3a7b-Nluc G23del). {Delta}3a7b-Nluc G23del exhibited significant resistance to ensitrelvir in both cultured cells an in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice. Binding affinity revealed that G23del mutation substantially altered Mpro binding affinity for ensitrelvir but not nirmatrelvir. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that G23del in Mpro can confer high resistance to ensitrelvir. Positively, G23del in Mpro does not render SARS-CoV-2 resistant to nirmatrelvir or remdesivir, suggesting the feasibility of treating infections with SARS-CoV-2 containing G23del with these other approved antivirals.","[{""name"":""NIAID"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U19 AI171403;R01 AI161363;R01 AI161363-03S1;5N93021C00014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392402

By quantitatively characterizing tissue dynamics and mechanics with oil microdroplets in cerebral organoids derived from humans, gorillas, and mice, here we uncover a transient fluidization that occurs exclusively in the basal region of human neuroepithelia. Enhanced droplet motility and frequent cell rearrangements reveal this basal tissue fluidization, which is absent in gorilla and mouse neuroepithelia and diminishes in humans at the onset of neurogenesis. Basal fluidization is driven by nuclear movement fluctuations and facilitated by expanded intercellular spaces. Increasing N-cadherin expression in human neuroepithelia to gorilla levels suppresses both nuclear fluctuations and basal fluidity. Our findings identify transient basal fluidization as a novel mechanical hallmark of early human forebrain development, which may contribute to the tangential surface expansion unique to humans.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EXC 2068 - 390729961;""},{""name"":""European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101002564;""},{""name"":""Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012kf4317"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392402

Despite this conservation, TBP function diverges across species. In yeast, TBP is required for all three RNA Pols, whereas in mammals, it is essential only for RNA Pol III, but not RNA Pol I or II. To examine the evolutionary divergence of TBP homologs in different species, we determined the ability of murine TBP and its paralogs to complement endogenous TBP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite their highly conserved DNA-binding domains, murine TBP homologs were unable to fully rescue the lethality caused by TBP inactivation in yeast. This incomplete complementation correlates with a failure to fully support binding by RNA Pols II and III. Furthermore, we show that the divergent N-terminal domain (NTD) of TBP contributes to species-specific activity and modulates RNA Pol II binding changes in stress-induced response. Lastly, we demonstrate a negative correlation between the length of the intrinsically disordered NTD of TBP family proteins and the gene density in different species, suggesting that the NTD may have contributed to increasingly complex gene regulation during evolution.","[{""name"":""Canadian Institutes of Health Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gavpb45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PJT-191938;PJT-162289;""},{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGPIN-2020-06106;""},{""name"":""Canada Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0517h6h17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRC-RS 2021-00294;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Leopards (Panthera pardus), a widely distributed generalist species, provide an ideal case for studying the role of the environment. The population dynamics of African and Asian leopards differ dramatically, with near panmixia in Africa versus a strong structure and eight subspecies in Asia. Fossil records show that a population in Europe disappeared after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), further pointing to complex range dynamics in Eurasia. In this study, we explicitly test the role of climate in shaping leopards population dynamics across the continents, by quantitatively combining paleoclimatic, demographic, and genetic simulations over the last 450 thousand years. Using an Approximate Bayesian Computational framework, we show that the genetic structure differences between Africa and Asia can be explained by distinct historical climatic conditions in these two continents: most of sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Southeast Asia exhibited a stable range without geographical barriers, while other areas such as Morocco, Afghanistan and Northeast Asia showed expansion and extinction cycles during glacial and interglacials. We further model population dynamics in Europe and validate it against fossil and radiocarbon dates records. We find that European populations were likely fragile, with extinctions repeatedly predicted over multiple glacial cycles, indicating that climate change possibly led to the extinction of the European subspecies following the LGM. Notably, we found that climate during the Holocene should have allowed a more recent recolonisation that did not happen, indicating other factors such as human presence might have blocked it.","[{""name"":""Cambridge Commonwealth European and International Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05sprqy15"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Actions"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101028348;101063265;""},{""name"":""Natural Environment Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02b5d8509"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NE/S007164/1;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""647787;""},{""name"":""Leverhulme Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012mzw131"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RPG-2020-317;""},{""name"":""Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) provide richer information than simple population genetic summary statistics and can potentially improve the power and accuracy of such inference. We present mrpast, a tool for inferring complex demographic history from ARGs. mrpast uses a composite likelihood formulation based on the pairwise sample coalescence time, observable in an ARG, and the coalescence probabilities from a continuous-time Markov process. We have evaluated mrpast's accuracy on a variety of models, including stepping-stone models with asymmetric migrations, changes in effective population sizes, out-of-Africa, and American admixture. We demonstrated mrpast's accuracy using simulated ARGs and inferred ARGs, and its high versatility in jointly inferring all parameters in complex models, including time of demographic events (e.g., population split, admixture), effective population size (e.g., constant, exponential growth), and gene flow (e.g., admixture proportion, migration rate). Extending the three-population out-of-Africa model with asymmetric migrations, we observed significantly more migrations from East Asians to Europeans than from Europeans to East Asians. Notably, mrpast can reliably recover all parameters in an American admixture model, when treating non-admixed Native American as an unsampled (""ghost"") population. Applying this model to Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Colombian populations, we found that the reconstructed histories of Native and admixed Americans align closely with both historical records and genetic evidence. Lastly, mrpast provides a comprehensive pipeline to facilitate easier, more appropriate, and robust demographic inference, such that users can easily use it to simulate, infer, and manipulate ARGs, and illustrate and test a demographic model.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM150579;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

We have recently shown that mesothelin-targeting CAR T cells co-transduced with cytokine-binding synthetic velocity receptors (VRs, referred to as CAR TV cells) demonstrate increased motility, improved infiltration in solid primary tumors, and lead to a better anti-tumor effect compared to CAR T cells that do not express VRs. However, it is metastasis that causes the vast majority of cancer related deaths and is difficult to target clinically, indicating an urgent unmet need. We show that these CAR T cells engineered to be hyper-migratory using VRs are highly effective against liver metastasis of ovarian cancer along different stages of the metastatic cascade. Mesothelin-targeting CAR TV cells expressing synthetic or native receptors responsive to the cytokine Interleukin-5 improved the survival of mice bearing an extremely high or  terminal level of metastatic burden compared to CAR T cells that did not express VRs. Against newly established metastatic lesions and lesions undergoing metastatic outgrowth, CAR TV cells showed a robust anti-cancer effect resulting in an improved prognosis compared to control CAR T cells. Histopathological assessments showed a substantial reduction of metastasis number and lesion size with CAR TV treatment, concomitant with increased immune cell infiltration in the metastatic regions. Our work demonstrates the efficacy of high-motility CAR T cells in a metastatic setting and extends their scope to the treatment of metastasis of solid tumors.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U54CA143868;U54AR081774;U54CA268083;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U01AG060903;P30CA006973;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Using magnetic tweezers, we show that the CoV non-structural protein (nsp) 13-helicase drives polymerase template switching, followed by copy-back RNA synthesis. This activity requires nsp13-helicase ATPase activity and a duplex RNA downstream of the CoV polymerase. This novel function of nsp13-helicase is targeted by the nucleotide analogs remdesivir and molnupiravir, whose incorporation in the nascent strand increases CoV polymerase template switching probability, leading to defective RNA production. We propose a novel mechanism of action where incorporation of these analogs dramatically reduces full length genome copy number by stimulating polymerase template switching. Our study further demonstrates nsp13-helicase's central role in CoV replication and how this enzyme function can be indirectly targeted by analogs.","[{""name"":""NWO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OCENW.XL21.XL21.115;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/043z4tv69"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AI161841-01;AI171292;AI158463;""},{""name"":""NIGMS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GM12260;GM067153;""},{""name"":""Netherlands Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Gravitation grant 024.003.019;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

We demonstrate that this standard formulation, which we refer to as an omnimodel, accurately fits the majority of voltage-gated models in the database (over 3,000 models). It produces similar, if not identical, responses to voltage-clamp protocols in simulations where the ion channel omnimodels were used. Importantly, the standard formalism enables easy comparison of models based on parameter settings. It can also be used to make new observations about the space of ion channel kinetics found in neurons. Furthermore, it facilitates the inference of ion channel parameters from the responses to standard protocols. We provide an interactive platform to compare and select channel models, and encourage the community to use this standard formulation whenever possible, to facilitate understanding and comparison among models.","[{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UKRI-BBSRC BB/N019512/1;""},{""name"":""German Research Foundation (DFG)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EXC 2064 – Project number 390727645;""},{""name"":""CRC ``Robust Vision''."",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1233;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SynapSeek;DeepCoMechTome;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Bi-cyclic peptides represent a unique, modular, modality in the antiviral armamentarium against future pandemics. This study provides a deeper evaluation of multivalent bi-cyclic (Bicycle(R)) molecule efficacy in several preclinical SARS-CoV-2 challenge settings. We explore both pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure therapeutic settings via subcutaneous and intranasal routes of administration. We contextualize this further in bespoke scenarios of immune compromisation, and viral transmission. Promisingly, in all studies we observe efficacy, significantly reducing infectious viral burden at each study endpoint. These data further support candidacy of Bicycle molecules as a differentiated antiviral therapeutic class in the context of pandemic preparedness.

ImportanceThe COVID-19 pandemic, triggered a rapid wave of innovation, accelerating the delivery of new vaccine technology and anti-viral treatments. In our first paper, we described the discovery and molecular optimization of Bicycle molecules as a novel drug class for the potential treatment of SARS CoV-2. Here, we have performed deeper characterization of these molecules in established animal models that simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission, testing more convenient delivery routes, such as intra-nasal. The Bicycle molecules demonstrated positive outcomes in each of these studies and suggest that Bicycle molecules, as convenient and effective anti-viral treatments, could be an important addition to help future preparedness against new viral pandemics.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Gene co-expression networks revealed that stress-response hubs were largely lineage-specific, yet converged in function through the co-option of ancient gene families. Phylogenomic and machine learning analyses supported a dominant role for early-evolving genes, enriched in stress-related functions, with extensive gene loss at terrestrialisation nodes.

Several studies have compared how food and social rewards are represented in different regions involved in reward processing and found either overlapping or distinct representations. In the basolateral amygdala (BLA) there seems to be opposing evidence for both shared and unique encoding of social and nonsocial stimuli. In our recent work, we found that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region reciprocally connected to the BLA, has distinct social and food representations using a novel self-paced two-choice assay. Given that the BLA and mPFC play differing roles in reward processing, it is important to understand how these two nodes may differ in their encoding reward types within the same assay. To resolve how the BLA encodes social and food information, we recorded the activity of individual BLA neurons in female and male mice during a two-choice social-sucrose operant task. We found that BLA neurons robustly and distinctly respond to social and food reward. In contrast to the mPFC, BLA neurons did not show a bias towards social reward responsiveness and instead showed equal social/sucrose representation, in males, or a sucrose reward bias, in females. BLA neurons were sensitive to internal state - water deprivation increased the proportion of sucrose reward responsive neurons. Additionally, sucrose reward responsive BLA neurons were differentially sensitive to reward omissions, such that neurons that were excited by sucrose reward were more sensitive to reward omissions compared to those inhibited by reward. Together, these findings demonstrate distinct, heterogeneous response profiles within the BLA to social and food rewards, in a manner different from the mPFC.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01MH130755;F31MH133373;""},{""name"":""Alfred P.

Recent years have seen the rise of rate-variable diversification models and metrics that estimate the rates of species diversification at the tips of phylogenetic trees and are thus potentially useful for predicting future evolutionary success of individual species. These methods use various assumptions about the variability and heritability of diversification rates. However, the general performance of rate-variable diversification methods have never been consistently tested against real world data. Here we explore the capacity of multiple rate-variable diversification methods to predict near-future diversification using temporal slices of empirical fossil and extant phylogenies. We do this using a newly developed approach similar to generalized linear models, allowing us to quantify the relationship between predictor tip rates and subsequent diversification rates derived from a probability distribution of numbers of daughter species. We find that tip rates estimated from current methods have non-zero but limited capacity to predict diversification in both fossil and extant phylogenies. The quality of the predictions depends not only on the methods used but also on the specific phylogeny, suggesting that diversification dynamics in some taxa may be more predictable in principle. Our results suggest that future cladogenesis can be, to a certain extent, predicted using existing tip rate methods, but the quality of such predictions is highly variable and depends on factors that are difficult to evaluate in practical applications.","[{""name"":""Czech Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01pv73b02"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GA&#268;R 24-12851O;GA&#268;R 20-29554X;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

During heat shock, misfolded proteins accumulate in its granular component (GC), but whether this is passive or regulated has been unclear. We show that the ubiquitin ligase CHIP remodels the nucleolus into a reversible protein quality control (PQC) compartment by diverting HSP70 from refolding toward sequestration and transiently suppressing rRNA synthesis. This process requires the segregase VCP, which mediates ubiquitinated substrate flux and couples nucleolar PQC with nuclear and ER stress responses. Functional genomics identify NOL6 and WDR55 as intrinsic gatekeepers with opposing effects on sequestration. We further define three structural states - free-flow, peripheral, and sealed - that encode PQC capacity and recovery potential. Thus, nucleolar proteostasis is revealed as an actively regulated continuum, linking chaperones, ubiquitination, and ribosome biogenesis with global stress adaptation.","[{""name"":""National Science Centre"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03ha2q922"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2021/42/E/NZ1/00190;2018/30/E/NZ7/00614;2019/34/H/NZ3/00691;""},{""name"":""Foundation for Polish Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/048zd9m77"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""POIR.04.04.00-00-5EAB/18-00;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

EPP1 is recruited to the activated SYMRK receptor, where it is phosphorylated on a key serine residue, an event essential and sufficient to propagate symbiotic signaling.

We demonstrate that roles of ATRX in telomere maintenance and replication are genetically separable requiring its ATPase activity and PIP-box, respectively, and independently of its DAXX interaction.

Why perturbations in ER morphology manifest specifically in neurons remains unknown. Here, by coupling visualisation of global sub-Hz firing bursts to ER ultrastructural manipulations in hiPSC-derived cortical neurons, alongside physical simulations, we establish a key ER structure-function principle: neuronal ER architecture dictates Ca2+ replenishment speed. Altering ER structure hinders network ER luminal connectivity and Ca2+ propagation from refill points at plasma membrane contact sites, impairing the ER's capability to supply repetitive Ca2+ bursts. The ER morpho-regulatory control of Ca2+ refill speed thus constitutes a switch on neuronal activity. These results expose the selective vulnerability of Ca2+-firing cells to ER structural disruptions, rationalising ER dysfunction in neurodegeneration.

Importantly, loss of Cirl also narrows Ir64a-DC4 tuning properties. Homologous neurons in Drosophila sechellia naturally exhibit narrow acid tuning, despite functional conservation of Ir64a; these differences correlate instead with lower expression of metabotropic components.

To address this gap, we exposed human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical organoids (COs; six independent lines) to physiologically relevant APAP concentrations (25, 50, and 100 M) for 5 days starting at day 21, a developmental stage corresponding to the late first trimester. We assessed organoid growth, apoptosis, neuronal/progenitor ratios, transcriptomics (RNA-seq), and functional maturation using multielectrode arrays (2-4 months). APAP exposure did not alter growth dynamics, cytoarchitecture, or viability, with apoptosis rates remaining below 1% in all conditions. Neuronal and progenitor cell proportions were unchanged. Bulk RNA-seq revealed subtle, dose-dependent transcriptional changes only at higher doses (0 differentially expressed genes at 25 {micro}M, 9 at 50 {micro}M, and 16 at 100 {micro}M), enriched for neurodevelopmental pathways. Despite these slight molecular perturbations, electrophysiological recordings showed normal firing rates, burst frequency, and network synchronicity across exposure groups. Taken together, therapeutic APAP concentrations produced only modest transcriptional effects without structural or functional consequences in developing cortical organoids. These results align with recent sibling-controlled epidemiological studies that attribute reported associations to confounding and provide mechanistic reassurance that recommended APAP use during pregnancy is unlikely to disrupt fetal brain development.","[{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R21HD109616;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R56MH128365;R21MH128827;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00j4k1h63"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01ES033636;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Upon cell entry, translation of the virus genome is mediated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5 untranslated region (UTR). Despite early identification of the poliovirus IRES, structure determination has been hampered by the flexibility and complexity of the RNA ([~]450 nt, five structured domains), the requirement for almost all of the eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), and additional dependency on PCBP2 for trans-activation. As a result, there is little mechanistic information on how enterovirus Type 1 IRESs recruit and direct translational machinery.

To address this, here we reconstitute human translation initiation on a model poliovirus IRES and examine 48S complexes by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). Our structures reveal a novel set of interactions between the IRES and the translation machinery. Domain IVc contacts uS19 and uS13 on the small ribosomal subunit, and the conserved apical GNRA tetraloop interacts directly with the initiator tRNA during start-codon recognition. We demonstrate that disruption of these contacts causes defects in IRES-driven translation and virus replication. Together, our results define the structural and molecular basis for translation initiation on the Type 1 IRES, and highlight the potential for RNA-RNA tertiary interactions as new targets for antiviral therapeutics.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/Z515668/1;BB/M011151/1;BBS/E/PI/230002A;BBS/E/PI/23NB0003;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/T000376/1;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""220620/Z/20/Z;202471/Z/16/A;221818/Z/20/Z;""},{""name"":""Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03356n642"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

However, existing methods for heritability estimation attributed to rare-coding variants are often limited by the effects of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and by the sparse nature of rare variant data. We introduce FLEX (Fast, LD-aware Estimation of eXome-wide and gene-level heritability), a scalable and flexible framework for estimating and partitioning heritability across genes or sets of genes using WES data. FLEX integrates all coding variants--from common to ultra-rare--within a unified model and corrects for LD-induced effects to improve the accuracy of heritability estimates. In addition, FLEX supports both individual-level and summary statistic data and is computationally efficient for biobank-scale datasets. Through extensive simulations, we show that FLEX is well-calibrated while providing accurate heritability estimates. We applied FLEX to WES data across N = 153, 351 unrelated European ancestry individuals and 20 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank. We identified 64 gene-trait pairs with significant gene-level heritability (p < 0.05/18, 624 accounting for the number of protein-coding genes tested), among which rare coding variants explained 38% of gene-level heritability, on average. Compared to heritability estimates from genome-wide imputed SNPs, incorporation of rare and ultra-rare coding variants led to a 24.8% increase in heritability on average, while effect sizes at rare and ultra-rare variants are substantially larger ({approx}18x on average). Partitioning across variant effect annotations, we find that predicted loss-of-function variants had stronger individual effects than missense variants (24% on average) while missense variants accounted for a greater share of rare coding heritability. Together, FLEX provides an adaptable and accurate approach for quantifying gene-level heritability, advancing our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits, and facilitating the discovery of trait-relevant genes.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM153406;""},{""name"":""National Heart Lung and Blood Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012pb6c26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HL170604;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00adh9b73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01DK132775;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CAREER-1943497;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Here, we use hiPSC-derived neuronal networks containing both excitatory and inhibitory neurons to show that excessive bursting activity in DS cultures is driven by excitatory neurons. This rise in bursting frequency is caused by the increased expression of HCN1 ""pacemaker"" channels in excitatory neurons, and bursting activity can be normalised using a channel blocker.

It is becoming increasingly clear that even at lower doses, ethanol exposure impacts both the brain and behavior. Emerging work has shown that chronic exposure to lower doses of ethanol may lead to inflexible behaviors and promote aberrant reward seeking. This study aimed to determine the impact of chronic, low-dose ethanol exposure on neural substrates of reward and associated alterations in behavioral strategy in response to change in reward value. Methods: Female and male C57BL/6J mice underwent operant training to self-administer 10% sucrose under a fixed ratio schedule. Once mice showed stable responding, response criteria were graduated to a random interval schedule to promote automated behaviors. Throughout training, mice were given an i.p. injection of low-dose ethanol (0.5g/kg) or saline, 1 hour after each training session. Mice did not receive low-dose ethanol or saline i.p. injections after completion of training. Mice were then tested in PR task in which the reward magnitude of reinforcer was reduced (small or large) or increased (small or large). A subset of mice expressed a retrograde tracer in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and cFos expression within NAc circuits was analyzed following a sucrose self-administration session. Results: Chronic low-dose ethanol exposure altered behavioral responding in female mice following small changes in reward magnitude. Female mice showed divergent response patterns when there was a small reduction in reward magnitude, with greater proportions of ethanol-exposed female mice either increasing or decreasing responding versus controls. Following a small increase, low-dose ethanol female mice significantly increased responding versus controls. Female mice exposed to chronic low-dose ethanol shifted behavioral strategy with a reduction in ""checking"" behavior (magazine entry after a lever press) in response to changes in reward magnitude. This effect was not observed in male mice. Low-dose ethanol altered cFos expression within the prelimbic cortex and its projections to the NAc during reward seeking. Conclusions: Chronic, low-dose ethanol altered behavioral responding and strategy in female mice in response to changes in reward value. During reward seeking, low-dose ethanol exposure impacted prelimbic cortex and its projections to the nucleus accumbens activity in both female and male mice. Future studies should investigate the consequences of chronic low-dose ethanol on both the brain and behavior to further understand what underlying processes drive aberrant reward-seeking behaviors.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02jzrsm59"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31AA031439;R21AA027629;T32 A007462;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Formed by the phase separation of biomolecules, condensates possess a wide range of mechanical responses. However, how condensate viscoelastic responses are encoded in the chemistries of their constituents---such as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)---are not well understood. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to connect measurable condensate viscoelasticity to the architectural heterogeneity and dynamic reconfigurability of associative networks formed by IDPs. Using a residue-resolution coarse-grained model, we characterize biologically relevant and synthetic condensates, demonstrating that their temperature sensitivity of elasticity is sequence dependent and modeled by exponential scaling laws. We interrogate condensate mesh heterogeneity via entanglement spacing, finding that entropy-driven structural heterogeneity and reduced IDP hydrophobicity favor condensate elasticity. Furthermore, we construct graph-theoretical representations of condensates and find that interaction network topologies with an abundance of redundant node pathways translates to more load-bearing paths for mechanical stress storage. Strikingly, we discover that elastic coupling of IDPs within condensates emerges when single-molecule shape memory timescales approach meshwork reconfiguration timescales. Akin to a condensate Deborah number, this interplay of timescales for molecular and microstructural processes dictates how restoring elastic forces propagate and are stored across IDP networks; linking condensate microstructure dynamics directly to mechanical responses. Taken together, our work provides a conceptual framework of how condensates act as stress-responsive biomaterials; helping illuminate how cells exploit condensate mechanics to sense and regulate their internal environment and opening avenues for the design of condensates with programmable material properties.","[{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative DAF (an advised fund of Silicon Valley Community Foundation)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2023-332391;""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM155259;""},{""name"":""Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NSF PHY-2309135;""},{""name"":""Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006wxqw41"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2919.02;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

A library of approximately 200,000 peptides was efficiently produced in E. coli with sufficient library diversity to identify cleavage efficiency of thousands of substrates for most proteases in a single assay.

We analyze >20 years of dengue data across >5000 municipalities and find that observed temperature anomalies in municipalities of southern Brazil pushed those locations into optimal thermal conditions for dengue transmission. In contrast, in northern Brazil, 2023/24 temperatures became too high for effective transmission, resulting in lower dengue incidence compared to a counterfactual scenario without anthropogenic climate change. We test the generalizability of our model to high altitude areas in Mexico, where dengue has been expanding.

How do prey cope with an evolutionarily new predation risk? We tracked three vervet monkey troops in a South-African semi-urban habitat for 14 months to study their response to domestic dogs. We show that monkeys responded to dogs with a two-pronged behaviour: they emitted alarm calls, and became more vigilant and displayed aggressive behaviours towards the dogs. While their movement highlighted risk-prone behaviour, they appeared to have mapped and planned for risk, as they reacted more strongly when risk was unexpected. The response intensity was further modulated by risk labels typically encountered in their natural environment, but not by labels uniquely associated with dogs. This highlights that vervet monkeys responded with ingrained behaviour to this evolutionarily new threat, anticipating risk based on long-term spatial memory, but failed to integrate evolutionarily new information.

The disease is caused by the insertion of a SINE-VNTR-Alu subfamily F (SVA_F) retrotransposon within an intron of the TATA-box binding protein-associated factor 1 (TAF1) gene. A major barrier to understanding the pathophysiology of XDP has been the lack of relevant animal models. Here, we introduce a novel conditional humanized XDP mouse model harboring a hybrid mouse-human Taf1/TAF1 gene (hyTAF1) containing the pathogenic SVA_F insertion. We activated the hyTAF1 in Nestin+ neural progenitor cells and found that the resulting XDP male mice recapitulate features of the human disease including severe motor impairment, striatal atrophy, and reactive gliosis. Transcriptomic, histological, and electron microscopy analysis revealed a dramatic reduction in oligodendrocyte lineage cells and widespread myelin disruption. Consistent with these findings, postmortem brain tissue from XDP patients revealed similar myelin pathology, including near-complete loss of myelin in parts of the medial prefrontal cortex. Together, these results identify oligodendrocyte dysfunction and myelin loss as previously unrecognized contributors to XDP pathogenesis, providing new mechanistic insight into this debilitating disorder.","[{""name"":""Collaborative Center for X-linked Dystonia Parkinsonism"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""MD Anderson Neurodegeneration Consortium"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Anonymous Donors"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Carol and Gene Ludwig Family Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Leon Levy Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/033hnyq61"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""NIH BRAIN Initiative"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U19NS1076;""},{""name"":""Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30CA016087;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""S10 OD019974;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Since MSAs are inherently noisy, ML tools may experience overfitting, whereby the inferred topology incorrectly models noise alongside the true phylogenetic signal. We statistically assess overfitting in ML tools using log-likelihood scores on unseen sites as primary metric. We deploy a 10-fold Monte Carlo cross-validation approach, partitioning 9,062 empirical and 6,342 simulated MSAs into training (80%) and testing (20%) sites. We conduct inferences using RAxML-NG, IQ-TREE, FastTree, and RAxML-NG ES (a recently released Early Stopping version) on the training MSAs. We store all intermediate improved topologies and subsequently evaluate them via the testing sites. We perform a linear regression on the final segments of the derived testing curves, and statistically evaluate the line slopes via the sign test. Our results indicate that ML tools do not overfit. For RAxML-NG (standard and ES) and IQ-TREE, the overall trend is non-significant for 86-98% of the empirical MSAs, while for less than 1% the tools exhibit overfitting. FastTree shows more positive trends, suggesting premature termination, especially on protein MSAs. Topological accuracy curves on simulated data further confirm that tools do not systematically diverge from the true topology. To complement these findings, we test whether strategies to mitigate overfitting can benefit ML inferences. To this end, we also benchmark a site-based holdout validation (HV) version of RAxML-NG. The results confirm that the overfitting is absent and also indicate that excluding MSA sites substantially reduces phylogenetic signal as well as accuracy.","[{""name"":""Klaus Tschira Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/052jep661"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101087081 (Comp-Biodiv-GR);""},{""name"":""PRAIRIE"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-19-P3IA-0001;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

These mechanisms are governed by gene regulatory networks - complex systems of transcription factors and other regulators that control gene expression. To investigate regulatory heterogeneity at the patient level, we inferred individual gene regulatory networks for over 9,000 tumors across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas enabling a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of inter-patient regulatory variation. Our analysis uncovered novel regulatory subtypes and revealed recurrent dysregulation of the PD-1 signaling pathway in 23 cancer types. This dysregulation was associated with patient outcomes in 12 cancers and appeared largely independent of established molecular subtypes and immune cell composition, suggesting alternative regulatory mechanisms. We identified both well-characterized (FOS, JUNB, ATF3) and previously unrecognized (RFX7, ELF1, NFYA, NFYC) transcriptional regulators of PD-L1 (CD274), highlighting new candidate targets for modulating immune checkpoint activity across tumor types.

A recent study identified an association between rs562556 within PCSK9 and breast cancer survival (BCS). It was suggested that PCSK9 inhibition might allow for early intervention strategies to prevent metastasizing breast cancer. Here, we attempt to replicate these findings by using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics in three 2-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) approaches.

MethodsWe used publicly available GWAS summary statistics for PCSK9 and BCS from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (N=99,217), and performed SNP association tests with BCS in the FinnGen study (N=4,648). First, we tested the MR-ratio using only the reported SNP rs562556, then tested the genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition using the MR inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach, and finally adjusted for indirect effects of the lipid metabolism using multivariable MR (MVMR-IVW). Coronary artery disease and parental longevity were chosen as positive control outcomes.

ResultsWe found no significant association between PCSK9 and BCS in neither the MR-ratio, MR-IVW nor MVMR-IVW approach. The positive controls were significant throughout.

ConclusionA significant positive effect of PCSK9 on BCS could only be reproduced when using the outcome data from the recent study, but not when using independent, larger GWASs.

ImpactPotential reasons for the discrepant results are different genetic models, sample selection criteria, and the time-variability of Hazard Ratio estimates. They should be explored before considering PCSK9 a therapeutic target in BC patients.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759961392403

P. aeruginosa isolates from the CF airways are also known to commonly acquire mutations in the quorum sensing regulator, lasR. The appearance of these lasR mutants is associated with a worsening clinical prognosis. In this work, we show that loss of lasR function has a significant impact on the stability of inter-species interactions in a polymicrobial ecosystem, and in particular on the dynamics of a common CF-associated fungus, Candida albicans. Titres of C. albicans were stable in the presence of wild type P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. However, when wild type P. aeruginosa was replaced by a {delta}lasR mutant, C. albicans titres progressively declined over time. This instability could be reversed by ectopic expression of a Type VI Secretion System effector cluster (tsi) in the %[delta]lasR mutant. We also noted that challenge of the polymicrobial cultures with a clinically-relevant combination of antibiotics (colistin and ciprofloxacin) led to a hyphal bloom of the fungus. This bloom was abolished in the %[delta]lasR mutant, but again, was restored by ectopic expression of the tsi cluster. Finally, we show that whereas wild type P. aeruginosa is relatively agnostic to the presence of other microbes, the %[delta]lasR mutant is not and undergoes substantial transcriptional reprogramming. Our data indicate that lasR has a large and previously unrecognised impact on inter-species interactions. We therefore propose that lasR is an ecological keystone gene.","[{""name"":""Cystic Fibrosis Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03xeae684"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Venture and Innovation Award;""},{""name"":""BBSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Analyses of single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from human AD cortical tissues and in vitro AD models reveal a notable increase and abnormal cytoplasmic localization of XIST, a phenomenon not previously observed in neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, altered EZH2 levels dampen the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) on the inactive X chromosome, disrupting epigenetic silencing. This dysregulation impacts the RNA export factor subunit THOC2, whose levels are also elevated in AD. Cytoplasmic XIST acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by binding to miR-186-5p, rescuing EZH2 and THOC2 transcripts. This creates a positive feedback loop that sustains both nuclear epigenetic machinery and cytoplasmic post-transcriptional regulation by XIST. The miR-186/EZH2/THOC2/XIST axis offers a molecular framework for understanding the female-biased vulnerability in AD, linking XIST-driven epigenetic changes with nuclear RNA export pathways via cytoplasmic XIST. Disrupted EZH2-XIST interaction reduces H3K27me3 marks on the inactive X chromosome, while increased THOC2 promotes THOC2 (TREX) binding to XIST, maintaining the harmful feedback. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism through which XIST gets recruited to the nuclear export pathways in AD. These results position XIST as a key epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulator in female AD pathophysiology and suggest it could be a target for sex-specific therapeutic interventions.","[{""name"":""Department of Atomic Energy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02m388s04"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RSI 4002;""},{""name"":""Department of Science and Technology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0101xrq71"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRG/2021/000678;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

However, the relationship between their catalytic activities and antimicrobial functions remains largely unknown. Particularly, few biologically relevant substrates of these proteases have been identified. Huanglongbing (HLB) has been a major threat to the citrus industry worldwide. The HLB-associated bacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las), was previously shown to deploy an inhibitor of papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) to promote disease in citrus. In this study, we identified an outer membrane protein (OMP) of Las, LasOMP1, as a substrate of the citrus PLCP CsRD21a. LasOMP1 is one of the most highly expressed genes in Las. CsRD21a cleaves LasOMP1 and produces cleaved peptide products, which could be detected in vitro and in HLB-diseased citrus plants. We found that CsRD21a targets the N-terminal portion of LasOMP1, potentially at an extracellular loop region. Importantly, transgenic sweet orange overexpressing CsRD21a showed reduced Las titers and delayed disease symptoms, highlighting that engineering this protease is a promising strategy to enhance HLB resistance in citrus. Together, our work reveals a pathogen-derived substrate of plant PLCPs and highlights bacterial OMPs as direct targets of plant defense.","[{""name"":""USDA-NIFA"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2020-70029-33197;2022-70029-38471;2023-70029-41280;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""UKRI BBSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/W00691X/1;BBS/E/J/000PR9797;""},{""name"":""ERC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101019324;""},{""name"":""National Natural Science Foundation of China"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h0zpd94"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""32525008;U23A20198;""},{""name"":""Hatch"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FLA-CRC-005979;""},{""name"":""Emergency Citrus Disease Research and Extension"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Florida Citrus Initiative Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Citrus Research and Development Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

We present whole-genome sequencing with adaptive sampling (AS-WGS) protocol using Oxford Nanopore Technologies optimized for pediatric oncology, enabling unified detection of genomic, structural, and epigenomic alterations in a single assay. Applied to 31 pediatric cancer patient samples, AS-WGS achieved high on-target coverage across hundreds of loci of interest for identifying somatic anomalies, while maintaining pan-genomic coverage for copy number assessment and methylome data. We demonstrate that AS-WGS, as a single approach, captures all categories of clinically relevant alterations, including most copy number changes, fusions, and mutations, even subclonal ones. Time stamp analyses revealed that clonal alterations are confidently supported within the first sequencing day, sometimes within the first hours. We developed and reported an open-source bioinformatic pipeline (nf-core-oncoseq) that facilitates streamlined and fully integrated analysis.

However, the pathways through which the gut conveys adverse or unpleasant information to the brain are still not well understood. In this study, we identify an aversive gut-brain axis in Drosophila melanogaster that detects toxin-induced gut damage and triggers both innate and learned anticipatory emesis (vomiting). After toxin ingestion, reactive oxygen species are produced by midgut enterocytes and detected by the transient receptor potential channel TrpA1 on nearby enteroendocrine cells. This sensing stimulates the release of neuropeptides from enteroendocrine cells, likely representing the gastric malaise flies experience after eating. We show that these neuropeptides act on specific serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in the brain. These neurons interact with each other and signal to the downstream memory-related mushroom bodies to promote emesis. This circuit not only drives an immediate emetic response but also represents a malaise-driven aversive signal. The signal manifests as the persistent activity of dopaminergic neurons, which reinforces aversive valence to odor cues in the mushroom bodies. Thus, the flies learn that a specific odor predicts the presence of a toxin in food and exhibit anticipatory emesis upon re-exposure to the same odor. Taken together, we have identified an interoceptive signaling pathway that may be conserved for detecting harmful gut conditions and for remembering how to avoid them. Our work offers a mechanistic framework for studying aversive gut-brain communication involved in feeding, metabolism, depression, brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases.","[{""name"":""Science and Engineering Research Board (now ANRF)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRG/2019/005587;SB/S2/RJN-048/2017;""},{""name"":""Pratiksha Trust Extra-Mural Support for Transformational Aging Brain Research (EMSTAR)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMSTAR/2023/SL03;""},{""name"":""Department of Biotechnology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03tjsyq23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BT/PR51490/MED/ 22/361/2024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Chronic neuroinflammation and disruption of the gut-brain axis are implicated as shared pathological drivers, but the precise molecular mechanisms connecting these conditions remain elusive. We hypothesized that a common microRNA (miRNA)-mediated inflammatory profile underlies this clinical triad, representing a point of pathological convergence.

MethodsWe analyzed the expression of a panel of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated miRNAs, key inflammatory markers, and glial response in postmortem brain tissue (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus) from patients with PD, DD, and matched healthy controls. To investigate causality and gut-brain axis involvement, two mouse models were used: (i) PD-associated -synucleinopathy was induced in dorsal raphe serotonin (5-HT) neurons; and (ii) DD-like based on corticosterone (CORT)-induced stress. Mice were assessed for depressive-like behaviors and GI dysmotility, and their brain (medial prefrontal cortex and caudate-putamen) and ileum tissues were analyzed for the same molecular markers.

ResultsWe identified a conserved miRNA pattern in the brains of both PD and DD patients, characterized by the significant downregulation of miR-199a-5p and miR-219a-5p and the upregulation of miR-200a-3p. This dysregulation was strongly associated with a pro-inflammatory state, as evidenced by increased expression of TNF, IFN-{gamma}, and NF{kappa}B1, as well as changes in the glial response. Mice with -synucleinopathy in the 5-HT system exhibited a depression-like phenotype and reduced intestinal motility, accompanied by increased Iba1 and GFAP signal. Comparable effects were observed in mice subjected to CORT-induced stress. Notably, the same pattern of miRNAs and inflammatory cytokines observed in the human brain was replicated in the brain and ileum of DD-PD-like mice, providing direct evidence of a parallel pathological process spanning the gut-brain axis.

ConclusionThis study identifies a specific miRNA-inflammatory axis as a common molecular mechanism connecting the pathophysiology of PD, DD, and gut dysfunction. This pattern represents a critical point of convergence that drives a shared, bidirectional inflammatory cascade along the gut-brain axis. Targeting this miRNA triad could provide a new therapeutic approach for addressing the motor, psychiatric, and GI symptoms of these interconnected disorders simultaneously.","[{""name"":""MCIU/AEI/FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PID2022-141700OB-I00;""},{""name"":""Fundació La Marató TV3"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""202207;""},{""name"":""AGAUR, Generalitat de Catalunya, Barcelona, ES"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2021-SGR-01358;""},{""name"":""Basque Government"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00pz2fp31"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IT1512/22;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

We further demonstrate that the fat pad atrophy is associated with influx of a CCR2-independent, lipid metabolising, macrophage population. Macrophage depletion ameliorates fat pad atrophy, and lymph node expansion, downstream of inflamed sites. Our data therefore identify peripheral inflammation as an antigen-independent trigger of downstream fat pad and lymph node remodelling and contributes to the release of essential nutrients to drive the energetic requirements of the adaptive immune response.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""217093/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/V01972/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

A crucial step in the development of computational tools for the objective and quantitative analysis of tissue sections has been color deconvolution. Color deconvolution functions by separating the absorption of colors corresponding to stained molecular or tissue compartments. The most widely used color deconvolution method in digital pathology, linear color deconvolution as described in Ruifrok 2001 et al., decomposes color images according to the absorbance values for individual stains. However, linear color deconvolution assumes that stains are linearly decomposable, and it relies heavily upon identifying optimal color vectors of stains, which is often challenging. Furthermore, linear deconvolution methods cannot deconvolve the image with more than three stains, further limiting their broader applicability. To combat the limitations of previous methods, we developed an intuitive and robust color deconvolution method that effectively and accurately separates more than three stain signals, does not rely on predetermined color vectors, and doesnt rely on identifying optimal stain vectors. The proposed method, NLTD 2.0, presents a robust and efficient solution to tackle color variations in histopathology images, enhancing the reliability and precision of computational pathology. Additionally, incorporating the method as an ImageJ plugin amplifies accessibility and usability, enabling researchers and pathologists to leverage its capabilities without specialized programming skills. The intuitive interface streamlines the application, fostering broader acceptance within the computational pathology community.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3CA275681;UH3CA275681;U54CA268083;R01CA300052;""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM157099;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Because of their intracellular nature, the establishment of these interactions requires tight regulation by the host plants. In particular, three genes - SYMRK, CCaMK and CYCLOPS - form the core of an ancestral common symbiosis pathway (CSP) for intracellular symbioses, and are conserved since the most recent common ancestor of land plants (Radhakrishnan et al. 2020; Delaux et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2010; Parniske 2008). Here, we describe EPP1 as a fourth gene committed to the CSP. Among land plants, EPP1 is conserved only in species able to associate with at least one type of intracellular symbiont. We found that loss-of-function epp1 mutants or EPP1 knock-down lines in four clades of land plants - legumes, Solanaceae, monocots and bryophytes - are all impaired in their ability to associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We discovered that the plasma membrane-localized receptor-like SYMRK phosphorylates EPP1 on a conserved serine residue and that this phosphorylation is essential for symbiosis. Using a gain-of-function approach, we demonstrate that EPP1 is upstream of the nuclear kinase CCaMK.

Despite the growing popularity of the processing software cryoSPARC for single-particle analyses, RELION remains the dominant software platform for performing helical reconstruction of amyloid structures, highlighting an area for further development. Here, we present comprehensive processing guidelines for helical reconstruction of helical amyloids using cryoSPARC. Through systematic re-processing and validation of publicly deposited datasets, we demonstrate current capabilities and identify key limitations, emphasizing the need for amyloid-specific parameter optimization within cryoSPARC workflows. Our findings showcase a potential for developing unsupervised processing workflows to meet the demanding throughput requirements of time-resolved in vitro studies and largescale compound screening initiatives, thereby accelerating therapeutic drug development.

Mathematical modeling provides a powerful approach to bridge this gap by linking viral dynamics with immune interactions. In this work, we develop a mechanistic within-host model, formulated in a system of coupled ordinary and delayed differential equations, to investigate the contributions of NK cell activity, interferon signaling, and pro-inflammatory cytokines to viral clearance and disease outcome. Model parameters are estimated from experimental data, and computational simulations are used to explore how dysregulated NK responses and cytokine feedback loops may drive divergent clinical outcomes. Local sensitivity analysis identifies the most influential parameters shaping host-pathogen dynamics, highlighting potential control points for intervention. In addition, knockdown simulations are performed to mimic potential therapeutic interventions, allowing us to evaluate their advantages and limitations in silico. These findings provide mechanistic insights into COVID-19 immune dynamics and offer a foundation for guiding the design of future treatment strategies.

During the tumult of war they are, however, challenging to obtain due to the conflicts themselves. The Gaza Ministry of Health (GMoH) has provided regular updates to their post-October-7 violent death tally for the Gaza Strip. However, GMoH reports have attracted both criticism and support. Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. Our findings suggest that violent mortality has significantly exceeded official figures. Our central estimate for the extent of GMoH undercount closely matches a separate estimate made using capture-recapture methods. We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden. These results underscore the feasibility of mortality surveillance methodologies in some highly challenging war-affected settings and provide a crucial empirical foundation for assessing the true human cost of the war.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759961392403

A central unresolved question, however, is whether lipidomic signatures identified in accessible peripheral biofluids faithfully recapitulate the pathogenic alterations within the central nervous system (CNS). This gap impedes the development of reliable biomarkers and constrains a comprehensive understanding of PD pathophysiology. To address this challenge, we employed a cross-species lipidomic approach. We modeled PD in both male and female mice by injecting human -synuclein preformed fibrils into the substantia nigra. Three months post-injection, lipidomic profiles of the midbrain and plasma were generated and compared. These findings were further validated in plasma from male and female PD patients and age-matched controls, enabling the identification of conserved alterations.

We identified shared dysregulation of sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, and fatty acids in the brains and plasma of diseased mice as well as in plasma from PD patients. Notably, lipids associated with lipid droplet biogenesis, including triacylglycerols and monoacylglycerols, were elevated in diseased mouse brains and patient plasma. These alterations coincided with a marked accumulation of lipid droplets in the mouse midbrain, and were further corroborated by increased lipid droplet abundance in macrophages derived from PD patients. Interestingly, lipid droplet accumulation exhibited sex-specific patterns: male mice displayed greater microglial accumulation, whereas female mice showed enhanced neuronal deposition. Together, these findings demonstrate that peripheral lipidomic signatures reflect CNS pathology in PD, highlighting new opportunities for biomarker discovery and therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, sex-specific lipid droplet accumulation in innate immune cells and neurons implicates these pathways as mechanistic contributors to PD and underscores the necessity of sex-stratified strategies in biomarker discovery and disease modeling.","[{""name"":""Cure Parkinson's Trust"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PT01;""},{""name"":""Parkinson's Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mx85j86"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PF-IMP-1437213;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04reqzt68"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IA/E/17/1/503664;""},{""name"":""Science and Engineering Research Board"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03ffdsr55"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SRG/2021/000981;""},{""name"":""Indian Council of Medical Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0492wrx28"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5/4-5/3/43/Neuro/2022-NCD-1;5/4-5Adhoc/Neuro/217/2020-NCD-1;""},{""name"":""SwarnaJayanti Fellowship, SERB"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SB/SJF/2021-22/01;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

How proliferative growth of the fungus is regulated at the same time as programmed cell death, however, is unknown. In this study, we provide evidence that each cell of the conidium undergoes a separate developmental program, which is necessary for plant infection. Using quantitative live-cell imaging, we monitored trafficking of ten organelle types during appressorium morphogenesis in a wild-type M. oryzae strain and isogenic{triangleup} atg8 autophagic mutant. High-resolution microscopy using a photoactivatable green fluorescent protein revealed that organelle trafficking occurs from a single conidium cell into the appressorium, while the remaining two cells undergo autophagy. Organelle inheritance operates independently of cell cycle checkpoints but is always associated with spore germination. We furthermore defined the temporal sequence of organelle movement and de novo organelle biogenesis in the incipient appressorium using photoconvertible fluorescent localisation microscopy.

Despite recent progress in de novo design of protein binders, there are no current methods for designing binders that recognize phosphorylated proteins and peptides; this is a challenging problem as phosphate groups are highly charged, and phosphorylation often occurs within unstructured regions. Here we introduce RoseTTAFold Diffusion 2 for Molecular Interfaces (RFD2-MI), a deep generative framework for the design of binders for protein, ligand, and covalently modified protein targets. We demonstrate the power and versatility of this method by designing binders for four critical phosphotyrosine sites on three clinically relevant targets: Cluster of Differentiation 3 (CD3{varepsilon}), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Insulin Receptor (INSR). Experimental characterization shows that the designs bind their phospho-tyrosine containing targets with affinities comparable to native binding sites and have negligible binding to non-phosphorylated targets or phosphopeptides with different sequences. X-ray crystal structures of generated binders to CD3{varepsilon} and EGFR are very close to the design models, demonstrating the accuracy of the design approach. RFD2-MI provides a generalizable all-atom diffusion framework for probing and modulating phosphorylation-dependent signaling, and more generally, for developing research tools and targeted therapeutics against post-translationally modified proteins.","[{""name"":""NIH NCI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1K99CA293001;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Critically, simple vividness ratings can replace the protracted questionnaires commonly used for this purpose and reduce methodological issues with these instruments. We further find that vividness is closely linked with the experience of ""seeing"" mental images or projecting them into the external world. People who report seeing mental images with their eyes shut are also more likely to experience externally projected imagery.

Yet, the mechanisms by which lipid imbalances are sensed and corrected to establish and maintain homeostasis are, in most cases, unknown. Here we present an expanded view of plasma membrane (PM) phosphoinositide metabolism by revealing an unexpected metabolic connection between two key anionic lipids in this membrane, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and phosphatidic acid (PA). PM pools of PI4P are generated by PI 4-kinase Type III (PI4KIII/PI4KA), an essential enzyme whose partial dysfunction leads to numerous hereditary human diseases. We find that depletion of PI4P by pharmacological inhibition of PI4KA increases the activity of phospholipase Ds (PLDs) and the levels of their lipid product, PA, in the PM. Guided by RNA-seq analysis and proximity labeling proteomics, we elucidate how cells connect this PI4P decrease to a compensatory increase in PA levels. Loss of PM PI4P induces a concomitant decrease of phosphatidylserine (PS) levels, and this metabolic rewiring activates a reciprocal relationship between PS synthesis and PLD-mediated PA generation. These metabolic changes also lead to transcriptional and translational upregulation of the small GTPase RhoB, which enhances PLD-mediated PA synthesis and subsequent actin cytoskeletal remodeling. Our study reveals how disease-relevant perturbation of phosphoinositide synthesis induces an integrated response that ultimately boosts levels of PA, a key anionic lipid and metabolic intermediate in phosphoinositide resynthesis.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM151682;DP1GM142101;Intramural Research Program;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

While therapeutics have been developed to exploit these pH changes to modulate activity across different physiological environments, current approaches for generating pH-dependent binders, such as combinatorial histidine scanning and display-based selections, are largely empirical and often labor-intensive. Here we describe two complementary principles and associated computational methods for designing pH-dependent binders: (i) introducing histidine residues adjacent to positively charged residues at binder-target interfaces to induce electrostatic repulsion and weaken binding at low pH, and (ii) introducing buried histidine-containing charged hydrogen-bonding networks in the binder core such that the protein is destabilized under acidic conditions. Using these methods, we designed binders that dissociate at acidic pH against ephrin type-A receptor 2, tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, interleukin-6, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, and the interleukin-2 mimic Neo2. Fusions of the designs to pH-independent binders of lysosomal trafficking receptors function as catalytic degraders, inducing target degradation at substoichiometric levels. Our methods should be broadly useful for designing pH-sensitive protein therapeutics.","[{""name"":""Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04yhme281"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Audacious Project at the Institute for Protein Design"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Open Philanthropy Project Improving Protein Design Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Nordstrom Barrier Institute for Protein Design Directors Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institute on Aging"",""id"":""https://ror.org/049v75w11"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are central to cellular signalling and represent one of the largest classes of therapeutic targets, yet their functional modulation remains challenging. Here, we present RareFoldGPCR (RFG), a GPCR-specialised AI model for structure prediction and design that supports NCAAs. By applying transfer learning on high-resolution GPCR structures, RFG accurately models and rationally designs both linear and cyclic peptides that incorporate NCAAs and modulate GPCR activity. This is achieved without the model ever being trained on NCAA-based GPCR modulators. We showcase the capability of RFG by designing peptide agonists for the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) and validating their functional activity experimentally in cell-based assays. We investigate the precise capabilities of generating active agonists by expanding different regions of the native GLP-1 hormone, and further demonstrate the design of cyclic peptide agonists with entirely novel sequences and topologies, creating new agonist modes. We analyse how design metrics relate to pathway specificity, enabling precise modulation of pathway activity, such as activating the cAMP response without recruiting {beta}-arrestin to reduce receptor desensitisation. RFG shows how transfer learning on specific target classes enables generalisation to new chemistry and molecular topology, providing a broadly applicable strategy for designing functional ligands beyond the constraints of natural amino acid chemistry.

In this work, we present mBER, an open-source protein binder design system capable of designing antibody-format binders with state-of-the-art experimental success rates. mBER builds on the ColabDesign framework, achieving successful antibody design primarily through the inclusion of informative sequence and structure conditioning information.

We experimentally screened the two libraries against 145 of these targets, resulting in a dataset of over 100 million binding interactions. We achieved specific and significant design success against 45% of targets. In a filtered set of designs, we detect binding rates to specific epitopes as high as 38%. Through mBER, we demonstrate that format-specific binder design is possible with no additional training of underlying folding and language models.

Here, we present chromosome-level genomes for the two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus) and the southern anteater (Tamandua tetradactyla), and investigate how retrotransposon-mediated gene duplications (retrocopies) have shaped xenarthran genome evolution. Comparative analyses revealed that xenarthran genomes harbor the highest number of retrocopies reported among mammals, with lineage-specific insertion dynamics. Anteater and armadillo genomes contain older LINE1 repertoires and species-specific older retrocopy insertions. In contrast, sloths retain both an abundance of young LINE1s and thousands of young retrocopies, alongside a large shared set that originated from an evolutionary burst of retroduplication in the branch leading to their last common ancestor ([~]30 Mya). In C. didactylus, approximately 50% of retrocopies are expressed, compared with 24% in Dasypus novemcinctus. Evolutionary analyses identified 38 retrocopies with strong hallmarks of domestication in C. didactylus. Many of these retrocopies derive from parental genes involved in mitochondrial and metabolic processes, suggesting a genomic mechanism underlying the physiological specialisations of sloths.

Processes that govern species-specific aspects of human postnatal brain development are difficult to study in animal models. While human brain organoids offer a promising in vitro model, they have thus far been shown to largely mimic early stages of brain development. Here, we developed human brain organoids for an unprecedented 5 years in culture, optimizing growth conditions able to extend excitatory neuron viability beyond previously-known limits. Using module scores of maturation-associated genes derived from a time course of endogenous human brain maturation, we show that brain organoids transcriptionally age with cell type-specificity through these many years in culture. Whole-genome methylation profiling reveals that the predicted epigenomic age of organoids sampled between 3 months and 5 years correlates precisely with time spent in vitro, and parallels epigenomic aging in vivo. Notably, we show that in chimeric organoids generated by mixing neural progenitors derived from ""old"" organoids with progenitors from ""young"" organoids, old progenitors rapidly produce late neuronal fates, skipping the production of earlier neuronal progeny that are instead produced by their young counterparts in the same co-cultures. The data indicate that human brain organoids can mature and record the passage of time over many years in culture.

Studies of West African arthropod diversity can therefore help address important questions regarding conservation, ecosystem services, and insecticide use and other species-control interventions in agriculture and disease management. We intensively sampled arthropods in Ghana using complementary trapping methods, generated DNA barcodes, and classified sequences by Barcode Index Numbers (BINs, a species proxy). Using this dataset, we investigate assemblage composition, temporal activity patterns, and the state of regional biodiversity sampling.

ResultsSequencing DNA from 95,996 individuals captured using Malaise, yellow pan, pitfall, Heath and Centre for Disease Control (CDC) traps, we identified 10,120 unique BINs. The rate of species accumulation did not approach an asymptote for any taxonomic group or trap type, indicating high biodiversity. The different trap types sampled different subsets of the local community, with greatest similarity between yellow pan and pitfall traps. More insects and species (BINs) were trapped during the day than at night. Our dataset shared more BINs in the Barcode of Life Database with South Africa than with any other country, although this predominantly reflects the limited sampling and DNA sequencing campaigns in Africa.

ConclusionsThis study more than doubles the published BINs for West Africa, offering insights into the biodiversity of an ecologically important but understudied taxon and region. Using multiple trap types allowed a more complete assessment of the local arthropod assemblage. The public release of these data will support and stimulate further taxonomic and ecological work in the region.","[{""name"":""Open Philanthropy Project"",""id"":""https://ror.org/004d1k391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Characterization of STAU2 knockout iPSC derived cells using scRNA-seq shows that loss of STAU2 disrupts neuroepithelial cell identity and accelerates neural differentiation by altering the activity of key transcription factors and driving early metabolic transitions. Additionally, STAU2 regulates the expression of miRNA host genes and alters miRNA-mediated post- transcriptional control in progenitor cells, which exerts additional effects on STAU2 regulated gene regulatory networks. These changes result in neural progenitor exhaustion, unstructured neural rosettes, and reduced organoid size. Together, our work uncovers a previously unrecognized role for STAU2 as a central regulator of early human neurogenesis, acting through both miRNA-mediated and transcriptional pathways to coordinate progenitor maintenance and neuronal fate specification.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting  spacetime attractor excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219525/Z/19/Z;225926/Z/22/Z;219627/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GAT3955;GAT3755;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0040/2024-L;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 651-2023;""},{""name"":""Fondation Fyssen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors1-5, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

However, this knowledge is fragmented across resources and often is not directly accessible for analytical methods. We developed OmniPath (https://omnipathdb.org/), a database combining diverse molecular knowledge from 168 resources. It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

These events occur when cohesin loads near the midpoint between two loci and extrudes them through a defined spatial radius, producing encounter durations that exceed those of random collisions. We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors. Our findings support a time-gated model of distal enhancer-promoter communication in which only rare, long-lived and mostly extrusion-driven encounters are productive, offering a unifying framework for how chromosome dynamics control transcription in single cells.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_192642;TMCG-3_213782;320030-236070;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 1305-2024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Here, we investigate the metabolic impact of the accessory protein ORF7a. Lentiviral expression of ORF7a in human lung epithelial (A549) and monocytic (THP1) cells, coupled with integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, revealed profound dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. ORF7a impaired oxidative phosphorylation, reducing basal and maximal respiration, inducing mitochondrial depolarization, and increasing reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, ORF7a upregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), promoting pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex phosphorylation and suppressing pyruvate oxidation. However, pharmacological PDK4 inhibition did not restore respiration. High-resolution respirometry in frozen samples revealed impaired complex I function, while Blue Native-PAGE demonstrated defective respiratory supercomplex assembly. By linking enzymatic inhibition with structural destabilization, our study uncovers a functional vulnerability of the mitochondrial respiratory chain to viral manipulation. These findings establish ORF7a as a key modulator of host metabolic reprogramming and highlight mitochondrial pathways as potential therapeutic targets in COVID-19.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification1 to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) as well as from local ER- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions.

Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid.

Here, we identify mechanically activated ion channels PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 as key mechanotransducers required for labor progression. Genetic deletion of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in mice resulted in weakened uterine contractions and severe parturition defects. Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either the uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects, whereas combined loss significantly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing showed that loss of PIEZO reduced expression of connexin43 (Gja1), a gap junction protein in uterine smooth muscle cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to impaired contraction. These findings highlight the critical role of PIEZO channels in mechanotransduction during parturition and suggest therapeutic targets for labor dysfunction.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 NS105067;R01AT012051;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-2405-20;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CMMI-2135428;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2DK128800;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

While we have some understanding of how sensory information is processed in the sensory periphery, the classification of cues according to valence in central brain circuits is less well understood. Here, we addressed this question in the Drosophila larva, where we could leverage the synaptic resolution connectome to determine where innate and learnt information from distinct aversive and appetitive sensory modalities converges; and combine this with imaging and manipulation of neural activity to determine how valence information is encoded and used to guide navigation. We found that information from multiple innately aversive and attractive sensory modalities converges onto a common output neuron of the learning circuit, specifically the Mushroom Body output neuron, MBON-m1. We discovered that this neuron is required for navigating both attractive odor and aversive temperature cues and is activated by attractive cues, such as food odour and sugar, and inhibited by different aversive cues, such as cooling, salt, or non-food odors. Together, our study reveals a neuron that bi-directionally encodes valence and controls actions.","[{""name"":""MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology Core funding"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Janelia Research Campus"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013sk6x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""205038/Z/16/Z;205050/Z/16/Z;""},{""name"":""ERC grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ERC-2018-COG: 819650;""},{""name"":""DFG German Research Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EXC 2117-587 422037984;""},{""name"":""Fyssen Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""ATIP-Avenir Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392403

Yet these transitions also involve coordinated shifts in cell morphology and behaviour, which remain poorly characterized in densely packed epithelia. We developed a quantitative live-imaging and computational framework to track thousands of individual cells over time in the rapidly differentiating Xenopus mucociliary epithelium (MCE). From segmentations and trajectories, we extracted dynamic features-cell and nuclear shape, movement, position-to create a time-resolved morphodynamic dataset spanning the full course of differentiation. While single features showed high noise and low separability of ground-truth cell types, supervised machine learning revealed that integrating time-resolved features robustly predicts final cell fate. Gradient-boosted trees and multinomial logistic regression achieved moderate but consistent accuracy, especially for abundant epithelial lineages. Key discriminants included normalized Z-position, membrane-nucleus offset, and absolute experimental time, whereas movement contributed minimally to the results. Our results show that morphodynamic signatures encode predictive information about cell identity and provide a framework linking physical dynamics with molecular state.","[{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04txyc737"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF21CC0073729;NNF19SA0035442;NNF22OC0076414;NNF19OC0056962;""},{""name"":""European Research Council CoG"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101125803 MechanoFate;""},{""name"":""LEO Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02rgsr590"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LF-OC-19-000219;""},{""name"":""GENCI-IDRIS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""A0161013396;AD011013695;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392404

LP.8.1 was designated a Variant Under Monitoring by the WHO in January 2025 due to its potential to displace prior circulating variants. Informed by early growth modeling and antigenic analysis, we selected LP.8.1 as a candidate strain for the 2025-2026 vaccine season. Here, we describe the development of updated LP.8.1-matched mRNA vaccine compositions encoding either the full-length spike protein for mRNA-1273 (monovalent) or the membrane-anchored receptor-binding and N-terminal domains for the mRNA-1283 vaccine. Initial in vitro characterization, including structural analysis, demonstrated robust antigen expression and intact antigenic features. Immunogenicity of both vaccines were evaluated in murine models following immunization as either a primary series in naive animals or as a booster dose. LP.8.1-matched vaccines elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses against the homologous LP.8.1 strain and more recently emerging JN.1-lineage subvariants, including XFG and NB.1.8.1. Notably, the mRNA-1283 vaccine expressing LP.8.1 induced higher mean neutralization titers than the mRNA-1273 version across multiple variants. These data demonstrate the immunogenicity and breadth of both LP.8.1-based mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1283 vaccines in the context of ongoing JN.1 lineage evolution and support the selection of LP.8.1 as the updated vaccine antigen for the 2025-2026 season.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759961392404
