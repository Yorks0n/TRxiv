The aim of the reCOVer trial was to investigate safety, tolerability and clinical effects of BC007 on fatigue, its severity and quality of life in PCS patients. Methods: reCOVer is a prospective, exploratory, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover phase IIa clinical trial with 1350 mg BC007 at the University of Erlangen-Nuernberg, Germany. Eligible participants were 18-80 years with GPCR-fAAb, whose PCS symptoms persisted [&ge;]3 months after PCR-confirmed COVID-19, with fatigue as the major symptom (Bell score [&le;]60) and at least three of eight defined PCS symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) according to a crossover design to either receive BC007 (sequence A) or placebo (sequence B) at day 0 and day 48 with a follow-up of 28 days, respectively. A crossover design was chosen to increase patient adherence. Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in comparison between sequence A and B from d0 to d28 and d0 to d70 were the primary and co-primary endpoint, respectively. Findings: Between 31.10.2023 and 12.06.2024, 30 PCS patients were randomised and analysed. The trial has been concluded. Summarizing all AE rates, no statistically significant differences between sequence A und sequence B were observed within day 28 and day 70. One report of a serious adverse event, not related to treatment, was recorded. As a secondary endpoint, BC007 showed a significant improvement on self-reported fatigue and its severity, as well as quality of life. Interpretation: As BC007 was well tolerated and showed a significant improvement of fatigue and quality of life, it might offer a therapeutic option for an autoimmune subgroup of PCS patients.

We conducted a retrospective data-linkage study including all Dutch inhabitants to investigate the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on excess mortality using a modified self-controlled case series method. We found a 44% lower relative incidence of all-cause deaths in the first three weeks after the primary vaccination compared to more than three weeks after vaccination (IRR 0.56, 95%CI 0.54-0.57). This lower incidence was consistent across vaccine types, doses, genders, age groups, and individuals with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or comorbidities, and for non-COVID-19 related deaths. For booster vaccinations, the relative incidence was similar (IRR 0.49, 95%CI 0.49-0.50).

Although these methods are conceptually similar, we show by analyzing association studies of 209 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank that they systematically prioritize different genes. This raises the question of how genes should ideally be prioritized. We propose two prioritization criteria: 1) trait importance -- how much a gene quantitatively affects a trait; and 2) trait specificity -- a gene's importance for the trait under study relative to its importance across all traits. We find that GWAS prioritize genes near trait-specific variants, while burden tests prioritize trait-specific genes. Because non-coding variants can be context specific, GWAS can prioritize highly pleiotropic genes, while burden tests generally cannot. Both study designs are also affected by distinct trait-irrelevant factors, complicating their interpretation. Our results illustrate that burden tests and GWAS reveal different aspects of trait biology and suggest ways to improve their interpretation and usage.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923926

The predictive role of gut microbiome composition during acute infection in the development of LC is not well understood, partly due to the heterogeneous nature of disease. We conducted a longitudinal study of 799 outpatients tested for SARS-CoV-2 (380 positive, 419 negative) and found that individuals who later developed LC harbored distinct gut microbiome compositions during acute infection, compared with both SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals who did not develop LC and negative controls with similar symptomatology. However, the temporal changes in gut microbiome composition between the infectious (0-1 month) and post-infectious (1-2 months) phases was not different between study groups. Using machine learning, we showed that microbiome composition alone more accurately predicted LC than clinical variables. Including clinical data only marginally enhanced this prediction, suggesting that microbiome profiles during acute infection may reflect underlying health status and immune responses thus, help predicting individuals at risk for LC. Finally, we identified four LC symptom clusters, with gastrointestinal and fatigue-only groups most strongly linked to gut microbiome alterations.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

The structural models deposited have provided insights into protein folds, relationships to evolution, energy functions of structures, and most recently, protein structure prediction, connecting sequence to structure. However, the X-ray crystallography (and cryo-EM) models deposited in the PDB are determined by a combination of refinement algorithms and manual modeling. The intervention of human modeling leads to the possibility that within a single structure, there can be differences in how well parts of a structure are modeled and/or fit the underlying experimental data. We identified that small molecule binding sites are more carefully modeled and better match the underlying experimental data than the rest of the protein structural model. This trend persisted regardless of the resolution or Rfree values of the structure. The variation of modeling has implications for how we interpret protein structural models and use structural models as truth in mechanisms, structural bioinformatics, simulations, docking, and structure prediction, especially when comparing binding sites to the rest of the protein.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1734386923927

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1734386923927

Recent studies using AIM assays identified prominent Th17-like (CCR6+) CD4+ T cells and circulating follicular T helper cells (cTfh) in anti-viral contexts, but were not observed with peptide/HLA tetramer staining. We demonstrate that CD39+ Treg-like and CD26hi Th22-like cells can be activated by cytokines in a TCR-independent manner during in vitro Ag stimulation, leading to non-specific upregulation of prototypical AIM readouts. Transcriptional analysis of memory CD4+ T cells that underwent TCR-dependent or -independent activation enabled discrimination of bona fide Ag-specific T cells from cytokine-activated Treg and Th22 cells. CXCR4 downregulation emerged as a hallmark of clonotypic expansion and TCR-dependent activation in memory CD4+ T cells and cTfh. Tracking tetramer-binding cells during re-stimulation showed that CXCR4-CD137+ cells provide a more accurate measure of the Ag-specific population than standard AIM readouts. This modified assay excludes the predominately CCR6+ cytokine-activated T cells that contribute to an average 12-fold overestimation of the Ag-specific population. As AIM assays enable the rapid study of T cell responses against emerging pathogens, our findings provide a highly accurate approach to characterize genuine Ag-specific T cell responses that contribute to protective immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

While this is a respiratory virus, one feature of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was recognized to cause pathogenesis of other organs. Because the membrane fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, binds to its major host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that regulates a critical mediator of cardiovascular diseases, angiotensin II, COVID-19 is largely associated with vascular pathologies. In fact, we have previous reported that postmortem lung tissues collected from patients who died of COVID-19 exhibited thickened pulmonary vascular walls and reduced vascular lumen. The present study extended these findings by further characterizing the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients using larger sample sizes and providing mechanistic information through histological observations. The examination of 56 autopsy lung samples showed thickened vascular walls of small pulmonary arteries after 14 days of disease compared to H1N1 influenza patients who died before COVID- 19 pandemic started. Pulmonary vascular remodeling in COVID-19 patients was associated with hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer, perivascular fibrosis, edema and lymphostasis, inflammatory infiltration, perivascular hemosiderosis and neoangiogenesis. We found a correlation between the duration of hospital stay and the thickness of the muscular layer of pulmonary arterial walls. These results further confirm that COVID-19 affects the pulmonary vasculature and warrants an evaluation of patients that survived COVID-19 for possible future development of pulmonary arterial hypertension.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

Here, we developed a preclinical LUAD mouse model and demonstrated that targeted oncogenic KRAS degradation induces rapid tumor regression. Transcriptional, histological, and immunophenotypic analyses revealed a substantial remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Notably, disease relapse observed during long-term degrader treatment stems from proteolysis machinery dysregulation, indicating resistance mechanisms distinct from those reported upon KRAS inhibition.

Scotland records up to 6 different diagnostic codes for one inpatient episode, compared with up to 20 in England, and 14 in Wales. We assessed the impact of the variations in diagnostic coding among countries on observed disease incidence rates. Methods: We examined the number of diagnoses coded by each country, and then compared the incidence of three diseases between countries: Parkinson's disease (PD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and dementia. We constructed Cox models for each disease, adjusting for ""country"". Results: England appears to have the highest risk (hazard ratio, HR) for all three diseases, while Scotland appears to have the lowest risk: HR [95% CI] = 0.62 [0.54, 0.72] for PD, 0.49 [0.45, 0.54] for T2D, and 0.88 [0.78, 0.99] for dementia.

Here, we tested the association of thromboembolism-related genetic variants with long COVID in the Long COVID Host Genetics Initiative (ncases=3,018; ncontrols=994,582). Primary analyses revealed that each unit increase in the log-odds of genetically predicted venous thromboembolism risk was associated with 1.21-fold odds of long COVID (95%CI: 1.08-1.35; P=1.2x10-3). This association was independent of acute COVID-19 severity, robust across genetic instruments and methods, and replicated in external datasets for both venous thromboembolism and long COVID.

Although molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used to investigate these transitions, all-atom (AA) methods are often limited by short timescales and high computational costs, and coarse-grained (CG) implicitsolvent G[o]-like models are usually incapable of studying the interactions between proteins and their environments. Here, we present an approach called Multiple-basin G[o]-Martini, which combines the recent G[o]-Martini model with an exponential mixing scheme to facilitate the simulation of spontaneous protein conformational transitions in explicit environments. We demonstrate the versatility of our method through five diverse case studies: GlnBP, Arc, Hinge, SemiSWEET, and TRAAK, representing ligand-binding proteins, fold-switching proteins, de novo designed proteins, transporters, and mechanosensitive ion channels, respectively. The Multiple-basin G[o]-Martini offers a new computational tool for investigating protein conformational transitions, identifying key intermediate states, and elucidating essential interactions between proteins and their environments, particularly protein-membrane interactions. In addition, this approach can efficiently generate thermodynamically meaningful datasets of protein conformational space, which may enhance deep learning-based models for predicting protein conformation distributions.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

A common mechanism is copy number changes, which can affect single genes, larger genomic regions, or even entire chromosomes in the case of eukaryotes (aneuploidy). Bacterial species with genomes comprising more than one chromosome are common, yet the role of adaptive copy number changes affecting entire chromosomes is unknown. Here, by using a bacterium with two chromosomes (chrI and chrII) as model system and combining evolution experiments in the presence of severe nutrient stress with whole-genome sequencing, we show that chromosomal copy number changes can drive rapid adaptation. We detected increased copy number of the entire chrII in almost half of the sequenced clones, isolated from twelve independent populations. In most cases, copy number increases were driven by mutations in the replication protein of chrII. A higher chrII copy number is likely to be beneficial because chrII codes for the operon responsible for metabolizing D-gluconic acid, the only carbon source present in the medium. Our results revealed a novel mechanism for rapid adaptation in bacteria. Given the prevalence of bacteria with secondary chromosomes, and the enrichment of secondary chromosomes in genes associated with interaction with the environment, this may be an important mechanism for adapting to novel environments that has been overlooked.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

This has led to a focus on using only gene families with a single gene-copy per species, as these families are likely to be composed of orthologs. However, recent work has demonstrated that phylogenetic inference using paralogs is accurate and allows researchers to take advantage of more data. Here, we investigate a case in which using larger gene families actually increases accuracy compared to using single-copy genes alone. Long-branch attraction is a phenomenon in which taxa with long branches may be incorrectly inferred as sister taxa due to homoplasy. The most common solution to long-branch attraction is to increase taxon sampling to break up long branches. Sampling additional taxa is not always feasible, perhaps due to extinction or access to high-quality DNA. We propose the use of larger gene families with additional gene copies to break up long branches. Using simulations, we demonstrate that using larger gene families mitigates the impacts of long-branch attraction across large regions of parameter space. We also analyze data from Chelicerates, with a focus on assessing support for a sister relationship between scorpions and pseudoscorpions. Previous work has suggested that the failure to recover this relationship is due to long-branch attraction between pseudoscorpions and other lineages. Using data from larger gene families increases support for a clade uniting scorpions and pseudoscorpions, further highlighting the potential utility of these gene families in phylogenetic inference.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

In the present paper we test whether population differences in genetic nurture, assortative mating, or population stratification contribute to the fact that polygenic indices constructed based on GWAS results from European-descent samples predict more poorly in admixed populations with Native American and African ancestry. We do this by comparing the rates of decline in prediction accuracy of classical-GWAS-based PGIs versus within-family-based PGIs, each estimated in a population of European descent, as they are deployed in two samples of Latino Americans and African Americans. Within-family GWAS putatively eliminates the effects of parental genetic nurture, assortative mating, and population stratification; thus, we can determine whether without those confounding factors in the PGI construction, the relative prediction accuracy in the out-groups is ameliorated. Results show that relative prediction accuracy is not improved, suggesting that the differences across groups can be almost entirely explained by variation in genetic architecture (i.e. allele frequencies and short-range LD) rather than the aforementioned factors. Additional analysis of the impact of genetic architecture on the decline in prediction accuracy supports this conclusion. Future researchers should test within-family analysis at the prediction rather than the discovery stage.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

The internal gene cassette of Genotype 2 became increasingly dominant, not only in the H1pdm09N1av population, but also in other Danish enzootic swIAV subtypes. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes from H1pdm09N1av viruses revealed a monophyletic source, a higher substitution rate compared to other H1N1pdm09 viruses and genetic differences with human seasonal and other swine adapted H1N1pdm09 viruses.

The rapid spread of H1pdm09N1av viruses in Danish swine herds is concerning for swine and human health.

Even well-annotated proteins are often poorly characterized in diverse biological contexts, disease states, and perturbations. We present ProCyon, a foundation model for modeling, generating, and predicting protein phenotypes across five interrelated knowledge domains: molecular functions, therapeutic mechanisms, disease associations, functional protein domains, and molecular interactions. To support this, we created ProCyon-Instruct, a dataset of 33 million protein phenotype instructions, representing a comprehensive resource for multiscale protein phenotypes. By co-training a large language model with multimodal molecular encoders, ProCyon integrates phenotypic and protein data. A novel architecture and instruction tuning strategy allow ProCyon to process arbitrarily interleaved protein-and-phenotype inputs, achieve zero-shot task transfer, and generate free-form text phenotypes interleaved with retrieved protein sequence, structure, and drug modalities in a single unified model. ProCyon achieves strong performance against single-modality models, multimodal models such as ESM3, as well as text-only LLMs on dozens of benchmarking tasks such as contextual protein retrieval and question answering. We extensively evaluate ProCyon for biological applications, including identifying protein domains that bind small molecule drugs, predicting peptide binding with enzymes, and assessing the functional impact of Alzheimer's disease mutations. ProCyon enables conditional retrieval of proteins linked to small molecules through complementary mechanisms of action. It generates candidate phenotypes for under-characterized proteins recently implicated in Parkinson's disease, facilitating hypothesis generation for poorly understood proteins and biological processes.

It has been assumed that each cortical area is composed of repeatable neuronal subtypes, and variations in synaptic strength and connectivity patterns underlie functional specialization. Here we test the hypothesis that diversity in the intrinsic make-up of single neurons contributes to area specialization along the visual pathways. We measured morphological and electrophysiological properties of single neurons in areas V1 and LPFC of marmosets. Excitatory neurons in LPFC were larger, less excitable, and fired broader spikes than V1 neurons. Some inhibitory fast spiking interneurons in the LPFC had longer axons and fired spikes with longer latencies and a more depolarized action potential trough than in V1. Intrinsic bursting was found in subpopulations of both excitatory and inhibitory LPFC but not V1 neurons. The latter may favour temporal summation of spikes and therefore enhanced synaptic plasticity in LPFC relative to V1.

Nitrogen fixation is regulated by microbial communities, which can be free-living in the soil and leaf litter (asymbiotic) or in symbioses with plants. [bullet] To investigate how warming affects asymbiotic and symbiotic components of the N cycle, we analyzed soil and leaf litter samples as well as annual seedling census data from an experimental warming field site in Puerto Rico. [bullet] 16S and nifH sequencing revealed that warming significantly altered bacterial composition. Asymbiotic N fixation rates were 55% greater in soil (0.004 nmol N2/g/hr) and 525% greater (0.217 nmol N2/g/hr) in leaf litter from warmed compared to ambient plots. This increase in fixation was associated with changes in the N-fixing bacterial community. Under warming, N fixers experienced a 4.4-fold increase in growth rate compared to non-fixers, yet competition with neighboring N fixers eventually reduced N fixer growth. Seedling growth, especially of N fixers, initially increased following hurricane disturbances before declining. [bullet] Together, our findings suggest that warming increases the flux of N from the atmosphere into this tropical forest, driving changes in both microbial and tree dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

To explore an alternative evolutionary scenario where plants sense hypoxia as animals do, we engineered a three-components system aimed to target proteins for degradation in an oxygen dependent manner in Arabidopsis thaliana. Applying the synthetic biology framework, we produced a hypoxia-responsive switch independent of endogenous pathways. When applied to control transcription, the synthetic system partially restored hypoxia responsiveness in oxygen-insensitive mutants.

However, whether intrinsic alterations in microglial function impact the pathogenesis of this disease remains unclear.

We conducted transcriptomic and functional analyses of microglia-like cells (iMGLs) differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with MS (pwMS) to answer this question.

We generated iPSCs from six pwMS showing increased microglial activity via translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging. We demonstrated that the differentiated iMGL transcriptional profile resembled the microglial signature found in MS lesions. Importantly, compared with healthy controls, MS iMGLs presented cell-autonomous differences in their regulation of inflammation, both in the basal state and following inflammatory lipopolysaccharide challenge. Through transcriptomic profiling, we showed that MS iMGLs display increased expression of genes known to be upregulated in MS microglia. Furthermore, upregulated genes in MS iMGLs were associated with immune receptor activation, antigen presentation, and the complement system, with known MS implications. Finally, functional analyses indicated that the transcriptional changes in MS iMGLs corresponded with alterations in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increased phagocytosis.

Together, our results provide evidence of putative cell-autonomous microglial activation in pwMS and identify transcriptomic and functional changes that recapitulate the phenotypes observed in vivo in microglia from pwMS. These findings indicate that MS disease-specific iPSCs are valuable tools for studying disease-specific microglial activation in vitro and highlight microglia as potential therapeutic targets in MS.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk. Methods: The study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19). Results: The study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

Nsp14 also modulates host functions. This includes the activation of NF-{kappa}B and downregulation of interferon alpha/beta receptor 1 (IFNAR1). Here we demonstrate that Nsp14 exerts broader effects, activating not only NF-{kappa}B responses but also ERK, p38 and JNK MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling, promoting cytokine production. Further, Nsp14 downregulates not only IFNAR1 but also IFN-{gamma} receptor 1 (IFNGR1), impairing cellular responses to both IFN and IFN{gamma}. IFNAR1 and IFNGR1 downregulation is via a lysosomal pathway and also occurs in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Analysis of a panel of Nsp14 mutants reveals a consistent pattern. Mutants that disable ExoN function remain active, whereas N7-MTase mutations impair both pro-inflammatory pathway activation and IFN receptor downregulation. Innate immune modulating functions also require the presence of both the ExoN and N7-MTase domains likely reflecting the need for the ExoN domain for N7-MTase activity. We further identify multi-functional host protein Tollip as an Nsp14 interactor. Interaction requires the phosphoinositide-binding C2 domain of Tollip and sequences C-terminal to the C2 domain. Full length Tollip or regions encompassing the Nsp14 interaction domain are sufficient to counteract both Nsp14-mediated and Nsp14-independent activation of NF-{kappa}B. Knockdown of Tollip partially reverses IFNAR1 and IFNGR1 downregulation in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, suggesting relevance of Nsp14-Tollip interaction for Nsp14 innate immune evasion functions.

SignificanceSARS-CoV-2 protein Nsp14 both activates NF-{kappa}B, which promotes virus replication and inflammation, and downregulates IFNAR1, which can render infected cells resistant to the antiviral effects of IFN-/{beta}. Our study demonstrates that Nsp14 also activates MAPK signaling and downregulates IFNGR1, causing broader impacts than previously recognized. Data from a panel of Nsp14 mutants suggests a common underlying effect of Nsp14 may be responsible for its multiple innate immune activities. We further describe a novel interaction between Nsp14 and Tollip, a selective autophagy receptor. We show that Tollip expression downregulates Nsp14 activation of NF-{kappa}B and that Tollip knockdown reverses IFNAR1 and IFNGR1 downregulation in SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that Tollip functions as a regulator of Nsp14 innate immune modulation.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

Here, using Chemically Induced Chromosomal Interaction (CICI) method, we create stable intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions in G1-phase budding yeast across a broad range of contact frequencies. Hi-C analysis of these engineered cell populations demonstrates that static intra-chromosomal loops do not generate Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) and only promote 3D proximity within [~]50kb flanking regions. At moderate sequencing depth, Hi-C is sensitive enough to detect interactions occurring in 5-10% of cells. It also shows no inherent bias toward intra-versus inter-chromosomal interactions. Furthermore, we observe a linear relationship between Hi-C signal intensity and contact frequency. These findings illuminate the intrinsic properties of the Hi-C assay and provide a robust framework for its calibration.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

Here we conducted data synthesis to better understand the extinction factors of the iconic Jambato Harlequin frog, Atelopus ignescens, which was widespread in the Ecuadorian Andes before 1985 but vanished in 1988. The mechanism of extinction remains elusive, as it was uncertain whether Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) fungus infection, climate change, or the interaction of the two factors primarily contributed to the rapid population decline. Here we synthesize historical data from natural history museums, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and mitochondrial DNA sequences to uncover the factors that have potentially contributed to the extinction of the Jambato Harlequin frog. We found excessive rare alleles reflected in the negative Tajimas D estimated from the mitochondrial DNA samples collected in 1984, which indicates a selective sweep or bottleneck in the population shortly before the historical extinction. There was a marginal effect of the time before versus during Bd epizootics on the body sizes of the adult males, which was relatively weaker than the sex effect and geographic effect. The body size of adult males, but not the females form a geographic cline where the individuals in the northeast were larger than the males in the southwest. Species distribution modeling based on temperature and precipitation accurately predicted the occupancy of A. ignescens in 1960-69 (R2 = 0.72, accuracy = 0.9). This model further predicted the rapid decline in species distribution over decades of climate change between 1970-2020, which could have contributed to the rapid population decline in the 1980s. Collectively, our data synthesis revealed a strong climate effect and a weak epizootics effect on A. ignescens extinction, which unravels the mysterious rapid population decline and informs ongoing conservation efforts. This investigation inspires future museum genomic studies to dissect the potential climatic maladaptation behind one of the most dramatic extinction events in modern history.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

More recently, high rates of inflation, the resulting  cost-of-living crisis and reforms to alcohol taxation have affected the affordability of alcohol, but little is understood about how these changes have impacted on alcohol sales and consumption. We aimed gain insights into recent trends in alcohol sales by assessing changes in alcohol duty revenue collected by the UK government since 2020.

Design and SettingWe used published data on UK alcohol duty revenue to model trends from 2010-2019. We forecasted these trends through to October 2024 using a novel statistical approach and compared these forecasts to observed receipts.

MeasurementsMonthly inflation-adjusted alcohol duty receipts received by the UK Treasury in pounds sterling for beer, cider, spirits and wine.

FindingsDuring the pandemic, alcohol duty receipts fell during lockdowns and rose as restrictions were subsequently lifted. Since 2022 alcohol duty receipts have been consistently below the historical trend, with a gradually increasing deficit in wine receipts and comparable deficit in spirits receipts that began sharply in late 2022. The reforms to the alcohol duty system in August 2023 do not appear to have significantly affected these trends.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest that the  cost of living crisis in 2022/23 has led to a fall in alcohol sales relative to the pre-pandemic trend. The magnitude of this fall differs by beverage type, indicating that wine and spirits drinkers may have changed their behaviour more than beer and cider drinkers.","NA","medrxiv",1734386923927

Clinical studies suggest that alterations in serotonin signalling such as genetic polymorphisms3-5 or antidepressant exposure during pregnancy6,7 are risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders. However, an understanding of how dysfunctional neuromodulation alters systems level activity over neocortical development is lacking. Here, we use a longitudinal imaging approach to investigate how genetics, pharmacology, and aversive experience disrupt state-dependent serotonin signalling with pathological consequences for sensory processing. We find that all three factors lead to increased neocortical serotonin levels during the initial postnatal period. Genetic deletion of the serotonin transporter or antidepressant dosing results in a switch from hypo- to hyper-cortical activity that arises as a consequence of altered cortical GABAergic microcircuitry. However, the trajectories of these manipulations differ with postnatal exposure to antidepressants having effects on adult sensory encoding. The latter is not seen in the genetic model despite a similar early phenotype, and a distinct influence of maternal genotype on the development of supragranular layers. These results reveal the dynamics and critical nature of serotonin signalling during perinatal life; pharmacological targeting of which can have profound life-long consequences for cognitive development of the offspring.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

The Malagasy radiation is more diverse in both skull and foot shape. However, rather than following the classic ""early burst"" of diversification, trait evolution accelerated well after their arrival in Madagascar, likely driven by the evolution of new modes of foraging and especially of a few species with highly divergent morphologies. Each anatomical region showed differing evolutionary patterns, and the presence of morphological outliers impacted the results of some analyses, particularly of integration and modularity. Our results demonstrate that the adaptive radiation of Malagasy vangas has evolved exceptional ecomorphological diversity along multiple, independent trait axes, mainly driven by a late expansion in niche space due to key innovations.

Here, we introduce scSurv, combining a Cox proportional hazards model with a deep generative model of single-cell transcriptome, to estimate individual cellular contributions to clinical outcomes. The accuracy of scSurv was validated using both simulated and real datasets. This method identifies cells associated with favorable or adverse prognoses and extracts genes correlated with their contribution levels. In melanoma, scSurv reproduces known prognostic macrophage classifications and facilitates hazard mapping through spatial transcriptomics in renal cell carcinoma. We also identified genes consistently associated with prognosis across multiple cancers and demonstrated the applicability of this method to infectious diseases. scSurv is a novel framework for quantifying the heterogeneity of individual cellular effects on clinical outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

These repetitions constitute statistical regularities, which the brain captures in an internal model through learning. A signature of such learning in primate visual areas V1 and V4 is the gradual strengthening of gamma synchronization. We used a V1-V4 Dynamic Causal Model (DCM) to explain visually induced responses in early and late epochs from a sequence of several hundred grating presentations. The DCM reproduced the empirical increase in local and inter-areal gamma synchronization, revealing specific intrinsic connectivity effects that could explain the phenomenon. In a sensitivity analysis, the isolated modulation of several connection strengths induced increased gamma. Comparison of alternative models showed that empirical gamma increases are better explained by (1) repetition effects in both V1 and V4 intrinsic connectivity (alone or together with extrinsic) than in extrinsic connectivity alone, and (2) repetition effects on V1 and V4 population input rather than output gain. The best input gain model included effects in V1 granular and superficial excitatory populations and in V4 granular and deep excitatory populations. Our findings are consistent with gamma reflecting bottom-up signal precision, which increases with repetition and, therefore, with predictability and learning.

Deviations in amplitude and timing of APAs exist in Parkinson's disease (PD), causing dysfunctional postural control which increases the risk of falls. The motor cortex and basal ganglia have been implicated in the regulation of postural control, however, their dynamics during gait initiation, relationship to APA metrics, and response to pharmacotherapy such as levodopa are unknown. To address these questions, we streamed electrocorticography (ECoG) potentials from the premotor and primary motor cortices, as well as local field potentials (LFPs) from the globus pallidus in five people with PD exhibiting gait and balance dysfunction during a cued gait initiation task. Amplitude and timing of APA were evaluated with force plates and synchronized to the neural data. Subjects performed gait initiation trials under ON and LOW levodopa conditions to assess effects of medication on APA metrics and underlying neural dynamics. All subjects demonstrated pallidal and cortical oscillatory changes during different phases of gait initiation. Grouped analysis revealed that from quiet standing to the first foot step, pallidal beta power showed stepwise decrease and broadband gamma power increases, whereas cortical potentials showed low frequency (theta, alpha, beta) power decrease during gait initiation, regardless of medication state. The pallidum and motor cortices also became increasingly coherent during gait initiation compared to quiet standing prior to APA onset. Using linear mixed models, we found that while pallidal gamma powers are predictive of APA scaling, pallidal-cortical coherence (theta, alpha, beta) and premotor-M1 gamma coherence are predictive of APA timing. Our study is the first detailed characterization of basal-ganglia cortical circuit dynamics during human gait initiation. We identified significant pallidal motor cortical power and coherence changes that underlie the amplitude and timing of APA which appear to be independent of medication states of the study subjects. Our results provide evidence for a model where synchronized premotor and motor cortical activities transiently couple with the globus pallidus to regulate the timing of postural responses, and local pallidal activity regulate the amplitude of postural changes during gait initiation. It suggests that abnormal pallidal outflow and synchronization between the pallidum and motor cortices may be a pathophysiological mechanism underlying disordered postural response in Parkinson's disease.","NA","medrxiv",1734386923927

Here, to explore the limits of structural and antigenic variation in HNVs, we construct an expanded, antigenically diverse panel of HNV fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins from 56 unique HNV strains that better reflects global HNV diversity. We expressed and purified the F ectodomains and the G head domains, characterized their biochemical, biophysical and structural properties. We performed immunization experiments in mice leading to the elicitation of antibodies reactive to multiple HNV F proteins. Cryo-EM structures of diverse F proteins elucidate molecular determinants of differential pre-fusion state metastability and higher order contacts. A crystal structure of the Gamak virus G head domain revealed an additional domain added to the conserved 6-bladed, {beta}-propeller fold.

While its ecological interactions and control strategies are well-studied, its associated viral diversity remains unexplored. Here, we employ high-throughput sequencing data mining to comprehensively characterize the L. botrana virome, revealing novel and diverse RNA viruses. We characterized four new viral members belonging to distinct families, with evolutionary cues of cypoviruses (Reoviridae), sobemo-like viruses (Solemoviridae), phasmaviruses (Phasmaviridae), and carmotetraviruses (Carmotetraviridae). Phylogenetic analysis of the cypoviruses places them within the genus in affinity with other moth viruses, suggesting a potential ecological roles and host range within Lepidoptera. The bi-segmented and highly divergent sobemo-like virus showed a distinctive evolutionary trajectory of its encoding proteins at the periphery of recently reported invertebrate Sobelivirales. Notably, the presence of a novel phasmavirus, typically associated with mosquitoes, expands the known host range and diversity of this family to moths. Furthermore, the identification of a carmotetravirus branching in the same cluster of providence virus, a lepidopteran virus which replicates in plants, raises questions regarding the biological significance of this moth virus and grapevine. We further explored viral sequences in several publicly available transcriptomic datasets of the moth, indicating potential prevalence across distinct conditions. These results underscore the existence of a complex virome within L. botrana and lays the foundation for future studies investigating the ecological roles, evolutionary dynamics, and potential biocontrol applications of these viruses on the L. botrana--vineyard ecosystem.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

To what extent is lumen acidification sensed by cytosolic-side molecules that drive endosome maturation? We show here that ""inside-out"" proton signaling through the endosomal Na+/H+ Exchanger 6 (NHE6) activates the late endosome master regulator Rab7. The mechanism involves potent inactivation of the Rab7 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) TBC1D5 with decreasing pH. NHE6 interacts with TBC1D5 in a complex with Rab7. Neurons from NHE6-null mice or mice engineered with a selective defect in NHE6 proton efflux exhibit blocked endosome maturation and decreased active Rab7, consistent with an overactive Rab7 GAP. Finally, epistatic knock-down of TBC1D5, thereby reducing Rab7 GAP activity, in NHE6-null neurons rescues Rab7 GTPase cycling and endosome maturation. Importantly, NHE6 is mutated in Christianson Syndrome underscoring the significance of these mechanisms to neurodegeneration. We conclude that lumen acidification regulates pH-dependent Rab GTPase cycling to coordinate late endosome maturation by a process involving proton signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

Here, we searched the genomes of two additional ctenophore species, Beroe ovata and Hormiphora californensis, for voltage-gated K+ channels and functionally expressed a subset of M. leidyi channels. We found that the last common ancestor of these three disparate ctenophore lineages probably had at least 33 voltage-gated K+ channels. Two of these genes belong to the EAG family, and the remaining 31 belong to the Shaker family and form a single clade within the animal/choanoflagellate Shaker phylogeny. We additionally found evidence for 10 of these Shaker channels in a transcriptome of the early branching ctenophore lineage Euplokamis dunlapae, suggesting that the diversification of these channels was already underway early in ctenophore evolution. We functionally expressed 16 Mnemiopsis Shakers and found that they encode a functionally diverse array of voltage-gated K+ conductances with functional orthologs for many classic Shaker family subtypes found in cnidarians and bilaterians. Ctenophores therefore appear to have independently evolved much of the voltage-gated K+ channel diversity that is shared between cnidarians and bilaterians.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

Among them, 2,3,5,4'-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-{beta}-D-glucoside (THSG), specifically abundant in the famous medicinal plant Pleuropterus multiflorus, exhibits significant pharmacological properties. A selfing progeny of P. multiflorus commercial variety  Jinwufugui No.1, which contains high THSG content, was used for genome sequencing. Through the combination of weighted correlation network analysis, genome mining, and enzymatic characterization studies, we identified an unpredicted biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for THSG biosynthesis. This cluster includes a stilbene synthase (PmSTS1), a flavin-containing monooxygenase (PmFMO3), and a UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT72B90). Our findings suggest this stilbenoid gene cluster is formed by transposable element-mediated gene duplications and neofunctionalization, and regulated by MYB and NAC type transcription factors. Notably, PmFMO3, as the first identified stilbenoid-2-hydroxylase, was confirmed that it can modify the other stilbenoids without the A ring modifications. The novel type of gene cluster, in which FMO serves as the key decorating enzyme, will guide the identification of more biosynthetic gene clusters in plants.

By analyzing resequencing data of 266 worldwide Pst isolates, we found that Pst may have undergone an important historical hybridization event, introducing substantial diversity and leading to the divergence of its haploid genomes into two distinct haplotypes. Strains with both haplotypes exhibit higher individual allele diversity and wider geographical distribution. Between the two haploid genomes, 16% of the genome had diverged, scattered as mosaic blocks within the genome. These regions are enriched with genes displaying critical roles during infection of the plant host, and exhibit higher expression levels. In these regions, 8.0 Mb shows recombination fingerprints associated with virulence, while 4.9 Mb displays linkage across the entire genome. We demonstrated that sexual recombination in Pst is extensive and significant. Pst can gain genetic diversity and adaptability due to intra- and inter-species hybridization. Our study resolved the debate over the sources of individual allele diversity in Pst and expands the understanding of pathogen virulence evolution. These findings also suggest that interrupting the sexual reproduction of pathogens can be an effective strategy for controlling wheat stripe rust.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

Pacing is a self-management strategy to mitigate symptoms. Our aim was to describe experiences of pacing from the perspectives of adults living with Long COVID.

MethodsWe conducted a community-engaged qualitative descriptive study involving one-on-one online interviews with adults living with Long COVID from Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom, and United States to explore experiences of disability. We asked participants about strategies they used to deal with health challenges living with Long COVID. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. We analyzed data using group-based content analytical techniques.

ResultsAmong the 40 participants living with Long COVID, the majority were women (n=25; 63%), white (n=29;73%) and heterosexual (n=30;75%). The median age of participants was 39 years (25th, 75th percentile: 32, 49). Most participants (n=37;93%) used pacing to mitigate or prevent symptoms. Participant described experiences of pacing across five main areas: 1) using pacing as a living strategy (pacing to mitigate multidimensional health challenges; applying pacing to many types of activities; process of pacing experienced as a moving target; pacing experienced as a helpful strategy, but not a cure for Long COVID); 2) learning how to pace (acquiring knowledge about pacing; developing strategies and skills to support pacing); 3) encountering challenges with pacing (learning how to pace; experiencing inequitable access to pacing; experiencing stigma and judgement; undergoing psychological and emotional adjustment from beliefs of  fighting or  pushing through to balancing rest with activity; making sacrifices; and encountering unexpected obstacles); 4) experiencing consequences of not pacing; and 5) conceptualising and describing pacing using analogies or metaphors.

Population restoration and reintroduction programs are essential for mitigating this threat, yet their outcomes are often unpredictable due to poorly understood success factors. The conservation program of the crested ibis (Nipponia nippon) marks a successful example where the population rose from seven survivors to over 9,000 in the past four decades. To learn whether this successful restoration was due to chance or largely repeatable, we developed an individual-based model that simulates the restoration process by incorporating life-history parameters from empirical data. Our simulation results closely mirror empirical findings, including the time taken to reach the current population size and population-level inbreeding coefficients. We further analyzed the model to compare the effectiveness of two reintroduction strategies and analyzed how inbreeding depression interacts with demography to influence the chance of recovery from bottlenecks. The reintroduction simulations reveal that the firework approach (one-source translocations) outperforms the stepping-stone (serial translocations) approach in restoration effectiveness. Our simulations over broad demographic parameters demonstrate that the net effect of inbreeding varies with species-specific demography, and highlight the importance of considering this interaction when interpreting conservation outcomes and designing future reintroduction programs.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

Many of these immune genes exhibit remarkable allelic diversity across populations. While computational methods for HLA typing from bulk RNA sequencing data have emerged, streamlined solutions for allele-specific quantification in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are lacking. Moreover, no standardized data structure or analytical framework has been established to handle allele-specific immune gene expression data at single-cell level. Results: We present a comprehensive workflow to (1) automate allele-typing and allele-specific expression quantification of HLA transcripts in scRNA-seq data using a Snakemake workflow, scIGD (single-cell ImmunoGenomic Diversity), and (2) represent and interactively explore immune gene expression at different annotation levels using a multi-layer data structure implemented as an R/Bioconductor software package, SingleCellAlleleExperiment. We validated our approach on a diverse spectrum of scRNA-seq datasets, and found that it performs consistently across different sequencing platforms and experimental setups. We illustrate how our method can be utilized to study loss of HLA expression in tumor cells or discover differential HLA allele expression in specific immune cell subtypes. By capturing such allele-specific expression patterns and their variation, our workflow offers novel insights into human immunogenomic diversity.

Expanding populations naturally form regions of high and low density, and simultaneously experience ecological interactions both internally and at the boundary of their range. For this reason, systems of expanding populations are ideal for studying the combination of density and ecological effects. Conservation ecologists have been studying the ability of an invasive species to establish for some time, attributing success to both ecological and spatial factors. Similar behaviors have been observed in spatially structured cell populations, such as those found in cancerous tumors and bacterial biofilms. In these scenarios, novel organisms may be the introduction of a new mutation or bacterial species with some form of drug resistance, leading to the possibility of treatment failure. In order to gain insight into the relationship between population density and ecological interactions, we study an expanding population of interacting wild-type cells and mutant cells. We simulate these interactions in time and study the spatially dependent probability for a mutant to survive or to take over the front of the population wave (gene surfing). Additionally, we develop a mathematical model that describes this survival probability and find agreement when the payoff for the mutant is positive (corresponding to cooperation, exploitation, or commensalism). By knowing the types of interactions, our model provides insight into the spatial distribution of survival probability. Conversely, given a spatial distribution of survival probabilities, our model provides insight into the types of interactions that were involved to generate it.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

In this perspective, we performed new molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the various spike RBD/hACE2 complexes corresponding to the WT, Delta and Omicron variants (BA.1 up to BA.4/5) over 1.5 {micro}s timescale. Then, carrying out a comprehensive analysis of residue interactions within and between the two partners, allowed us to draw the profile of each variant by using complementary methods (PairInt, hydrophobic potential, contact PCA). Main results of PairInt calculations highlighted the most involved residues in electrostatic interactions that represent a strong contribution in the binding with highly stable contacts between spike RBD and hACE2 (importance of mutated residues at positions 417, 493 and 498). In addition to the swappable arginine residues (493/498), the apolar contacts made a substantial and complementary contribution in Omicron with the detection of two hydrophobic patches, one of which was correlated with energetic contribution calculations. This study brings new highlights on the global dynamics of spike RBD/hACE2 complexes resulting from the analysis of contact networks and cross-correlation matrices able to detect subtle changes at point mutations. The results of our study are also consistent with alternative approaches such as binding free energy calculations but are more informative and sensitive to transient or low-energy interactions. Nevertheless, the energetic contributions of residues at positions 501 and 505 were in good agreement with hydrophobic interactions measurements. The contact PCA networks could identify the intramolecular incidence of the S375F mutation occurring in all Omicron variants and likely conferring them an advantage in binding stability. Collectively, these data revealed the major differences observed between WT/Delta and Omicron variants at the RBD/hACE2 interface, which may explain the greater persistence of Omicron.

Author SummaryThe evolution of SARS-CoV-2 was extremely rapid, leading to the global predominance of Omicron variants, despite the many mutations identified in the spike protein. Some of these were introduced to evade the immune system, but many others were located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) without affecting its efficient binding to hACE2 and preserving the high infectivity of this variant. To unravel the mechanism by which this protein-protein connection remains strong or stable, it is necessary to study the different types of interactions at the atomic level and over time using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Indeed, in contrast to crystal or cryo-EM structures providing only a fixed image of the binding process, MD simulations have allowed to unambiguously identify the sustainability of some interactions mediated by key residues of spike RBD. This study could also highlight the interchangeable role of certain residues in compensating for a mutation, which in turn allows the virus to maintain durable binding to the host cell receptor.

However, measurement of the transcript levels is typically done in homogenized tissues post-mortem. Here, we present a new platform that enables non-invasive monitoring of specific mRNA levels in vivo, without tissue destruction. We achieved this by combining two cutting-edge tools - synthetic serum markers, called Released Markers of Activity (RMAs), and RNA-based sensors of transcription. We call this platform IN-vivo Tracking of ACtive Transcription, or INTACT. In INTACT, when the target mRNA is expressed, the RNA sensor detects it and triggers the production and release of RMA reporters into the blood. Once in blood, the RMAs can be easily measured through a simple blood draw. Our data shows that INTACT can measure transcription of transgenes, as well as endogenous transcripts, such as c-Fos or Arc, both in vivo in the brain and in tissue culture. INTACT enables simple measurement of transcript level histories in genetically-targetable cell populations of living animals.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we define the individual and combined contribution of KAT6A, KAT6B and KAT7, in MLL-FP leukaemia. Whilst inhibition of KAT6A/B is efficacious in some pre-clinical models, simultaneous targeting of KAT7, with the novel inhibitor PF-9363, increases the therapeutic efficacy. KAT7 interacts with Menin and the MLL complex and is co-localised at chromatin to co-regulate the MLL-FP transcriptional program. Inhibition of KAT6/KAT7 provides an orthogonal route to targeting Menin to disable the transcriptional activity of MLL-FP. Consequently, combined inhibition rapidly evicts the MLL-FP from chromatin, potently represses oncogenic transcription and overcomes primary resistance to Menin inhibitors. Moreover, PF-9363 or genetic depletion of KAT7 can also overcome acquired genetic/non-genetic resistance to Menin inhibition. These data provide the molecular rationale for rapid clinical translation of combination therapy in MLL-FP leukaemia.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

Yet insights into dikaryotic fungi that separate their haploid genomes into distinct nuclei is limited. Here we explore the impact of dikaryotism on the genome biology of a long-term asexual clone of the wheat pathogenic fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. We use Oxford Nanopore (ONT) duplex sequencing combined with Hi-C to generate a T2T nuclear-phased assembly with >99.999% consensus accuracy. We show that this fungus has large regional centromeres enriched in LTR retrotransposons, with a single centromeric dip in methylation that suggests one kinetochore attachment site per chromosomes. The centromeres of chromosomes pairs are most often highly diverse in sequence and kinetochore attachment sites are not always positionally conserved. Each nucleus carries a unique array of rDNAs with >200 copies that harbour nucleus-specific sequence variations. The inter-haplotype diversity between the two nuclear genomes is caused by large-scale structural variations linked to transposable elements. Nanopore long-read cDNA analysis across distinct infection conditions revealed pervasive allele specific expression for nearly 20% of all heterozygous gene pairs. Genes involved in plant infection were significantly enriched in ASE genes which appears to be mediated by elevated CpG gene body methylation of the lower expressed pair. This suggests that epigenetically regulated ASE is likely a previously overlooked mechanism facilitating plant infection. Overall, our study reveals how dikaryotism uniquely shapes key eukaryotic genome features.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

TFs often have drastically different regulatory behaviors depending on promoter context and interacting cofactors. However, the detailed mechanisms by which each TF affects transcription and produce promoter-dependent regulation is unclear. Here, we discover that a simple model explains the regulatory effects of E. coli TFs in a range of contexts. Specifically, we measure the relationship between basal promoter activity and its regulation by diverse TFs and find that the contextual changes in TF function are determined entirely by the basal strength of the regulated promoter: TFs exert lower fold-change on stronger promoters under a precise inverse scaling. Remarkably, this scaling relationship holds for both activators and repressors, indicating a universal mechanism of gene regulation. Our data, which spans between 100-fold activation to 1000-fold repression, is consistent with a model of regulation driven by stabilization of RNAP at the promoter for every TF. Crucially, this indicates that TFs naturally act to maintain homeostatic expression levels across genetic or environmental perturbations, ensuring robust expression of regulated genes.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

Here we present three cryo-EM structures of SETD2 bound to Pol II elongation complexes at different states of nucleosome passage. Together with functional probing, our results suggest a 3-step mechanism of transcription-coupled H3K36me3 deposition. First, binding to the elongation factor SPT6 tethers the catalytic SET domain in proximity to the upstream DNA. Second, Pol II nucleosome passage leads to the transfer of a hexasome from downstream to upstream, poised for methylation. Finally, continued transcription leads to upstream nucleosome reassembly, partial dissociation of the histone chaperone FACT and sequential methylation of both H3 tails, completing H3K36me3 deposition of an upstream nucleosome after Pol II passage.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

Yet laboratory tests of decision making often investigate how animals optimize their behavior to achieve a single, well-defined goal, which is often a nutritive reward. Thus, how animals solve multi-objective optimization problems is not well understood. Here, we devised an ethologically-inspired decision making task to examine how rats balance the pursuit of food and non-food reinforcement. Rats performed a free-choice patch-foraging task, in which they could earn food in one location (food patch) or interact with a rodent play structure in a different location (toy patch). The cost of switching between patches was manipulated by requiring rats to endure a long or short ""travel time"" penalty during which they were not able to access either patch. Rats devoted a considerable amount of their limited foraging time to patches of both types, showing a small but significant preference for food patches. In accordance with theoretical models of foraging, when the cost of switching patches was high rats chose longer stay durations in both types of patches, suggesting that similar rational principles guided their pursuit of food and non-food rewards. Examining the within-session dynamics of time allocation revealed that rats showed an early preference for spending time in toy patches that reversed over the course of the session. These results validate a naturalistic approach to testing decision making in rats over a range of food and non-food goods.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

We investigated the role of HP1 by recruiting the activators VP16, p65, and VPR to mouse fibroblast chromocenters and analyzed its silencing activity with a transcription reporter. Upon chromocenter decondensation and transcription activation, interactions of HP1 with chromatin and H3K9 trimethylation remained stable, suggesting stoichiometric binding rather than higher-order assembly. HP1-mediated repression required promoter-proximal binding and effectively suppressed VP16-triggered activation but not the stronger activation by VPR. These observations are explained by a 1D lattice binding model, which conceptualizes chromocenters as arrays of repeat units that can independently switch between silenced and activated states. Our findings provide a quantitative framework that explains how chromocenter organization responds to transcriptional activation while maintaining local heterochromatin features.

However, their variability complicates reference-based analysis, especially when these chromosomes are missing in the reference genome. Pangenome variation graphs offer a reference-free alternative for studying these chromosomes. Here, we constructed a pangenome variation graph for 73 diverse Fusarium oxysporum genomes, a major fungal plant pathogen with a compartmentalized genome that includes conserved core as well as variable accessory chromosomes. To obtain insights into accessory chromosome dynamics, we first constructed a chromosome similarity network using all-vs-all similarity mapping. We identified eleven core chromosomes conserved across all strains and a substantial number of highly variable accessory chromosomes. Some of these accessory chromosomes are host-specific and likely play a role in determining host range. Using a k-mer based approach we further identified the presence of these accessory chromosomes in all available (581) F. oxysporum assemblies and corroborated the occurrence of host specific accessory chromosomes. To further analyze the evolution of chromosomes in F. oxysporum, we constructed a pangenome variation graph per group of homologous chromosomes. This reveals that accessory chromosomes are composed of different stretches of accessory regions, and possibly rearrangements between accessory regions gave rise to these mosaic accessory chromosomes. Furthermore, we show that accessory chromosomes are likely horizontally transferred in natural populations. Our findings demonstrate that a pangenome variation graph is a powerful approach to elucidate the evolutionary dynamics of accessory chromosomes in F. oxysporum, which is not only a useful resource for Fusarium but provides a framework for similar analyses in other species encoding accessory chromosomes.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

Cardiac NCCs play a critical role in heart development by orchestrating outflow tract septation, valve formation, aortic arch artery patterning, parasympathetic innervation, and maturation of the cardiac conduction system. Abnormal migration, proliferation, or differentiation of cardiac NCCs can lead to severe congenital cardiovascular malformations. However, the complexity and timing of early embryonic heart development pose significant challenges to studying the molecular mechanisms underlying NCC-related cardiac pathologies. Here, we present a sophisticated functional model of human heart assembloids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, which, for the first time, recapitulates cardiac NCC integration into the human embryonic heart in vitro. NCCs successfully integrated at developmentally relevant stages into heart organoids, and followed developmental trajectories known to occur in the human heart. They demonstrated extensive migration, differentiated into cholinergic neurons capable of generating nerve impulses, and formed mature glial cells. Additionally, they contributed to the mesenchymal populations of the developing outflow tract. Through transcriptomic analysis, we revealed that NCCs acquire molecular features of their cardiac derivatives as heart assembloids develop. NCC-derived parasympathetic neurons formed functional connections with cardiomyocytes, promoting the maturation of the cardiac conduction system. Leveraging this models cellular complexity and functional maturity, we uncovered that early exposure of NCCs to antidepressants harms the development of NCC derivatives in the context of the developing heart. The commonly prescribed antidepressant Paroxetine disrupted the expression of a critical early neuronal transcription factor, resulting in impaired parasympathetic innervation and functional deficits in cardiac tissue. This advanced heart assembloid model holds great promise for high-throughput drug screening and unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying NCC-related cardiac formation and congenital heart defects.

IN BRIEFHuman neural crest heart assembloids resembling the major directions of neural crest differentiation in the human embryonic heart, including parasympathetic innervation and the mesenchymal component of the outflow tract, provide a human-relevant embryonic platform for studying congenital heart defects and drug safety.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

To learn about causal genes and mechanisms at the remaining loci, we created a unified single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) map in peripheral blood comprising a total of 282,424 cells from 48 individuals. Clustering and topic modeling of scATAC data identified discrete cell-types and continuous cell states, which helped reveal disease-relevant cellular contexts, and allowed mapping of genetic effects on chromatin accessibility across these contexts. We identified 37,390 chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTL) at 10% FDR across eight cell groups and observed extensive sharing of caQTLs across immune cell contexts, finding that fewer than 20% of caQTLs are specific to a single cell type. Notably, caQTLs colocalized with [~]50% more GWAS loci compared to eQTLs, helping to nominate putative causal genes for many unexplained loci. However, most GWAS-caQTL colocalizations had no detectable downstream regulatory effects on gene expression levels in the same cell type. We find evidence that the higher rates of colocalization between caQTLs and GWAS signals reflect missing disease-relevant cellular contexts among existing eQTL studies. Thus, there remains a pressing need for identifying disease-causing cellular contexts and for mapping gene regulatory variation in these cells.","NA","medrxiv",1734386923927

Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have identified unique populations of epithelial cells lacking KRT5 while expressing KRT17; fibroblasts characterized by high collagen production, and the expression of CTHRC1; as well as a distinct subset of SPP1 positive macrophages. However, the precise interactions among these and potentially other cells that lead to the formation of fibrotic niche remain unclear.

MethodsUsing spatial transcriptomics and Hyperion imaging mass cytometry we compared the cellular populations in formalin fixed paraffin embedded fibrotic lesions (n=9 patients) with control lung (n=9), and using CellChat we investigated the cellular interactions.

ResultsSpatial transcriptomic analysis identified 180,067 cells which demonstrated three unique fibrotic niches enriched for KRT5-/KRT17+ epithelial cells, SPP1+ macrophages and collagen producing fibroblasts as well as a unique DCN+ expressing plasma B cell. Ligand receptor analysis inferred that most fibrotic cells interacted with ATII cells, with the exception of KRT5-/KRT17+ epithelial cells which interacted primarily with macrophages. Hyperion Mass Cytometry identified 55,979 cells, which identified similar cell populations clustered into two unique fibrotic niches: a stromal fibrotic niche characterized by CTHRC1+ fibroblasts interacting with fibrotic associated plasma cells, and a second niche containing KRT5-/KRT17+ cells and SPP1+ macrophages. This latter niche appeared likely to originate from the control bronchial niche with progressive loss of KRT5.

ConclusionThese findings describe the characteristics of the fibrotic niche, support the hypothesis that basal cells can also contribute to the origin of the fibrotic epithelium and describe a novel fibrotic plasma cell population, shedding light on the complex cellular dynamics within fibrotic human lung tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

These disruptions lead to the intestine acting as a reservoir for VRE that seed difficult-to-treat infections. Patients would benefit from new treatments that prevent or treat VRE intestinal colonisation. However, the factors that drive VRE growth in the gut are poorly understood. We demonstrated that multiple antibiotics that promote VRE intestinal colonisation increased the concentration of a wide range of nutrients and decreased the concentration of a wide range of microbial metabolites. We demonstrated that specific short chain fatty acids and branched chain fatty acids found in healthy gut microbiomes inhibited VRE growth, however inhibition was incomplete at physiologically relevant concentrations. We also showed that VRE could use most nutrients increased in antibiotic-treated faecal microbiomes as carbon or nitrogen sources to support their growth, where growth was higher in the presence of oxygen. Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis had some common and some distinct preferences for use of specific nutrients that were enriched in antibiotic-treated faecal microbiomes. Finally, we showed that E. faecium and E. faecalis occupied overlapping but distinct nutrient-defined intestinal niches that promoted high growth when cultured with each other and when cultured with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (another group of multidrug-resistant pathogens). Our results demonstrated that VRE occupy distinct intestinal niches in the antibiotic-treated intestine, defined by their abilities to utilise specific enriched nutrients and their abilities to grow with reduced concentrations of microbial metabolites.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

Excessive Ca2+ entry is cytotoxic and Ca2+- mobilizing receptors have evolved diverse mechanisms for tight regulation that often include Calmodulin (CaM). TRPA1, an essential Ca2+-permeable ion channel involved in pain signaling and inflammation, exhibits complex Ca2+ regulation with initial channel potentiation followed by rapid desensitization. The molecular mechanisms of TRPA1 Ca2+ regulation and whether CaM plays a role remain elusive. We find that TRPA1 binds CaM best at basal Ca2+ concentration, that they co-localize in resting cells, and that CaM suppresses TRPA1 activity. Combining biochemical, biophysical, modeling, NMR spectroscopy, and functional approaches, we identify an evolutionarily conserved, high-affinity CaM binding element in the distal TRPA1 C-terminus (DCTCaMBE). Genetic or biochemical perturbation of Ca2+/CaM binding to the TRPA1 DCTCaMBE yields hyperactive channels that exhibit drastic slowing of desensitization with no effect on potentiation. Ca2+/CaM TRPA1 regulation does not require the N-lobe, raising the possibility that CaM is not the Ca2+ sensor, per se. Higher extracellular Ca2+ can partially rescue slowed desensitization suggesting Ca2+/CaM binding to the TRPA1 DCTCaMBE primes an intrinsic TRPA1 Ca2+ binding site that, upon binding Ca2+, triggers rapid desensitization. Collectively, our results identify a critical regulatory element in an unstructured TRPA1 region highlighting the importance of these domains, they reveal Ca2+/CaM is an essential TRPA1 auxiliary subunit required for rapid desensitization that establishes proper channel function with implications for all future TRPA1 work, and they uncover a mechanism for receptor regulation by Ca2+/CaM that expands the scope of CaM biology.","NA","biorxiv",1734386923927

Even cancers with the same driver mutation show significant transcriptional heterogeneity and varied responses to therapy. However, the mechanisms underpinning this heterogeneity remain under-explored. Here, we find that novel enhancer usage is a common feature in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In particular, KMT2A::AFF1 ALL, an aggressive leukemia with a poor prognosis and a low mutational burden, exhibits substantial transcriptional heterogeneity between individuals. Using single cell multiome analysis and extensive chromatin profiling, we reveal that much transcriptional heterogeneity in KMT2A::AFF1 ALL is driven by novel enhancer usage. Using high resolution Micro-Capture-C in primary patient samples, we also identify patient-specific enhancer activity at key oncogenes such as MEIS1 and RUNX2, driving high levels of expression of both oncogenes in a patient-specific manner. Overall, our data show that enhancer heterogeneity is highly prevalent in KMT2A::AFF1 ALL and may also be a mechanism that drives transcriptional heterogeneity in cancer more generally.

Using a suite of experimental and computational multiscale approaches, we found that aortic expansion is guided by specific biological principles and scales with the vertebral column rather than animal body weight. Expansion proceeds via two distinct waves of arterial cell proliferation along blood flow that are spatially stochastic, yet temporally coordinated. Each wave exhibits unique cell cycle kinetics and properties, with the first wave exhibiting cell cycle durations as fast as 6 hours. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed changes in fatty acid metabolism concomitant with an increase in cell size. Mathematical modeling and experiments indicated endothelial cell extrusion is essential for homeostatic aortic growth and balancing excess proliferation. In a genetic model of achondroplasia, the aorta achieves proper scaling through enhanced cell extrusion while maintaining normal proliferation dynamics.

While the Golgi apparatus plays a central role in lysosomal enzyme sorting, the mechanisms linking Golgi function to lysosomal activity remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify the Golgi-resident protein GRASP55, but not its paralog GRASP65, as a key regulator of lysosome function. More specifically, we demonstrate that loss of GRASP55 expression leads to missorting and secretion of lysosomal enzymes, lysosomal dysfunction and bloating. GRASP55 deficiency also disrupts lysosomal mTORC1 signaling, reducing the phosphorylation of its lysosomal substrates, TFEB and TFE3, while sparing its non-lysosomal targets. Mechanistically, GRASP55 interacts with GNPTAB, a critical enzyme required for mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) tagging of lysosomal enzymes, and is necessary for its correct trafficking and stability. These findings reveal an essential role for GRASP55 in Golgi-lysosome communication and lysosomal enzyme trafficking, and suggest that GRASP55/GORASP2 may act as a susceptibility gene for lysosomal storage disorder (LSD)-like conditions.
