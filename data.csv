However, disease mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Objectives: To evaluate the frequency and severity of autonomic dysfunction in a subset of carefully phenotyped, previously healthy patients with LC-POTS using a detailed protocol of autonomic, cerebrovascular, respiratory, blood, and tissue analyses. Methods: Participants in this study completed a battery of autonomic function tests, including measures of sudomotor, cardiovagal, and sympathetic adrenergic function, and head-up tilt (HUT) with transcranial Doppler measures of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv), end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2), cerebral and skeletal muscle near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and plasma catecholamines. Skin biopsy was performed at proximal and distal sites and analyzed for intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) and phosphorylated -synuclein (P-Syn). Results were compared to healthy controls (HC) [&ge;] 3 months post-COVID infection with no lasting sequelae. Results: LC-POTS participants (n=24) exhibited a greater increase in heart rate on HUT (31.1{+/-}20.3, p=0.01), and 38% exhibited elevated upright norepinephrine levels consistent with a hyperadrenergic response. CBFv did not significantly differ between LC-POTS and HC (n=10). EtCO2 and NIRS were also similar between groups. Twenty-two percent of LC-POTS and 38% of HC had decreased IENFD on skin biopsy, while 8.7% LC-POTS had dermal P-Syn aggregation on skin biopsy, compared to none of HC. Conclusions: LC-POTS was associated with widespread autonomic dysfunction, including orthostatic tachycardia, sympathetic adrenergic hyperactivity, small fiber neuropathy, and dermal P-Syn deposition. Our findings support the concept of multiple pathophysiological mechanisms in most patients with POTS triggered by SARS-CoV-2.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

Design: Matched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up. Setting: Florida's state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics. Participants: Matched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021. Intervention: Initial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 Main outcome measures: All-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose Results: There were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431,1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]). Negative control outcomes did not show any indication of meaningful unobserved residual confounding. Conclusion: Florida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. They underscore the need to evaluate vaccines using clinical endpoints that extend beyond their targeted diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

Saffron (Crocus sativus) supplementation has been linked to sleep improvements and gut microbiome changes, but its effect on sleep quality through gut microbiota-brain axis modulation remains unexplored. A randomised, placebo-controlled pilot study of saffron (30mg/day for 4-weeks) was conducted with 52 older adults (55-85 years) experiencing sleep complaints. Subjective and objective sleep quality were measured using validated questionnaires and electroencephalography-based sleep tracker respectively. A subgroup (n=26) underwent microbiome analysis. Saffron supplementation improved subjective sleep quality (p=0.02) and sleep efficiency (p=0.04). Objective measures showed reduced latency to persistent sleep (p=0.003) and sleep onset latency (p=0.03). Linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis of the microbiome revealed increases in Faecalibacterium (q=0.013), Lachnoclostridium (q=0.045), Prevotella (q=0.022), UBA1819 (q=0.020) and Oscillibacter (q=0.045), while decreasing Dialister (q=0.028). Univariate analysis further indicated increases in Lachnospiraceae-UGC-001 (p=0.020) and Roseburia (p=0.03), with a decrease in Turicibacter (p=0.045) in the saffron group. Oscillibacter and UBA1819 correlated with subjective measures of sleep efficiency (r=0.63, p=0.0007) and sleep latency (r=-0.39, p=0.04. Changes in Dialister, Turicibacter and UBA1819 were correlated with several measures of objective sleep quality including wake duration, latency to persistent sleep and wake-after-sleep-onset. Four-weeks saffron supplementation improved both subjective and objective sleep quality in older adults with sleep complaints, while increasing gut bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids. These results pave the way for further randomised controlled trials exploring the links between sleep quality and gut health and may help devising new preventative strategies for age-related brain disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

However, the underlying mechanisms driving functional {beta}-cell heterogeneity are still not fully understood. Here, we aimed to investigate how paracrine signaling, specifically GLP-1R mediated -{beta}-cell communication shapes functional {beta}-cell heterogeneity. To address this question, we sought to understand how {beta}-cell function and heterogeneity are altered when the -to {beta}-cell communication was inhibited via GLP1-R antagonist, exendin-9. To this end, we utilized confocal imaging to record calcium response in isolated islets from GCaMP6s mice and in islets from pancreatic slices from C57Bl6 mice, both before and after the application of exendin-9. We found that inhibiting -{beta}-cell communication prolonged the response-time, increased 1st phase heterogeneity, and decreased the peak of the 1st phase islets response. Additionally, it reduced 2nd phase oscillation frequency and 2nd phase heterogeneity, thereby enhancing 2nd phase coordination across {beta}-cells. These changes in oscillation frequency were also found to be more pronounced in -neighboring {beta}-cells. Additionally, we also found that inhibiting GLP1-R mediated -{beta}-cell communication disrupted the temporal consistency and -cell proximity of 1st responder and hub-cell functional {beta}-cell subpopulations in the islet.","NA","biorxiv",1746050922074

METHODS PsycInfo, Medline and Embase databases were systematically searched up to December 2024. Studies of children aged 2-18 years with PPCMS who had undergone standardised neurocognitive assessment were included. Quality was appraised using Institute of Health Economics Quality Appraisal Checklist for Case Series and Quality In Prognosis Studies tools. Synthesis without meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS Sixteen studies (PPCMS+ n=252, PPCMS-n=590) met criteria for inclusion. Children who experience PPCMS were found to have pronounced, long-term neurocognitive impairments with severely affected processing speed, psychomotor and executive function, and poorer neurocognitive outcomes generally compared to children without PPCMS. Current literature is limited by small samples, lack of diagnostic clarity or routine prospective screening of PPCMS, and limited investigation of factors that may moderate neurocognitive outcomes. INTERPRETATION Children with PPCMS have increased vulnerability to neurocognitive impairments which persist beyond the recovery of initial PPCMS symptoms in the post-operative phase. Dedicated research is needed to further our understanding of PPCMS and associated neurocognitive outcomes to inform clinical care.

What this paper addsO_LIChildren who experience PPCMS after surgery experience significant long-term neurocognitive impairment, with most consistent moderate-severe impairments in processing speed, psychomotor function, and executive function.
C_LIO_LIChildren who experience PPCMS have poorer neurocognitive outcomes generally than children treated for posterior fossa tumour without PPCMS, however future research is needed with larger matched samples of children with and without PPCMS.
C_LIO_LIProspective screening for PPCMS using formal diagnostic criteria in research and clinical practice is recommended, and cognitive development should be monitored in the long-term when PPCMS is identified.
C_LIO_LIFuture research is needed to understand the role of potential moderating influences on neurocognitive outcomes, such as duration and severity of mutism, age at surgery, and adjuvant oncology treatments.

Methods: At two time-points, we acquired T1-weighted MRI images (mean [SD] follow-up period 8.98 [2.20] years) of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; N=32) and Bipolar Disorder BD; N=6) and healthy controls (HC; N = 37) at two sites (Dublin, Muenster). Using a brain age prediction model trained on a sample of over 10,000 subjects of the German National Cohort (GNC), we estimated individual BAG at two time-points (baseline and follow-up) using gray matter segments derived from MRI images. Employing linear-mixed-effects models, we tested main effects of diagnosis and hospitalizations during follow-up on BAG at baseline and follow-up, as well as their interaction with time respectively. In an exploratory analysis, we tested if BAG at baseline was predictive of hospitalizations during the nine-year follow-up using logistic regression and 10-fold nested cross-validation. Results: MDD patients showed a larger BAG compared to HC (MDD>HC: p=.039, MDD vs. BD: n.s.), while BD patients only showed a tendency for a larger BAG (p = .066). In the Muenster subsample (N=52), patients with hospitalizations showed a higher BAG compared to patients without hospitalizations (p=.001). No significant group-by-time interaction could be detected. However, higher BAG at baseline was associated with the number of hospitalizations during follow- up (p=.018), however, the cross-validation of our prediction with an accuracy of 64.3% was not significant (p=.071). Discussion: Our results show that BAG did not change over time as a function of patients' course of disease. The present study rather suggests that a higher estimation of biological aging (higher BAG) predicts future hospitalizations. Therefore, BAG may indicate a patient's vulnerability to future recurrence.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

Its best-known strain is H5N1, with South- or South-East Asia a likely location for an initial outbreak. Such an outbreak would be initiated through a primary event of bird-to-human infection, followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Early interventions would require the extraction, integration and interpretation of epidemiological information from the limited and noisy case data available at outbreak onset. We studied the implications of a potential zoonotic spillover of H5N1 influenza into humans. Our simulations used BharatSim, an agent-based model framework designed primarily for the population of India, but which can be tuned easily for others. We considered a synthetic population representing farm-workers (primary contacts) in a farm with infected birds. These primary contacts transfer infections to secondary (household) contacts, from where the infection spreads further. We simulate outbreak scenarios in such a setting, accounting for the network structure of human contacts and the stochasticity of the infection process. We further simulated multiple interventions, including bird-culling, quarantines, and vaccinations. We show how limited, noisy data for primary and secondary infections can be used to estimate epidemiological transmission parameters, such as the basic reproductive ratio R0, in realistic settings. We describe the impact of early interventions (bird-culling, quarantines, and vaccination), taken together or separately, in slowing or terminating the outbreak. An individual-based model allows for the most granular description of the bird-human spillover and subsequent human-to-human transmission for the case of H5N1. Such models can be contextualised to individual communities across varied geographies, given representative contact networks. We show how such models allow for the systematic real-time exploration of policy measures that could constrain disease-spread, as well as guide a better understanding of disease epidemiology.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

Haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequencing data from 82 of 368 influenza A positive samples (71 submissions) were determined, identifying H1N1 and H1N2 subtypes from the 1A classical swine and 1B human-seasonal lineages respectively. The 1B lineage viruses were predominant, accounting for 68.29% of sequenced viruses, with 1A lineage viruses comprising 31.71%, primarily from the 1A.3.3.2 clade (2009 H1N1 pandemic origin). This study characterised previously undefined diversity within the 1B lineage which led to the designation of new HA clades 1B.1.1.1, 1B.1.1.2 and 1B.1.1.3. Complete genome data were obtained from 64/82 viruses thereby updating the definition of genetic diversity thresholds and leading to the identification of 24 unique genotypes. All these 64 viruses contained PB2, PB1, PA, NP, MP, and NS gene segments of 2009 H1N1 pandemic origin.

To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

We also detected 1051 expression outliers and prioritised 299 rare non-coding single-nucleotide, structural variants or copy number variants as plausible drivers for 28% of outlier events. This study increases understanding of gene expression regulation in the human retina.

While cholinergic activity supports cortical activation during REM sleep, direct evidence for a link between cholinergic degeneration and early REM sleep alterations in humans is still lacking. Here, we tested the long-standing hypothesis that early cholinergic denervation may be associated with REM sleep EEG slowing in older adults with and without Mild Cognitive Impairment. Twenty-four older participants (mean [standard deviation] age: 71.29 [4.85] years; 58.33% women; 25% participants with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment) without dementia or moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea underwent a night of in-laboratory polysomnography, comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, structural MRI and molecular PET imaging with [18F]-Fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol (FEOBV), known for its sensitivity to quantify brain cholinergic innervation. Voxel-wise multiple regressions assessed the associations between REM sleep characteristics (i.e., REM sleep percentage, relative theta power and EEG slowing ratios, defined as [delta + theta]/[alpha + beta] power) and FEOBV-PET standard uptake value ratio maps corrected for partial volume effects, controlling for sex. Given that FEOBV uptake was higher in women compared to men, we also performed exploratory sex-stratified analyses adjusted for age. Higher REM sleep EEG slowing over frontal and parietal derivations was significantly associated with cortical cholinergic denervation, notably in fronto-parietal areas and the medial temporal lobe (P<0.005 level, combined with a cluster-level family-wise error correction). Exploratory sex-stratified analyses revealed that REM sleep EEG slowing was associated with cholinergic denervation in medial temporal regions in women, and neocortical regions in men. These findings provide the first direct in vivo evidence that REM sleep EEG slowing could represent a sensitive marker of cortical cholinergic denervation in older adults, prior to dementia onset. Thus, quantitative REM sleep EEG may constitute a promising marker for early diagnosis and disease-modifying interventions in Alzheimer's disease.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

Using genetically engineered model organisms, cell cultures, proteomic and metabolomic profiling, and human genetics, we show that ATG7 deficiency shifts PT cell metabolism and differentiation toward growth at the expense of function. ATG7 loss impairs autophagy-mediated lipid droplet homeostasis, causing their accumulation and disrupting fatty acid transfer to mitochondria, compromising energy metabolism and cellular function. In zebrafish, reintroducing human wild-type ATG7 restores homeostasis, whereas inhibiting mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation induces phenotypic changes in wild-type cells. In humans, ATG7 variation associates with increased kidney disease risk, and loss-of-function variants cause tubular proteinuria and altered mitochondrial metabolism. Low ATG7 levels correlate with dedifferentiation, altered metabolic pathways, and poor renal cell carcinoma outcomes. Together, our results establish a metabolic paradigm that links autophagy to kidney epithelial cell fate specialization, with broad implications for health and disease.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

METHODSCommunity-dwelling dementia-free (n=113, including 102 (91%) cognitively normal) participants underwent ATN neuroimaging and plasma biomarker assessments.

RESULTSPlasma A{beta}42/A{beta}40, p-tau181, and p-tau217 showed significant associations with A{beta}-PET status (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] of 1.74*10-24, 1.47, and 3.43*103 respectively [p- values<0.05]), with p-tau217 demonstrating the highest classification accuracy for A{beta}-PET status (AUC=0.94).

Hence, we conducted genome-wide association study across six graph metrics of the macroscale functional networks at global, hemispheric and regional levels and their hemispheric asymmetry in 54,030 individuals. We identified seven experiment-wide significant loci and prioritised ten candidate genes. Both global graph metrics and hemispheric asymmetry are modestly heritable, but phenotypically and genetically form two clusters. Furthermore, cortical macro- and microstructure are causally related to global graph metrics and asymmetry, respectively, suggesting a dual structural constraint on functional network organisation. Finally, amongst twelve common neuropsychiatric conditions, only autism was genetically correlated with graph metrics of the functional network, supporting phenotypic case-control differences in functional connectivity. Overall, our results suggest different genetic axes shaping different aspects of brain functional topology and demonstrate shared biology with brain structure and autism.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

Yet, there is no consensus on the relative influence of schistosome and viral hepatitis coinfection for any liver disease.

MethodsWe conducted a meta-analysis for intestinal schistosome and hepatitis B or C coinfection on author-defined nonspecific liver outcomes, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The study protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023443435) and adhered to PRISMA reporting guidelines. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Global Health, Global Index Medicus, and Medline were systematically searched from inception to 23 January 2025. Inverse-variance weighted random effects were used to calculate pooled effect sizes. Subgroup analyses were conducted for study aims, region, species, diagnostic tools, and reference categories of singularly infected versus uninfected. We assessed study quality using a modified National Institute of Health risk of bias (RoB) tool.

FindingsOut of 1984 studies screened, 33 full text articles were eligible for meta-analysis with 8637 participants. 57% of studies (19/33) were on coinfection with hepatitis C and S. mansoni. Individuals with any coinfection were 2{middle dot}75 times more likely to have any liver disease than singularly or uninfected individuals, and a 2{middle dot}29, 2{middle dot}35 and 2{middle dot}69 higher likelihood of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Schistosome and hepatitis B coinfections, in particular, were 4{middle dot}11 times more likely to be associated with any liver disease. Results were similar when compared to singularly infected only. Heterogeneity was moderate (I2 74{middle dot}35%), and 42{middle dot}42% (14/32) of studies where RoB could be assessed were of low quality.

InterpretationSchistosome and viral hepatitis coinfection worsened hepatic disease. Guidelines for schistosomiasis and hepatitis B and C should consider coinfection when evaluating eligibility for treatment or prophylaxis, and determining morbidity management strategies.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSSchistosomiasis, caused by helminths of the species Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, S. mekongi, as well as chronic infection with hepatitis B and C viruses can lead to similar liver disease outcomes including periportal or portal fibrosis. In 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) released new guidelines for hepatitis B that changed treatment eligibility based on the importance of coinfections, of which schistosomiasis was not considered despite known co-endemicity. For schistosomiasis, there are currently no WHO guidelines that directly focus on morbidity management. A population-based study in Uganda by Anjorin and colleagues showed that schistosomal liver fibrosis risk depended on underlying hepatitis B coinfections. However, there is conflicting evidence as to the association of intestinal schistosome and hepatitis B or C coinfections, especially given the current context of available hepatitis B vaccinations and regular mass drug administration for schistosomiasis. It remains unknown how similar the hepatic disease presentations are between these vastly different helminth and viral pathogens; whether diseases specific to one pathogen can be worsened by coinfection; or whether an individual could be predisposed to develop hepatic disease if exposed previously to the other pathogen. These knowledge gaps exist despite known spatial overlap in the portal area of liver fibrosis caused by both pathogens. There remain open questions as to potential interactions between immune-driven inflammatory processes specific to schistosomes versus hepatitis B or C, or any role of immune priming for liver fibrosis. Here we synthesised the current state of evidence to assess whether coinfection worsens hepatic outcomes when compared to singular or no infections and to identify the relevance and severity of the type of hepatic outcome in humans only with murine models excluded.

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1996-), Medline including PubMed (1946-), Embase (1974-), Global Health (1973-) and Global Index Medicus (1901-) were searched from database inception to 7 July 2023 and updated on 23 January 2025 using the search string (schistosom* OR bilharzia* OR ""snail fever"" OR ""mansoni"" OR ""japonicum"" OR ""mekongi"") and (""hepatitis B"" OR HBV OR ""hepatitis C"" or HCV or ""hepatitis B C"") AND (liver OR hepat* OR cirrho*). One systematic literature review was identified from this search string, which summarised the clinical progression of liver disease in general in the event of coinfection of S. mansoni and hepatitis B or C. However, this review did not perform a meta-analysis and was focused solely on coinfection relating to one species of intestinal schistosomiasis. We found no published reviews specifically investigating coinfection with any intestinal schistosome species and hepatitis B or C for hepatomegaly, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Added value of this studyIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we estimated the pooled effect size of coinfection versus singular infections or no infection, as well as compared to singular infections only. We assessed whether intestinal schistosomes and viral hepatitis B or C coinfections influence the odds of nonspecific liver pathology, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma without restrictions on language or geography. By combining summary measures from 8637 participants across 7 different countries from 1991-2024, we identified that co-infected individuals were 2{middle dot}75 times more likely to have any liver pathology than singularly or uninfected individuals, and the odds were similar when coinfected individuals were compared to singularly infected individuals only (Odds Ratio 2{middle dot}61; CI 1{middle dot}62-4{middle dot}25). When specified by author-defined hepatic disease outcomes, we found that coinfection was over two times more likely to be associated with liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma when compared to singularly or uninfected individuals. The results were similar when compared to singularly infected individuals only, though slightly attenuated for hepatocellular carcinoma (Odds Ratio 1{middle dot}81; CI 1{middle dot}11-2{middle dot}96). Remarkably, schistosome and hepatitis B coinfection had over four times higher likelihood of any hepatic outcome than singular infections. Heterogeneity amongst the included studies was moderate (I2 74{middle dot}35%) and was reduced (I2 69{middle dot}85%) when outlying studies were removed. Risk of bias was moderate to high in most included studies, with only one study classed as low risk of bias.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis study demonstrates the importance of jointly considering schistosomes and hepatitis B or C for estimating the likelihood of chronic liver diseases of varying prognostic value. Coinfections influenced a range of author-defined hepatic outcomes of varying severity from fibrosis to cirrhosis. Future research is needed to assess whether to incorporate coinfections in guidelines for schistosomiasis and hepatitis B or C morbidity management, as well as to explore possibilities of coordinating vaccination campaigns with mass drug administration, or preventative interventions such as health education targeting.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

Methods A rapid review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach. Searches were completed in June 2024 and included MEDLINE, Embase, American Psychological Association (APA) PsycINFO, evidence based medicine (EBM) Reviews (including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), Health Management Information Consortium, Web of Science and Google Scholar. This review included studies on LC symptoms lasting over 12 weeks, focusing on 1) non-workplace- and workplace-based support for RTW in LC patients, and/or 2) barriers and facilitators to RTW in LC patients. A quality assessment was conducted using the JBI Systematic Reviews critical appraisal tool. The data were summarised in tabular format and a narrative summary. This study was pre-registered (PROSPERO-ID: CRD42023478126). Results Twenty-five studies were included. While many studies demonstrated rigorous methodologies and low risk of bias levels, some had high and medium risk levels. Non-workplace-based support was mostly measured quantitatively and included interdisciplinary healthcare programmes, clinical interventions, and rehabilitation programmes focusing on pacing and breathing strategies. Compensation and insurance schemes were important funders of these interventions. Workplace-based support was mostly measured qualitatively. Barriers to the provision of support at organisational level included lack of understanding of LC symptoms, insufficient workplace guidance, and educational gaps among managers. Individual barriers included threat of income loss, remote working and disconnection from the workplace. Facilitators for support included recognition and validation of LC and its symptoms, and eligibility for disability benefits associated with work. Conclusions RTW is an important outcome of health related absence and should be systematically recorded in studies of people with long COVID (PwLC). The heterogeneity and unpredictability of LC symptoms create challenges for supporting working age populations. Further research is crucial to better understand the specific RTW needs for PwLC and address potential barriers and facilitators to effective support. Consistent guidelines on LC's definition, and disability status may facilitate the provision of support and the development of interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

Dance has emerged as a promising intervention for improving motor and non-motor symptoms in persons with PD (PwPD), yet long-term effects remain underexplored.

ObjectiveTo assess changes in cognitive function and gait performance over six years among PwPD who participated in a weekly dance program, compared to a Reference group who remained physically inactive.

MethodsThis six-year longitudinal observational study included 43 PwPD who attended weekly dance classes and were evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). A Reference group of 28 PwPD, matched on age, gender, and Hoehn & Yahr scores, were selected from the Parkinsons Progression Marker Initiative, and assessed using the MDS-UPDRS and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Cognitive scores were standardized. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare cognitive and gait outcomes across time.

ResultsThe Dance group was significantly different from the Reference group (p < 0.001), with improved cognitive scores in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The Dance group had worse gait at baseline, however, the Reference group showed significantly poorer gait performance by 2018. No significant association was found between gait and cognitive scores.

ConclusionAfter two years of weekly dance, the Dance group showed improvements in cognition and maintained stability in gait performance. The findings highlight the potential neuroprotective benefits of continued dance engagement over six years.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

Zoonotic transmission of avian influenza A viruses represents a significant threat to human health given the lack of population level immunity, which could translate into an influenza pandemic. Therefore, there is a need to better understand pre-existing human immunity against avian influenza strains. as highlighted by the recent rapid, global spread of avian H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4b variants. Here, we sought to quantify the frequencies and specificities of B cells recognising avian hemagglutinin (HA) within unexposed adults, and to characterise the ability of seasonal immunisation to boost cross-reactive immune responses to H5Nx strains, including from clade 2.3.4.4b. Low but detectable serum antibody titres against H5 and H7 avian influenza HA were observed in donors. The frequency of memory B cells with cross-reactive recognition of H5 and H7 HA was low and 2-5 fold lower than populations of seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 HA-specific B cells. Boosting of B cell responses against H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4b HA following seasonal immunisation were sporadic with only 3 out of 19 individuals showing an increased population of probe-positive cells. Cross-reactive B cells generally expressed immunoglobulins drawn from variable heavy chain genes associated with recognition of the HA stem (VH6-1, VH1-69, VH1-18). CD4+ T cell responses towards H5 HA were also weakly boosted with little to no increase in circulating T follicular helper cell populations.

There is an established relationship between these conditions, trajectories of decline and outcomes in dementia post-diagnosis. An understanding of when these conditions first occur and how they manifest over time within dementia populations remains unclear. The pathophysiology across major bodily systems changes before and after the clinical onset of dementia. However, the timing of various complex, chronic conditions, how they interact and their association with dementia are not yet fully understood. Understanding the complex relationship between multiple long-term conditions and dementia can enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of disease. This understanding can help identify ""windows of opportunity"" for early interventions in at-risk populations. Long-term conditions also continue to affect individual decline as the disease progresses. We set out to map these key comorbidities chronologically, specific to diagnoses of Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Dementia. Method We map comorbidities based on International Classification of Diseases (10th revision) system, in a population of people with Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Dementia from 20 years before through to 10 years after diagnosis. We used inpatient hospital electronic healthcare record data from 10,696 UK Biobank participants, with records spanning a median of 16.90 years (IQR = 10.10 years) for participants with dementia and 13.36 years (IQR = 13.52) for controls (no diagnosis of dementia). Controls were validated with lower polygenic risk scores than either dementia group. Results Characteristic comorbidity signatures were observed in individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Dementia. Up to 20 years before diagnosis, depressive episodes, osteoporosis, arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome are characteristic of Alzheimer's Disease, but not Vascular Dementia or control cohorts. From 15 years before diagnosis, type 1 diabetes, functional intestinal disorder and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease begin to emerge. Up to 10 years before, symptoms involving fluid and food intake are uniquely associated with the cohort of people diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. In Vascular Dementia, 20 years before diagnosis cerebral infarctions, type 1 diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, intestinal disorders and rheumatoid arthritis are early conditions in the Vascular Dementia cohort, not seen in control or Alzheimer's Disease cohorts. 15 years before Vascular Dementia, an increase in mental health conditions emerge such as depressive episodes as well as rheumatoid arthritis. 10 years before Vascular Dementia, an additional burden of cerebrovascular diseases, hypotension and dorsalgia. From 5 years up to diagnosis of Vascular Dementia, intra-cerebral haemorrhage, mental and behavioural disorders due to tobacco begin to emerge within this population. In the years following Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis, acute lower respiratory infections and skin conditions such as decubitus ulcer emerge up to 2 years after diagnosis. After a diagnosis of Vascular Dementia, pneumonitis and decubitus ulcer and pressure area, are unique to this cohort. Conclusion In this study, comorbid conditions were mapped in relation to Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Dementia pre- and post-diagnosis. Understanding prodromal and progressive changes in health over the course of these dementia sub-types could uncover opportunities for targeted screening, preventative measures and early interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

While immunotherapy has revolutionized treatment for other hematologic malignancies, its efficacy in TP53-mutant AML remains limited. Although TP53 mutations in leukemic blasts are well characterized, their presence and functional consequences in immune cells have not been fully explored. Here we show that TP53 mutations are also present in T and NK cells from AML patients, where they are associated with increased activation markers but diminished cytotoxic function. T cells engineered to express common TP53 mutations exhibit an exhausted phenotype, characterized by impaired cytokine secretion and reduced tumor-killing capacity. Remarkably, restoring wild-type p53 conformation using a targeted small molecule reactivator reverses these dysfunctions and improves disease control in preclinical AML models. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of immune escape driven by mutant p53 in T cells and highlight the therapeutic potential of p53 reactivation. This work broadens our understanding of immune dysfunction in AML and supports incorporating immune-cell genotyping and correction strategies into future immunotherapy approaches for TP53-mutant disease.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

To address this gap, Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) established a biorepository and developed a comprehensive DNA sequencing resource including 15,684 individuals who self-identified as African American or Black and received care at CCHMC.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled through the CCHMC Discover Together Biobank and sequenced. Admixture analyses confirmed the genetic ancestry of the cohort, which was then linked to electronic medical records.

ResultsHigh-quality genome-wide genotypes from common variants accompanied by medical record-sourced data are available through the Genomic Information Commons. This dataset performs well in genetic studies. Specifically, we replicated known associations in sickle cell disease (HBB, p = 4.05 x 10-{superscript 1}{square}{square}), anxiety (PLAA3, p = 6.93 x 10-{square}), and asthma (PCDH15, p = 5.6 x 10-{superscript 1}{square}), while also identifying novel loci associated with asthma severity.

ConclusionWe present the acquisition and quality of genetic and disease-associated data and present an analytical framework for using this resource. In partnership with a community advisory council, we have co-developed a valuable framework for data use and future research.

Relatively few reports, however, address this problem when it confronts researchers reporting tests of potential new biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. This is despite the reality that the vast majority of published studies employ the neurologists clinical diagnoses as the gold standard, despite their well-known inherent inaccuracies relative to the true, gold standard, autopsy neuropathology diagnosis. More recently, biomarkers that have, appropriately, been evaluated against the autopsy gold standard, have then themselves been used as a surrogate gold standard to evaluate other biomarkers, despite their less-than-perfect accuracy against autopsy. The shortcomings of these approaches to neurodegenerative disease biomarker validation are rarely discussed. It is clear from the prior literature that testing the accuracy of a new AD or PD diagnostic test against the clinical diagnosis can in fact lead to both underestimates and overestimates of its true (against autopsy) accuracy. Despite these problems, the clinical diagnoses of AD and PD are still routinely used to assess the accuracy of new biomarkers. A related issue is that when a new biomarker is evaluated against a test type previously validated against autopsy (e.g. amyloid PET tau PET), in effect serving as a surrogate gold standard, it is again clear that this new biomarker might itself be more accurate, as accurate or less accurate than the surrogate gold standard. We here present a method that makes it possible, if there are published data on the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis, or of a surrogate gold standard, relative to autopsy, to at least estimate a range of possible accuracies of a new biomarker using those imperfect gold standards. Our procedure was developed using basic theoretical modeling of conditional probabilities.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

Notably, in the past two decades, the incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer, affecting individuals under the age of 50 years, has doubled in many countries. The reasons for this increase are unknown. Here, we investigate whether mutational processes contribute to geographic and age-related differences by examining 981 colorectal cancer genomes from 11 countries. No major differences were found in microsatellite unstable cancers, but variations in mutation burden and signatures were observed in the 802 microsatellite-stable cases. Multiple signatures, most with unknown etiologies, exhibited varying prevalence in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Russia, and Thailand, indicating geographically diverse levels of mutagenic exposure. Signatures SBS88 and ID18, caused by the bacteria-produced mutagen colibactin, had higher mutation loads in countries with higher colorectal cancer incidence rates. SBS88 and ID18 were also enriched in early-onset colorectal cancers, being 3.3 times more common in individuals diagnosed before age 40 than in those over 70, and were imprinted early during colorectal cancer development. Colibactin exposure was further linked to APC driver mutations, with ID18 responsible for about 25% of APC driver indels in colibactin-positive cases. This study reveals geographic and age-related variations in colorectal cancer mutational processes, and suggests that early-life mutagenic exposure to colibactin-producing bacteria may contribute to the rising incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

Although physiotherapists (PTs) often use reassurance strategies, the perception of the different reassuring messages remains unclear.

ObjectiveTo investigate perceptions of confidence of different reassurance messages delivered by PTs to people with LBP.

MethodsA survey was conducted among 544 participants with LBP. The survey included 21 reassuring messages divided into six themes  Prevalence and statistics,  Red flag,  Natural healing,  Imaging,  Treatment strategies, and  Pain physiology. Participants had to rate the extent to which each message increased their confidence using a 5-point Likert scale. Messages were categorized into four levels of perceived confidence based on participants responses: high ([&ge;]80% rated the message as  provide confidence or  significantly provide confidence), moderate (60-79%), low (40-59%) and very low ([&le;]40%). Correlation and non-parametric analyses examined the relationships between confidence ratings, demographic variables and personality traits.

ResultsMessages that emphasized patient autonomy and the absence of red flags were perceived as particularly reassuring and received the highest ratings ([&ge;]80%). In contrast, messages that referred to natural healing and the neurophysiology of pain were perceived as less effective in providing confidence. Personality traits and background characteristics had minimal effects on perceived reassurance.

ConclusionsReassuring communication that emphasizes patient autonomy and the low likelihood of serious pathology can boost confidence in individuals with LBP and may be more impactful than patient-specific characteristics. These findings may help PTs refine their communication strategies and strengthen therapeutic relationships, potentially leading to better treatment outcomes. Future research should explore the implications of these findings in clinical settings in real-life interactions.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

However, cost and invasiveness preclude EGD in those who have no prior GERD symptoms, despite having other risk factors, representing missed opportunities for BE screening in individuals who account for approximately 40% of the patients who eventually develop esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).

AimThe aim of this study was to evaluate if non-endoscopic methods can enable BE detection in an at-risk population without GERD symptoms.

MethodsPatients presenting for colonoscopy who had not undergone previous EGD plus had [&ge;]3 BE risk factors (from among age >50 years, male sex, white race, smoking history, family history of BE/EAC, or central obesity) without chronic GERD symptoms were prospectively recruited for non-endoscopic screening. Trained nurses administered the EsoCheck (Lucid Diagnostics) encapsulated balloon. Samples were assayed with the EsoGuard BE detection methylated DNA marker panel (Lucid Diagnostics). Patients with a positive result were offered standard-of-care EGD, while patients with a negative EG result were offered free of cost research EGD. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and BE prevalence were calculated.

ResultsThe mean age of the 132 study subjects was 60.7 years, 129 (98%) were white, 124 (94%) were male, 71 (54%) had a prior smoking history, 46 (35%) were centrally obese, and 5 (4%) reported a family history. EsoCheck was successfully administered in 124 (94%) and the EsoGuard methylated DNA marker panel could be assayed in 120 (97%) of the samples. Thirty-four assays were positive of which 27 underwent a follow-up EGD and BE was identified in 9, PPV = 33% [17%, 54%] subjects. EGD was also performed in 22 of the 86 subjects whose assays were negative and none of them had BE, NPV = 100% [85%, 100%]. A logistic regression model fitted to impute the presence of BE estimated the PPV as 27% [13%, 44%], NPV as 98% [92%, 100%], and BE prevalence as 8.4% [4.5%, 14.3%].

ConclusionPatients without chronic GERD who have [&ge;]3 BE risk factors have a moderately high prevalence of BE. Non-endoscopic detection can effectively identify BE, enabling expansion of screening to this larger at-risk population. Those with a negative EG assay have a low likelihood of BE.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074

Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing.

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

Many recent studies have quantified their adverse events with a focus on gastrointestinal adverse events. However, no large epidemiologic study has investigated the risk of hair loss with these medications. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of hair loss. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone. The adjusted hazard ratio for hair loss for all patients using semaglutide, for men, and for women compared to bupropion-naltrexone were 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.86-2.69), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.05-14.49), and 2.08 (95% CI: 1.17-3.72) respectively.

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1746050922074
