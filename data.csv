Leveraging transcriptomics and proteomics imaging platforms, STAMP eliminates sequencing costs, to enable single-cell genomics from hundreds to millions of cells at an unprecedented low cost. Stamping cells in suspension onto imaging slides, STAMP supports single-modal (RNA or protein) and multimodal (RNA and protein) profiling and flexible, ultra-high-throughput formats. STAMP allows the analysis of a single or multiple samples within the same experiment, enhancing experimental flexibility, throughput and scale. We tested STAMP with diverse sample types, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), dissociated cancer cells and differentiated embryonic stem cell cultures, as well as whole cells and nuclei. Combining RNA and protein profiling, we applied immuno-phenotyping of millions of blood cells simultaneously. We also used STAMP to identify ultra-rare cell populations, simulating clinical applications to identify circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Performing in vitro differentiation studies, we further showed its potential for large-scale perturbation studies. Together, STAMP establishes a new standard for cost-effective, scalable single-cell analysis. Without the need for sequencing, STAMP makes high-resolution profiling more affordable and accessible. Designed to meet the needs of research labs, diagnostic cores and pharmaceutical companies, STAMP holds the promise to transform our capacity to map human biology, diagnose diseases and drug discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

How these GTPases are appropriately positioned at the opposite poles of a migrating cell is unknown. Here we leverage optogenetics, manipulation of cell mechanics, and mathematical modeling to reveal a surprising long-range mutual activation of the front and back polarity programs that complements their well-known local mutual inhibition. This long-range activation is rooted in two distinct modes of mechanochemical crosstalk. Local Rac-based protrusion stimulates Rho activation at the opposite side of the cell via membrane tension-based activation of mTORC2. Conversely, local Rho-based contraction induces cortical-flow-based remodeling of membrane-to-cortex interactions leading to PIP2 release, PIP3 generation, and Rac activation at the opposite side of the cell. We develop a minimal unifying mechanochemical model of the cell to explain how this long-range mechanical facilitation complements local biochemical inhibition to enable robust global Rho and Rac partitioning. Finally, we validate the importance of this long-range facilitation in the context of chemoattractant-based cell polarization and migration in primary human lymphocytes. Our findings demonstrate that the actin cortex and plasma membrane function as an integrated mechanochemical system for long-range partitioning of Rac and Rho during cell migration and likely other cellular contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

We successfully designed binders against a diverse set of challenging targets, including cell-surface receptors, common allergens, de novo designed proteins, and multi-domain nucleases, such as CRISPR-Cas9.

In prokaryotes and viruses, evolution favors keeping genes participating in the same biological processes co-localized as conserved gene clusters. Conversely, conservation of gene neighborhood indicates functional association. Spacedust is a tool for systematic, de novo discovery of conserved gene clusters. To find homologous protein matches it uses fast and sensitive structure comparison with Foldseek. Partially conserved clusters are detected using novel clustering and order conservation P-values. We demonstrate Spacedust's sensitivity with an all-vs-all analysis of 1308 bacterial genomes, identifying 72843 conserved gene clusters containing 58% of the 4.2 million genes. It recovered recover 95% of antiviral defense system clusters annotated by a specialized tool.

Vaccines must also elicit T cell responses recognizing the same peptide-MHC complexes presented by infected cells, and successful presentation of target human MHC-II peptides is currently challenging to evaluate and optimize. Here, we define antigenic targets for TB vaccine development by using mass spectrometry (MS) for proteome-wide discovery of Mtb epitopes presented on MHC-II by infected human cells.

Epidemiological investigations consistently demonstrate an overrepresentation of the elderly in COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatalities. Despite this, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms explaining how old age constitutes a critical risk factor remains elusive. To unravel this, we designed an animal study, juxtaposing the course of COVID-19 in young adults (2 months) and geriatric (15-22 months) mice. Both groups of K18(hACE2) mice were intranasally exposed to 500 TCID50 of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with a variety of outcomes assessed on days 3, 5, and 7 post-infections (DPI). Analyses included pulmonary cytokines, RNA, viral loads, lipidomic profiles, and histological assessments, with a concurrent evaluation of the percentage of mice reaching humane endpoints. The findings unveiled notable distinctions between the two groups, with aged mice exhibiting impaired viral clearance at 7 DPI, correlating with diminished survival rates together with an absence of weight loss recovery at 6-7 DPI. Additionally, elderly-infected mice exhibited a deficient Th1 response characterized by diminished productions of IFNg, CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL9 relative to younger mice. Furthermore, mass-spectrometry analysis of the lung lipidome indicated altered expression of several lipids with immunomodulatory and pro-resolution effects in aged mice such as Resolvin, HOTrEs, and NeuroP, but also DiHOMEs-related ARDS. Collectively, disease severity implies a dysregulation of the antiviral response in elderly-infected mice relative to younger mice, resulting in compromised viral clearance and a more unfavorable prognosis. This underscores the potential efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments for elderly subjects experiencing symptoms of severe COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

To successfully infect, colonize and complete their life cycle, plant pathogens are under constant selective pressures imposed by hosts, leading to genetic adaptation and possibly lineage radiation or speciation. Population and comparative genomics approaches are powerful tools to identify signatures of selection associated with host specialization in pathogen genomes and further allow recapturing population histories. Implementing such approaches, we identified evolutionary signatures of divergent host specialisation in distinct lineages of the fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici, a major disease causing-agent of wheat. Unique collections of Z. tritici were isolated from wild (Aegilops spp.) and domesticated (Triticum aestivum) host grasses in the Middle East and whole-genome sequencing was performed in a selected subset of isolates from each collection. We observed distinct population structure between the two host-diverging pathogens and identified particular genomic features in the Aegilops-infecting isolates that may have shaped their evolutionary history. Phylogenomic analyses revealed that A. cylindrica and A. tauchii -infecting populations of Z. tritici form separate clusters, possibly reflecting incipient speciation driven by divergent host specialization. Using infection experiments, we confirm that Z. tritici isolates collected from Aegilops spp. only infect their respective host species and not T. aestivum. Population genomics analyses and demographic inference furthermore allowed us to detect signatures of recent selection and show that divergence of the wheat-infecting lineage likely coincided with wheat domestication. At last, we confirm a virulence-related role for one candidate effector located in a selective sweep region of the A. cylindrica-infecting pathogen. Taken together, our findings highlight the interplay between agricultural and wild hosts on the evolution of fungal plant pathogens and illustrate host specialization as a possible route of rapid pathogen emergence.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Compared to chemical inducers, light-dependent control of gene expression by optogenetics achieves a higher spatial and temporal resolution. This could also prove decisive beyond basic research for manufacturing difficult-to-express proteins in pharmaceutical bioproduction. However, current optogenetic gene-expression systems limit this application in mammalian cells as expression levels and fold induction upon light stimulation are not sufficient. To overcome this limitation, we designed a photoswitch by fusing the blue light-activated light-oxygen-voltage receptor EL222 from Erythrobacter litoralis to the three tandem transcriptional activator domains VP64, p65, and Rta. The resultant photoswitch, dubbed DEL-VPR, allows an up to 400-fold induction of target gene expression by blue light, achieving expression levels that surpass those for strong constitutive promoters. Here, we utilized DEL-VPR to enable light-induced expression of complex monoclonal and bispecific antibodies with reduced byproduct expression, increasing the yield of functional protein complexes. Our approach offers temporally controlled yet strong gene expression and applies to both academic and industrial settings.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Using 887 ultraconserved element loci and Sanger-sequenced nuclear genes, we resolve the phylogenetic relationships of the three closest relatives of Percomorpha-the roughies, flashlightfishes, porcupinefishes and fangtooths (Trachichthyiformes), the squirrelfishes and soldierfishes (Holocentridae), and the whalefishes, bigscales, and alfonsinos (Berycoidei)-and the placement of percomorphs among them.

We report a case of a novel, idiosyncratic gesture in a Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus) at  La Foret des Singes, Rocamadour, France. One adult male, Jomanix, was observed hand-clapping. To our knowledge, hand-clapping has never been described before in this species. To hand-clap, the male briefly shifted his weight onto his legs, lifted his upper body, and clapped both hands together. We recorded 30 instances of hand-clapping. Twenty-five of these hand-claps occurred in combination with other agonistic signals, such as lunges and open mouth threats. Recipients either responded with counter-aggression (N = 9) or a submissive response (N = 16). In five of the 30 events, the context was unclear. These observations suggest that the gesture constitutes an agonistic signal. According to the staff at  La Foret des Singes, the hand-clapping may have been copied from staff members who occasionally hand-clap to shoo the animals away from areas where they were not supposed to be, but that notion remains speculative. In the meantime, another subject from the same group reportedly started to hand-clap, but the subject had passed away before we could document the behaviour. The observations show that Jomanix can flexibly combine a novel gesture with other established communicative signals. The hand-clap is goal-directed and fulfils the criteria for first-order intentional communication. This case, as well as anecdotal reports from a Tonkean macaque (Macaca tonkeana) hand-clapping to get attention, reveals greater flexibility in the gestural communication of this genus than previously assumed but also underscores that social learning of the production of communicative gestures occurs rarely in this taxon.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Some of these recruited cells remain within the lung following infection and contribute to enhanced viral control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells can also display long-term changes following infection or insults. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection and find that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes associated with communication with T cells. Lung epithelial cells from IAV-infected mice display functional changes by more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naive animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection.

In the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, for example, eight bilaterally positioned gastric segments are generated by the action of a group of Hox-Gbx genes in the developing larval endo-mesoderm. Still, given the range of segment numbers observed in different anthozoans, it remains unclear whether this Hox-Gbx module is evolutionarily conserved and how it might be deployed to generate different numbers of segments. Here, we systematically interrogate the role of Hox-Gbx genes during development of the rice coral Montipora capitata. We first characterize the temporal sequence of segmentation in M. capitata juveniles and then combine transcriptomic profiling and in situ hybridization to identify three conserved homeobox-containing genes, McAnthox8, McAnthox6a.1 and McGbx, which are collectively expressed in the developing endo-mesoderm prior to and during segment formation. The expression boundaries of these genes prefigure the positions of the first six segment boundaries, similar to their Nematostella homologs. Further, we show that chemical inhibition of BMP activity at the planula stage abolishes the expression of Hox-Gbx genes, leading to the formation of an unsegmented gastric cavity. These findings demonstrate the existence of a functionally conserved Hox-Gbx module in evolutionarily divergent anthozoan species, suggesting that the last common ancestor of all anthozoans likely utilized a similar genetic toolkit to axially pattern the endo-mesoderm into metameric subunits.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

We investigated the genetic diversity of cassava and identifed new sources of resistance to the viruses causing cassava brown streak disease. The cassava line, COL40, from a South American germplasm collection showed broad-spectrum resistance against all known strains of the viruses that cause this disease. To further understand the genetic basis of this resistance, we sequenced the genome of COL40 and produced a high-quality, haplotype-resolved genome assembly. This genomic resource provides new insights into cassavas genetic architecture, particularly in regions associated with disease resistance. The sequence reveals significant structural variation, including transposable elements, inversions, and deletions, which may contribute to the resistance phenotype. The reference genome assembly presented here will provide a valuable genomic resource for studying the cassava brown streak resistance and will help in accelerating breeding efforts to introduce virus resistance into African cassava varieties. By identifying genetic variants linked to resistance, future breeding programs can develop cassava cultivars that are more resilient to viral threats, enhancing food security and livelihoods for smallholder farmers across regions affected by the disease.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Unlike other blood cells, megakaryocytes do not fully enter the bloodstream, but instead extend cytoplasmic protrusions through the sinusoidal barrier, which fragment into circulating platelets. How the extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates the balance between being both resident in the bone marrow and in the bloodstream is still unknown in vivo. Here, we address the spatial organisation and functional role of ECM components in the megakaryocyte vascular niche. We reveal that laminin and collagen IV form three-dimensional (3D) cage of ECM connected to the sinusoidal basement membrane that surrounds the individual megakaryocytes. The 3D cages of ECM are controlled by megakaryocytes since megakaryocyte-specific {beta}1/{beta}3 integrin knock-out (Itgb1-/-/Itgb3-/-) is characterised by weakened ECM cages. This is associated with an increased megakaryocyte intravasation and the passage of entire megakaryocytes into the circulation. The inhibition of ECM degradation induces the formation of denser cages, and results in dysplastic megakaryocytes with defective formation of the demarcation membrane system (DMS). Therefore, the 3D ECM cage stabilizes megakaryocytes within their vascular niche to orchestrate their maturation and intravasation capabilities, and underscores the crucial role of a specific ECM microarchitecture in megakaryocyte functions.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Some bacterial and archaeal proteins include selenocysteine or pyrrolysine, the 21st and 22nd amino acids, but no evidence establishes the adoption of a genetic code in which a stop codon universally encodes either amino acid. Here, we used proteomics to confirm the prediction that certain Archaea consistently incorporate pyrrolysine at TAG codons, supporting a new archaeal genetic code which we designate Genetic Code 34. This genetic code has 62 sense codons encoding 21 amino acids, and only two stop codons. In contrast with monophyletic genetic code distributions in bacteria, Code 34 occurs sporadically. This, combined with evidence for lateral gene transfer of the code change machinery and anticipated barriers to code reversal, suggests Code 34 arose independently in multiple lineages. TAG codon distribution patterns in Code 34 genomes imply a wide range in time since code switch. We identified many new enzymes containing Pyl residues, raising questions about potential roles of this amino acid in protein structure and function.

PC states that the brain computes internal models of expected events and responds robustly to unexpected stimuli with prediction errors that feed forward. This can be studied using oddball tasks. A repetitive sequence interrupted by a novel stimulus is a ""local"" oddball. ""Global"" oddballs defy expectations while repeating the local context. This dissociates expectation-driven neuronal prediction error responses vs. merely stimulus-history-driven release from adaptation. We recorded neuron spiking activity across the visual hierarchy in mice and monkeys viewing these oddballs. Local oddball responses largely followed PC hypotheses. They were robust, emerged early in layers 2/3, and fed forward. Global oddball responses challenged PC. They were weak, absent in most visual areas, more robust in prefrontal cortex, and emerged in non-granular layers. Contrary to the most popular PC models that emphasize prediction error computations occurring in early sensory areas and feeding forward, this implies that genuine predictive coding computations take place in more cognitive, higher-order areas.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Both rhythmic and broadband processes contribute to the neural power spectrum, which decomposes the variance of a neural recording across frequencies. Although an extensive body of literature has successfully studied rhythms in various diseases and brain states, researchers only recently have systematically studied the characteristics of broadband effects in the power spectrum. Broadband effects can generally be categorized as 1) shifts in power across all frequencies, which correlate with changes in local firing rates and 2) changes in the overall shape of the power spectrum, such as the spectral slope or power law exponent. Shape changes are evident in various conditions and brain states, influenced by factors such as excitation to inhibition balance, age, and various diseases. It is increasingly recognized that broadband and rhythmic effects can interact on a sub-second timescale. For example, broadband power is time-locked to the phase of <1 Hz rhythms in propofol induced unconsciousness. Modeling tools that explicitly deal with both rhythmic and broadband contributors to the power spectrum and that capture their interactions are essential to help improve the interpretability of power spectral effects. Here, we introduce a tractable stochastic forward modeling framework designed to capture both narrowband and broadband spectral effects when prior knowledge or theory about the primary biophysical processes involved is available. Population-level neural recordings are modeled as the sum of filtered point processes (FPPs), each representing the contribution of a different biophysical process such as action potentials or postsynaptic potentials of different types. Our approach builds on prior neuroscience FPP work by allowing multiple interacting processes and time-varying firing rates and by deriving theoretical power spectra and cross-spectra. We demonstrate several properties of the models, including that they divide the power spectrum into frequency ranges dominated by rhythmic and broadband effects, and that they can capture spectral effects across multiple timescales, including sub-second cross-frequency coupling. The framework can be used to interpret empirically observed power spectra and cross-frequency coupling effects in biophysical terms, which bridges the gap between theoretical models and experimental results.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

In this paper we present a novel approach for dynamic modeling of the evolution of chronic disease risks over time, incorporating individual genetic predispositions. Our approach uses a hierarchical Bayesian topic model including Gaussian Processes to capture age effects. It accounts for genetic predisposition through a time-warping function and topic-dependent genetic scores, enabling both simultaneous learning and updated predictions of complex comorbidity patterns, inclusive of genomic and non-genomic effects. We systematically compare to previous approaches and provide detailed simulations at https://bookdown.org/sarahmurbut/dynamic_ehr/ and https://surbut.shinyapps.io/dynamic_ehr.

Impact StatementOur model significantly advances healthcare for aging populations by facilitating the early identification of high-risk individuals through the analysis of their unique disease trajectories within complex comorbidity patterns. Existing models are limited in their capacity to manage diverse comorbidity patterns, particularly those that are time-dependent. We introduce an approach leveraging Bayesian hierarchical modeling to concurrently learn population-level patterns and provide updated real-time predictions across 350 diseases, thereby uncovering and forecasting intricate comorbidity patterns. This methodology paves the way for preventive measures and targeted interventions that enhance health outcomes, mitigate late-stage disease burdens, and foster healthier aging. Furthermore, our model incorporates genetic influences via a genetic predisposition parameter to estimate the lifetime risk of specific diseases and disorders, alongside a time-warping function to facilitate personalized predictions of disease trajectories.","NA","medrxiv",1728079786478

However, current transcriptomic profiling technologies result in destruction of the biological sample, preventing direct analysis of transcriptional dynamics in the same living cells over time. Here, we developed a synthetic RNA export system called cellular 'self-reporting' to address this fundamental technological limitation. We repurposed the murine leukemia virus retroviral protein Gag to enable diverse types of immortalized and primary mammalian cells to package cellular RNA molecules in virus-like particles (VLPs) for export into the extracellular environment. We applied self-reporting to interrogate the transcriptome-wide dynamics that occur during neuronal differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells and detected gene expression profiles from individual live cells. Leveraging this genetically encodable approach, we expanded the capabilities of self-reporting through molecular engineering of VLP components. Pseudotyping VLPs with epitope-tagged envelope proteins enabled multiplexed selective live-cell readout of transcriptional states from heterogeneous co-cultures. Furthermore, structure-guided protein engineering of Gag fusions with human RNA binding domains improved the mRNA representation in self-reporting readouts and enabled the directed export of libraries of synthetic barcode transcripts. Taken together, this work establishes self-reporting as a facile and broadly enabling technology for live-cell, transcriptome-scale profiling of dynamic processes across diverse cell types and biological applications.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Here, we leveraged broad phenotypic data from a large cohort with matched genetics to characterize classes of autism and their patterns of core, associated, and co-occurring traits, ultimately demonstrating that phenotypic patterns are associated with distinct genetic and molecular programs. We used a generative mixture modeling approach to identify robust, clinically-relevant classes of autism which we validate and replicate in a large independent cohort. We link the phenotypic findings to distinct patterns of de novo and inherited variation which emerge from the deconvolution of these genetic signals, and demonstrate that class-specific common variant scores strongly align with clinical outcomes. We further provide insights into the distinct biological pathways and processes disrupted by the sets of mutations in each class. Remarkably, we discover class-specific differences in the developmental timing of genes that are dysregulated, and these temporal patterns correspond to clinical milestone and outcome differences between the classes.

These diseases, if left untreated, can be lethal within hours. Hyperinvasive N. meningitidis strains often express a genomically encoded filamentous bacteriophage called MDA{varphi}, which promotes colonisation of mucosal host surfaces to facilitate invasion. How this phage is organised and how it promotes biofilm formation and infection at the molecular level is unclear. Here, we present an electron cryomicroscopy structure of the MDA phage, showing that MDA{varphi} is a class I filamentous inovirus, with the major capsid protein arranged within the phage as a highly curved and densely packed -helix. Comparison with other filamentous bacteriophages offers clues about inoviral genome encapsidation mechanisms, providing a framework for understanding the evolutionary diversity of inoviruses. A disordered, N-terminal segment in the major capsid protein presents hydrophobic patches on the surface of assembled phage particles, which, together with electron cryotomography data of phage bundles, furnishes a structural rationale for phage-phage interactions that were seen previously in an epithelium adhesion infection model of N. meningitidis.

Canopy architecture is determined by several component traits, including leaf length, width, number, angle, and phyllotaxy. Phyllotaxy may be among the most difficult of the leaf canopy traits to measure accurately across large numbers of individual plants. As a result, in simulations of the leaf canopies of grain crops such as maize and sorghum, this trait is frequently approximated as alternating 180{degrees} angles between sequential leaves. We explore the feasibility of extracting direct measurements of the phyllotaxy of sequential leaves from 3D reconstructions of individual sorghum plants generated from 2D calibrated images and test the assumption of consistently alternating phyllotaxy across a diverse set of sorghum genotypes. Using a voxel-carving-based approach, we generate 3D reconstructions from multiple calibrated 2D images of 366 sorghum plants representing 236 sorghum genotypes from the sorghum association panel. The correlation between automated and manual measurements of phyllotaxy is only modestly lower than the correlation between manual measurements of phyllotaxy generated by two different individuals. Automated phyllotaxy measurements exhibited a repeatability of R2 = 0.41 across imaging timepoints separated by a period of two days. A resampling based genome wide association study (GWAS) identified several putative genetic associations with lower-canopy phyllotaxy in sorghum. This study demonstrates the potential of 3D reconstruction to enable both quantitative genetic investigation and breeding for phyllotaxy in sorghum and other grain crops with similar plant architectures.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Understanding fundamental changes in the healthy immune system that occur over a lifespan is critical in developing interventions for age-related susceptibility to infections and diseases. Here, we use multi-omic profiling (scRNA-seq, proteomics, flow cytometry) to examined human peripheral immunity in over 300 healthy adults, with 96 young and older adults followed over two years with yearly vaccination. The resulting resource includes scRNA-seq datasets of >16 million PBMCs, interrogating 71 immune cell subsets from our new Immune Health Atlas. This study allows unique insights into the composition and transcriptional state of immune cells at homeostasis, with vaccine perturbation, and across age. We find that T cells specifically accumulate age-related transcriptional changes more than other immune cells, independent from inflammation and chronic perturbation. Moreover, impaired memory B cell responses to vaccination are linked to a Th2-like state shift in older adults memory CD4 T cells, revealing possible mechanisms of immune dysregulation during healthy human aging. This extensive resource is provided with a suite of exploration tools at https://apps.allenimmunology.org/aifi/insights/dynamics-imm-health-age/ to enhance data accessibility and further the understanding of immune health across age.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Despite the essential nature of proprioceptive signaling in daily life, the mechanisms governing proprioceptor activity are poorly understood. Here, we have identified distinct and nonredundant roles for two voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs), NaV1.1 and NaV1.6, in mammalian proprioception. Deletion of NaV1.6 in somatosensory neurons (NaV1.6cKO mice) causes severe motor deficits accompanied by complete loss of proprioceptive transmission, which contrasts with our previous findings using similar mouse models to target NaV1.1 (NaV1.1cKO). In NaV1.6cKO animals, loss of proprioceptive feedback caused non-cell- autonomous impairments in proprioceptor end-organs and skeletal muscle that were absent in NaV1.1cKO mice. We attribute the differential contribution of NaV1.1 and NaV1.6 in proprioceptor function to distinct cellular localization patterns. Collectively, these data provide the first evidence that NaV subtypes uniquely shape neurotransmission within a somatosensory modality.

Ancient protein families have been found to share common themes and proteins reduced in composition to prebiotically plausible amino acids have been reported capable of structure formation and key functions, such as binding to RNA. While this may suggest peptide relevance in early life, their functional repertoire when composed of a limited number of early residues (missing some of the most sophisticated functional groups of todays alphabet) has been debated.

Cofactors enrich the functional scope of about half of extant enzymes but whether they could also bind to peptides lacking the evolutionary late amino acids remains speculative. The aim of this study was to resolve the early peptide propensity to bind organic cofactors by analysis of protein-coenzyme interactions across the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We find that the prebiotically plausible amino acids are more abundant in the binding sites of the most ancient coenzymes and that such interactions rely more frequently on the involvement of the protein backbone atoms and metal ion cofactors. Moreover, we have identified a few select examples in todays enzymes where coenzyme binding is supported solely by prebiotically available amino acids. These results imply the plausibility of a coenzyme-peptide functional collaboration preceding the establishment of the Central Dogma and full protein alphabet evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Automated segmentation of brainstem arousal nuclei is an essential step toward elucidating the physiology of arousal in human consciousness and the pathophysiology of disorders of consciousness. We created a probabilistic atlas of brainstem arousal nuclei built on diffusion MRI scans of five ex vivo human brain specimens scanned at 750 m isotropic resolution. Labels of arousal nuclei used to generate the probabilistic atlas were manually annotated with reference to nucleus-specific immunostaining in two of the five brain specimens. We then developed a Bayesian segmentation algorithm that utilizes the probabilistic atlas as a generative model and automatically identifies brainstem arousal nuclei in a resolution- and contrast-agnostic manner. The segmentation method displayed high accuracy in both healthy and lesioned in vivo T1 MRI scans and high test-retest reliability across both T1 and T2 MRI contrasts.

To uncover the molecular determinants of high-efficiency editing, we conducted biochemical, biophysical and cell-based assays on S. pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9) variants with wide-ranging genome editing efficiencies that differ in PAM binding specificity. Our results show that reduced PAM specificity causes persistent non-selective DNA binding and recurrent failures to engage the target sequence through stable guide RNA hybridization, leading to reduced genome editing efficiency in cells. These findings reveal a fundamental trade-off between broad PAM recognition and genome editing effectiveness. We propose that high-efficiency RNA-guided genome editing relies on an optimized two-step target capture process, where selective but low-affinity PAM binding precedes rapid DNA unwinding. This model provides a foundation for engineering more effective CRISPR-Cas and related RNA-guided genome editors.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

We discovered lysosomes clogged with both Tau and phosphorylated Tau, stalled lysosome motility, disrupted molecular motors, enhanced autophagic flux, and slowed cargo degradation in mutant Tau neurons. Treatment of mutant Tau neurons with a small molecule autophagy enhancer drug increases autophagic flux and cargo degradation, reduces phospho-Tau levels, and reduces Tau accumulation in lysosomes without restoring defects in lysosomal motility.

This process helps individuals establish what they themselves, as opposed to others, control and what consequence they themselves cause or that another person causes. People identify when active disambiguation is needed and engage in it at that time. A pattern of activity in the supramarginal gyrus that emerges during and after active disambiguation is linked to establishing controllability and tracking the outcomes from which control is inferred.

We aim to predict the circumstances in which pLMs can successfully perform zero-shot fitness estimation. Our work studies trends observed over hundreds of deep mutational scans across multiple different fitness objectives. We find that the likelihood, or abstractly, implicit preference of a certain protein sequence imbued during pretraining is predictive of fitness prediction capabilities. Both over-preferred and under-preferred wild type sequences harm performance. Using influence functions to causally understand how individual data points increase protein likelihoods, we find that there exists a power law tail due to sequence homology. Lastly, under-performance on low likelihood wild type proteins can be remedied by unsupervised finetuning. These findings that pLM zero-shot fitness estimation can be predicted by the likelihood of the engineered sequence can motivate and improve pLMs' deployment in protein maturation campaigns.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Here, we provide the most comprehensive study to date on the evolution of the opsin gene family in the largest class of vertebrate, fishes, with a particular focus on the understudied non visual opsins. Based on an in depth analysis of 535 high quality genomes, we document great variation in gene numbers in the different opsin gene subfamilies across ray finned fishes and show that visual opsins are more prone to duplications and losses than non visual opsins. We provide compelling evidence that visual and non visual opsins coevolve in ray finned fishes, both in terms of copy numbers and selective pressures acting on their coding sequences, probably in response to the different photic environments they inhabit. Species that live in dim light or all in the dark (such as in caves or the deep sea) convergently reduced their visual and non visual opsin gene repertoires, while polar species feature accelerated evolution in both. Fishes that rely on electroreception show a reduction in the number of visual and non visual opsin genes and accelerated evolution of the remaining genes. We further found that genes of the phototransduction cascade coevolve with opsins. Finally, that non visual opsins are mainly expressed in testes and ovaries (next to the eyes) supports a function in gamete biology.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

We identify hundreds of genes that exhibit dynamic allelic imbalances during cortical neurogenesis, providing the first insight into the developmental mechanisms underpinning changes in cortical structure and function between mouse strains. These experimental methods and cellular resources represent a powerful new platform for investigating mechanisms of gene regulation in the developing cerebral cortex.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

In this study, we developed a method to predict whether two proteins catalyze the same enzymatic reaction by analyzing sequence and structural similarities, utilizing structural models predicted by AlphaFold2. We performed pocket detection and domain decomposition for each structural model. The similarity between protein pairs was assessed using features such as full-length sequence similarity, domain structural similarity, and pocket similarity. We developed several models using conventional machine learning algorithms and found that the LightGBM-based model outperformed the models. Our method also surpassed existing approaches, including those based solely on full-length sequence similarity and state-of-the-art deep learning models. Feature importance analysis revealed that domain sequence identity, calculated through structural alignment, had the greatest influence on the prediction. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that integrating sequence and structural information improves the accuracy of protein function prediction.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

We discover that the gp5.9 protein of bacteriophage T7 blocks this capture site by DNA mimicry, thereby preventing DNA loading and inactivating MukBEF. We propose a comprehensive and unidirectional loading mechanism in which DNA is first captured at the complex's periphery and then ingested through the DNA entry gate, powered by a single cycle of ATP hydrolysis. These findings illuminate a fundamental aspect of how ubiquitous DNA organizers are primed for genome maintenance and demonstrate how this process can be disrupted by viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Combining human genomics with behavioral and mechanistic studies in fish and flies, we uncover a role for beat-Ia/CADM2, synaptic adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily, in excessive sleepiness. Neuronal knockdown of Drosophila beat-Ia results in sleepy flies and loss of the vertebrate ortholog of beat-Ia, CADM2, results in sleepy fish. We delineate a developmental function for beat-Ia in synaptic elaboration of neuropeptide F (NPF) neurites projecting to the suboesophageal zone (SEZ) of the fly brain. Brain connectome and experimental evidence demonstrate these NPF outputs synapse onto a subpopulation of SEZ GABAergic neurons to stabilize arousal.

Among eukaryotes, BGCs are most common in plants and fungi, where they ensure the co-expression of enzymes and transcriptional regulators that coordinate the biosynthesis of specialised metabolites. Here, we report on a newly identified withanolide BGC in Physalis grisea (ground-cherry), a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). A combination of transcriptomic, epigenomic and metabolic analyses, revealed that, following a duplication event, this BGC evolved two tissue-specifically expressed sub-clusters, containing eight pairs of paralogs that contribute to related but distinct biochemical processes; this sub-functionalisation is tightly associated with with epigenetic features and the local chromatin environment. The two sub-clusters appear strictly isolated from each other at the chromatin structural level, each forming a highly self-interacting chromatin domain with tissue-dependent levels of condensation. This correlates with gene expression exclusively in either above- or below-ground tissue, thus spatially separating the production of different withanolide compounds. By comparative phylogenomic analysis, we show that the withanolide BGC most likely evolved before the diversification of the Solanaceae family and underwent lineage-specific diversifications and losses. The tissue-specific sub-functionalisation is common to species of the Physalideae tribe but distinct from other, independent duplication events outside of this clade. In sum, our study reports on the first instance of an epigenetically modulated sub-functionalisation within a BGC and sheds light on the biosynthesis of withanolides, a highly diverse group of steroidal triterpenoids that play a role in plant defence and are amenable to pharmaceutical applications due to their anti-inflammatory, antibiotic and anti-cancer properties.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Existing clinical testing for BV is primarily based upon physical and microscopic examination of vaginal secretions, while more modern PCR-based clinical tests target panels of BV-associated microbes, such as the Labcorp NuSwab test. Remnant clinician-collected NuSwab vaginal swabs underwent DNA extraction and 16S V3-V4 rRNA gene sequencing to profile microbes in addition to those included in the Labcorp NuSwab test. Community State Types (CSTs) were determined using the most abundant taxon detected in each sample. PCR results for NuSwab panel microbial targets were compared against the corresponding microbiome profiles. Metabolic pathway abundances were characterized via metagenomic prediction from amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Sequencing of 75 remnant vaginal swabs yielded 492 unique 16S V3-V4 ASVs, identifying 83 unique genera. NuSwab assay microbe quantification was strongly concordant with quantification by sequencing (p << 0.01). Samples in CST-I (18 of 18, 100%), CST-II (3 of 3, 100%), CST-III (15 of 17, 88%), and CST-V (1 of 1, 100%) were largely categorized as BV-negative via the NuSwab panel, while most CST-IV samples (28 of 36, 78%) were BV-positive or BV-indeterminate. BV-associated microbial and predicted metabolic signatures were shared across multiple CSTs. These findings show that 16S V3-V4 rRNA gene sequencing robustly reproduces PCR-based BV diagnostic testing results, accurately discriminates vaginal microbiome CSTs dominated by distinct Lactobacilli, and further elucidates BV-associated bacterial and metabolic signatures.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

The key to improve patient outcomes in modern clinical cancer research is to gain insights into dynamics underlying cancer evolution in order to facilitate the search for effective therapies. However, most cancer data analysis tools are designed for controlled trials and cannot leverage routine clinical data, which are available in far greater quantities. In addition, many cancer models focus on single disease processes in isolation, disregarding interaction This work proposes a unified stochastic modelling framework for cancer progression that combines (stochastic) processes for tumour growth, metastatic seeding, and patient survival to provide a comprehensive understanding of cancer progression. In addition, our models aim to use non-equidistantly sampled data collected in clinical routine to analyse the whole patient trajectory over the course of the disease. The model formulation features closed-form expressions of the likelihood functions for parameter inference from clinical data. The efficacy of our model approach is demonstrated through a simulation study involving four exemplary models, which utilise both analytic and numerical likelihoods. The results of the simulation studies demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the analytic likelihood formulations. We found that estimation can retrieve the correct model parameters and reveal the underlying data dynamics, and that this modelling framework is flexible in choosing the precise parameterisation.

Here, we introduce the largest collection of ancient Portuguese genomic datasets (n = 68) to date, spanning 5,000 years, from the Neolithic to the 19th century.

ResultsWe found evidence of patrilocality in Neolithic Portugal, with admixture from local hunter-gatherers and Anatolian farmers, and persistence of Upper Paleolithic Magdalenian ancestry. This genetic profile persists into the Chalcolithic, reflecting diverse local hunter- gatherer contributions. During the Bronze Age, local genetic ancestry persisted, particularly in southern Iberia, despite influences from the North Pontic Steppe and early Mediterranean contacts. The Roman period highlights Idanha-a-Velha as a hub of migration and interaction, with a notably diverse genetic profile. The Early Medieval period is marked by Central European ancestry linked to Suebi/Visigoth migrations, adding to coeval local, African, and Mediterranean influences. The Islamic and Christian Conquest periods show strong genetic continuity in northern Portugal and significant African admixture in the south, with persistent Jewish and Islamic ancestries suggesting enduring influences in the post-Islamic period.

ConclusionsThis study represents the first attempt to reconstruct the genetic history of Portugal from the analysis of ancient individuals. We reveal dynamic patterns of migration and cultural exchange across millennia, but also the persistence of local ancestries. Our findings integrate genetic information with historical and archaeological data, enhancing our understanding of Iberias ancient heritage.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Our case study centers on the epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases. We develop an efficient algorithm to train our proposed KAN-UDE models using time series data generated by traditional SIR models. Compared to the UDE based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), training KAN-UDE models shows significantly improves fitting performance in terms of the accuracy, as evidenced by a rapid and substantial reduction in the loss. Additionally, using KAN, we accurately reconstruct the nonlinear functions represented by neural networks in the KAN-UDE models across four distinct models with varying incidence rates, which is robustness in terms of using a subset of time series data to train the model. This approach enables an interpretable learning process, as KAN-UDE models were reconstructed to fully mechanistic models (RMMs). While KAN-UDE models perform well in short-term prediction when trained on a subset of the data, they exhibit lower robustness and accuracy when real-world data randomness is considered. In contrast, RMMs predict epidemic trends robustly and with high accuracy over much longer time windows (i.e., long-term prediction), as KAN precisely reconstructs the mechanistic functions despite data randomness. This highlights the importance of interpretable learning in reconstructing the mechanistic forms of complex functions. Although our validation focused on the transmission dynamics of emerging infectious diseases, the promising results suggest that KAN-UDEs have broad applicability across various fields.","NA","medrxiv",1728079786478

However, interpreting such data with mechanistic computational models is hindered because direct model/data comparison is often muddled. We developed an algorithm that tracks simulated division and death events in mechanistically detailed single-cell lineages to enable such a model/data comparison and suggest causes of cell-cell drug response variability. Using our previously developed model of mammalian single-cell proliferation and death signaling, we simulated drug dose response experiments for four targeted anti-cancer drugs (alpelisib, neratinib, trametinib and palbociclib) and compared them to experimental data. Simulations are consistent with data for strong growth inhibition by trametinib (MEK inhibitor) and overall lack of efficacy for alpelisib (PI-3K inhibitor), but are inconsistent with data for palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) and neratinib (EGFR inhibitor). Model/data inconsistencies suggest (i) the importance of CDK4/6 for driving the cell cycle may be overestimated, and (ii) that the cellular balance between basal (tonic) and ligand-induced signaling is a critical determinant of receptor inhibitor response. Simulations show subpopulations of rapidly and slowly dividing cells in both control and drug-treated conditions. Variations in mother cells prior to drug treatment all impinging on ERK pathway activity are associated with the rapidly dividing phenotype and trametinib resistance.

We compare our method to the widely used quantitative fluorescence approach and find that it underestimates the partition factor into condensates at least two-fold for FUS and PGL-3. The accessibility of our method opens the possibility for the thermodynamic assessment of entire protein families, generating sufficient quantitative data for testing theory, and for the screening of drugs in pharmaceutical research.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

One prominent exception is the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) which is remarkably adapted to withstand prolonged periods (~18 mins) of severe hypoxia, a trait likely driven by its crowded underground lifestyle. Other African mole-rat species are less social or entirely solitary like the Cape mole-rat (Georychus capensis). Here, we asked whether cellular and molecular adaptations to hypoxia map to social traits. We discovered that at the cellular level naked mole-rat fibroblasts survive >30 hours in 1% oxygen, while fibroblasts from terrestrial or non-social mole-rat species (human, mouse and Cape mole-rat) die rapidly under hypoxic conditions. We further show that naked mole-rat mitochondria have evolved morphological, functional and proteomic adaptations crucial for hypoxia resistance, remaining unaffected after long periods of severe hypoxia. We identify the mitochondrial protein Optic Atrophy 1 (OPA1) as a key player in naked mole-rat hypoxia resilience. Naked mole-rat mitochondria not only express more protective forms of OPA1, but also harbor a structurally unique isoform that likely protects cells from hypoxic damage. We show that evolutionary changes including the functionalization of a unique Opa1 exon support mitochondrial mediated cellular protection. Indeed, knockdown of OPA1 in naked mole-rat cells is sufficient to render them equally susceptible to hypoxia as human cells or cells from non-social African species. Our study demonstrates how molecular evolution drives unique adaptations that enable cells to achieve unprecedented resistance to hypoxic damage. We also show that molecular changes at the level of mitochondria are crucial in conferring hypoxia resistance. Our results thus chart a novel molecular path to understand how robust cellular hypoxia resistance can be achieved. Such knowledge may eventually inspire novel strategies to circumvent the consequences of hypoxic-damage in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

By its nature, this text is flexible and inconsistent, making it challenging to use for clinical trial matching, decision support, and predictive modeling. In this study, we develop and assess text normalization pipelines built using large-language models. Materials and Methods: Here, we evaluated four LLM-based normalization strategies: Zero-Shot Recall, Prompt Recall, Semantic Search, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and one baseline, TF-IDF based String Matching. We compared normalization performance across two datasets of condition terms mapped to SNOMED, one tailored to oncology, and one covering a wide range of medical conditions. Additionally, we benchmarked our models against the TAC 2017 drug label annotations, which normalizes terms to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Preferred Terms. Results: RAG, which effectively combines Prompt Recall and Semantic Search, was the most effective, accurately identifying the correct term 88.31% of the time for the domain-specific dataset and 79.97% for the broader dataset. Our model achieved a micro F1 score of 88.01 on task 4 of the TAC2017 conference, surpassing all other models without relying on the provided training data. Discussion: These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs in medical text normalization. We find that retrieval-focused approaches overcome traditional LLM limitations for this task. Conclusion: Large language models combined with retrieval-augmented generation should be explored for text normalization of biomedical free text.","NA","medrxiv",1728079786478

We measured COVID-19 VE against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic infection in HCWs in the country of Georgia from January - June 2022, during a period of Omicron circulation.

MethodsWe conducted a cohort study of HCWs in six hospitals in Georgia. HCWs were enrolled in early 2021. Participants completed weekly symptom questionnaires. Symptomatic HCWs were tested by RT-PCR and/or rapid antigen test (RAT). Participants were also routinely tested, at varying frequencies during the study period, for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or RAT, regardless of symptoms. Serology was collected quarterly throughout the study and tested by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We estimated absolute and relative VE of a first booster dose compared to a primary vaccine series as (1-hazard ratio)*100 using Cox proportional hazards models.

ResultsAmong 1253 HCWs, 141 (11%) received a primary vaccine series (PVS) and a first booster, 855 (68%) received PVS only, and 248 (20%) were unvaccinated. Most boosters were BNT162b2 (Comirnaty original monovalent) vaccine (90%) and BIBP-CorV vaccine (Sinopharm) (9%). Most PVS were BNT162b2 vaccine (68%) and BIBP-CorV vaccine (24%). Absolute VE for a first booster was 40% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -56 - 77) at 7- 29 days following vaccination, -9% (95% CI -104 - 42) at 30 - 59 days, and - 46% (95% CI -156 - 17) at [&ge;] 60 days. Relative VE of first booster dose compared to PVS was 58% (95% CI 1 - 82) at 7- 29 days following vaccination, 21% (95% CI -33 - 54) at 30 - 59 days, and -9% (95% CI -82 - 34) at [&ge;] 60 days.

ConclusionIn Georgia, first booster dose VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs was moderately effective but waned very quickly during Omicron. Increased efforts to vaccinate priority groups in Georgia, such as healthcare workers, prior to periods of anticipated high COVID-19 incidence are essential.","NA","medrxiv",1728079786478

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

To answer this question, we focused on motion parallax, a depth cue relying on visual motion resulting from movement of the observer. As neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) are broadly modulated by locomotion, we hypothesized that they may integrate vision- and locomotion-related signals to estimate depth from motion parallax. Using recordings in a three-dimensional virtual reality environment, we found that conjunctive coding of visual and self-motion speeds gave rise to depth-selective neuronal responses. Depth-selective neurons could be characterized by three-dimensional receptive fields, responding to specific virtual depths and retinotopic locations. Neurons tuned to a broad range of virtual depths were found across all sampled retinotopic locations, showing that motion parallax generates a depth map of visual space in V1.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Longer-lived mammals tend to gain fewer noisy CpGs with age, irrespective of whether these originate from hyper- or hypomethylation processes.

Despite their importance, the mechanisms underlying leukocyte and tumor cell extravasation remain incompletely understood. Here, we developed an imaging pipeline that integrates fast, label-free live-cell imaging with deep learning-based image analysis to quantitatively track and compare the initial steps of extravasation--cell landing and arrest on an endothelial monolayer--under physiological flow conditions. We find that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells exhibit variable adhesion strength and flow sensitivity. Remarkably, some PDAC cells demonstrate comparable endothelial engagement as leukocytes, preferentially arresting at endothelial junctions, potentially due to increased stiffness at these sites, which leads to exposure to the underlying basal extracellular matrix. PDAC cells also tend to cluster in regions with high, heterogeneous expression of the endothelial CD44 receptor. Simulations suggest that clustering results from the combination of CD44-mediated attachment and localized flow disturbances that facilitate subsequent cell attachment. Targeting CD44 using siRNA or function-blocking antibodies, or degrading its ligand hyaluronic acid (HA), almost completely abolishes PDAC cell attachment. Overall, we demonstrate that cancer and immune cells share both common and unique features in endothelial adhesion under flow, and identify CD44 and HA as key mediators of PDAC cell arrest.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

The gut microbiome enables protection against diverse pathogens and exhibits dysbiosis during infectious and autoimmune disease. Studies based in the United States and China have found that severe COVID-19 cases have altered gut microbiome composition when compared to mild COVID-19 cases. We present the first study to investigate the gut microbiome composition of COVID-19 cases in a population from Sub-Saharan Africa. Given the impact of geography and cultural traditions on microbiome composition, it is important to investigate the microbiome globally and not draw broad conclusions from homogenous populations.

ResultsWe used stool samples in a Ugandan biobank collected from COVID-19 cases during 2020-2022. We profiled the gut microbiomes of 114 symptomatic individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 along with 76 household contacts who did not present any symptoms of COVID-19. The inclusion of healthy controls enables us to generate hypotheses about bacterial strains potentially related to susceptibility to COVID-19 disease, which is highly heterogeneous. Comparison of the COVID-19 patients and their household contacts revealed decreased alpha diversity and blooms of Enterococcus and Eggerthella in COVID-19 cases.

ConclusionsOur study finds that the microbiome of COVID-19 individuals is more likely to be disrupted, as indicated by decreased diversity and increased pathobiont levels. This is either a consequence of the disease or may indicate that certain microbiome states increase susceptibility to COVID-19 disease. Our findings enable comparison with cohorts previously published in the Global North, as well as support new hypotheses about the interaction between the gut microbiome and SARS-CoV-2 infection.","NA","medrxiv",1728079786478

Excitatory projection neurons are considered to be the primary neuronal substrate for memory acquisition and storage. However, inhibitory interneurons control the activity of projection neurons in a in a spatially and temporally precise manner, yet their contribution to memory acquisition, storage and expression remains poorly understood. Here, we employ a miniature microscope imaging approach to monitor the activity of large amygdala interneuron populations in freely moving mice during fear learning and extinction at the single cell level. We find that amygdala interneurons display mixed-selectivity and show complex plastic responses at both the ensemble and single neuron level across the acquisition, expression and extinction of aversive memories. In contrast to bidirectional single cell plasticity across distinct fear states, learning-induced changes at the population level occur transiently during conditioning and do not consolidate across days. Examining molecular interneuron subpopulations revealed that disinhibitory vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing cells are predominantly activated by high fear states. In contrast, somatostatin (SST) interneurons display a preference for safety cues and thereby suppress excitatory neuron responsiveness. However, responses of individual neurons within the SST and VIP populations are non-uniform, indicating the presence of functional subtypes within classical molecularly-defined interneuron populations. Taken together, we identify complex neuronal plasticity within amygdala interneuron ensembles that goes beyond a passive processing function, suggesting a critical role of inhibitory microcircuit elements for memory selectivity and stability.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Despite being observed for the first time twenty years ago, their structure and how they are assembled remains unknown. Here, we reconstituted in vitro the ESCRT-0 clathrin assembly onto various types of membranes. The ESCRT-0 protein HRS, a known clathrin adaptor on endosomes, was found to form protein condensates. These condensates spread into a thin layer on PI(3)P-rich membranes. Platinum replica electron microscopy revealed that, surprisingly, the assembly of clathrin was different depending on the HRS phase. Protein droplets recruited clathrin as a dense, curved lattice, with many cage-like structures. On two-dimensional condensates, HRS recruited clathrin as a dense flat assembly. Two-dimensional HRS-clathrin condensates promoted the clustering of cholesterol in the underlying membrane, while cholesterol enhanced PI(3)P- dependent HRS recruitment on the membrane. On free-standing membranes, two-dimensional HRS-clathrin condensates promoted membrane flattening. Overall, these results show that a two- dimensional HRS condensate creates a unique membrane structure for sorting cargo molecules, defining a new mechanism in membrane trafficking processes.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

While rational design strategies can expedite the discovery of heterobifunctional CIPs, molecular glues have predominantly been discovered by serendipity. Envisioning a prospective approach to discover molecular glues for a pre-selected target, we hypothesized that pre-existing ligands could be systematically decorated with chemical modifications to discover protein-ligand surfaces that are tuned to cooperatively engage another protein interface. Using high-throughput chemical synthesis to diversify a ligand for the transcriptional coactivator ENL with 3,163 structurally diverse chemical building blocks, we discovered a compound dHTC1 that elicits potent, selective, and stereochemistry-dependent degradation of ENL by induced binding to CRL4CRBN. Unlike prior CRBN-based degraders, dHTC1 binds the ligase with high affinity only after forming the ENL:dHTC1 complex, relying on a hybrid interface of protein-protein and protein-ligand contacts. Altogether, this study points toward an expanded chemical space for co-opting the therapeutically important substrate receptor, CRBN, and a second proof-of-concept extending this approach to BRD4 further validates high-throughput chemistry as a facile tool to discover new degraders.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Insect muscles are remarkable examples because they use extremely different contraction frequencies (ranging from ~1 to 1000 Hz) and amplitudes for flying, walking and crawling. This is puzzling because sarcomeres are built from essentially the same actin-myosin components. We show here that the giant protein titin is the key to this functional specialisation. I-band titin spans and determines the length of the sarcomeric I-band, and occurs in muscle-type-specific isoforms. Surprisingly, it also rules the length of the force-generating myosin filament in a force feedback mechanism, even though it is not present there.

CPK28 regulates immune homeostasis, stress responses, and growth in multiple angiosperms including tomato, rice, cotton, and Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter, Arabidopsis). In Arabidopsis, CPK28 phosphorylates and activates the E3 ubiquitin ligases PLANT U-BOX 25 (PUB25) and PUB26 that target the major immune signaling protein BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1), resulting in its turnover. The CPK28-PUB25/26-BIK1 regulatory module maintains precise levels of BIK1 in the cell and is thought to optimize immune responses. Separated from angiosperms by 450M years of evolution, the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (hereafter, Marchantia) has emerged as a model system to study the evolution of signaling modules across land plants. Here, we demonstrate that the function of CPK28 is conserved in Marchantia. MpCPK28 displays Ca2+-dependent protein kinase activity and is inhibited by calmodulin in vitro. Over-expression of MpCPK28 results in pronounced developmental phenotypes and decreased chitin-induced oxidative burst, and MpCPK28 can functionally complement the mutant phenotypes of the Arabidopsis cpk28-1 mutant. MpCPK28 associates with and phosphorylates multiple residues on Marchantia AVRPPHB SUSCEPTIBLE 1 (PBS1)-like (PBL)-a (MpPBLa), a functional ortholog of AtBIK1, as well as MpPUB20e (a putative ortholog of AtPUB25/26). MpPBLa undergoes proteasomal degradation in Marchantia and can be polyubiquitinated by MpPUB20e. The occurrence of the CPK28-PUB25/26-BIK1 module across land plants reveals that the regulation of immune amplitude has been conserved throughout plant evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

They are implicated in multiple neurological disorders including stroke, epilepsy and neurodegeneration and can regulate neuronal excitability through interactions with ion channels2. Polyamines have been linked to pain showing altered levels in human persistent pain states and modulation of pain behaviour in animal models3. However, the systems governing polyamine transport within the nervous system remain unclear. In undertaking a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) of chronic pain intensity in the UK-Biobank we found significant association with variants mapping to the SLC45A4 gene locus. In the mouse nervous system SLC45A4 expression is enriched in all sensory neuron sub-types within the dorsal root ganglion including nociceptors. Cell-based assays show that SLC45A4 is a selective plasma membrane polyamine transporter, whilst the cryo-EM structure reveals a novel regulatory domain and basis for polyamine recognition. Mice lacking SLC45A4 show normal mechanosensitivity but reduced sensitivity to noxious heat and algogen induced tonic pain that is associated with reduced excitability of peptidergic nociceptors. Our findings thus establish a role for neuronal polyamine transport in pain perception and identify a new target for therapeutic intervention in pain treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

A common procedure that allows such physical interfacing is cranial microsurgery, wherein small to large craniotomies are performed in the overlying skull for insertion of neural interfaces or implantation of optically clear windows for long-term cranial observation. Performing craniotomies is, however, a skilled task that requires significant time and practice and further needs to be carried out precisely to ensure that the procedure does not cause damage to the underlying brain and dura. Here, we present a computer vision-guided craniotomy robot (CV-Craniobot) that utilizes machine learning to accurately estimate the dorsal skull anatomy from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Instantaneous information of the skull morphology is used by a robotic mill to rapidly and precisely remove the skull from a desired craniotomy location. We show that the CV-Craniobot can perform small (2 - 4 mm diameter) craniotomies with near 100% success rates within 2 minutes and large craniotomies encompassing most of the dorsal cortex in less than 5 minutes. Thus, the CV-Craniobot enables rapid and precise craniotomies, significantly reducing surgery time as compared to human practitioners and eliminating the need for long training.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

To counteract metal-based host defense strategies (e.g., nutritional immunity, metal poisoning), S. aureus uses a combination of metal-sensing transcription factors and regulatory RNAs to maintain metal homeostasis. In this study, we uncovered an unprecedented interaction between a cis- and a trans-acting regulatory RNA controlling a conditionally essential gene, mntY, encoding a Mn efflux pump. This broadly conserved RNA-RNA interaction between a Fe-responsive sRNA and a Mn-sensing riboswitch allows the integration of Feand Mn-related stresses, notably encountered at the infection site, to fine-tune mntY expression. Remarkably, deletion of the mntY gene is strongly pleomorphic, causing growth defects, altering virulence factor expression, immune evasion, and survival during infection. We demonstrated that MntY is critical for the adaptation of S. aureus to both low and high Mn environments, due to its dual role in metalation of Mn-dependent exoenzymes and Mn detoxification. These findings point to MntY as a promising new therapeutic target to combat multidrug-resistant staphylococcal infections.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Here we designed libraries composed of extant, ancestral, mutagenized or miniaturized variants of Pol III promoters or guide RNA (gRNA) scaffolds and quantified their ability to mediate precise edits to the mammalian genome via multiplex prime editing. We identified thousands of parts that reproducibly drive a range of editing activities in human and mouse stem cells and cancer cell lines, including hundreds exhibiting similar or greater activity than the sequences used in conventional genome engineering constructs. We further conducted saturation mutagenesis screens of canonical Pol III promoters (U6p, 7SKp, H1p) and the prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) scaffold, which identified tolerated variants that can be superimposed on baseline parts to further enhance sequence diversity. While characterizing thousands of orthologous promoters from hundreds of extant or ancestral genomes, we incidentally mapped the functional landscape of mammalian Pol III promoter evolution. Finally, to showcase the usefulness of these parts, we designed a ten key molecular recording array that lacks repetitive subsequences in order to facilitate its one-step assembly in yeast. Upon delivering this 15.8 kb tandem array of promoters and guides to mammalian cells, individual pegRNAs exhibited balanced activities as predicted by the activity of component parts, despite their relocation to a single locus. Looking forward, we anticipate that the diversified parts and variant effect maps reported here can be leveraged for the design, assembly and deployment of synthetic loci encoding arrays of gRNAs exhibiting predictable, differentiated levels of activity, which will be useful for multiplex perturbation, advanced biological recorders and complex genetic circuits.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

While traditionally viewed as a mutagenic selfish element, recent studies point to roles for LINE1 in early mouse development, T cell quiescence and neurogenesis. Here we show that human LINE1 RNA is essential for self-renewal and identity of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Silencing of LINE1 using either antisense oligonucleotides or CRISPR interference in naive hESCs leads to a strong induction of 8C-like cells (8CLCs). We found that genes derepressed upon LINE1 KD are not uniformly distributed across the genome, with an enrichment for chromosome 19, which includes key markers of the 8C state such as TPRX1. Silencing of TPRX1, but not other putative 8C regulators p53 or H3.XY, suppresses the induction of the 8C program in LINE1 KD hESCs. We found that LINE1 RNA is preferentially localized to the lamina and periphery of the nucleolus in hESCs. Sequencing of Lamina-Associated Domains (LADs) and Nucleolus-Associated Domains (NADs) reveals a preferential association of chromosome 19 with NADs in hESCs. However, 8CLCs have a distinct nucleolar morphology and a lower association of chromosome 19 and TPRX1 loci with the nucleolus relative to naive and primed hESCs, suggesting a role for nucleolar dynamics in the 8CLC-hESC transition. In agreement, LINE1 KD leads to disruption of nucleolar architecture with signs of nucleolar stress. Independent perturbations of the nucleolus induce the 8C program in hESCs. Genes induced by LINE1 KD are enriched for targets of Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC2), and inhibition of PRC2 leads to a strong induction of 8C genes.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis repeated cross-sectional study used the 2012-2019 National Inpatient Sample to estimate the rate of TS among delivery hospitalizations to people with SCD, without SCD (non-SCD), Black people with and without SCD, and people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Logistic regression models estimated the odds of TS between SCD and non-SCD deliveries, SCD and non-SCD deliveries with Black race, and SCD and CF deliveries. We examined whether SMM modified the association between TS and SCD in interaction analyses.

ExposureSCD, CF

ResultsAmong 29,822,518 deliveries, 6.7% underwent TS. Among 18,860 SCD deliveries, 8.8% underwent TS. Among 2,945 CF deliveries, 6.6% underwent TS. After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, SCD had higher odds of TS compared to non-SCD deliveries (aOR= 1.38 [1.06,1.79]) and in a stratified analysis of deliveries coded with Black race (aOR= 1.42 [1.06,1.90]). After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, there was no difference in the odds of TS between SCD or CF deliveries (aOR=1.0 [0.51,2.24]). SMM more than doubled the odds of TS in SCD deliveries (interaction: aOR=2.34 [1.57,3.47]; aOR= 2.14 [1.40,3.24] in deliveries coded with Black race).

ConclusionEven after accounting for patient and hospital characteristics, people with SCD have higher odds of immediate postpartum TS compared to control groups. SMM at delivery increased the odds of TS in SCD compared to all non-SCD deliveries and compared to CF deliveries. Possibly SMM severity, patient preference, or clinician recommendations inform this finding. SMM is 3-7 times more common in SCD than non-SCD pregnancies and may be a modifiable risk factor for TS in SCD deliveries.

KEY POINTS

QuestionWhat are the national rates and associations of postpartum tubal sterilization (TS) among deliveries to people with sickle cell disease (SCD) compared to deliveries to people without SCD (non-SCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF)?

FindingsFrom 2012-2019, the TS rate was significantly higher in SCD deliveries (88 per 1,000 deliveries) vs non-SCD (67 per 1,000 deliveries) and CF deliveries (66 per 1,000 deliveries). SCD was positively associated with TS. SMM modified the association between TS and SCD by two-fold.

MeaningPostpartum TS rate in people with SCD is high; SMM during SCD deliveries significantly increases the odds of postpartum TS.","NA","medrxiv",1728079786478

However, they are threatened by climate change and even face the risk of local or global extinction. The responses of these species to climate change have received little attention. In this study, we examine the effects of climate change on state flowers and insects in the United States by employing correlative species distribution models (SDMs). We select a variety of commonly used SDM algorithms to construct an ensemble forecasting framework aimed at predicting the potential habitats for each species under both historical and future climate scenarios, and how these changes might influence the distributions of state flower and insect species. Our results show that more than half of the state flowers ([~] 66%) and insects ([~] 51%) are predicted to experience a substantial decrease in regions with favorable climates within the states they represent. Conversely, only a small number (Flowers: [~] 2%; Insects: [~] 10%) are projected to see an increase in habitat suitability in the future. Certain states may no longer possess suitable habitats for their state-designated species. Our findings indicate that cultural heritage might be at risk due to reduced habitat suitability and local extinctions driven by climate change. These findings can provide guidance regarding the protection or replacement of state species to preserve cultural heritage.

Significance StatementWe have known for decades that climate change may lead to species local or global extinction. However, the vast majority of such research has focused on species of ecological or economic importance. Only recently have researchers begun to seriously consider the impacts of climate change on our cultural heritage, and that research has mainly focused on tangible cultural assests such as buildings and anthropological sites. Here, we consider the impacts of climate change on species of cultural significance, namely U.S. state flowers and insects. We find that the majority of these species are threatened with local extinction from climate change, and the loss of these species will take with them important aspects of our history and culture.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

This module demonstrated significant overlap with genes implicated in fatigue, cognitive disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Our pathway analysis revealed potential associations between ME/CFS and conditions such as COVID-19, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, neurodegenerative diseases, and pathways involved in cortisol synthesis and secretion, supporting the hypothesis that ME/CFS is a neuroimmune disorder. Additionally, our findings underscore a potential link between ME/CFS and estrogen signaling pathways, which may elucidate the higher prevalence of ME/CFS in females.

Mitigation of arboviral outbreaks relies largely on the use of insecticides, but the effectiveness of such responses is threatened by the evolution of insecticide resistance. Monitoring mosquito susceptibility to different insecticides is therefore vital for informed decisions regarding outbreak responses. In this study, we elucidate the patterns of resistance to two insecticide classes within the primary vectors of West Nile virus in the northeast and midwestern regions of the continental United States, Culex pipiens and Culex restuans.

Methodology/Principal FindingsEgg collections were performed throughout Illinois from 2018-2020, and adults were tested for insecticide resistance to permethrin and malathion. Individuals from each sampling location were sequenced to determine the presence of kdr target-site mutations, and biochemical assays were performed to determine increases in detoxification enzymes and insensitive acetylcholinesterase. Results from the bottle assays indicate variable resistance rates in Illinois, however lowered mortality was found in most of the regions that were tested. The kdr mutation (L1014F) was present in 50% of Culex pipiens sequenced, and more prevalent in southern Illinois compared with northern and central (p < 0.001). Different mechanisms were predictive of resistance by species and insecticide, with permethrin resistance being affected by kdr-allele frequency and oxidase levels and malathion resistance by - and {beta}-esterases in Cx. pipiens. For Cx. restuans -esterase and oxidase levels were predictive of permethrin resistance while {beta}-esterase and insensitive acetylcholinesterase levels were predictive of malathion resistance.

Conclusions/SignificanceWe documented variation in insecticide resistance levels that appear to be driven by population differences in kdr mutation rates and metabolic resistance mechanisms. The presence of different mechanisms in species and regions has implications for approaches to resistance management and highlights the need to implement and maintain insecticide resistance monitoring practices.

Author SummaryMosquitoes are the vectors of many major diseases including malaria, dengue, yellow fever, zika, and West Nile virus. Insecticides are often used to control mosquitoes and the outbreaks they cause. However, evidence has shown that populations of different mosquito species worldwide have developed resistance to our most common insecticides. This study shows that West Nile virus vectors in Illinois, (Culex pipiens and Culex restuans) are no exception to this trend. Egg collections were made throughout the state during the 2018-2020 field seasons and the resulting adults were tested for resistance to two common insecticides using the CDCs bottle bioassay protocol. The results indicate that rates of resistance vary throughout the state and population differences in resistance mechanisms are driving this variation.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

While epigenetic aging clocks have shown accuracy in predicting biological age, they typically provide single estimates for the samples and lack mechanistic insights. In this study, we challenge the paradigm that aging can be sufficiently described with a single biological age estimate. We describe Ageome, a computational framework for measuring the epigenetic age of thousands of molecular pathways simultaneously in mice and humans. Ageome is based on the premise that an organisms overall biological age can be approximated by the collective ages of its functional modules, which may age at different rates and have different biological ages. We show that, unlike conventional clocks, Ageome provides a high-dimensional representation of biological aging across cellular functions, enabling comprehensive assessment of aging dynamics within an individual, in a population, and across species. Application of Ageome to longevity intervention models revealed distinct patterns of pathway-specific age deceleration. Notably, cell reprogramming, while rejuvenating cells, also accelerated aging of some functional modules. When applied to human cohorts, Ageome demonstrated heterogeneity in predictive power for mortality risk, and some modules showed better performance in predicting the onset of age-related diseases, especially cancer, compared to existing clocks. Together, the Ageome framework offers a comprehensive and interpretable approach for assessing aging, providing insights into mechanisms and targets for intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786478

Peptide fragments of larger proteins are particularly attractive for achieving these functions due to their inherent potential to form native-like binding interactions. Recently developed experimental approaches allow for high-throughput measurement of protein fragment inhibitory activity in living cells. However, it has thus far not been possible to predict de novo which of the many possible protein fragments bind to protein targets, let alone act as inhibitors. We have developed a computational method, FragFold, that employs AlphaFold to predict protein fragment binding to full-length proteins in a high-throughput manner. Applying FragFold to thousands of fragments tiling across diverse proteins revealed peaks of predicted binding along each protein sequence. Comparisons with experimental measurements establish that our approach is a sensitive predictor of fragment function: Evaluating inhibitory fragments from known protein-protein interaction interfaces, we find 87% are predicted by FragFold to bind in a native-like mode. Across full protein sequences, 68% of FragFold-predicted binding peaks match experimentally measured inhibitory peaks. Deep mutational scanning experiments support the predicted binding modes and uncover superior inhibitory peptides in high throughput. Further, FragFold is able to predict previously unknown protein binding modes, explaining prior genetic and biochemical data. The success rate of FragFold demonstrates that this computational approach should be broadly applicable for discovering inhibitory protein fragments across proteomes.

Significance StatementPeptides can regulate protein interactions by binding to specific interfaces, and fragments of larger proteins have high potential to function in this manner. Recently developed experimental methods allow massively parallel measurement of protein fragment-based inhibition in vivo. However, we have lacked comparable computational methods to predict which protein fragments act as inhibitors and how they bind. Here we report a new approach, FragFold, which leverages high-throughput AlphaFold predictions of protein - fragment binding to tackle these problems at scale. FragFold is successful at predicting inhibitory protein fragments and their binding modes across diverse protein structures and functions. This new approach stands to enable proteome-wide discovery of inhibitory protein fragments and aid the interpretation of high-throughput experimental measurements of inhibitory activity.

Our previous work has detailed the timeline of BBB functional maturation in zebrafish, revealing a conserved mechanism of BBB induction through the suppression of endothelial transcytosis. Yet, as opposed to extensive research on glial-vascular interactions in rodents, such interactions remain largely overlooked in the zebrafish model system. Here, we focus on glial-vascular development in the zebrafish brain, leveraging three glial gene promoters: gfap (glial fibrillary acidic protein), glast (an astrocyte-specific glutamate transporter), and glastini (a new, shortened, equally effective version of the Glast promoter). Using these glial promoters, sparse labeling revealed fewer glial-vascular interactions during early larval stages, with both glial coverage and contact area increasing as the zebrafish brain matured. We then generated stable transgenic lines for both the Glast and Glastini promoters and observed similar increases in glial coverage during larval development, starting at [~]30% coverage at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) and peaking at [~]60% at 10 dpf. Ultrastructural assessment of glial-vascular interactions using electron microscopy (EM) confirmed a progressive increase in glial coverage over larval development, with maximal coverage reaching [~]70% in adult zebrafish, significantly lower than the nearly 100% coverage observed in mammals. Finally, immunogold-EM labeling confirmed that cells identified as glia in aforementioned morphological analyses were indeed Glast-positive.

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection.

We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786479

It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar.

MethodsTwo matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024.

ResultsThe adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.07) in the three-dose analysis. In the first six months of follow-up in the two-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.27-0.46); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.19-1.94). In the first six months of follow-up in the three-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.20-0.50); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02-1.85). The overall effectiveness of the primary series and third-dose vaccinations against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 95.9% (95% CI: 94.0-97.1) and 34.1% (95% CI: -46.4-76.7), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

ConclusionA strong healthy vaccinee effect was observed in the first six months following vaccination. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations.","NA","medrxiv",1728079786479

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786479

To explore it, we analyzed deep proteomic and transcriptomic data from over 1,000 human samples, including 6 cancer types and 26 healthy human tissues. This global analysis identified 60,024 high confidence substitutions corresponding to 8,801 unique sites in proteins derived from 1,990 genes. Some substitutions are shared across samples, while others exhibit strong tissue-type and cancer specificity. Surprisingly, products of alternate translation are more abundant than their canonical counterparts for hundreds of proteins, suggesting sense codon recoding. Recoded proteins include transcription factors, proteases, signaling proteins, and proteins associated with neurodegeneration. Mechanisms contributing to substitution abundance include protein stability, codon frequency, codon-anticodon mismatches, and RNA modifications. We characterize sequence motifs around alternatively translated amino acids and how substitution ratios vary across protein domains, tissue types and cancers. The substitution ratios are positively associated with intrinsically disordered regions and genetic polymorphisms in gnomAD, though the polymorphisms cannot account for the substitutions. Both the sequence and the tissue-specificity of alternatively translated proteins are conserved between human and mouse. These results demonstrate the contribution of alternate translation to diversifying mammalian proteomes, and its association with protein stability, tissue-specific proteomes, and diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786479

Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document.

While many viruses can reach the central nervous system (CNS) causing acute or chronic infections (such as herpes simplex virus 1, HSV-1), the lack of a clear mechanistic link between viruses and protein aggregation into amyloids, a characteristic of several neurodegenerative diseases, has rendered such a connection elusive. Recently, we showed that viruses can induce aggregation of purified amyloidogenic proteins via the direct physicochemical mechanism of heterogenous nucleation (HEN). In the current study, we show that the incubation of HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 with human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leads to the amyloid aggregation of several proteins known to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases, such as: APLP1 (amyloid beta precursor like protein 1), ApoE, clusterin, 2-macroglobulin, PGK-1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1), ceruloplasmin, nucleolin, 14-3-3, transthyretin and vitronectin. Importantly, UV-inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 does not affect its ability to induce amyloid aggregation, as amyloid formation is dependent on viral surface catalysis via HEN and not its ability to replicate. Additionally, viral amyloid induction led to a dramatic drop in the soluble protein concentration in the CSF. Our results show that viruses can physically induce amyloid aggregation of proteins in human CSF and result in soluble protein depletion, and thus providing a potential mechanism that may account for the association between persistent and latent/reactivating brain infections and neurodegenerative diseases.

Significance StatementViruses have generally been excluded from the etiology of amyloid pathologies based on the assumption that amyloid formation requires a proteinaceous conformational template (a prion) to form. Here we show that neuroinvasive viruses induce amyloid aggregation of a plethora of proteins in human CSF even after UV inactivation. Our work illustrates that viruses can induce amyloid aggregation of endogenous human proteins in their native environment by acting as physical catalysts of amyloid nucleation and phase transition. Demonstrating this direct mechanistic link, which is independent of templating, can help better understand the link between viruses and neurodegenerative disorders, especially in the post-COVID-19 era.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786479

Attention can also be seen as a solution to the binding problem: concurrent attention to all parts of an entity allows separating it from the rest. However, the rich models of attention in computational neuroscience are generally not scaled to real-world problems and there are thus many behavioral and neural phenomena that current models cannot explain. Here, we propose a bidirectional recurrent model of attention that is inspired by modern neural networks for image segmentation. It conceptualizes recurrent connections as a multi-stage internal gating process where bottom-up connections transmit features, while top-down and lateral connections transmit attentional gating signals. Our model can recognize and segment simple stimuli such as digits as well as objects in natural images and is able to be prompted with object labels, attributes or locations. It can learn to perform a range of behavioral findings, such as object binding, selective attention, inhibition of return, and visual search. It also replicates a variety of neural findings, including increased activity for attended objects, features, and locations, attention-invariant tuning, and relatively late onset attention. Most importantly, our proposed model unifies decades of cognitive and neurophysiological findings of visual attention into a single principled architecture. Our results highlight that the ability to selectively and dynamically focus on specific parts of stimulus streams can help artificial neural networks to better generalize and align with human brains.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786479

Pathogen exposure led to an array of architectural changes including faster nest growth, increased spacing between entrances, transmission-inhibitory changes in overall nest network topology, and reduced chamber centrality. Simulations confirmed that these changes reduced disease spread.

However, these dances have attracted little scientific attention and their structure and meaning remain largely obscure. Here we analyse close-range video recordings of captive crested gibbons, extracting descriptions of dance in four Nomascus species (N. annamensis, N. gabriellae, N. leucogenys, and N. siki). Additionally, we report results from a survey amongst relevant professionals clarifying behavioural contexts of dance in captive and wild crested gibbons. Our results demonstrate that dances in Nomascus represent a common and intentional form of visual communication restricted to sexually mature females. While primarily used as a proceptive signal to solicit copulation, dances occur in a wide range of contexts related to arousal and/or frustration in captivity. A linguistically informed view of this sequential behaviour demonstrates that dances follow a grouping organisation and isochronous rhythm - patterns not described for visual displays in other non-human primates. We argue that applying the concept of dance to gibbons allows us to expand our understanding of the communicative behaviours of non-human apes and develop hypotheses on the rules and regularities characterizing this behaviour. We propose that gibbons dances likely evolved from less elaborate rhythmic proceptive signals, similar to those found in siamangs. Although dance displays in humans and crested gibbons share a number of key characteristics, they cannot be assumed to be homologous. Nevertheless, gibbon dances represent a model behaviour whose investigation could be extended to the study of complex gestural signals in hominoid primates.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786479

""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786479

ME/CFS diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME/CFS patients low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME/CFS cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME/CFS status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME/CFS cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME/CFS status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME/CFS status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME/CFS diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1728079786479

This degeneracy impacts the efficiency of heterologous protein production due to the codon usage preferences of each organism. The process of tailoring organism-specific synonymous codons, known as codon optimization, must respect local sequence patterns that go beyond global codon preferences. As a result, the search space faces a combinatorial explosion that makes exhaustive exploration impossible. Nevertheless, throughout the diverse life on Earth, natural selection has already optimized the sequences, thereby providing a rich source of data allowing machine learning algorithms to explore the underlying rules. Here, we introduce CodonTransformer, a multispecies deep learning model trained on over 1 million DNA-protein pairs from 164 organisms spanning all kingdoms of life. The model demonstrates context-awareness thanks to the attention mechanism and bidirectionality of the Transformers we used, and to a novel sequence representation that combines organism, amino acid, and codon encodings. CodonTransformer generates host-specific DNA sequences with natural-like codon distribution profiles and with negative cis-regulatory elements. This work introduces a novel strategy of Shared Token Representation and Encoding with Aligned Multi-masking (STREAM) and provides a state-of-the-art codon optimization framework with a customizable open-access model and a user-friendly interface.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786479

Such defenses include venoms that deter predators by targeting nociceptive (pain-sensing) pathways. Through co-evolution, venom toxins can become extremely efficient modulators of their molecular targets. The venom of velvet ants (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae) is notoriously painful. The intensity of a velvet ant sting has been described as ""Explosive and long lasting, you sound insane as you scream. Hot oil from the deep fryer spilling over your entire hand."" [1] The effectiveness of the velvet ant sting as a deterrent against potential predators has been shown across vertebrate orders, including mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and birds [2-4]. The venoms low toxicity suggests it has a targeted effect on nociceptive sensory mechanisms [5]. This leads to the hypothesis that velvet ant venom targets a conserved nociception mechanism, which we sought to uncover using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. Drosophila larvae have peripheral sensory neurons that sense potentially damaging (noxious) stimuli such as high temperature, harsh mechanical touch, and noxious chemicals [6-9]. These polymodal nociceptors are called class IV multidendritic dendritic arborizing (cIV da) neurons, and they share many features with vertebrate nociceptors, including conserved sensory receptor channels [10,11]. We found that velvet ant venom strongly activated Drosophila nociceptors through heteromeric Pickpocket/Balboa (Ppk/Bba) ion channels. Furthermore, we found a single venom peptide (Do6a) that activated larval nociceptors at nanomolar concentrations through Ppk/Bba. Drosophila Ppk/Bba is homologous to mammalian Acid Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs) [12]. However, the Do6a peptide did not produce behavioral signs of nociception in mice, which was instead triggered by other non-specific, less potent, peptides within the venom. This suggests that Do6a is an insect-specific venom component that potently activates insect nociceptors. Consistent with this, we showed that the velvet ants defensive sting produced aversive behavior in a predatory praying mantis. Together, our results indicate that velvet ant venom evolved to target nociceptive systems of both vertebrates and invertebrates, but through different molecular mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786479

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1728079786479

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786479

Yet, no efficient mechanisms for their removal have been identified. Here we report bioaccumulation of PFAS by several gut bacterial species over a wide range of concentrations from nanomolar up to 500 M. For bioaccumulating Bacteroides uniformis, a highly prevalent species, we estimate intracellular PFAS concentration in the mM range - above that of most native metabolites. Despite this high bioaccumulation, B. uniformis cells could grow appreciably up to 250 M perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure. Escherichia coli, which accumulated PFAS to a much lesser extent, substantially increased PFAS bioaccumulation when lacking TolC efflux pump indicating trans-membrane transport in PFAS bioaccumulation. Electron microscopy and cryogenic Focused Ion Beam-Secondary Ion Mass-spectrometry revealed distinct morphological changes and intracellular localisation of PFNA aggregates. Bioaccumulation of PFAS and transmembrane transport is also evident in proteomics, metabolomics, thermal proteome profiling, and mutations following adaptive laboratory evolution. In an in vivo context, mice colonized with human gut bacteria showed, compared to germ-free controls or those colonized with low-bioaccumulating bacteria, higher PFNA levels in excreted feces. As the gut microbiota is a critical interface between exposure and human body, our results have implications for understanding and utilizing microbial contribution to PFAS clearance.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786479

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","NA","biorxiv",1728079786479

We investigated whether a diverse refugee committee could utilize participatory methods to identify health priorities and a research agenda to address them.

MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study with focus groups of current and former refugees, asylum claimants and evacuees from a specialized refugee clinic over a year. We collected sociodemographic data using standardized instruments, then utilized a four-step nominal group technique process (idea generation, recording, discussion, and voting) to identify and rank participants health and research priorities. Participants ranked their top five priorities across three time periods: Pre-migration/early arrival (0-3 months), post-migration (3 months-2 years), and long-term health (>2 years). Participants created overarching priorities and corroborated findings via a member checking step.

FindingsTwenty-three participants (median age 35 years) attended one or more of five focus groups. Twenty-one completed sociodemographic surveys: 16/21 (76%) were women, representing 8 countries of origin. Participants identified ""more family physicians"" and ""improving health system navigation"" (11/60 votes each) as top health and research priorities respectively across all resettlement periods. Participants also prioritized pre-departure healthcare system orientation and improved post-arrival and long-term mental health services. Twelve participants completed the member checking process, affirming the results with minor clarifications.

InterpretationThis proof-of-concept study illustrates how refugees can use a rigorous consensus process without external influence to prioritize their healthcare needs, direct a health research agenda to address those needs, and co-produce research. These low-cost participatory methods should be replicated elsewhere.

Mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction is associated with lack of physical activity and considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs) aflicting our societies such as T2D, CVD, metabolic syndrome, and even AD.

To our knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies on the metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular characteristics of ""healthy sedentary"" individuals living without clinical symptoms. Hence, the main aim of our study herein was to characterize multiple metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular bioenergetic signatures in ""healthy sedentary"" individuals which could already be downregulated compared to moderately active individuals.

Nineteen subjects, 9 sedentary (SED) and 10 moderately active (AC) volunteered for multiple assessments including muscle biopsies, in order to assess muscle metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics both at rest and during exercise.

For our exercise studies, we performed graded exercise testing (GXT) to assess carbohydrate and fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity according to our previously developed methodology.

Resting studies showed decreased mitochondrial respiration including decreases in complex I (-36%) and II (-28%) as well as total electron system capacity (-34%) and electron system capacity coupled to ATP production via ATP synthase (-30%). Regarding muscle carbohydrate metabolism, SED individuals showed a decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation (-37%) as well as reduced expression (-49%) of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Regarding fatty acid metabolism, SED showed decreased activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1)(-51%) and CPT2 (-44%) as well as decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (-35%). Metabolomics analysis also confirmed downregulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) identified distinct metabolic phenotypes through intermediates of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Further, we found significant differences in cardiolipin (CL) species expression between SED and AC groups, which, due to the important role of CL in mitochondrial structure, function, biogenesis and bioenergetics, deserves further attention.

Exercise studies also showed significant differences in substrate utilization between groups where SED possessed a significantly lower fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity. The correlation of different bioenergetic parameters between resting and exercise conditions were robust, suggesting the possibility of performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) as a non-invasive methodology to indirectly assess metabolic function in multiple populations. In summary, in our study herein, we show that ""healthy sedentary"" individuals already possess a significant decrease in cellular metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics compared to moderately active individuals both during resting and exercising conditions.

Since large numbers of sedentary individuals evolve to develop cardiometabolic disease, a better understanding of decreased cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial function is needed in order to improve both diagnosis and treatment of multiple metabolic diseases.
