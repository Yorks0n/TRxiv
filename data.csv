In this study, we establish a multiplex-edited mouse model with modifications in genes associated with hair morphology and lipid metabolism, enabling insights into traits involved in developing woolly hair and cold tolerance. Our optimized workflows achieved high editing efficiencies and produced genetically modified mice with simultaneous editing of up to seven different genes. Selected modifications include loss-of-function mutations in Fgf5, Tgm3, and Fam83g, among others. The resulting mice display exaggerated hair phenotypes including curly, textured coats, and golden-brown hair. This study establishes a rapid platform for testing mammoth-centric genetic variants while advancing methods for complex genetic model generation. These approaches inform de-extinction efforts and research into the genetic basis of mammalian hair development and cold adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120893

There are > 10,000 new hospitalizations per week in the U.S., many of whom develop post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), or ""long COVID"", with long-term health issues and compromised quality of life. Early identification of individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 is key for monitoring and supporting respiratory status and improving outcomes. Therefore, precision tools for early detection of patients at high risk of severe disease can reduce morbidity and mortality. Here we report an untargeted and longitudinal metabolomic study of plasma derived from adult patients with COVID-19. One-carbon metabolism, a pathway previously shown as critical for viral propagation and disease progression, and a potential target for COVID-19 treatment, scored strongly as differentially abundant in patients with severe COVID-19. A follow-up targeted metabolite profiling revealed that one arm of the one-carbon metabolism pathway, the methionine cycle, is a major driver of the metabolic profile associated with disease severity. The methionine cycle produces S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl group donor important for methylation of DNA, RNA, and proteins, and its high abundance was reported to correlate with disease severity. Further, genomic data from the profiled patients revealed a genetic contributor to methionine metabolism and identified the C677T allele of the MTHFR gene as a pre-existing predictor of disease trajectory - patients homozygous for the MTHFR C677T have higher incidence of experiencing severe disease. Our results raise the possibility that screening for the common genetic MTHFR variant may be an actionable approach to stratify risk of COVID severity and may inform novel precision COVID-19 treatment strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1741126120893

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1741126120893

This study evaluates variant calls derived from genome assemblies compared to traditional read-based variant-calling methods, using seven closely related Staphylococcus aureus isolates sequenced on Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms. By benchmarking multiple assembly and variant-calling pipelines against a ground truth dataset, we found that read-based methods consistently achieved high accuracy. Assembly-based approaches performed well in some cases but were highly dependent on assembly quality, as errors in the assembly led to false-positive variant calls. These findings underscore the need for improved assembly techniques before the potential benefits of assembly-based variant calling - such as reduced computational requirements and simpler data management - can be realised.

2. Impact statementVariant calling is foundational to microbial genomics, yet traditional workflows rely heavily on sequencing reads, which for a typical bacterial genome can be hundreds of megabytes. In contrast, genome assemblies are far smaller - usually just a few megabytes - making them significantly easier to manage. If accurate variant calls could be made directly from assemblies, this would reduce computational demands and, in some cases, may even eliminate the need to retain raw sequencing reads. This study addresses the key question of whether variant calling from assemblies is accurate enough to replace read-based methods. Our findings show that while assembly-based variant calling can achieve high accuracy, this is only possible with error-free assemblies. Since most assemblies contain errors, assembly-based variant-calling approaches should currently be used with caution. Nevertheless, as sequencing and assembly technologies continue to advance, improved assembly accuracy may make assembly-based variant calling a viable alternative, reducing data complexity and storage demands while streamlining microbial genomic analyses.

Many defense systems were unrecognizable based on sequence or predicted structure, so could only be identified via functional assays. In mechanistic studies, we show that some defense systems encode nucleases that only degrade covalently modified phage DNA, but which accommodate diverse chemical modifications. We also identify outer membrane proteins that prevent phage adsorption and a set of previously unknown defense systems with diverse antiphage profiles and modalities. Most defenses acted against at least two phages, indicating that broadly acting systems are widely distributed among non-model bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120893

Design Retrospective online survey. The survey was co-designed with Long COVID patients and carers. Setting Respondents were recruited from representative online panels in the U.S. and U.K. maintained by the data firm Dynata in early 2024. Participants After data cleaning, the final dataset comprised 1,816 respondents, 352 (19.4%) who reported Long COVID and 1,464 (80.6%) who did not. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was self-reported Long COVID, defined as experiencing symptoms related to a COVID-19 infection at least three months after the infection began. Participants were also asked to indicate whether they experienced no, mild or severe initial symptoms during each COVID-19 infection and to respond to nine questions that assessed different aspects of hypermobility: the Hakim and Grahame 5-part questionnaire (5PQ) and four additional co-produced questions. The 5PQ was used to identify individuals with generalized joint hypermobility (GJH). All nine questions were used to develop a measure of extreme hypermobility, based on the top 10th percentile of hypermobility among respondents in each of six groups sorted by age and gender. Results In separate binomial logistic regressions of the dataset controlling for sex assigned at birth, age, number of infections, and number of vaccine doses, both GJH (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.65) and extreme hypermobility (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.16) were found to be predictive of Long COVID. Hypermobility influences the odds of getting Long COVID through two pathways. First, both GJH and extreme hypermobility increase the risk that individuals with no or moderate initial symptoms from a COVID-19 infection experience Long COVID. Second, both GJH and extreme hypermobility are significant predictors of developing severe initial symptoms from (a) COVID-19 infection(s), which is independently associated with increased Long COVID risk. A mediation analysis confirmed that extreme hypermobility influences the odds of developing Long COVID in part by increasing the likelihood that individuals experience severe initial symptoms from (a) COVID infection(s). Conclusions Both GJH and extreme hypermobility are significant risk factors for Long COVID. People with extreme hypermobility are at particularly high risk of developing Long COVID after an initial COVID-19 infection. Further research is needed to replicate these findings with other datasets and clarify the pathophysiology that explains why people with hypermobility may be at greater risk of Long COVID.","NA","medrxiv",1741126120893

Their morphology, and the degree of morphological variation observed among the assemblage, has generated considerable controversy about their affinities and heterogeneity. Here we use parsimony analyses to test the competing hypotheses for Dmanisi hominins employing characters from the cranium, mandible, dentition, and postcranium; and we address anomalies in endocranial volume, dentition and mandibular structure among the assemblage. We propose that the Dmanisi hominins are not Homo erectus, and that two species are represented among the assemblage: one comprises Homo georgicus and the other an as yet unnamed species. Our review of the dating of the Dmanisi site leads us to propose that Homo georgicus was probably present by 1.8 Ma and that the other hominins recovered from the Dmanisi excavations accumulated at some time or times during the reverse polarity of 1.07 Ma and 1.77 Ma.

Examining the zoonotic emergence of Ebola virus, Marburg virus, influenza A virus, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, we find no evidence of a change in the intensity of natural selection immediately prior to a host switch, compared with typical selection within reservoir hosts. We conclude that extensive pre-zoonotic adaptation is not necessary for human-to-human transmission of zoonotic viruses. In contrast, the reemergence of H1N1 influenza A virus in 1977 showed a change in selection, consistent with the hypothesis of passage in a laboratory setting prior to its reintroduction into the human population, purportedly during a vaccine trial. Holistic phylogenetic analysis of selection regimes can be used to detect evolutionary signals of host switching or laboratory passage, providing insight into the circumstances of past and future viral emergence.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

In many species, this is accomplished by primordial germ cells (PGCs), which give rise to sperm or eggs. PGCs are often specified far from the future gonads and must migrate through developing tissues to reach them. Failure to do so can result in infertility or germ cell tumours. While PGC migration is well characterized in some species, very little is known about their migration in mammalian embryos. Here, we performed dynamic and quantitative analyses of PGC migration from E7.5 to E9.5 in the mouse embryo, providing the first comprehensive study of the migratory characteristics of PGCs from their point of origin to the gonads. We demonstrate that migrating PGCs are influenced by the surrounding environment and, in contrast to other organisms, extend highly dynamic, actin-rich protrusions to navigate through ECM barriers and tight intercellular spaces. As PGCs migrate through increasingly confined spaces, they undergo significant nuclear deformation and become prone to nuclear rupture and DNA damage. Their migration under confinement may be aided in part by a depleted nuclear lamina that leads to wrinkled nuclear morphology. Our high-resolution and dynamic imaging approaches have uncovered a surprising risk to genome integrity in migrating PGCs, with implications for DNA repair and adaptations in nuclear mechanics in PGCs.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) pose a significant public health threat, particularly in children, where infections can lead to bloody diarrhea and progress to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a life-threatening condition with long-term complications. Antibiotics are contraindicated in STEC infections due to their potential to induce prophages carrying Shiga toxin (stx) genes, triggering toxin production. Here, we present a CRISPR-based antimicrobial strategy that selectively targets and eliminates O157 STEC clinical isolates while preventing toxin release. We designed a Cas12 nuclease to cleave >99% of all stx variants found in O157 strains, leading to bacterial killing and suppression of toxin production. To enable targeted delivery, we engineered a bacteriophage-derived capsid to specifically transfer a non-replicative DNA payload to E. coli O157, preventing its dissemination. In a mouse STEC colonization model, our therapeutic candidate, EB003, reduced bacterial burden by a factor of 3x103. In an infant rabbit disease model, EB003 mitigated clinical symptoms, abrogated stx-mediated toxicity, and accelerated epithelial repair at therapeutically relevant doses. These findings demonstrate the potential of CRISPR-based antimicrobials for treating STEC infections and support further clinical development of EB003 as a precision therapeutic against antibiotic-refractory bacterial pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

Herein, we show that HPhTX has enhanced polymerase activity, compared with HPbTX, in human cells and that the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) protein is the main factor responsible for this difference. Through single and combined site-directed mutagenesis and swapping the three amino acids different between HPhTX and HPbTX, we found that PB2 mutation E627K is the major contributor to the enhanced polymerase activity of HPhTX. E362G substitution in HPhTX PB2 affected the polymerase, although to a lesser extent than E627K. Moreover, M631L mutation in HPhTX PB2 enhanced polymerase activity. Rescue of a loss-of-function recombinant HPhTX (rHPhTX) containing mutations at residues 627 and 362, alone or in combination, revealed a contribution of PB2 E362G and K627E in morbidity, mortality, and viral replication as compared to rHPhTX wild-type (WT), and significantly reduced viral pathogenicity to levels comparable to rHPbTX WT. These findings indicate that HPAIV H5N1 of cattle origin isolated from the first human case has post-transmission amino acid changes that increase viral replication in human cells and pathogenicity in mice.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

However, between 3 and 2 thousand years before present (BP) Celtic was widely spoken across most of Europe. While often associated with Bell Beaker-related populations, the spread of this prominent Indo-European linguistic cluster remains debated1-7. Previous genomic investigations have focused on its arrival to specific regions: Britain8, Iberia9 and Southwestern Germany10. Here, we utilize new genomic data from Bronze and Iron Age Europe to investigate the population history of historically Celtic-speaking regions, and test different linguistic theories on the origins and early spread of the Celtic languages. We identify a widespread demographic impact of the Central European Urnfield Culture. We find ancestry associated with its Knoviz subgroup in the Carpathian Basin to have formed between 4 - 3.2 kyr BP, and subsequently expanded across much of Western Europe between 3.2 and 2.8 kyr BP. This ancestry further persisted into the Hallstatt Culture of France, Germany and Austria, impacting Britain by 2.8 kyr BP and Iberia by 2.5 kyr BP. These findings support models of an Eastern Central rather than a Western European center of spread for a major component of all the attested Celtic languages. Our study demonstrates, yet again, the power of ancient population genomics in addressing long-standing debates in historical linguistics.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

Repeated vaccination is essential for preparing against currently circulating and newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants while enabling people to continue with daily life. Optimizing vaccination strategies is crucial to efficiently manage medical resources and establish an effective vaccination framework. Therefore, it is important to quantitatively understand vaccine-induced immunity dynamics and to be able to identify poor responders with lower sustained antibody titers as potential priorities for revaccination. We investigated longitudinal antibody titer data in a cohort of 2,526 people in Fukushima, Japan, from April 2021 to November 2022 for whom basic demographic and health information was available. Using mathematical modeling and machine learning, we stratified the time-course patterns of antibody titers after 2 primary doses and 1 booster dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We identified 3 notable populations, which we refer to as the durable, the vulnerable, and the rapid-decliner populations, approximately half of which remained in the same population after the booster dose. Notably, the rapid-decliner population experienced earlier infections than the others. Furthermore, when comparing IgG(S) titers, IgA(S) titers, and T-spot counts between participants who experienced breakthrough infections after booster vaccination and those who did not, we found that IgA(S) titers were significantly lower in breakthrough infected participants during the early stage after booster vaccination. Our computational approach is adaptable to various types of vaccinations. This flexibility can inform policy decisions on vaccine distribution to enhance immunity both in future pandemics and in the post-COVID-19 era.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

However, little is known on the role of CD8 T cells in MS, partially due to the nearly ubiquitous use of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models that are mediated by CD4 T cells, with no CD8 T cell contribution. Importantly, MS and EAE differ in both their distribution of CNS lesions and their symptoms, indicating differences in CNS inflammation. MS lesions are more prevalent in the brain, while EAE lesions are more frequent in the spinal cord. Additionally, neurologic deficits in MS rarely parallel the paralysis typical for CD4 T cell-mediated EAE (CD4-EAE). In contrast, CD8-EAE models suggest that CD8 T cells preferentially cause brain inflammation, but little is known regarding how brain and spinal cord inflammation may differ, and how CD8 T cells may contribute to those differences. We have established an adoptive CD8-EAE mouse model characterized by brain-centered inflammation, severe ataxia, and weight loss. CNS inflammation in the brain and spinal cord differed in immune cell numbers, cellular composition, and inflammatory signatures. CD8-EAE could be suppressed by blocking IFN-{gamma}, and exacerbated by blocking PD-1, with concomitant changes in numbers of CNS-infiltrating monocytes. Most CD8 T cells in the CNS were CD11c+, suggesting that they are the pathogenic subset. We describe a robust CD8-EAE model, identify differences between brain and spinal cord inflammation, and characterize mechanisms that control CD8 T cell-mediated neuroinflammation, thereby furthering understanding of these cells in EAE/MS.

The assumption that pathogens and mammalian-associated bacteria remodel their lipid A PAMP because of host-microbe co-evolution is a long held-belief of microbial pathogenesis. We set out to test this fundamental principle by interrogating a Gram-negative genus presenting evidence of evolutionary events linked to the acquisition of essential virulence traits, resulting in pathogenic and non-pathogenic species. The genus Yersinia fulfil these requirements; the acquisition of the pYV virulence plasmid is one of the evolutionary events associated with virulence. At 37C, only pathogenic Yersinia switch to deacylated lipid A, a modification that diminishes TLR4/MD-2 recognition and reduces inflammation. An engineered chimeric pathogenic Yersinia strain expressing the non-pathogenic lipid A profile efficiently engages with TLR4, demonstrating it is sufficient to switch the acylation pattern to modify the recognition by TLR4 and subsequent activation of inflammation. The lipid As of pathogenic and non-pathogenic species are modified with aminoarabinose and palmitate; therefore, only the reduced acylation of the lipid A PAMP is a trait associated with virulence. The decorations of lipid A do not alter TLR4 engagement but confer resistance to antimicrobial peptides. The chimeric pathogenic Yersinia strain expressing the non-pathogenic lipid A profile allows to ascertain whether the switch in the lipid A PAMP affects virulence. This strain showed enhanced motility due to an upregulation of the flhDC master regulator, and impaired cellular invasion through downregulation of rovA, a key invasion regulator. The expression and function of pYV-encoded virulence factors Yops and YadA were not affected. Nonetheless, the chimeric strain was attenuated in vivo, demonstrating that virulence factors cannot overcome a switch in the lipid A PAMP associated with pathogenicity.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

We present three complementary approaches for predicting epitope relationships from antibody amino acid sequences. First, we analyze ~18 million antibody pairs targeting ~250 protein families and establish that a threshold of >70% CDRH3 sequence identity among antibodies sharing both heavy and light chain V-genes reliably predicts overlapping-epitope antibody pairs. Next, we develop a supervised contrastive fine-tuning framework for antibody large language models which results in embeddings that better correlate with epitope information than those from pre-trained models. Applying this contrastive learning approach to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain antibodies, we achieve 82.7% balanced accuracy in distinguishing same-epitope versus different-epitope antibody pairs and demonstrate the ability to predict relative levels of structural overlap from learning on functional epitope bins (Spearman {rho} = 0.25). Finally, we create AbLang-PDB, a generalized model for predicting overlapping-epitope antibodies for a broad range of protein families. AbLang-PDB achieves five-fold improvement in average precision for predicting overlapping-epitope antibody pairs compared to sequence-based methods, and effectively predicts the amount of epitope overlap among overlapping-epitope pairs ({rho} = 0.81). In an antibody discovery campaign searching for overlapping-epitope antibodies to the HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody 8ANC195, 70% of computationally selected candidates demonstrated HIV-1 specificity, with 50% showing competitive binding with 8ANC195.

We analyzed electrocorticography (ECoG) and local field potentials (LFP) in the visual cortex of human and non-human primates (macaque) to investigate to what extent broadband signals (BB) and narrowband gamma (NBG) oscillations conveyed synergistic or redundant information about images. In both species, the information conveyed by BB signals was highly synergistic within and between visual areas.

Using primary samples from clinical trial patients, we performed detailed phenotypic analyses of bone marrow mononuclear cells from MGUS, SMM, and newly diagnosed MM patients. We found that disease progression is associated with an increase in CD56bright NK cells with a dynamic positive association between this NK cell subset and local tumour burden. We generated a large single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of >100,000 NK cells from healthy donor individuals and plasma cell disorder patients and identify a bone marrow specific CD56bright-like NK cell population (BM-NK) that is enriched in the marrow of MM patients.

While the link between morphology and functional states has been studied extensively, the role of subcellular transcript localization in cellular function remains unclear. Here we use microglia, the brains resident macrophages, as a model to dissect the interaction of morphology, transcript localization, and function. Using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we analyzed transcript distribution and morphology simultaneously in young and aged mouse brains. Our approach revealed how mRNA spatial organization varies across microglial states. We identified distinct transcript localization patterns within microglial processes and uncovered morphological heterogeneity within transcriptomically defined populations. Notably, we found a subpopulation of disease-associated microglia with a ramified morphology (displaying numerous processes), challenging the conventional assumption between morphology and microglial states. Finally, we found that aging not only alters the distribution of compartmentalized mRNAs but also reshapes their colocalization networks, shifting microglial functions from synaptic maintenance and phagocytic processes in younger brains to migration and catabolic pathways in older brains. Our findings highlight the role of subcellular transcript organization in shaping microglial morphology and function, offering new avenues for studying and modulating microglial states in health, disease, and aging.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

Here, we establish a biochemical analogue of this paradigm using genetically encoded protein oscillators (GEOs) as carrier signals in circuits that enable continuous, real-time FM streaming of single-cell data. GEOs are constructed from evolutionarily diverse MinDE-family ATPase and activator modules that generate fast synthetic protein oscillations when co-expressed in human cells. These oscillations serve as a single-cell carrier signal, with frequency and amplitude controlled by GEO component levels and activity. We systematically characterize 169 ATPase/activator GEO pairs and engineer composite GEOs with multiple competing activators to develop a comprehensive platform for waveform programming. Using these principles, we design circuits that modulate GEO frequency in response to cellular activity and decode their responses using a calibrated machine-learning model to demonstrate sensitive, real-time FM streaming of transcription and proteasomal degradation dynamics in single cells. GEOs establish a dynamically controllable biochemical carrier signal, unlocking noise-resistant FM data-encoding paradigms that open new avenues for dynamic single-cell analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

Here we show that although TRF2 is indispensable for the proliferation and survival of mouse neural stem cells (mNSCs), surprisingly, this is due to non telomeric transcriptional function of TRF2, and not telomere protection. Complementing recent work showing TRF2 is dispensable for telomere protection in pluripotent stem cells. Deletion of TRF2 in adult mNSCs (TRF2fl/fl, Nestin Cre) resulted in markedly reduced proliferation and impaired differentiation into neurons. However, telomere dysregulation induced DNA damage was not observed, as indicated by the unaltered DNA damage response. Similarly, in SHSY5Y cells, TRF2 depletion induced differentiation without causing telomere dysfunction. Mechanistically, nontelomeric TRF2 directly binds to the promoters of key genes that regulate differentiation. TRF2 dependent recruitment of the polycomb repressor complex (PRC2) and subsequent H3K27 trimethylation repress differentiation associated genes, thereby maintaining NSC identity. Interestingly, G quadruplex (G4) motifs are necessary for TRF2 binding. Disrupting the TRF2 G4 interaction, either through G4 binding ligands or the G4 specific helicase DHX36 induces differentiation genes, thereby promoting neurogenesis. These findings reveal a pivotal non-telomeric role of TRF2 in NSC survival, providing key mechanistic insights into neurogenesis with implications for aging related neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

India remains a rich resource for population genomics studies with many small and socioculturally homogeneous communities whose origins and demographic histories are largely unknown. In this study, we analysed such a small Sindhi settlement in the Thane district in Maharashtra of West coast India using genome-wide autosomal SNP data using both frequency- and haplotype-based approaches. Our analyses suggest that the West coast Indian Sindhi community is very unique and has significant population affinity with a group more closely related to the Pakistani Burusho than to the Pakistani Sindhi, as it has an additional East/Southeast Asian component. Furthermore, the sharing of haplotype and IBD suggests recent gene flow from the local Konkani population on the west coast of India into Indian Sindhi. Admixture modelling suggested that Indian Sindhi admixture with the East/Southeast Asian source group could be 40-50 GBP, explaining their current unique demographics. However, apart from this additional admixture, they share the basic genetic composition of the Pakistan/NWI groups, as reflected in PCA, outgroup F3 and IBD sharing. These new findings suggest that Indian Sindhi settlement from the Thane in Maharashtra in West coast of India derive their genetic ancestry not directly from Pakistani Sindhis but from other groups related to Burusho in Pakistan. The study therefore encourages further research to identify the heterogeneous nature of migrations to the Indian subcontinent and thus further decipher its unique demographics.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

How new KZFPs emerge in response to ERV invasions is currently unknown.

Our data supports a model by which new ERV integrations within young KZFP gene clusters likely promoted recombination events leading to the emergence of new KZFPs that repress them.

Here, we used synaptic partner matching in the Drosophila olfactory circuit to address this question. By systematically altering the combination of differentially expressed CSPs in a single olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) type, which senses a male pheromone that inhibits male-male courtship, we switched its connection from its endogenous postsynaptic projection neuron (PN) type nearly completely to a new PN type that promotes courtship. To achieve this switch, we deduced a combinatorial code including CSPs that mediate both attractive and repulsive interactions between synaptic partners. The anatomical switch changed the odor response of the new PN partner and markedly increased male-male courtship. We generalized three manipulation strategies from this rewiring to successfully rewire a second ORN type to multiple distinct PN types. This work demonstrates that manipulating a small set of CSPs is sufficient to respecify synaptic connections, paving ways to explore how neural systems evolve through changes of circuit connectivity.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

Given the accelerating human impact on ecosystems worldwide, understanding how populations evolve after a genetic bottleneck is becoming increasingly important for species conservation. Ash deposits from the 2022 Hunga volcanic eruption in the Southwest Pacific led to a drastic decline of animal symbioses associated with hydrothermal vents in this region, allowing insights into the effects of population bottlenecks in the deep sea. Here, we applied metagenomic sequencing to pre- and post-eruption samples of mollusk-microbial symbioses from the Lau Basin to investigate patterns of genetic variation and effective population size. Our data indicate that animal host populations currently show only small changes in genome-wide diversity but in most cases experienced a long-term decline in effective size that was likely intensified by the volcanic impact. By contrast, symbiont populations exhibited a notable decrease in genomic variation, including loss of certain habitat-specific strains. However, detection of environmental symbiont sequences suggests that lost strain diversity might be recovered from the free-living symbiont pool. The differences between host and symbiont populations might be related to their contrasting genetic structures and levels of gene flow, although the full extent of population bottlenecks in the host animals might only be recognizable after a few generations. These results add to our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of animal-microbe populations following a natural disturbance and help assess their resilience to potential future anthropogenic impacts.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

Treatment of the rps6a mutant with various concentrations of auxin and its analogues did not restore the root defect phenotype, suggesting a defect in the auxin signalling pathway.

Although determining their relative weight is made difficult by discrepancies between palaeontological and neontological data4, mammalian tooth morphology may bridge the gap between fossil record and laboratory observations. Fossils indicate that placentals and marsupials diversified after evolving molars bearing more cusps5-7, which emerge through the iterative signalling of enamel knots8,9. However, this theoretical evo-devo model of mammalian tooth evolution has not been explicitly assessed on empirical data. Here, by combining the fossil record with laboratory experiments, we identify a shared developmental basis for the convergent, ratcheted evolution of increasingly complex molars in arvicoline rodents (voles, lemmings, muskrats). Longer, narrower molars lead to more cusps throughout development and deep time, suggesting a developmental driver for tooth evolution. Both the arvicoline fossil record and vole tooth development show slower transitions toward the highest cusp counts. This newly identified pattern suggests that the developmental processes fuelling the evolution of increasingly complex molars may also limit the potential for further complexity increases. Integrating palaeontological and developmental data shows that long-term evolutionary trends can be accurately explained by the simple tinkering of developmental pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

Cell fate segregation proceeds in a gradual manner encompassing two rounds of cell division, as well as cell positional and morphological changes. While it is known that the activity of the Hippo signaling pathway and the subcellular localization of its downstream effector YAP dictate lineage specific gene expression, the response of YAP to these dynamic cellular changes remains incompletely understood. Here we address these questions by quantitative live imaging of endogenously tagged YAP while simultaneously monitoring geometric cellular features and cell cycle progression throughout cell fate segregation. We apply a probabilistic model to our dynamic data, providing a quantitative characterization of the mutual effects of YAP and cellular relative exposed area, which has previously been shown to correlate with subcellular YAP localization in fixed samples. Additionally, we study how nuclear YAP levels are influenced by other factors, such as the decreasing pool of maternally provided YAP that is partitioned to daughter cells through cleavage divisions, cell cycle-associated nuclear volume changes, and a delay after divisions in adjusting YAP levels to new cell positions. Interestingly, we find that establishing low nuclear YAP levels required for the inner cell mass fate is largely achieved by passive cell cycle-associated mechanisms. Moreover, contrary to expectations, we find that mechanical perturbations that result in cell shape changes do not influence YAP localization in the embryo. Together our work identifies how various inputs are integrated over a dynamic developmental time course to shape the levels of a key molecular determinant of the first cell fate choice.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

Herein, we report the discovery of S-892216, a second-generation SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease (3CLpro) inhibitor, to treat COVID-19. S-892216 is a reversible covalent 3CLpro inhibitor with highly potent antiviral activity and an EC50 value of 2.48 nM against SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Structure-based design of a covalent modifier for compound 1 revealed that introducing a nitrile warhead increased 3CLpro inhibition activity by 180-fold. Subsequent optimization efforts yielded S-892216, which combined a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and high off-target selectivity. S-892216 exhibited antiviral activity against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants, with no cross-resistance to major mutations reducing antiviral activities of nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir. In SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, S-892216 inhibited viral replication in the lungs similar to ensitrelvir, although at a 30-fold lower dose.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

An emerging consensus is to reduce the potential immunogenicity of such therapies by instead using human protein domains. However, as we engineer these human-derived proteins, we create nonhuman peptides at the linkers or junctions between domains and at mutated residues within them, which still pose a risk of immunogenicity that has largely been left unaddressed. Here, we present a modular workflow to simultaneously optimize the functions of proteins and minimize their immunogenic risk using existing machine learning models that predict protein function and nonhuman peptide immunogenicity from their sequences. We first applied this workflow to existing transcriptional activation and bio-orthogonal RNA binding domains. Then we generated a set of small molecule-controllable transcription factors with human-derived zinc finger DNA-binding domains for targeting orthogonal non-genomic DNA sequences. Finally, we established a workflow for creating deimmunized zinc finger arrays to target arbitrary genomic DNA sequences and used it to upregulate expression of two therapeutically relevant genes, UTRN and SCN1A. Our future-proof, modular workflow offers a proof of principle for making cell and gene therapies safer and more efficacious through dual-objective protein optimization using state-of-the-art algorithms.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

Fully harnessing its potential requires the use of advanced computational methodologies, which are often available only through proprietary software. This limitation restricts flexibility and accessibility for academic researchers and small biotech companies, hindering the growth of the technology. Here, we present DELi, an open-source DEL informatics platform designed for library design, NGS decoding and calling, and enrichment analysis. To showcase its capabilities, we used DELi to design an in-house custom library (UNC-DEL006), a benzimidazole-based DEL, and performed proof-of-concept selection experiments against Bromodomain-containing Protein 4 (BRD4). The DELi decoding and analysis modules identified top-performing compounds, leading to the off-DNA synthesis of UNC 002-080, which was confirmed as a nanomolar BRD4 binder via isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). In contrast, a chemically similar compound not prioritized by DELi, UNC 002-083, showed no measurable binding. These results demonstrate DELi as an effective tool for DEL design and analysis. Further, its open-source nature will promote ongoing development and contributions from the DEL community to expand its applications and capabilities.

We also identify the intracellular (IC) domain of RLP23 as crucial for ensuring compatibility and efficacy during heterologous expression. Targeted engineering of the IC domain significantly enhances RLP23 potential utility, enabling transfer of robust resistance against bacterial, fungal, and oomycete pathogens to other plants without compromising yield.

However, our study reveals a systematic failure of both technologies to sequence and assemble specific exons of Drosophila melanogaster genes, indicating an overlooked limitation. Namely, multiple Y-linked exons are nearly or completely absent from raw reads produced by deep sequencing with state-of-the-art Nanopore (10.4 flow cells, 200x coverage) and PacBio (HiFi 50x). The same exons are accurately assembled using Illumina 65x coverage. We found that these missing exons are consistently located near simple satellite sequences, where sequencing fails at multiple levels: read initiation (very few reads start within satellite regions), read elongation (satellite-containing reads are shorter on average), and base-calling (quality scores drop as sequencing enters a satellite sequence). These findings challenge the assumption that long-read technologies is unbiased and reveal a critical barrier to assembling sequences near repetitive regions. As large-scale sequencing projects move towards telomere-to-telomere assemblies in a wide range of organisms, recognizing and addressing these biases will be important to achieving truly complete and accurate genomes. Additionally, the underrepresented Y-linked exons provides a valuable benchmark for refining those sequencing technologies while improving the assembly of the highly heterochromatic and often neglected Drosophila Y chromosome.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

Unbiased analyses of IDRome-spanning grammars reveals that specialized IDR grammar features direct biological processes, cellular localization preferences, and molecular functions. IDRs with exceptional grammars, defined as sequences with high-scoring non-random features, are harbored in proteins and complexes that enable spatial and temporal sorting of biochemical activities.

We discovered that microglia exhibited the most pronounced age-related changes of all cell types and that their transcriptional signatures pointed to enhanced neuroprotective immune activation and reduced lipid-droplet accumulation compared to hippocampal microglia. Furthermore, cerebellar microglia in aged mice, compared to young mice, were found in closer proximity to granule cells. This relationship was characterized using the newly defined neuron-associated microglia score, which captures proximity-dependent transcriptional changes and suggests a novel microglial responsiveness.

While various genome mining tools can identify and characterize gene clusters, they often overlook their evolutionary diversity, a crucial factor in revealing novel cluster functions and applications. To address this gap, we developed GATOR-GC, a targeted genome mining tool that enables comprehensive and flexible exploration of gene clusters in a single execution. We show that GATOR-GC identified a diversity of over 4 million gene clusters similar to experimentally validated biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that other tools fail to detect. To highlight the utility of GATOR-GC, we identified previously uncharacterized co-occurring conserved genes potentially involved in mycosporine-like amino acid biosynthesis and mapped the taxonomic and evolutionary patterns of genomic islands that modify DNA with 7-deazapurines. Additionally, with its proximity-weighted similarity scoring, GATOR-GC successfully differentiated BGCs of the FK-family of metabolites (e.g., rapamycin, FK506/520) according to their chemistries. We anticipate GATOR-GC will be a valuable tool to assess gene cluster diversity for targeted, exploratory, and flexible genome mining.

Studies focused on identifying different species of bat CoVs may have information cardinal for effective prevention and control of emerging zoonotic diseases.  We conducted a systematic review using selected keywords (Surveillance, detection, identification, discovery, isolation, characterization, molecular methods, and Bat coronaviruses) to evaluate molecular studies on CoVs in bats. A total of 790 articles were found using the advanced search strategy of the PubMed database. Following the selection criteria, a total of 127 articles were finally chosen for full-text evaluation. Out of the total of 54 countries examined, China emerged as the country with the highest number of studies, accounting for 26% (n = 33).  The sample categories consisted of faecal, urine, guano, blood, tissues, oral, and rectal swabs.  The molecular detection approaches included polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques using species-specific, genus-specific, or broad-range primers. Approximately 94.5% (n = 120) of studies used PCR assays that amplified the partial RdRp gene of length ranging from 123 to 440 bp, followed by amplicon sequencing using either Sanger or next-generation sequencing technologies. Full genome sequencing was only performed in approximately 33.9% (n = 43), with metagenomics approaches being used in 15.7% (n = 20) of the studies. The higher positivity rate of bat CoVs were detected in Asia. Globally, the most predominant bat species which tested positive for CoVs were Rhinolophus, Myotis, Miniopterus, Scotophilus, Eidolon, Chaerephon, Hipposideros, and Desmodus. Continuous bat coronavirus surveillance using molecular methods and full genome sequencing is of utmost importance in detecting and characterizing viruses at molecular level and establishing the genetic diversity of new and circulating viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

Whether TSLP or IL-33 have a role in EoE and whether their activities are distinct requires further investigation.

MethodsExperimental EoE was induced in wild type (WT) Il33-/-and Crlf2-/- mice. TSLP or IL-5 were neutralized using antibodies. Esophageal histopathology was determined by H&E, anti-Ki67, anti-CD31 and anti-MBP staining. Esophageal RNA was subjected to RNA sequencing. Bone marrow-derived MCs were activated with TSLP and IL-13 was determined (ELISA)

ResultsTSLP and IL-33 were overexpressed in human and experimental EoE. Human and mouse esophageal MCs displayed the highest level of Crlf2 (TSLPR) compared to other immune cells. Crlf2-/- mice were nearly-completely protected from EoE, and TSLP neutralization resulted in decreased basal cell proliferation, eosinophilia, lamina propria thickening and vascularization. Induction of experimental EoE in Il33-/- mice resulted in reduced eosinophilia but no alterations in tissue remodeling were observed compared to WT mice. RNA sequencing revealed that TSLP regulates the expression of key genes associated with human EoE (e.g. eotaxins, Il19, Klk5, Flg, Il36rn, Il1r2) and suggest a role for TSLP in regulating IL-1 signaling, barrier integrity and epithelial cell differentiation. Experimental EoE was characterized by a MC-associated gene signature and elevated MCs. Activation of MCs with TSLP resulted in secretion of IL-13.

ConclusionTSLP and IL-33 have non-redundant functions in experimental EoE. This study highlights TSLP as an upstream regulator of IL-13 and a potential therapeutic target for EoE.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

In particular, how QDR against a generalist necrotrophic pathogen evolved and whether it is driven by conserved or species-specific regulatory networks remains unclear. Here, we examined the transcriptomic responses of five diverse wild tomato species that span a gradient of QDR. We initially hypothesised that conserved regulatory modules might control QDR. Instead, we use differential gene expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to find that species-specific regulatory features, encompassing both infection-induced and constitutively expressed genes, predominantly shape QDR levels. Although we identified an ethylene response factor among candidate genes for QDR-regulation, it did not fully account for the phenotypic variation. To further dissect the evolutionary basis of these regulatory patterns, we performed phylotranscriptomic analyses on gene regulatory networks. Notably, our findings reveal that the conserved NAC transcription factor 29 is pivotal in developing disease resistance only in S. pennellii. The differential regulation and altered downstream signalling pathways of NAC29 provide evidence for its co-option in the resistance mechanisms of S. pennellii. This finding highlights the species-specific rewiring of gene regulatory networks by repurposing a conserved regulatory element to enhance resistance against pathogens effectively. These results offer new insights into the evolutionary and regulatory complexity underlying QDR and emphasise the significance of species-specific gene regulation in shaping resistance against a cosmopolitan necrotrophic pathogen.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

We demonstrate how co-expression networks measured by Smoothie enable precise gene module detection, functional annotation of uncharacterized genes, linkage of gene expression to genome architecture, and multi-sample comparisons to assess stable or dynamic gene expression patterns across tissues, conditions, and time points. Overall, Smoothie provides a scalable and versatile framework for extracting deep biological insights from high-resolution spatial transcriptomics data.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

RepTiles reduced the burden associated with the manual design of long DNA from standard biological parts. We are applying RepTiles to the construction of random DNA segments that will form part of a neochromosome in Physcomitrium patens. RepTiles has a base DNA collection of 52 1.7 kb chemically synthesised Phytobricks mini-chunks. We provide a user-friendly web application that facilitates the design of DNA assemblies based on the base collection. The system generates assembly plans for generating chunks using Golden Braid. The resulting chunks can then be assembled into megachunks using Transformation Associated Recombination cloning. It thus supports the generation of ultra-long synthetic DNA from phytobricks, contributing to the vision of synthetic plant genomics from modular parts to complete genomes.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

Structure determination by single particle cryo-EM is premised on randomly orientated particles embedded in thin layer of vitreous ice to resolve high-resolution structural information in all directions. Otherwise, preferentially distributed particle orientations will lead to anisotropic resolution of the structure. Here we established a deconvolution approach, named AR-Decon, to computationally improve the quality of three-dimensional maps with anisotropic resolutions reconstructed from datasets with preferred orientations. We have tested and validated the procedure with both synthetic and experimental datasets and compared its performance with alternative machine-learning based methods.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

How these processes contribute to translating genetic dispositions into observed academic achievement remains critically under-investigated. Here, we examined the role of non-cognitive skills--e.g., motivation, attitudes and self-regulation--in mediating education-associated genetic effects on academic achievement across development. Data were collected from 5,016 children enrolled in the Twins Early Development Study at ages 7, 9, 12, and 16, as well as their parents and teachers. We found that non-cognitive skills mediated polygenic score effects on academic achievement across development, and longitudinally, accounting for up to 64% of the total effects. Within-family analyses highlighted the contribution of non-cognitive skills beyond genetic, environmental and demographic factors that are shared between siblings, accounting for up to 83% of the total mediation effect, likely reflecting evocative/active gene-environment correlation. Our results underscore the role of non-cognitive skills in academic development in how children evoke and select experiences that align with their genetic propensity.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

To estimate gene expression heritability, standard models require a single gene expression value per individual, forcing data from single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments to be ""pseudobulked"". Here, we show that applying standard heritability models to pseudobulk data overestimates gene expression heritability and produces inflated false positive rates for detecting cis-heritable genes. Therefore, we introduce a new method called scGeneHE (single cell Gene expression Heritability Estimation), a Poisson mixed-effects model that quantifies the cis-genetic component of gene expression using individual cellular profiles. In simulations, scGeneHE has a consistently well-calibrated false positive rate for eGene detection and unbiasedly estimates cis-heritability at many parameter settings. We applied scGeneHE to scRNA-seq data from 969 individuals, 11 immune cell types, and 822,552 cells from the OneK1K cohort to infer cell-type-specificity of genetic regulation at risk genes for immune-mediated diseases and trace the fluctuation of cis-heritability across cellular populations of varying resolution. In summary, we developed a new statistical method that resolves the analytical challenge of estimating gene expression cis-heritability from native scRNA-seq data.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

We found that mScarlet3 fluorescence in E. coli reversibly decreased by 21% in the presence of a 60 mT magnetic field, the largest magnetic field effect (MFE) reported in any fluorescent protein. Purified mScarlet3 did not show an MFE, but addition of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and simultaneous illumination with blue and yellow light restored the MFE. Through extensive photophysical experiments, we developed a quantitative model of the giant MFE in mScarlet3-FMN mixtures. The key reaction step involved electron transfer from fully reduced FMNH2 to triplet-state mScarlet3, to form a triplet spin-correlated radical pair. The magnetic field then controlled the branching ratio between singlet recombination vs. triplet separation. Our quantitative model of the mScarlet3-FMN photocycle provides a framework for design and optimization of magnetic field-sensitive proteins, opening possibilities in fluorescent protein-based magnetometry, magnetic imaging, and magnetogenetic control.","NA","biorxiv",1741126120894

C_LIO_LIBy investigating the colonisation of Arabidopsis thaliana by the highly polyphagous peach-potato aphid (Myzus persicae), we identified cell wall-derived DAMPs, specifically oligogalacturonides (OGs), as key in inducing DTI against aphids. The OG-responsive immune components BAK1/BKK1, CPK5/CPK6, GRP3, and EDS1 collectively contribute to DTI limiting aphid colonisation.
C_LIO_LIWe found that aphids limit OG production during feeding. Additionally, the salivary chemosensory protein (CSP) effector Mp10/CSP4, which is known to be delivered into the cytoplasm of plant cells early in aphid attack, inhibits OG-induced DTI.
C_LIO_LIWhile Mp10 suppresses OG-induced DTI, it also interacts with EDS1-mediated defences, enhancing aphid fecundity in the absence of EDS1 but restoring OG responsiveness under attack, revealing its broader role in immune modulation and effector-driven host adaptation.
