Several experimental techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can, in principle, determine conformational states, binding configurations and their probabilities, but suffer from low throughput. Here we develop a Biomolecular Emulator (BioEmu), a generative deep learning system that can generate thousands of statistically independent samples from the protein structure ensemble per hour on a single graphical processing unit. By leveraging novel training methods and vast data of protein structures, over 200 milliseconds of MD simulation, and experimental protein stabilities, BioEmu's protein ensembles represent equilibrium in a range of challenging and practically relevant metrics. Qualitatively, BioEmu samples many functionally relevant conformational changes, ranging from formation of cryptic pockets, over unfolding of specific protein regions, to large-scale domain rearrangements. Quantitatively, BioEmu samples protein conformations with relative free energy errors around 1 kcal/mol, as validated against millisecond-timescale MD simulation and experimentally-measured protein stabilities. By simultaneously emulating structural ensembles and thermodynamic properties, BioEmu reveals mechanistic insights, such as the causes for fold destabilization of mutants, and can efficiently provide experimentally-testable hypotheses.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

With no known effective FDA-approved treatments for either condition, patient-reported outcomes of treatments are invaluable for guiding management strategies in patient care and generating new avenues for research. Here, we present the results of an ME/CFS and Long COVID treatment survey with responses from 3,925 patients. We assessed the experiences of these patients with more than 150 treatments, as well as their demographics, symptoms, and comorbidities. Patients with each condition who participated in the study shared similar symptom profiles, including all the core symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g., 89.7% of ME/CFS and 79.4% of Long COVID reported post-exertional malaise (PEM). Treatments with the greatest perceived benefits were identified, which had varied effects on different core symptoms. In addition, treatment responses were significantly correlated (R{superscript 2} = 0.68) between the two patient groups. Patient subgroups with distinct profiles of symptoms and comorbidities showed varied responses to treatments, e.g., a POTS-dominant cluster benefiting from autonomic modulators and a cognitive-dysfunction cluster from CNS stimulants. This study underscores the symptomatic and therapeutic similarities between ME/CFS and Long COVID and highlights the commonalities and nuanced complexities of infection-associated chronic diseases and related conditions. Insights from patient-reported experiences, in the absence of approved treatments, provide urgently needed real-world evidence for targeted therapies in patient care and for developing future clinical trials.

Traditionally linked to genomic imprinting, these effects are believed to have evolved from parental conflict over resource allocation to offspring, which results in opposing parental genetic influences. Despite their potential importance, POEs remain heavily understudied in complex traits, largely due to the lack of parental genomes.

Here, we present a multi-step approach to infer the parent-of-origin of alleles without parental genomes, leveraging inter-chromosomal phasing, mitochondrial and chromosome X data, and sibling-based crossover inference. Applied to the UK Biobank (discovery cohort) and Estonian Biobank (replication cohort), this scalable approach enabled parent-of-origin inference for up to 221,062 individuals, representing the largest dataset of its kind.

GWAS scans for more than 60 complex traits and over 2,400 protein levels contrasting maternal and paternal effects identified over 30 novel POEs and confirmed more than 50% of testable known associations. Notably, approximately half of our POEs exhibited a bipolar pattern, where maternal and paternal alleles exert conflicting effects. These effects were particularly prevalent for traits related to growth (e.g., IGF-1, height, fat-free mass) and metabolism (e.g., type 2 diabetes, triglycerides, glucose). Replication in the Estonian Biobank validated over 70% of testable associations.

Overall, our findings shed new light on the influence of POEs on diverse complex traits and align with the parental conflict hypothesis, providing compelling evidence for this understudied evolutionary phenomenon.","NA","medrxiv",1733695755003

More recently, AlphaFold2 (AF2) has been adapted for the prediction of multiple structural conformations in addition to single-state structures. This novel avenue of research has focused on proteins (typically 50 residues in length or greater), while multi-conformation prediction of shorter peptides has not yet been explored in this context. Here, we report AF2-based structural conformation prediction of a total of 557 peptides (ranging in length from 10 to 40 residues) for a benchmark dataset with corresponding nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-determined conformational ensembles. De novo structure predictions were accompanied by structural comparison analyses to assess prediction accuracy. We found that the prediction of conformational ensembles for peptides with AF2 varied in accuracy versus NMR data, with average root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) among structured regions under 2.5 [A] and average root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) differences under 1.5 [A]. Our results reveal notable capabilities of AF2-based structural conformation prediction for peptides but also underscore the necessity for interpretation discretion.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

This escape has been attributed to mutations in critical neutralizing antibody epitopes mainly in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. Here we show that this notion is incomplete. We found that several broadly neutralizing human antibodies isolated over the past years retain an almost undiminished capacity for inhibitory targeting of RBDs of recent highly immunoevasive SARS-CoV-2 strains. Likewise, human sera collected during the pre-Omicron era from persons immunized with original Wuhan-based vaccines were found to contain abundant neutralizing activity targeted against the RBDs of modern Omicron variants. However, this unexpected neutralization sensitivity was observed only when these RBDs were incorporated into a mismatched spike protein backbone, whereas the corresponding native Omicron spike proteins were highly resistant against the same panel of antibodies and human sera. We conclude that changes occurring outside of the RBD and leading to altered conformational dynamics of the spike protein have played a key part in the viral evolution enabling SARS-CoV-2 to escape from neutralizing antibodies that target highly conserved cryptic RBD epitopes.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

The result is a genomic network that describes the conditionally independent genetic associations between traits that remain when controlling for shared signal with the broader network of traits. Graph theory metrics provide added insight by formally quantifying the most important traits in the genomic network. GNA can discover additional trait-specific pathways by incorporating gene expression or genetic variants into the network to estimate their conditional associations with each trait.

Application to a diverse set of traits demonstrate that GNA yields critical insight into the genetic architecture that demarcate genetically overlapping traits at varying levels of biological granularity.","NA","medrxiv",1733695755003

However, little is known about what causes macrophages to choose trogocytosis versus phagocytosis. Here, we report that cortical tension of target cells is a key regulator of macrophage trogocytosis. At low tension, macrophages will preferentially trogocytose antibody-opsonized cells, while at high tension they tend towards phagocytosis. Using model vesicles, we demonstrate that macrophages will rapidly switch from trogocytosis to phagocytosis when membrane tension is increased. Stiffening the cortex of target cells also biases macrophages to phagocytose them, a trend that can be countered by increasing antibody surface density and is captured in a mechanical model of trogocytosis. This work suggests that a distinct molecular pathway for trogocytosis is not required to explain differences in trogocytosis among target cell types and points to a mechanism for target cells to modulate trogocytosis.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

We utilized this framework to assess the energy of functional brain networks under cognitive control and to understand how energy is allocated across canonical functional networks during various cognitive control tasks. We extracted network energy from functional connectivity patterns of subjects who underwent fMRI scans during cognitive tasks involving working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility, in addition to task-free scans. We found that the energy of the whole-brain network increases when exposed to cognitive control tasks compared to the task-free resting state, which serves as a reference point. The brain selectively allocates this elevated energy to canonical functional networks; sensory networks receive more energy to support flexibility for processing sensory stimuli, while cognitive networks relevant to the task, functioning efficiently, require less energy. Furthermore, employing network energy, as a global network measure, improves the performance of predictive modeling, particularly in classifying cognitive control tasks and predicting chronological age. Our results highlight the robustness of this framework and the utility of network energy in understanding brain and cognitive mechanisms, including its promising potential as a biomarker for mental conditions and neurological disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

These models aggregate individuals into compartments, often stratified by characteristics to represent groups that might be intervention targets or otherwise of particular concern. Ideally, model calculation could occur at the most demanding resolution for the overall analysis, but this may be infeasible due to availability of computational resources or empirical data. Instead, detailed population age-structure might be consolidated into broad categories such as children, working-age adults, and seniors. Researchers must then discretise key epidemic parameters, like the infection-fatality ratio, for these lower resolution groups. After estimating outcomes for those crude groups, follow on analyses, such as calculating years of life lost (YLLs), may need to distribute or weight those low-resolution outcomes back to the high resolution. The specific calculation for these aggregation and disaggregation steps can substantially influence outcomes.

To assist researchers with these tasks, we developed paramix, an R package which simplifies the transformations between high and low resolution. We demonstrate applying paramix to a common discretisation analysis: using age structured models for health economic calculations comparing YLLs. We compare how estimates vary between paramix and several alternatives for an archetypal model, including comparison to a high resolution benchmark. We consistently found that paramix yielded the most similar estimates to the high-resolution model, for the same computational burden of low-resolution models. In our illustrative analysis, the non-paramix methods estimated up to twice as many YLLs averted as the paramix approach, which would likely lead to a similarly large impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios used in economic evaluations.

Author summaryResearchers use infectious disease models to understand trends in disease spread, including predicting future infections under different interventions. Constraints like data availability and numerical complexity drive researchers to group individuals into broad categories; for example, all working age adults might be represented as a single set of model compartments. Key epidemic parameters can vary widely across such groups. Additionally, model outcomes calculated using these broad categories often need to be disaggregated to a high resolution, for example a precise age at death for calculating years life lost, a key measure when estimating the cost-effectiveness of interventions. To satisfy these needs, we present a software package, paramix, which provides tools to move between high and low resolution data. In this paper, we demonstrate the capabilities of paramix by comparing various methods of calculating deaths and years of life lost across broad age groups. For an analysis of an archetypal model, we find paramix best matches a high-resolution model, while the alternatives are substantially different.","NA","medrxiv",1733695755003

In PDAC, both cell types stimulate macropinocytosis as an adaptive response to glutamine depletion. CAFs play a critical role in sculpting the tumor microenvironment, yet how adaptations to metabolic stress impact the stromal architecture remains elusive. In this study, we find that macropinocytosis functions to control CAF subtype identity when glutamine is limiting. Our data demonstrate that metabolic stress leads to an intrinsic inflammatory CAF (iCAF) program driven by MEK/ERK signaling. Utilizing in vivo models, we find that blocking macropinocytosis alters CAF subtypes and reorganizes the tumor stroma. Importantly, these changes in stromal architecture can be exploited to sensitize PDAC to immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Our findings demonstrate that metabolic stress plays a role in shaping the tumor microenvironment, and that this attribute can be harnessed for therapeutic impact.

Specific deletion of the Ifngr1 in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) greatly expanded the intratumoral lymphatic network and drove the emergence of a tip-like endothelial state, promoting lymph node metastasis but not dendritic cell migration.

However, despite developments in sensor technology, machine learning, and statistical methods, a general AI-assisted data-to-inference pipeline has yet to emerge.
C_LIO_LIWe argue that this is, in part, due to a lack of clarity around several decisions in existing workflows, including: the choice of classifier used (e.g., semi- vs. fully automated); how classifier confidence scores are used and interpreted; and the availability and selection of appropriate statistical methods for drawing ecological inferences.
C_LIO_LIHere, we attempt to conceptualise a general workflow associated with automated tools in ecology. We motivate this perspective using our experiences with occupancy modelling using monitoring data collected through passive acoustic monitoring and camera trapping, identifying priority areas for future developments.

We describe how different error types arise from both sensor-based monitoring and from classifiers themselves; how different error types are handled at each stage of the workflow; and finally, implications and opportunities associated with deciding on methods used at each step of the pipeline.
C_LIO_LIWe recommend that ""black box"" tools like neural network classification algorithms should be embraced in ecology, but widespread uptake requires more formal integration of AI into the existing ecological inference workflows. Like ecological AI more broadly, however, successful development of new data-to-inference pipelines is a multidisciplinary endeavour that requires input from everyone invested in collecting, processing, analysing, and using ecological monitoring data.

This isolated colony inhabits a warmer climate zone, akin to the predicted future environments of polar bears with vastly reduced sea ice habitats, rendering this population of bears particularly important. Over two-thirds of polar bears will be extinct by 2050 with total extinction predicted by the end of this century and understanding possible mechanisms of adaptation via genomic analyses and preservation are critical. Transposable elements (TEs) are parasitic mobile elements that may play a role in an adaptive response to environmental challenges. We analysed transcriptome data from polar bear sub-populations in North-East and South-East Greenland (NEG, SEG), who reside in cooler and warmer habitats respectively, to identify differentially expressed, divergent TE species, TE families and linked changes in gene expression with some overlapping significantly differentially expressed TEs and genes. We identified activity hotspots in the genome of regions with significantly differentially expressed TEs. LINE family TEs were the most abundant, and most differentially expressed and divergent in the SEG population compared to reference TEs. Our results provide insights into how a genomic response at the TE level may allow the SEG subpopulations adapt and survive to climate change and provides a useful resource for conservation in polar bears.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

Moreover, we identified secreted factors that enable a pair of thermosensory neurons (AFD) to communicate with the germline and trace the path of the epigenetic signal.

Force generated by beating cilia propels cells and moves fluids. The ciliary skeleton is made of peripheral doublet microtubules and a central pair (CP) with a distinct structure at the tip. In this study, we present a high-resolution structure of the CP in the ciliary tip of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila and identify several tip proteins that bind and form unique patterns on both microtubules of the tip CP. Two of those proteins that contain tubulin polymerization-promoting protein (TPPP)-like domains, TLP1 and TLP2, bind to high curvature regions of the microtubule. TLP2, which contains two TPPP-like domains, is an unusually long protein that wraps laterally around half a microtubule and forms the bridge between the two microtubules. Moreover, we found that the conserved protein SPEF1 binds to both microtubule seams. In vitro, human SPEF1 not only binds to the microtubule seam but also crosslinks two parallel microtubules. Single-molecule microtubule dynamics assays indicate that SPEF1 stabilizes microtubules in vitro. Together, these data show that the proteins in the tip CP maintain stable microtubule structure and probably play important roles in maintaining the integrity of the axoneme.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

Net1 mRNA accumulates at DEJ protrusion-like structures that interact with the basement membrane and connect to a mechanosensitive network of microfibrils. Disrupting Net1 mRNA localization in mouse epithelium alters DEJ morphology and keratinocyte-matrix connections, affecting tissue homeostasis. mRNA localization dictates Net1 protein distribution and its function as a RhoA GTPase exchange factor (GEF). Altered RhoA activity is in turn sufficient to alter the ultrastructure of the DEJ. This study provides a high-resolution in vivo view of mRNA targeting in a physiological context. It further demonstrates how the subcellular localization of a single mRNA can significantly influence mammalian epithelial tissue organization, thus revealing an unappreciated level of post-transcriptional regulation that controls tissue physiology.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

Methods Using a population-based panel study of 9,820 adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large, integrated healthcare system, we compared survey-defined ME/CFS-like illness with presence of an ME/CFS diagnosis in the electronic health record (EHR) to evaluate ME/CFS underdiagnosis. Results Of those with survey-defined ME/CFS-like illness, an estimated 97.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 97.1%-98.4%) did not have an ME/CFS diagnosis in the EHR. The group without EHR diagnosis was younger, less likely to identify as white non-Hispanic, and more likely to have developed fatigue in the past three years than the EHR diagnosed group. Both diagnosed and undiagnosed ME/CFS-like illness groups had significantly impaired physical, cognitive, and social functioning, and significantly worse mental health and anxiety than those without ME/CFS-like illness.

Here we demonstrate that Tfh and Th1 lineages acquire distinct de novo DNA methylation programs that are preserved into memory. Using whole genome methylation analyses and deletion of DNA methyltransferase 3a, we found that de novo DNA methylation is required for generating epigenetic programing to enforce lineage commitment and preserve lineage-specific functions during a recall response to infection. Importantly, partial inhibition of de novo methylation using the methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine during priming enhances Tfh cell functionality in primary and secondary responses to viral infection. Together, these findings demonstrate that de novo DNA methylation is critical to balance lineage commitment and functionality of memory CD4+ T cell subsets and reveal novel potential strategies to modulate immune responses to infectious diseases.

Resultshand2-2A-cre and hand2-2A-creERT2 knock-ins crossed with ubiquitous loxP-based Switch reporters led to broad labeling in expected mesodermal and neural crest-derived lineages in cardiac, pectoral fins, pharyngeal arch, liver, intestine, and mesothelial tissues, as well as enteric neurons. Novel patterns of hand2 lineage tracing appeared in venous blood vessels.

Utilizing single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we characterized the diverse molecular landscape of pSI neurons, revealing significant differences in ion channels and hormone regulator genes that may underpin sex-specific aggression. Male GABAergic pSI neurons exhibited remarkable hyperexcitability due to increased Ih currents. Strikingly, modulating HCN1 expression not only adjusted this hyperexcitability but also influenced sexual dimorphism in aggression: silencing HCN1 in the GABAergic pSI neurons reduced male aggression, while its overexpression markedly heightened aggression in females. Furthermore, testosterone was shown to intensify aggression by upregulating HCN1 and remodeling pSI circuits.

Unraveling protein functions is essential for advancements in medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology, enabling the development of targeted therapies, engineered crops, and novel biomaterials. However, this endeavor is challenging due to the complex nature of proteins, requiring sophisticated experimental designs and extended timelines to uncover their specific functions. Public large language models (LLMs), though proficient in natural language processing, struggle with biological sequences due to the unique and intricate nature of biochemical data. These models often fail to accurately interpret and predict the functional and structural properties of proteins, limiting their utility in bioinformatics. To address this gap, we introduce BetaDescribe, a collection of models designed to generate detailed and rich textual descriptions of proteins, encompassing properties such as function, catalytic activity, involvement in specific metabolic pathways, subcellular localizations, and the presence of particular domains. The trained BetaDescribe model receives protein sequences as input and outputs a textual description of these properties. BetaDescribe's starting point was the LLAMA2 model, which was trained on trillions of tokens. Next, we trained our model on datasets containing both biological and English text, allowing biological knowledge to be incorporated. We demonstrate the utility of BetaDescribe by providing descriptions for proteins that share little to no sequence similarity to proteins with functional descriptions in public datasets. We also show that BetaDescribe can be harnessed to conduct in-silico mutagenesis procedures to identify regions important for protein functionality without needing homologous sequences for the inference. Altogether, BetaDescribe offers a powerful tool to explore protein functionality, augmenting existing approaches such as annotation transfer based on sequence or structure similarity.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

In contrast to a majority of species in the phylum Basidiomycota that have tetrapolar mating-type systems, the opportunistic human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans employs a bipolar mating-type system, with two mating types (a and ) determined by a single MAT locus that is unusually large ([~]120 kb) and contains more than 20 genes. While several MAT genes are associated with mating and sexual development, others control conserved cellular processes (e.g. cargo transport and protein synthesis), of which five (MYO2, PRT1, RPL22, RPL39, and RPO41) have been hypothesized to be essential. In this study, through genetic analysis involving sporulation of heterozygous diploid deletion mutants, as well as in some cases construction and analyses of conditional expression alleles of these genes, we confirmed that with the exception of MYO2, both alleles of the other four MAT genes are indeed essential for cell viability. We further showed that while MYO2 is not essential, its function is critical for infectious spore production, faithful cytokinesis, adaptation for growth at high temperature, and pathogenicity in vivo. Our results demonstrate the presence of essential genes in the MAT locus that are divergent between cells of opposite mating types. We discuss possible mechanisms to maintain functional alleles of these essential genes in a rapidly-evolving genomic region in the context of fungal sexual reproduction and mating-type evolution.

IMPORTANCESexual reproduction is essential for long-term evolutionary success. Fungal cell type identity is governed by the MAT locus, which is typically rapidly evolving and highly divergent between different mating types. In this study, we show that the a and  alleles of four genes encoded in the MAT locus of the opportunistic human fungal pathogen C. neoformans are essential. We demonstrate that a fifth gene, MYO2, which had been predicted to be essential, is in fact dispensable for cell viability. However, a functional MYO2 allele is important for cytokinesis and fungal pathogenicity. Our study highlights the need for careful genetic analyses in determining essential genes, which is complementary to high-throughput approaches. Additionally, the presence of essential genes in the MAT locus of C. neoformans provides insights into the function, maintenance, and evolution of these fast-evolving genomic regions.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

Our study aimed to design a multi-serotype Dengue virus vaccine using a computational approach to achieve broad-spectrum immunity. We employed advanced computational tools and algorithms to predict B-cell and T-cell epitopes, ensuring the selection of antigenic targets that provide comprehensive protection against all four serotypes. The methodology included tools for B-cell epitope prediction, tools for MHC class II and I peptide predictions, and tools for toxicity and allergenicity screening to ensure the safety of the vaccine candidates. Our results identified 21 B-cell epitopes, 15 CTL peptides, and 12 HTL peptides, validated for safety regarding toxicity and allergenic potential. The vaccine construct incorporated the adjuvant {beta}-defensin-3 and specific linkers to enhance immunogenicity and stability. Tertiary structure prediction, Ramachandran plot analysis, and stereochemical examination confirmed the stability and quality of the vaccine model.

These findings demonstrate the potential of computational methods in addressing the complex challenges of Dengue virus vaccine development.

We recently identified spontaneous atherosclerosis in the Korat cat breed, characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia and clinical signs of congestive heart failure, ultimately leading to death. Histopathological examination revealed lesions similar to those observed in human atherosclerosis. Given the close genetic relationship among affected cats, we hypothesized a genetic basis for the condition. Methods: We expanded our sample recruitment and employed whole genome sequencing to identify genetic variants associated with the condition. Results: We identified a homozygous XM_003981898.6:c.2406G>A variant specific to the cases in the LDLR gene. This variant is predicted to result in a premature stop codon, XP_003981947.3:p.Trp758*, leading to a truncated LDLR protein that lacks the last 108 amino acids, including the transmembrane and intracellular C-terminal domains. Genotyping this LDLR variant in an additional cohort of 309 Korat cats confirmed its segregation and revealed new affected cats for clinical follow-up. In silico analyses demonstrated that the identified variant appears optimal for gene-editing-based therapeutics. Conclusions: This is the first report of a spontaneous atherosclerosis animal model with an LDLR variant, the most common gene associated with familial hypercholesterolemia in humans. Given that PCSK9, another known hypercholesterolemia gene, has been lost in many mammalian genomes, including cats, our study provides an exciting double knockout model for human atherosclerosis. The affected Korats may also serve as a valuable model for DNA base editing therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

The embryology and biology of pigmentation in the RPE differs from other pigmented tissues such as the hair, skin and iris. The extent to which RPE pigmentation is related to that of other tissues remains unclear, and this study aims to address this knowledge gap. Here, we utilised RPE thickness measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging as a surrogate phenotype for RPE melanin content. We used UK Biobank data to assess the phenotypic relationships between RPE thickness and fundus pigmentation (principally a measure of choroidal pigmentation), hair colour, skin colour, and ability to tan. We subsequently performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic loci associated with RPE thickness. We utilised the obtained genetic data to explore the global and local genetic correlation between RPE thickness and other pigmentation-related traits. We found that RPE thickness is not phenotypically or globally genetically correlated with hair colour, skin colour or ability to tan. Whilst RPE thickness was phenotypically correlated with retinal pigmentation score, there was not significant global genetic correlation. Despite this, variants in key pigmentation loci including TYR, and OCA2-HERC2 were found to be significant in our GWAS of RPE thickness. Furthermore, we identified four genetic regions in which RPE thickness is locally genetically correlated with other pigmentation-related traits, all of which contain protein-coding genes that are central to melanogenesis and melanosome transport. In conclusion, our study supports our assertion that pigmentation plays a role in RPE thickness, and highlights both shared and divergent features of RPE and other pigmentation-related traits.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

Despite transformative advances in dense extracellular recordings, the activity of most cortical neurons remains undetected. Small simulations with known neuron spike times offer critical ground truth data to improve spike sorting. Yet, current simulations underestimate neuronal heterogeneity and connectivity, which can potentially make spike sorting more challenging. We simulated recordings in a detailed large-scale cortical microcircuit model to link spike sorting accuracy to neuronal heterogeneity, evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art spike sorters and examine how spike sorting impacts the retrieval of information encoded in the cortical circuit. We found that modern spike sorters accurately isolated about 15% of neurons within 50 microns of the electrode shank, which contrasts with previous simulated yields but agrees with experiments. Neurons were unresolved because their spike trains were either missed (undersampling) or, when detected, incomplete or merged with other units' (assignment biases). Neuron isolation quality was influenced by both anatomical and physiological factors (selection bias), improving with increased neuron firing rate, spike spatial extent, for neurons in layer 5, and excitatory neurons. We exposed the network to various stimuli to dissociate the impact of these biases on its stimulus discrimination ability. Surprisingly, undersampling did not affect discrimination capacity, but selection and assignment biases nearly reduced it by half. These findings posit realistic models as a complementary method to evaluate and improve spike sorting and, hence, brain activity representations.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

The analysis of the resulting data poses significant challenges due to their sparsity and large volume, and proper statistical methods are required to analyze and extract information from scRNA-Seq datasets. Sample classification based on gene expression data has proven effective and valuable for precision medicine applications. However, standard classification schemas are often not suitable for scRNA-Seq due to its unique characteristics, and new algorithms are required to effectively analyze and classify samples at the single-cell level. In this article, we introduce singleDeep, an end-to-end pipeline that streamlines the analysis of scRNA-Seq data training deep neural networks, enabling robust prediction and characterization of sample phenotypes. To validate the effectiveness of singleDeep, we applied it to make predictions on scRNA-Seq datasets from different conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate strong diagnostic performance, validated both internally and externally. Moreover, compared with traditional machine learning methods applied to pseudobulk data, singleDeep consistently outperformed these approaches. In addition to prediction accuracy, singleDeep provides valuable insights into cell types and gene importance estimation for phenotypic characterization. This functionality provided additional and valuable information in our use cases. For instance, we corroborated that some interferon signature genes are consistently relevant for autoimmunity across all immune cell types in lupus. On the other hand, we discovered that genes linked to dementia have relevant roles in specific brain cell populations, such as APOE in astrocytes.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

We have recently shown that in humans, memory-related processing is a stronger driver of low frequency oscillations than navigation. These findings and others support the idea that low-frequency oscillations are more strongly associated with a general memory function than with a specific role in spatial navigation. However, whether the low-frequency oscillations that support episodic memory and those during navigation could still share some similar functional roles remains unclear. In this study, patients undergoing intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) monitoring performed a navigation task in which they navigated and performed internally directed route replay, similar to episodic memory. We trained a random forest classification model to use patterns in low-frequency power (2-12 Hz) to learn the position during navigation and subsequently used the same model to successfully decode position during mental simulation. We show that removal of background differences in power between navigation and mental simulation is critical to detecting the overlapping patterns. These results suggest that the low-frequency oscillations that emerge during navigation are more associated with a role in memory than specifically with a navigation related function.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

These plants acquire water and nutrients from their hosts through a specialized organ called the haustorium. A critical process in the formation and function of the haustorium involves cell wall modification. In this study, we identified and analyzed the evolutionary relationships of pectate lyase-like (PLL) genes in parasitic plants and other major land plant lineages. One particular PLL gene, denoted as PLL1 in parasitic Orobanchaceae, which our previous research identified as a potential key parasitism gene, belongs to the largest sub-clade of this gene family. To explore the role of PLL1 gene in parasitic Orobanchaceae further, we manipulated its transcript abundance during haustorium development in Triphysaria versicolor, a model species in parasitic Orobanchaceae, using both direct transformation of the parasite and host-induced-gene-silencing (HIGS). For HIGS, we generated transgenic hosts (Medicago truncatula and Arabidopsis thaliana) carrying hairpin RNAs targeting the PLL gene in T. versicolor. Our results demonstrated that both methods effectively reduced the PLL1 expression in the haustorium of T. versicolor, leading to an increase in poorly adhered parasites. These findings highlight PLL1's crucial role in haustorium development in Orobanchaceae and may inform novel strategies towards parasitic weed management.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

However, researchers commonly misconceive the relationship between mating success (MS) and reproductive success (RS) as always being causal, leading to a misinterpretation of the BG. The BG is phenomenological and therefore uninformative about the mechanisms leading to correlations between MS and RS. Here, we simulate sequential matings in males from biological systems with varying levels of anisogamy and sperm competition, to better understand the underlying processes that modulate male BGs. We show that the BG does not solely reflect the causal influence of MS on RS as is typically interpreted, but is also a consequence of covariances between male MS and male ejaculate traits, female fecundity, or female post-mating decisions. For example, we show that the BG is substantially shallower when the ejaculate size of males negatively co-varies with their MS, such as in species with alternative male reproductive tactics. Such covariances can lead to a misinterpretation of the measured BG, because here, it does not merely represent the strength of selection on intra-sexual competition for mates. We suggest how such covariances can be visually assessed, and accounted for using partial Bateman gradients, to better interpret the influence of MS on RS, thus the strength of pre-copulatory sexual selection. Among other simplifications, our simulations have a male-only focus, but they provide insights into the mechanisms driving inter- and intra-specific variation in the BG, clarify its meaning, and improve our understand of sexual selection.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

While some types of floral traits, such as flower color, are well-characterized, other types of complex morphologies remain understudied. One example is occluded personate flowers, dorso-ventrally compressed flowers with obstructed floral passageways, which have evolved in multiple genera, but have only been characterized from snapdragon.

MethodsOur study examined the morphological basis and evolutionary history of personate flowers in a clade of Penstemon species that includes three personate-flowered species. We characterized floral morphology and inferred phylogenomic relationships for 13 species in this group in order to examine the evolutionary history of personate flowers. We used phylogenomic tests for introgression to examine whether personate-flowered lineages have a history of introgression.

ResultsUnlike the personate flowers of snapdragon, personate flowers in Penstemon are produced by deep pleats in the ventral petal tissue that curve the ventral petal surface upwards, obstructing the floral tube opening. Our phylogenetic tree suggests that personate flowers evolved in two separate lineages. Phylogenomic analyses indicate incomplete lineage sorting and introgression between certain taxa have contributed to phylogenomic discordance, however we found little evidence of recent introgression between the two personate-flowered lineages.

ConclusionsThe evolution of personate flowers in Penstemon involves a distinct morphological basis than snapdragon. Personate flowers have evolved multiple times in Penstemon on a rapid evolutionary timescale. The source of genetic variation for repeated shifts may be de novo mutations or pre-existing variants.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

C. elegans germ granules consist of at least seven distinct subcompartments, including P granules, Z granules, Mutator foci, SIMR foci, P-bodies, D granules and E granules. Among these condensates, the E granule, which is nonrandomly positioned within the germ granule, is required for the production of a specialized class of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). However, the mechanisms underlying E granule formation and its functional significance remain largely unexplored. In this study, via the use of TurboID-based proximity labeling technology combined with an RNAi-based reverse genetic screen, we identified two novel components of the E granule, EGC-2/C27B7.5 and EGC-3/F59G1.8, which initiate E granule assembly. The depletion of EGC-2 or EGC-3 disrupts the perinuclear localization of the EGO and PICS complexes, both of which are enriched in E granules and are required for E-class siRNA and piRNA biogenesis, respectively. Small RNAomic analyses revealed that both EGC-2 and EGC-3 promote the production of 5' E-class siRNA, whereas prohibiting piRNA maturation. Taken together, our results elucidate the roles of EGC-2 and EGC-3 in maintaining E granule integrity and small RNA homeostasis, and suggest that intracellular condensation may exert distinct regulatory effects on different biological processes. Additionally, the combination of proximity labeling technology and reverse genetic screening provides a robust strategy for studying the assembly of biomolecular condensates.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

Nevertheless, recombination suppression has repeatedly evolved in sex chromosomes and mating-type chromosomes. The evolutionary causes for recombination suppression and the proximal mechanisms preventing crossing overs are still poorly understood. Several hypotheses have recently been suggested based on theoretical models, and in particular, that divergence could accumulate neutrally around a sex-determining region and reduce recombination rates, a self-reinforcing process that could foster progressive extension of recombination suppression. The ascomycete fungus Podospora anserina is an excellent model for investigating these questions. A 0.8 Mb region around the mating-type locus is non-recombining, despite being collinear between the two mating types. This fungus is mostly selfing, so that strains are highly homozygous, except in the non-recombining region around the mating-type locus that displays differentiation between mating types. Here, we generated a mutant to test the hypothesis that sequence divergence alone is responsible for recombination cessation. We replaced the mat- idiomorph by the sequence of the mat+ idiomorph, to obtain a strain that is sexually compatible with the mat-reference strain and isogenic to this strain in the MAT-proximal region. Crosses showed that recombination was still suppressed in the MAT-proximal region in the mutant strains, indicating that other proximal mechanisms than inversions or mere sequence divergence are responsible for recombination suppression in this fungus. This finding suggests that selective mechanisms likely acted for suppressing recombination, as the neutral model does not seem to hold, at least in this fungus.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

Targeting female fertility genes in a gene drive can be an efficient strategy for population suppression. In this study, we investigated nine female fertility genes in Drosophila melanogaster using CRISPR-based homing gene drives. Employing a multiplexed gRNA approach to prevent formation of functional resistance alleles, we aimed to maintain high drive conversion efficiency with low fitness costs in female drive carriers. Drive efficiency was assessed in individual crosses and had varied performance across different target genes. Notably, drives targeting the octopamine beta2 receptor (oct) and stall (stl) genes exhibited the highest drive conversion rates and were further tested in cages. A drive targeting stl successfully suppressed a cage population with a high release frequency, though suppression failed in another replicate cage with lower initial release frequency. Fitness costs in female drive carriers were observed in test cages, impacting the overall efficiency of population suppression. Further tests on the fertility of these lines using individual crosses indicated that some fitness costs were possibly due to the maternal deposition of Cas9 combined with new gRNA expression, which would only occur in progeny of drive males when testing split drives with separate Cas9 (when mimicking cages with complete drives) but not for complete drive systems. This could enable success in complete drives with higher maternal Cas9 deposition, even if cage experiments in split drives fail. Our findings underscore the potential and challenges of assessing gene drives for population control, providing valuable insights for optimizing and testing suppression gene drive designs.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

A pyrimidine at target nucleotide t10 positions another unrecognized catalytic residue, Arginine-710, for optimal cleavage. Expansion of the guide-target duplex major groove docks the scissile phosphate for hydrolysis and subsequent groove compression after position 16 permits target RNAs to exit the catalytic cleft. These findings reveal how hAgo2 catalyzes siRNA target hydrolysis, providing a high-resolution model for therapeutic design.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

Here, we describe an additional layer to this process, essential when pathogen-derived signals alone cannot directly achieve full DC activation. Immunisation with sporozoites from Plasmodium leads to CD8 T cell priming in a complex response that is initiated by conventional type 1 DC (cDC1). We unveil a pivotal initiating role for Vgamma1+ gammadelta T cells, as they directly supply IL-4 to DC and CD8 T cells. IL-4 synergises with a CD4 T cell-derived CD40L signal to induce IL-12 production by cDC1. Both IL-12 and IL-4 then directly signal CD8 T cells, with synergy between these cytokines then driving enhanced IL-12 receptor expression and expansion of responding CD8 T cells. This study reveals a key role for Vgamma1+ gammadelta T cells in initiating CD8 T cell immunity to Plasmodium. More broadly, it shows that responses to some pathogens require help from innate-like T cells to pass the initiation threshold and further amplify the response in a process underscored by IL-4 production.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

Yet, to date these chiral molecules have often been the products of poorly enantioselective and environmentally harsh organic synthesis routes. Here, we reveal the broad specificity of multiple natural pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes, specifically an L-threonine transaldolase, a phenylserine dehydratase, and an aminotransferase, towards substrates that contain aryl side chains with diverse substitutions. We exploit this tolerance to construct a one-pot biocatalytic cascade that achieves high-yield synthesis of 18 diverse L-phenylalanine derivatives from aldehydes under mild aqueous reaction conditions. We demonstrate addition of a carboxylic acid reductase module to this cascade to enable the biosynthesis of L-phenylalanine derivatives from carboxylic acids that may be less expensive or less reactive than the corresponding aldehydes. Finally, we investigate the scalability of the cascade by developing a lysate-based route for preparative-scale synthesis of 4-formyl-L-phenylalanine, a nsAA with a bio-orthogonal handle that is not readily market-accessible. Overall, this work offers an efficient, versatile, and scalable route with the potential to lower manufacturing cost and democratize synthesis for many valuable nsAAs.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

Indeed, myside bias has become a particularly pernicious fact of societal cohesion, contributing to the propagation of fake news, to social polarization, and even to the replication crisis in experimental science. By contrast, relatively little is understood about either its neurocognitive underpinnings or its evolution, one reason for this being that the potential presence of myside bias-like tendencies in non-human animals has never been directly tested. Hence, in order to advance research in both of these directions, we designed a novel mouse model of everyday-like rule revision such that the dynamic model environment would be sufficient to call out myside bias-like behaviors providing that mice did indeed possess the particular kind of competing neurocognitive processes necessary for it to manifest. Here, we both validate that model and provide the first behavioral descriptions of myside confirmation bias-like deliberative profiles in a non-human animal. Notably, we observe that this bias does not manifest in a merely unreflective or heuristic/'system 1' manner but rather also emerges through and indeed increases deliberative behaviors, especially in contexts of low representational resolution. Several other parallels with findings from human studies of myside bias are also detailed in the discussion.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

Described initially from Cuba in 1904, there has been substantial debate about its origin and diversification. The prevailing view, first proposed by the Psilocybe expert Gaston Guzman in 1983, is that P. cubensis was inadvertently introduced to the Americas when cattle were introduced to the continents from Africa and Europe (~1500 CE), but that its progenitor was endemic to Africa. This hypothesis has never been tested. Here, we report the discovery of the closest wild relative of P. cubensis from sub-Saharan Africa, P. ochraceocentrata nom. prov. Using DNA sequences from type specimens of all known African species of Psilocybe, multi-locus phylogenetic and molecular clock analysis strongly support recognizing the African samples as a new species that last shared a common ancestor with P. cubensis ~1.5 million years ago (~710k - 2.55M years ago 95% HPD). Even at the latest estimated time of divergence, this long predates cattle domestication and the origin of modern humans. Both species are associated with herbivore dung, suggesting this habit likely predisposed P. cubensis to its present specialization on domesticated cattle dung. Ecological niche modeling using bioclimatic variables for global records of these species indicates historical presence across Africa, Asia, and the Americas over the last 3 million years. This discovery sheds light on the wild origins of domesticated P. cubensis and provides new genetic resources for research on psychedelic mushrooms.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

Our study reveals that, among these resources, SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the oxysterol-binding protein 1 (OSBP1) transporter to exploit the Golgi-bound phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) pool. This leads to a depletion of Golgi-resident PI4P, triggering the activation of the ATM DNA Damage Response (DDR) kinase in the cytoplasm. As such, ATM, typically anchored to PI4P at the Golgi in an inactive state, undergoes auto-phosphorylation and cytoplasmic release upon SARS-CoV-2-induced PI4P depletion. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of ATM auto-phosphorylation, which stabilizes its interaction with PI4P, significantly impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication. The requirement for PI4P and impact of ATM inhibition might be conserved across coronaviruses, as similar effects were observed with HCoV-229E. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-induced, cytoplasmic ATM pre-activation primes cells for an accelerated response to DNA damage, which might contribute to the severe outcomes of COVID-19 observed in cancer patients undergoing chemo- or radiotherapy. Therefore, this study uncovers a DNA damage-independent mode of ATM activation and highlights the potential of ATM inhibitors as therapeutic agents against COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

In Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, male gametogenesis mitosis is exceptionally rapid and divergent. Within 8 minutes, the haploid male gametocyte genome undergoes three replication cycles (1N to 8N), while maintaining an intact NE. Axonemes assemble in the cytoplasm and connect to a bipartite MTOC-containing nuclear pole and cytoplasmic basal body, producing eight flagellated gametes. The mechanisms coordinating NE remodelling, MTOC dynamics, and flagellum assembly remain poorly understood.

Here, we identify the SUN1-ALLAN complex as a novel mediator of NE remodelling and bipartite MTOC coordination during Plasmodium male gametogenesis. SUN1, a conserved NE protein, localizes to dynamic loops and focal points near nuclear spindle poles. ALLAN, a divergent Allantoicase-like protein, has a location like that of SUN1 at nuclear MTOCs. SUN1 and ALLAN form a unique complex, detected by live-cell imaging, ultrastructural expansion microscopy, and interactomics. Deletion of either SUN1 or ALLAN gene disrupts nuclear MTOC organization, leading to basal body mis-segregation, defective spindle assembly, and impaired kinetochore attachment, but axoneme formation remains intact. Ultrastructural analysis revealed nuclear and cytoplasmic MTOC miscoordination, producing aberrant flagellated gametes lacking nuclear material. Sun1 deletion also alters parasite lipid composition, underscoring its role in NE homeostasis. These defects block parasite development in the mosquito and transmission, highlighting the essential functions of this complex.

This study reveals a bipartite MTOC and a highly divergent mechanism of NE remodelling during Plasmodium male gametogenesis. The SUN1-ALLAN complex is an unusual adaptation of the LINC complex, in absence of canonical KASH-domain proteins in Plasmodium, providing new insights into the evolution of closed mitosis and highlighting potential targets for blocking malaria transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

In both primary human CD4 T cells and CRISPR/Cas-9 engineered Jurkat T cells, loss of TRPM7 led to altered Mg2+ homeostasis, Ca2+ signaling, reduced NFAT translocation, decreased IL-2 secretion and ultimately diminished proliferation and differentiation. While the activation of primary human CD4 T cells was dependent on TRPM7, polarization of naive CD4 T cells into regulatory T cells (Treg) was not.

Traditional low-throughput experimental methods do not generate sufficient data for comprehensive benchmarking or training deep learning models. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments provide rich, high-throughput data; however, they are often used incompletely, neglecting to consider the binding partners, and on a per-study basis without assessing the generalization capabilities of fine-tuned models across different assays. To address these limitations, we collected over ten million raw DMS data points and refined them to half a million high-quality points from twenty-five assays, focusing on protein-protein interactions. We intentionally excluded non-PPI DMS data pertaining to intrinsic protein properties, such as fluorescence or catalytic activity. Our dataset meticulously pairs binding energies with the sequences and structures of all interacting partners using a comprehensive pipeline, recognizing that interactions inherently involve at least two proteins.

In non-human primates, forelimb nerve transection and repair dramatically alters the otherwise orderly and highly conserved organisation of the digit maps in primary somatosensory areas 3b and 1. Digit-map organisation becomes patchwork and highly variable. Although without compelling evidence, these same reorganisational changes are presumed to occur in humans and to have significant functional implications for patient recovery. In the current study, we evaluate these assumptions.

Functional MRI is used to characterise the fine-grained organisation of digit responses in the primary somatosensory cortex in twenty-one patients with nerve transection injuries and thirty healthy controls. Both univariate dice  overlap coefficients and state-of-the-art multivariate representational distances are used to quantify the extent and pattern of interdigit response separability in primary somatosensory cortex. Our results reveal significant differences between patients and controls. The fine-grained organisation of the primary somatosensory cortex is altered in nerve repair. Average dice coefficients reveal significantly increased interdigit response overlap. These effects are specific to the hemisphere contralateral to the nerve-repaired hand, reflecting inputs from reinnervated digits, and are more robust within the cortical zones of the repaired nerves. Nerve repair also alters the relative functional structure of the primary somatosensory cortex, changing the otherwise stereotypical pattern of interdigit response separability seen in healthy controls. Unexpectedly, these later alterations manifest bilaterally, as maps for the healthy hand of patients also show an atypical pattern of interdigit response separability.

Our findings provide the first compelling evidence for altered digit maps following nerve repair in humans, bridging results from animal models. Nonetheless, the clinical significance of the changes we observe remains unclear. No reliable relationships between fMRI measures of cortical reorganisation and behavioural measures of functional impairments are observed. Altered digit maps are not found to correlate with impairments in touch localisation or with broader measures of functional impairment as captured by sensory Rosen scores.","NA","medrxiv",1733695755003

We previously reported that Gpr17 ablation in the brain-gut axis leads to improved metabolic homeostasis, suggesting GPR17 antagonism could be developed for diabetes and obesity treatment. Here, we performed high throughput screening (HTS) and identified two new GPR17 antagonists (compound 978 and 527). Both compounds antagonized downstream Gi/o, Gq and {beta}-arrestin signaling with high selectivity for GPR17, but not the closely related purinergic and cysteinyl leukotriene receptors. The molecular mechanisms of antagonism were revealed through Schild analysis, structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies and homology modelling. Compound 978 and its analog (793) attenuated GPR17 signaling and promoted glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion in enteroendocrine cells. In summary, we identified selective GPR17 antagonists through HTS, which represent promising pharmacological tools for developing new therapeutic strategies in diabetes and obesity.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

We developed a preclinical animal model to determine whether transitioning to e-cigarette use after up to 16 weeks of daily exposure to combustible cigarette smoke (CS) could restore normal lung immune responsiveness to house dust mites (HDM). In these studies, CS exposed animals were randomly assigned to 6 groups. (1) CS-CS mice continued combustible cigarette exposure for an additional 7 or 16 weeks, and (2) CS-recovery mice were removed from cigarette smoking where they recovered without intervention. (3) CS-carrier mice transitioned to vaporized propylene glycol (30%) with vegetable glycerol (70%) (i.e. carrier). (4) CS-salt mice transitioned to e-vapor exposure containing nicotine salt (liquid nicotine in benzoic acid + carrier), and (5) CS-base mice transitioned to daily exposures to liquid nicotine + carrier containing e-vapors. (6) Room air exposed mice, that were not smoked or exposed to e-cigarette vapors, were included as controls. We hypothesized that transitioning from CS to either of the three e-cigarette exposures (base, salt or carrier) would restore eosinophil influx into the airways following intranasal HDM administration. Here we report that shorter (7 week) e-vapor exposure containing salt, base or carrier led to significant eosinophil responses following HDM challenge. In the 16-week model, CS-base and CS-salt exposed animals did not regain their HDM responsiveness when compared to controls. CS-carrier mice did regain partial responses to HDM at 16 weeks as indicated by an increase in eosinophils compared to control mice. Lung resident lymphoid cells support the influx of eosinophils following allergen exposure. As such we measured total T cells, B cells and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) in the lungs of each of the treatment groups. ILC2 and CD4+ T cells were reduced, and B cells were increased in the lungs of CS mice compared to controls. Numerically, the transition to nicotine-salt increased the CD3+ T cell response but transitioning to the nicotine-base significantly reduced CD19 B cells. Additional studies showed that GM-CSF protein was increased in cultured ILC and in whole lung tissues of control mice compared to CS-carrier mice indicating plasticity of the ILC2 population. RNA microarray analyses identified significant increases in GM-CSF, CCL17 and CCL24 transcripts in alveolar macrophages following the transition from CS to carrier compared to control mice. In summary, the immunosuppressive effects of CS may be restored following short-term use of e-cigarettes, but chronic use of e-cigarettes may blunt pulmonary immunity similarly to traditional cigarette smoke.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

However, taxonomic changes and errors can result in inconsistencies when amalgamating specimen metadata, that compromise the assignment of occurrence records to correct taxa, and the subsequent interpretation of patterns in biodiversity. We present a novel workflow to mass-curate digital specimens. By employing existing digital taxonomic backbones, we aggregate specimen names by their accepted name and flag remaining cases for manual review. We then validate names using site-specific floras, balancing automation with taxonomic expert-based curation. Applying our workflow to the vascular plants of Greenland, we harmonised 175,266 digitised herbarium specimens and observations from 92 data providers from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The harmonised metacollection for the Greenland flora contains 780 plant species. Our workflow increases the number of species known from Greenland compared to other currently available species checklists and increases the mean number of occurrences per species by 42.6. Our workflow illustrates the integration required in order to create a global, universally accessible digital herbarium, and shows how previous obstacles to database curation can be overcome through a combination of automation and expert curation. From the specific perspective of the Greenland flora, our approach arrives at a new checklist of taxa, a new curated metacollection of occurrence data, and revised estimates of plant richness. The list of taxa and their prevalence allow a new basis for biodiversity assessment and conservation planning.

Societal Impact StatementDigitising plant collections has allowed for data to be aggregated across multiple collections, forming a single harmonised resource of unprecedented scale. This resource is only accurate once the database names are assigned to one accepted name per species. We established a semi-automated workflow for processing plant name data, leveraging taxonomic backbones and employing taxonomic expertise at key stages. Applying our workflow to the flora of Greenland, we developed a curated checklist of 780 species, capturing greater species richness than previously published, while also curating 175,266 plant records. Our findings redefine our knowledge of Greenlandic plant diversity, while harmonising a vast digital collection for further research.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

While the spatiotemporal specificity of DNA methylation controls organ formation and development, the molecular mechanisms underlying locus- or tissue-specific DNA methylation remain unclear. Previously, locus- or tissue-specific DNA methylation was thought to depend solely on the recognition of histone methylations. Here we show that high expression of 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (24-nt siRNAs) leads to incremental CHH methylation at specific loci via the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway during female gametophyte development in rice. We also identify a DNA motif, the Female-specific RdDM-associated Element (FRE), which guides methylation to these loci. Furthermore, we show that the female-preferentially expressed protein OsCLSY3 directly interacts with FRE to regulate CHH methylation specifically in female reproductive tissues. These findings uncover a novel molecular mechanism necessary for tissue- and locus-specific de novo DNA methylation that might be conserved across diverse organisms including animals.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

The interactions between plant roots and local soil microbes are critical for environmental adaptation and plant health. Plants actively regulate the microbial community composition in their rhizospheres to recruit specific microorganisms that enhance their fitness in the ecosystem they inhabit. This study builds on prior research suggesting that plants have a 'home field advantage' in recruiting microbes unique in their home environment, reflecting mutual recognition and the targeted recruitment of microbes. Results: Using gene- and genome-centric approaches, we assessed the functional potential of root-associated microbes and profiled the host metabolites to uncover the metabolic outputs potentially regulating host-microbe interactions. Our results showed that plants adapted to drier environments experience less stress, producing fewer stress-related metabolites and impacting the recruitment of microbes with genes linked to stress relief pathways. In particular, plant-derived trimethyllysine was highly associated with microbial populations capable of improving nutrient uptake, producing plant growth-promoting compounds, and modulating stress responses. Conclusion: This study highlights the critical interplay between host exudates and microbial substrate uptake as the primary mechanism of rhizosphere assembly. We demonstrate that plants actively produce metabolites to recruit microbial populations with the functional potential to enhance hosts' ability to thrive in a stressful environment. This research provides insights into the mechanisms of plant-microbe communication, rhizosphere recruitment, and the complex interplay of plant-microbe interactions. Furthermore, it highlights promising avenues for manipulating rhizosphere microbiomes to support conservation agriculture in the face of climate change.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

In eukaryotes, building whole custom genomes is still many years away, but work in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast is closing-in on the first synthetic eukaryotic genome with genome-wide design changes. A key design change throughout the synthetic yeast genome is the introduction of LoxPsym site sequences. These enable inducible genomic rearrangements in vivo via expression of Cre recombinase via SCRaMbLE (Synthetic Chromosome Recombination and Modification by LoxPsym-mediated Evolution). When paired with selection, SCRaMbLE can quickly generate strains with phenotype improvements by diversifying gene arrangement and content in LoxPsym-containing regions. Here, we demonstrate how iterative cycles of SCRaMbLE can be used to reorganise synthetic genome modules and synthetic chromosomes for improved functional performance under selection. To achieve this, we developed SCOUT (SCRaMbLE Continuous Output and Universal Tracker), a reporter system that allows SCRaMbLEd cells to be sorted into a high diversity pool. When coupled with long-read sequencing, SCOUT enables high-throughput mapping of genotype abundance and correlation of gene content and arrangement with growth-related phenotypes. Iterative SCRaMbLE was applied here to yeast strains with a full synthetic chromosome, and to strains with synthetic genome modules encoding the gene set for histidine biosynthesis. Five synthetic designs for HIS modules were constructed and tested, and we investigated how SCRaMbLE reorganised the poorest performing design to give improved growth under selection. The results of iterative SCRaMbLE serve as a quick route to identify genome module designs with optimised function in a selected condition and offer a powerful tool to generate datasets that can inform the design of modular genomes in the future.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

TE mobility can be mutagenic and is thought to contribute to genome evolution by altering genome structure and diversification. In C. elegans elevated temperature leads to desilencing of TEs in the germline, suggesting that environmental conditions could impact the integrity of inheritable genomes. Here, we show that dysfunction of the AFD thermosensory neurons leads to desilencing of TEs in the germline. The TE activity results in de novo insertions and mutagenesis.

Such fibrinaloid microclots are also relatively resistant to fibrinolysis. The proteins that the amyloid microclots contained differed markedly both from the soluble proteome of typical plasma and that of normal clots, and also between the disease studies (an acute syndrome in the form of sepsis in an ITU and a chronic disease represented by Long COVID). Many proteins in the amyloid microclots were low in concentration in plasma and were effectively accumulated into the fibres, whereas many other abundant plasma proteins were excluded. The proteins found in the microclots associated with the diseases also tended to be themselves amyloidogenic. We here ask effectively the inverse question. This is: can the clot proteome tell us whether the clots associated with a particular disease contained proteins that are observed uniquely (or are highly over-represented) in known amyloid clots relative to normal clots, and thus were in fact amyloid in nature? The answer is in the affirmative in a variety of major coagulopathies, viz. venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, various cardiac issues, and ischaemic stroke. Galectin-3-binding protein and thrombospondin-1 seem to be especially widely associated with amyloid-type clots, and the latter has indeed been shown to be incorporated into growing fibrin fibres.

Cryptosporidium is an intracellular parasite of intestinal epithelial cells, and a leading cause of diarrheal death and disease in infants worldwide. Despite this, very little is known about the cell biology of infection of this eukaryotic pathogen. Here, we designed and implemented a unique microscopy-based arrayed CRISPR-Cas9 screen to interrogate the effects of the loss of every protein-coding human gene on a Cryptosporidium infection. As the experimental readout is image-based, we extracted multiple phenotypic features of infection, including parasite growth, progression of the parasite to its sexual life stage, and recruitment of host actin to  pedestals beneath the parasite vacuole. Using this dataset, we discovered a tipping point in the host cholesterol biosynthesis pathway that controls Cryptosporidium infection. Parasite growth can either be inhibited or promoted by the intermediary metabolite squalene. A build-up of squalene in epithelial cells creates a reducing environment, with more reduced host glutathione available for uptake by the parasite. Because Cryptosporidium has lost the ability to synthesise glutathione, this uptake from the host cell is required for growth and progression through its life cycle. We demonstrate that this dependency can be leveraged for treatment with the abandoned drug lapaquistat, an inhibitor of host squalene synthase that has efficacy against Cryptosporidium in vitro and in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

While emerging research demonstrates that isolates belonging to the P. syringae species complex colonize diverse hosts, the extent to which these bacteria naturally infect non-flowering plants like the model liverwort Marchantia polymorpha remains unclear. Here, we identify natural associations between Pseudomonas viridiflava and the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. Pseudomonas bacteria isolated from diseased liverworts in the wild successfully re-infected M. polymorpha in pure culture conditions, producing high in planta bacterial densities and causing prominent tissue maceration. Comparative genomic analysis of Marchantia-associated P. viridiflava identified core virulence machinery like the type-III secretion system (T3SS) and conserved effectors (AvrE and HopM1) that were essential for liverwort infection. Disease assays performed in Nicotiana benthamiana further confirmed that liverwort-associated P. viridiflava infect flowering plants in an effector-dependent manner. Our work highlights P. viridiflava as an effective broad host pathogen that relies on conserved virulence factors to manipulate evolutionarily divergent host plants.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

C. elegans possesses an expanded repertoire of at least 19 AGOs functioning in an intricate gene regulatory network. Despite their crucial roles, little is known about the regulation of AGOs, and whether their expression levels, tissue specificity, and functions change in response to genetic perturbations or environmental triggers. Here, we report that PALS-22, a member of an unusually expanded protein family in C. elegans, acts as a negative regulator of antiviral RNAi involving the RIG-I homolog. The loss of pals-22 leads to enhanced silencing of transgenes and endogenous dsRNAs. We found that PALS-22 normally suppresses the expression of two AGOs, VSRA-1 and SAGO-2, which are activated by bZIP transcription factor ZIP-1. When pals-22 is eliminated, vsra-1 and sago-2 are upregulated. These AGOs in turn play key roles in defense against foreign genetic elements and intracellular pathogens, respectively. Surprisingly, while in pals-22 mutants immune genes functioning in the intracellular pathogen response (IPR) are upregulated, removing SAGO-2 or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RRF-3 in these mutants leads to the downregulation of these genes. This observation contrasts with the typical gene-silencing role of siRNAs. Finally, by analyzing C. elegans wild isolates and lab reference strains, we demonstrate that PALS-22 regulates the expression of several germline AGOs, affecting germline mortality and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In summary, PALS-22 is a key genetic node that balances the trade-off between immunity and germline health by modulating the functions of different AGOs, thereby shaping the outputs of the RNAi machinery and the dynamics of epigenetic inheritance.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

Here we demonstrate that XNA-containing templates can be directly and robustly sequenced (>2.3 million reads/flowcell, similar to DNA controls) on a MinION sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies to obtain signal data that is significantly distinct from DNA controls (median fold-change >6x). To enable training of machine learning models that deconvolve these signals and basecall XNAs along with natural bases, we developed a framework to synthesize a complex pool of 1,024 UB-containing oligonucleotides with diverse 6-mer sequence contexts and high XNA purity (>90% UB-insertion on average). Bootstrapped models to enable data preparation, and data augmentation with spliced XNA reads to provide high context diversity, enabled learning of a generalizable model to call natural as well as unnatural bases with high accuracy (>80%) and specificity (99%).

Moreover, genetically divergent versions of N2 have arisen over decades of research and hindered reproducibility of C. elegans genetics and genomics. Here we provide a 106.4 Mb gap-free, telomere-to-telomere genome assembly of C. elegans, generated from CGC1, an isogenic derivative of the N2 strain. We used improved long-read sequencing and manual assembly of 43 recalcitrant genomic regions to overcome deficiencies of prior N2 and VC2010 assemblies, and to assemble tandem repeat loci including a 772-kb sequence for the 45S rRNA genes. While many differences from earlier assemblies came from repeat regions, unique additions to the genome were also found. Of 19,972 protein-coding genes in the N2 assembly, 19,790 (99.1%) encode products that are unchanged in the CGC1 assembly.

Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to quantify genetic contributions to cis-regulatory variation in 361,119 peripheral blood mononuclear cells across 63 COVID-19 patients during acute infection, 39 samples collected in the convalescent phase, and 106 healthy controls. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping across cell types within each disease state group revealed thousands of cis-associated variants, of which hundreds were detected exclusively in immune cells derived from acute COVID-19 patients. Patient-specific genetic effects dissipated as infection resolved, suggesting that distinct gene regulatory networks are at play in the active infection state. Further, 17.2% of tested loci demonstrated significant cell state interactions with genotype, with pathways related to interferon responses and oxidative phosphorylation showing pronounced cell state-dependent variation, predominantly in CD14+ monocytes. Overall, we estimate that 25.6% of tested genes exhibit gene-environment interaction effects, highlighting the importance of environmental modifiers in the transcriptional regulation of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

We present LRGE, a novel tool that uses read-to-read overlap information to estimate genome size in a reference-free manner. LRGE calculates per-read genome size estimates by analysing the expected number of overlaps for each read, considering read lengths and a minimum overlap threshold. The final size is taken as the median of these estimates, ensuring robustness to outliers such as reads with no overlaps. Additionally, LRGE provides an expected confidence range for the estimate. LRGE outperforms k-mer-based methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency and produces genome size estimates comparable to those from assembly-based approaches, like Raven, while using significantly less computational resources. We validate LRGE on a large, diverse bacterial dataset and confirm it generalises to eukaryotic datasets.

Unlike previous models, AIDO.Cell is capable of handling the entire human transcriptome as input without truncation or sampling tricks, thus learning accurate and general representations of the human cells entire transcriptional context. This pretraining with a longer context was enabled through FlashAttention-2, mixed precision, and large-scale distributed systems training.

The reliability of these forecasts hinges on detailed knowledge of disease transmission across different population segments, which may be inferred from within-community transmission rates via proxy data, such as contact surveys and mobility data. However, these approaches are indirect, making it difficult to accurately estimate rare transmissions between socially or geographically distant communities. We show that the steep ramp up of genome sequencing surveillance during the pandemic can be leveraged to directly identify transmission patterns between communities. Specifically, our approach uses a hidden Markov model to infer the fraction of infections a community imports from other communities based on how rapidly the allele frequencies in the focal community converge to those in the donor communities. Applying this method to SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data from England and the U.S., we uncover networks of inter-community disease transmission that, while broadly reflecting geographical relationships, also expose epidemiologically significant long-range interactions. We provide evidence that transmission between regions can substantially change between waves of variants of concern, both in magnitude and direction, and analyze how the inferred plasticity and heterogeneity in inter-community transmission impact evolutionary forecasts.

Not only do TF concentrations fluctuate in time and from cell to cell, in each cell the actual binding and unbinding of TFs to promoters is also stochastic. However, how this  noise propagation from TFs to their targets determines the expression fluctuations in target genes of the same TF has so far not been quantitatively characterized. Here we use fluorescence time-lapse microscopy in combination with microfluidics and automated image analysis to quantitatively track the single-cell growth and gene expression dynamics of different target promoters of the LexA SOS response regulator in E. coli under mild DNA damage induced by the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP).

We find that, at the single-cell level, LexA target promoters exhibit stochastic bursts in protein production with specific quantitative characteristics. First, the durations of protein production bursts are short, identical for all promoters, and independent of CIP levels. Second, the heights of the production peaks are exponentially distributed for each promoter, and independent of CIP level, but with different average heights for different promoters. Third, the frequency of the production bursts increases with CIP level for all promoters, but differs across promoters.

Importantly, we show that these observations are inconsistent with popular  equilibrium models of bacterial gene regulation that assume that the dynamics of binding and unbinding of TFs is fast relative to the time-scale of TF concentration fluctuations. Instead, all observations can be quantitatively fit by a relatively simple model in which DNA damage events lead to short transient dips in LexA concentration, and an expression burst occurs in a cell whenever LexA unbinds from the target promoter during such a short dip in LexA concentration. Moreover, because these transient dips in LexA concentration occur on the same time-scale as the stochastic unbinding of LexA from promoters, the response of a target promoter to an individual DNA damage event is stochastic and depends in a complex manner on the strengths of its LexA binding sites and the duration of the event. Consequently, the expression levels of different LexA target genes in a given cell reflect distinct statistics of the frequency and durations of DNA damage events in the recent history of that cell.

Our results show that, even in the simple scenario where a single TF is induced, different target promoters can exhibit distinct stochastic responses that depend on the precise kinetics of the induction events.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

Besides the commonly used Agrobacterium strains, Rhizobium rhizogenes can also introduce foreign DNA into host plants for gene expression. While many R. rhizogenes strains have been known for inducing hairy root symptoms, their use for transient expression has not been fully explored. Here, we showed that R. rhizogenes A4 outperformed all other tested agrobacterial strains in agroinfiltration experiments on leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana and other solanaceous plants. By conducting an agroinfiltration screening in N. benthamiana leaves using various agrobacterial strains carrying the RUBY reporter gene cassette, we discovered that A4 mediates the strongest and fastest transient expression. Utilizing the genomic information, we developed a collection of disarmed and modified strains derived from A4. By performing vacuum infiltration assays, we demonstrated that these A4-derived strains efficiently transiently transform 6-week-old N. benthamiana leaves, showing less sensitivity to the age of plants compared to the laboratory strain GV3101. Furthermore, we performed agroinfiltration using AS109, an A4-derived disarmed strain, on the leaves of tomato, pepper, and eggplant. Remarkably, AS109 mediated transient gene expression on tested solanaceous plants more effectively than all the tested commonly used agrobacterial strains. This discovery paves the way for establishing R. rhizogenes A4-derived strains as a new option for enhancing transient expression in N. benthamiana and facilitating the functional study of plant genes in other solanaceous species.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

However, these co-expression networks must be interpreted with caution, as they can arise from multiple processes. Here, we show that hybridization and gene flow between populations can greatly modify co-expression networks. Admixture between populations produces correlated expression between genes experiencing linkage disequilibrium. This correlated expression does not reflect functional relationships between genes, but rather depends on migration rates and physical linkage on chromosomes. Given the prevalence of gene flow between divergent populations in nature, these introgression effects likely represent a significant force in network evolution, even in populations where hybridization is historical rather than contemporary. These findings emphasize the critical importance of considering both evolutionary history and genomic architecture when analyzing gene co-expression networks in natural populations.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

Regrettably, this was accomplished only for individual, tissue-dissociated cells. High-plex spatial biology has begun to recover the x, y, and z-coordinates of single-cells, but typically at the expense of far less than whole transcriptome coverage. To solve this problem, Bruker Spatial Biology has accomplished a commercial-grade panel (CosMx(R) Spatial Molecular Imager Whole Transcriptome Panel (WTx)), using 37,872 imaging barcodes, capable of sub-cellular imaging of the entire human protein-coding transcriptome. The imaging barcodes are encoded with 156 bits of information (4 on-cycles and 35 dark-cycles per code), at a Hamming Distance of 4 from each other to achieve a very low false-code detection. Key to achieving this high-plex capability was the ability to manufacture imaging barcodes that require no in-tissue amplification (every barcode is manufactured under GMP to contain exactly 30 fluorescent dyes) and uniform, size-exclusion purified, extremely small imaging barcodes ([~] 20 nm). A detailed study of six different human FFPE tissue types was performed (Colon, Pancreas, Hippocampus, Skin, Breast, Kidney), yielding over 5.4 billion transcripts from 2.7 million cells. We counted over 1,550 transcripts-per-cell on average and observed 900 unique genes per cell (measured as the median). Single fixed-cells containing well over 10,000 subcellularly imaged transcripts were accomplished. Advancing single-cell imaging to the whole transcriptome level opens a single unified approach to accomplish essentially all single-cell experiments, both imaging and non-imaging. Depending upon the sample type (e.g. fixed-cells, organoids, tissue sections, etc.), the transcripts per cell and genes per cell measured using the whole transcriptome panel often exceeds that obtained by the highest-resolution single-cell RNA-seq, can be performed on a single 5 {micro}m FFPE tissue section, with no dissociation bias (every cell is counted). Pathway analysis within the tumor bed of a colon adenocarcinoma sample found evidence of enrichment in pathways suggestive of an aggressive tumor type, and localized ligand-receptor analysis showed spatially restricted patterns related to adhesion, migration, and proliferation. The high-dimensional whole transcriptome data is streamed directly to a cloud-based Spatial Informatics Platform, allowing for the scalable processing of millions-of-single-cells and billions-of-transcripts per operation. The WTx data are combined with high-resolution antibody-based cell-morphology imaging and data-driven machine-learning cell segmentation algorithms, to generate the most complete view of single cell and sub-cellular spatial biology that has ever been obtained.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

It is commonly assumed that cells respond to these gradients by migrating directionally towards the regions of highest ligand density. In contrast with this view, here we show that cells exposed to micropatterned fibronectin gradients exhibit a complex repertoire of trajectories, including directed haptotactic migration up the gradient but also linear oscillations and circles with extended periods of migration down the gradient. To explain this behavior, we developed a biophysical model of haptotactic cell migration based on a coarse-grained molecular clutch model coupled to persistent stochastic polarity dynamics. While initial haptotactic migration is explained by the differential friction at the front and back of the cell, the observed complex trajectories over longer time scales arise from the interplay between differential friction, persistence, and physical confinement. Overall, our study reveals that confinement and persistence modulate the ability of cells to sense and respond to haptotactic cues and provides a framework to understand how cells navigate complex environments.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

They are an important tool for understanding both the spread of epidemics as well as long-term macroevolutionary trends in speciation and extinction. In particular, phylodynamic methods based on multi-type birth-death models have been used to infer the evolution of discrete traits, the movement of individuals or pathogens between geographic locations or host types, and the transition of infected individuals between disease stages. In these models, population heterogeneity is treated by assigning individuals to different discrete types. Typically, methods which allow inference of parameters under multi-type birth-death models integrate over the possible birth-death trajectories (i.e. the type-specific population size functions) to reduce the computational demands of the inference. As a result, it has not been possible to use these methods to directly infer the dynamics of trait-specific population sizes, infected host counts or other such demographic quantities. In this paper we present a method which infers these multi-type trajectories with almost no additional computational cost beyond that of existing methods. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach by applying it to a previously-published set of MERS-CoV genomes, inferring the numbers of human and camel cases through time, together with the number and timing of spillovers from the camel reservoir. This application highlights the multi-type population trajectorys ability to elucidate properties of the population which are not directly ancestral to its sampled members.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

This chaperone function is critically important to proteostasis, conserved across all kingdoms of life, and associated with various protein misfolding diseases in humans4,5. Mechanistic insights into how sHSPs sequester destabilized clients have been limited due to the extreme molecular plasticity and client-induced polydispersity of sHSP/client complexes6-8. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the sHSP from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (mjHSP16.5) in both the apo-state and in an ensemble of client-bound states. The ensemble not only reveals key molecular mechanisms by which sHSPs respond to and sequester client proteins, but also provides insights into the cooperative nature of chaperone-client interactions. Engagement with destabilized client induces a polarization of stability across the mjHSP16.5 scaffold, proposed to facilitate higher-order assembly and enhance client sequestration capacity. Some higher-order sHSP oligomers appear to form through simple insertion of dimeric subunits into new geometrical features, while other higher-order states suggest multiple sHSP/client assembly pathways. Together, these results provide long-sought insights into the chaperone function of sHSPs and highlight the relationship between polydispersity and client sequestration under stress conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

The relative importance of standing genetic variation vs. de novo mutations in adaptation remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. Selection during domestication has been long used as a model to understand evolutionary processes, providing information not only on the phenotypes selected but also, in many cases, an understanding of the causal loci. Of the multiple causal loci that have been identified in maize, the selected allele can be found segregating in natural populations, consistent with their origin as standing genetic variation. The sole exception to this pattern is the well-characterized domestication locus tga1, which has long been thought to be an example of selection on a de novo mutation. Here, we use a large dataset of maize and teosinte genomes to reconstruct the origin and evolutionary history of tga1. We first estimated the age of tga1-maize using a genealogy-based method, finding that the allele arose approximately 41,000-49,000 years ago, predating the beginning of maize domestication. We also identify, for the first time, tga1-maize in teosinte populations, indicating the allele can survive in the wild. Finally, we compare observed patterns of haplotype structure and mutational age distributions near tga1 with simulations, finding that patterns near tga1 in maize better resemble those generated under simulated selective sweeps on standing variation. These multiple lines of evidence suggest that maize domestication likely drew upon standing genetic variation at tga1 and cement the importance of standing variation in driving adaptation during domestication.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755003

Herein, we devise a live-cell microscopy-based approach to follow hydroxyurea-induced fork stalling and subsequent restart at 30-s resolution. We measure two distinct processes during fork stalling. One is rapid PCNA removal, which reflects the drop in DNA synthesis. The other is gradual RPA1 accumulation on up to 2400 nt of ssDNA per fork despite an active intra-S checkpoint. Restoring the nucleotide pool enables prompt restart without post-replicative ssDNA and a smooth cell cycle progression. ATR, but not ATM inhibition, accelerates hydroxyurea-induced RPA1 accumulation nine-fold, leading to RPA1 exhaustion within 20 min. Fork restart under ATR inhibition led to the persistence of [~]600 nt ssDNA per fork after S-phase, which reached 2500 nt under ATR/ATM co-inhibition, with both scenarios leading to mitotic catastrophe. MRE11 inhibition had no effect on PCNA/RPA1 dynamics regardless of ATR activity. E3 ligase RAD18 was recruited at stalled replication forks in parallel to PCNA removal.

Heterogeneous expression, regulatory complexity, and redundancy offsetting the inhibition of individual proteins, complicate the assignment of targeted therapy. We combined flow cytometry  fingerprinting, immunofluorescence imaging, and computational modeling to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities in DLBCL. The combined workflow predicted selective responses to BCL2 inhibition (venetoclax) and non-canonical NF-{kappa}B inhibition (Amgen16). Within the U2932 cell line we identified distinct resistance mechanisms to BCL2 inhibition in cellular sub-populations recapitulating intratumoral heterogeneity. Co-cultures with CD40L-expressing stromal cells, mimicking the tumor microenvironment (TME), induced resistance to BCL2 and BCLXL targeting BH3-mimetics via cell-type specific upregulation of BCLXL or MCL1. Computational models, validated experimentally, showed that basal NF-{kappa}B activation determined whether CD40 activation drove BH3-mimetic resistance through upregulation of RelB and BCLXL, or cRel and MCL1. High basal NF-{kappa}B activity could be overcome by inhibiting BTK to resensitize cells to BH3-mimetics in CD40L co-culture. Importantly, non-canonical NF-{kappa}B inhibition overcame heterogeneous compensatory BCL2 upregulation, restoring sensitivity to both BCL2-and BCLXL-targeting BH3-mimetics. Combined molecular fingerprinting and computational modelling provides a strategy for the precision use of BH3-mimetics and NF-{kappa}B inhibitors in DLBCL.

Key Points- TME-mimicking co-culture provides resistance to BH3-mimetics through BCLXL, which can be overcome by inhibition of non-canonical NF-{kappa}B.
- Multidisciplinary profiling reveals how high NF-{kappa}B activity leads to crosstalk, and BH3-mimetic resistance counteracted by BTK inhibition.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755004

Condensate formation and function remain incompletely understood due to difficulties in visualizing the condensate interior at high resolution. Here we analyzed the structure of biochemically reconstituted chromatin condensates through cryo-electron tomography. We found that traditional blotting methods of sample preparation were inadequate, and high-pressure freezing plus focused ion beam milling was essential to maintain condensate integrity. To identify densely packed molecules within the condensate, we integrated deep learning-based segmentation with novel context-aware template matching. Our approaches were developed on chromatin condensates, and were also effective on condensed regions of in situ native chromatin. Using these methods, we determined the average structure of nucleosomes to 6.1 and 12 [A] resolution in reconstituted and native systems, respectively, and found that nucleosomes have a nearly random orientation distribution in both cases. Our methods should be applicable to diverse biochemically reconstituted biomolecular condensates and to some condensates in cells.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755004

Post-transcriptional Q/R editing of GluA2 renders AMPARs nearly impermeable to calcium ions, which is crucial for their normal function. Although previous studies have characterized conductivity and selectivity differences between edited and unedited GluA2 variants and heteromeric receptors incorporating GluA2, the atomistic mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigate ion permeation in the context of multiple Ca2+ binding sites along the pore predicted from MD simulations, considering both mutations and co-permeating monovalent ions. Patch clamp electrophysiology recordings confirmed a binding site at the intracellular mouth of the selectivity filter that confers selectivity for calcium over monovalent ions. A patient mutation at the same site has been previously shown to cause neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Furthermore, MD simulations of GluA2 with different arginine copy number at the Q/R site show that Ca2+ conduction is blocked in the presence of two arginines, whereas K+ is only blocked by four arginines, in explaining the results from decades of electrophysiological work. Finally, MD simulations revealed that Ca2+ reduces K+ conduction by preferentially occupying the intracellular SF binding site, whereas Na+ does not. This result is consistent with electrophysiological results from the D590 mutants, and suggests that divalent binding in the selectivity filter is a major determinant of AMPAR conductance.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755004

Typhi) invasion from the gut lumen. Transmission between people occurs through ingestion of contaminated food and water, particularly in settings with poor water and sanitation infrastructure, resulting in over 10 million illnesses annually. As the pathogen invades via the gastrointestinal tract, it is plausible that the gut microbiome may influence the outcome of S. Typhi exposure. There is some evidence that bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) may create an environment unfavourable to invasive Salmonella, but data from humans is limited.

To investigate the association between gut microbiome and typhoid fever, we analysed samples collected from three all-age cohorts enrolled in a prospective surveillance study conducted across three settings where typhoid fever is endemic (Dhaka, Bangladesh; Blantyre, Malawi; and Kathmandu, Nepal). Cohorts consisted of acute typhoid fever patients (n=92), asymptomatic household contacts of typhoid fever patients (representing individuals who were likely exposed to S. Typhi but did not develop disease, n=97), and asymptomatic serosurvey participants with high Vi antibody titres (representing individuals who were exposed to S. Typhi and may be carriers, n=69). The stool microbiomes of each cohort were characterised using shotgun metagenomics, and bacterial diversity, composition, and function were compared.

We identified 4 bacterial species that were significantly lower in abundance in typhoid fever patients compared with household contacts (i.e. probably exposed), in two of the three participant populations (Bangladesh and Malawi). These bacteria may represent taxa that provide protection against development of clinical infection upon exposure to S. Typhi, and include the inflammation-associated species Prevotella copri clade A and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Our functional analysis identified 28 specific metabolic gene clusters (MGCs) negatively associated with typhoid fever in Bangladesh and Malawi, including seven MGCs involved in SCFA metabolism. The putative protection provided by microbiome SCFA metabolism was supported by data from a controlled human infection model conducted in a UK population, in which participants who did not develop typhoid fever following ingestion of S. Typhi had higher abundance of a putative SCFA-metabolising MGC (q-value = 0.22).

This study identified the same protective associations between taxonomic and functional microbiota characteristics and non-susceptibility to typhoid fever across multiple human populations. Future research should explore the potential functional role of SCFAs and inflammation-associated bacteria in resistance to S. Typhi and other enteric infections.","NA","medrxiv",1733695755004

Here, we focused on the contribution of the viral ""internal"" genomic segments of H5N1 B3.13 to bovine cells adaptation. We generated 45 reassortant viruses harbouring the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 and internal gene constellations from several influenza A viruses (IAV) or carrying segment swaps between distinct H5N1 strains. The recombinant B3.13 viruses displayed faster replication kinetics in bovine cells compared to other IAV. Importantly, multiple genomic segments of B3.13 viruses contribute to their faster replicative fitness. Further, recombinants with the B3.13 internal genes were less susceptible than ancestral 2.3.4.4b strain to the bovine IFN response. However, bovine (and human) MX1, a key restriction factor for avian IAV, restricted both ancestral 2.3.4.4b and B3.13 recombinant viruses. Interestingly, the latter escape restriction from human BTN3A3. Finally, recombinant B3.13 was virulent in mice unlike the ancestor 2.3.4.4b recombinant virus.

Here, we report on the identification of a previously unrecognized property of MYOD as repressor of gene expression, via E-box-independent chromatin binding within accessible genomic elements, which invariably leads to reduced chromatin accessibility. MYOD-mediated repression requires the integrity of functional domains previously implicated in MYOD-mediated activation of gene expression. Repression of mitogen-and growth factor-responsive genes occurs through promoter binding and requires a highly conserved domain within the first helix. Repression of cell-of-origin/alternative lineage genes occurs via binding and decommissioning of distal regulatory elements, such as super-enhancers (SE), which requires the N-terminal activation domain as well as two chromatin-remodeling domains and leads to reduced strength of CTCF-mediated chromatin interactions. Surprisingly, MYOD-mediated chromatin compaction and repression of transcription do not associate with reduction of H3K27ac, the conventional histone mark of enhancer or promoter activation, but with reduced levels of the recently discovered histone H4 acetyl-methyl lysine modification (Kacme). These results extend MYOD biological properties beyond the current dogma that restricts MYOD function to a monotone transcriptional activator and reveal a previously unrecognized functional versatility arising from an alternative chromatin recruitment through E-box or non-E-box sequences. The E-box independent repression of gene expression by MYOD might provide a promiscuous mechanism to reduce chromatin accessibility and repress cell-of-origin/alternative lineage and growth factor/mitogen-responsive genes to safeguard the integrity of cell identity during muscle progenitor commitment toward the myogenic lineage.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755004

Current rapid rewarming methods are unreliable at maintaining water temperature between the gold standard range of 37{degrees}C and 39{degrees}C. However, immersion circulators can precisely maintain this temperature range throughout rewarming, potentially leading to better patient outcomes following frostbite injury. In-vitro rewarming trials were conducted using frozen wild boar (Sus scrofa) legs to evaluate 3 rewarming methods: sink and faucet, bucket, and immersion circulator. Porcine leg temperature and water temperature were measured every minute over the 30 minute duration of each trial. The immersion circulator method proved to be the most efficient at reaching the target tissue temperature (9 minutes) while maintaining the least variability in water temperature (0% of time spent below 37{degrees}C). Our study concludes that the immersion circulator method is superior to other methods as it achieves faster and more consistent rewarming. This method has the potential to enhance frostbite treatment protocols, particularly in clinical and field settings where consistent rewarming is difficult to achieve.","NA","medrxiv",1733695755004

It is widely accepted that the spread of this language family across Europe from the 5th millennium BP correlates with the expansion and diversification of steppe-related genetic ancestry from the onset of the Bronze Age6,7. However, multiple steppe-derived populations co-existed in Europe during this period, and it remains unclear how these populations diverged and which provided the demographic channels for the ancestral forms of the Italic, Celtic, Greek, and Armenian languages8,9. To investigate the ancestral histories of Indo-European-speaking groups in Southern Europe, we sequenced genomes from 314 ancient individuals from the Mediterranean and surrounding regions, spanning from 5,200 BP to 2,100 BP, and co-analysed these with published genome data. We additionally conducted strontium isotope analyses on 224 of these individuals. We find a deep east-west divide of steppe ancestry in Southern Europe during the Bronze Age. Specifically, we show that the arrival of steppe ancestry in Spain, France, and Italy was mediated by Bell Beaker (BB) populations of Western Europe, likely contributing to the emergence of the Italic and Celtic languages. In contrast, Armenian and Greek populations acquired steppe ancestry directly from Yamnaya groups of Eastern Europe. These results are consistent with the linguistic Italo-Celtic10,11 and Graeco-Armenian1,12,13 hypotheses accounting for the origins of most Mediterranean Indo-European languages of Classical Antiquity. Our findings thus align with specific linguistic divergence models for the Indo-European language family while contradicting others.

How a single enzyme can sense stress across cells and elicit timely stress response inactivation is poorly understood. Here, we report the structure of human SIFI, which revealed how this 1.3MDa complex can target hundreds of proteins for accurate stress response silencing. SIFI attaches the first ubiquitin to substrates using flexible domains within an easily accessible scaffold, yet builds linkage-specific ubiquitin chains at distinct, sterically restricted elongation modules in its periphery. Ubiquitin handover via a ubiquitin-like domain couples versatile substrate modification to precise chain elongation. Stress response silencing therefore exploits a catalytic mechanism that is geared to process many diverse proteins and hence allows a single enzyme to monitor and, if appropriate, modulate a complex cellular state.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755004

Therefore, we collected predicted protein structures from hyperthermophiles, which differ substantially in their amino acid composition from mesophiles. Notably, ProteinMPNN fails to recover their unique amino acid composition.

These two groups of taxa show contrasting trends in the molecular mechanisms of 3D chromatin organization and long-term evolutionary dynamics of cis-regulatory element (CREs) conservation. To help us identify shared versus derived features that could be responsible for the evolution of these different regulatory architectures in animals, we studied the evolution and organization of the regulatory genome of echinoderms, a lineage whose phylogenetic position and relatively slow molecular evolution has proven particularly useful for evolutionary studies. First, using PacBio and HiC data, we generated new reference genome assemblies for two species belonging to two different echinoderm classes: the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the bat sea star Patiria miniata. Second, we characterized their 3D chromatin architecture, identifying TAD-like domains in echinoderms that, like in flies, do not seem to be associated with CTCF motif orientation. Third, we systematically profiled CREs during sea star and sea urchin development using ATAC-seq, comparing their regulatory logic and dynamics over multiple developmental stages. Finally, we investigated sea urchin and sea star CRE evolution across multiple evolutionary distances and timescales, from closely related species to other echinoderm classes and deuterostome lineages. This showed the presence of several thousand elements conserved for hundreds of millions of years, revealing a vertebrate-like pattern of CRE evolution that probably constitutes an ancestral property of the regulatory evolution of animals.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755004

The recent approval of TCR-gene-edited T cells for cancer therapy demonstrates the therapeutic advantage of using pMHC recognition to eliminate cancer. However, identification and selection of TCRs from patient material is complex and influenced by the TCR repertoire of the donors used. To overcome these limitations, we here present a rapid and robust de novo binder design platform leveraging state-of-the-art generative models, including RFdiffusion, ProteinMPNN, and AlphaFold2, to engineer minibinders (miBds) targeting the cancer-associated pMHC complex, NY-ESO-1(157-165)/HLA-A*02:01. By incorporating in silico cross-panning and molecular dynamics simulations, we enhanced specificity screening to minimise off-target interactions. We identified a miBd that exhibited high specificity for the NY-ESO-1-derived peptide SLLMWITQC in complex with HLA-A*02:01 and minimal cross-reactivity in mammalian display assays. We further demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this miBd by integrating it into a chimeric antigen receptor, as de novo Binders for Immune-mediated Killing Engagers (BIKEs). BIKE-transduced T cells selectively and effectively killed NY-ESO-1+ melanoma cells compared to non-transduced controls, demonstrating the promise of this approach in precision cancer immunotherapy.

These three loci, Teosinte crossing barrier 1 (Tcb1), Gametophytic factor 1 (Ga1), and Ga2, each play a key role in preventing hybridization between populations and are proposed to maintain the barrier between domesticated and wild subspecies. Each locus encodes a matching pair of silk- and pollen-active pectin methylesterases (PMEs). To investigate the diversity and molecular evolution of these gametophytic factor loci, we identified existing and improved models of the responsible genes in a new genome assembly which contains active versions of all three loci. We then examined fifty-two assembled genomes from seventeen species to classify haplotype diversity and identify sites under diversifying selection during the evolution of the causal genes. We show that Ga2, the oldest of these three loci, was duplicated to form Ga1 at least 12 million years ago. Tcb1, the youngest locus, arose as a duplicate of Ga1 before or around the time of diversification of the Zea genus. We find evidence of positive selection during evolution of the functional genes at an active site in the pollen-expressed PME and predicted surface sites in both the silk- and pollen-expressed PMEs. The most common allele at the Ga1 locus is a conserved ga1 allele (ga1-O), which is non-coding due to conserved stop codons in full-length gene copies that are between 610 thousand and 1.5 million years old. We show that the ga1-O allele is associated with and likely generates 24-nt siRNAs in developing pollen-producing tissue, and these siRNAs map to functional Ga1 alleles. In previously-published crosses, the ga1-O allele associates with reduced function of the typically dominant functional alleles for the Ga1 and Tcb1 barriers. Taken together, this seems to be an example of a type of epigenetic trans-homolog silencing known as paramutation functioning at a locus controlling a reproductive barrier.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755004

Early-life adversity (ELA) is a risk for human affective disorders involving dysregulated reward behaviors. In mice, ELA causes anhedonia-like behaviors in males and augmented reward motivation in females, indicating sex-dependent disruption of reward circuit operations. We recently identified a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expressing GABAergic projection from basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) that governs reward-seeking deficits in adult ELA males--but not females.

MethodsTo probe the sex-specific role of this projection in reward behaviors, adult male and female CRH-Cre mice raised in control or ELA conditions received excitatory or inhibitory Cre-dependent DREADDs in BLA, and then clozapine N-oxide or vehicle to NAc medial shell during reward behaviors. We determined the cell identity of the projection using immunostaining and electrophysiology. Using tissue clearing, light sheet fluorescence microscopy and deep learning pipelines, we mapped brain-wide BLA CRH+ axonal projections to uncover sex differences in innervation.

ResultsChemogenetic manipulations in male mice demonstrated inhibitory effects of the CRH+ BLA-NAc projection on reward behaviors, whereas neither excitation nor inhibition influenced female behaviors. Molecular and electrophysiological cell-identities of the projection did not vary by sex. By contrast, comprehensive whole-brain mapping uncovered significant differences in NAc innervation patterns that were both sex and ELA-dependent, as well as selective changes of innervation of other brain regions.

ConclusionsThe CRH/GABA BLA-NAc projection that influences reward behaviors in males differs structurally and functionally in females, uncovering potential mechanisms for the profound sex-specific impacts of ELA on reward behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755004

In the case of ligand-gated ion channels, agonist binding triggers rapid transition through a series of intermediate states leading to a transient open-pore conformation. These transitions are usually framed in terms of a mechanism where agonist binding and channel activation are separate events. Here, we collect cryo-EM images over a range of agonist concentrations to define structures of the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in unliganded, mono-liganded, and di-liganded states. We show that agonist binding to a single agonist site stabilizes an intermediate state where an entire principal agonist-binding subunit has transitioned to an active-like conformation, while the other unoccupied principal subunit remains inactive, albeit poised for activation. Binding of agonist to the second agonist site fully activates the remaining subunits leading to hydration of the ion pore. Uniting this cryo-EM derived intermediate structure with single-channel recordings leads to a model where individual acetylcholine receptor subunits asynchronously undergo conformational transitions, and thus a sequential activation mechanism that has implications for the entire superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755004

SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to multisystem deficits, including those affecting the nervous system. Here, we investigated whether a SARS-CoV-2 infection alone increases the susceptibility to develop parkinsonian phenotypes in C57BL/6J mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor, or in addition to two well-known toxin exposures, MPTP and paraquat. Additionally, we examined mice carrying a G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene. We also examined if vaccination with either an mRNA- or protein-based vaccine can alter any observed neuropathology. We find that the infection with the WA-1/2020 (alpha) or omicron B1.1.529 strains in ACE2 and G2019S LRRK2 mice both synergize with a subtoxic exposure to the mitochondrial toxin MPTP to induce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra. This synergy appears toxin-dependent since we do not observe this following exposure to the direct redox-inducing compound paraquat. This synergistic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is rescued in WT mice that were vaccinated using either mRNA- and protein- based vaccines directed against the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, in the G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice, we find that only the protein-based vaccine but not the mRNA- based vaccine resulted in a rescue of the SARS-CoV-2 mediated neuropathology. Taken together, our results highlight the role of both environmental exposures and familial background on the development of parkinsonian pathology secondary to viral infection and the benefit of vaccines in reducing these risks.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755004

Here, using experimental evolution, we show that the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae can adapt to freeze-thaw stress in a stereotyped manner, with survival increasing nearly two orders of magnitude from {approx}2% to {approx}70% in about 25 cycles of stress exposure. Adapted cells exhibit reduced membrane damage, smaller sizes, higher mass densities, and a lower prevalence of budding. Rheological measurements show that the adapted cells are stiffer and exhibit lower particle mobilities within the cytoplasm. Whole genome sequencing indicates that increased survival is not accompanied by specific (unique) genetic changes, but rather is associated with multiple, distinct genotypes. Concomitant with mechanical changes in the adapted cells, the basal intracellular level of trehalose, a sugar speculated to play a physical role in maintaining membrane and cytoplasmic integrity, exhibits a three-fold increase. Together, these cellular attributes strongly correlate with the entry of cells into a quiescence-like state. A quantitative model that incorporates selection based on cellular quiescence recapitulates the adaptation dynamics, i.e. increase in survival and trehalose levels, seen in experiments. Finally, we find that the evolved mechano-chemical phenotypes are similar even when we use qualitatively different freeze-thaw selection protocols for the evolution, hinting at a convergent adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755004

With the advance of population genomics, studies in diverse organisms revealed supergenes associated with a myriad of complex traits, ranging from morphology to sexual behavior, from butterfly wing patterns to floral morphs. Two supergenes have been described on non-homologous ""social chromosomes"" in two ant lineages, Solenopsis and Formica, that diverged more than 90 million years ago. In both lineages, the supergene is associated with social polymorphism, where some colonies are headed by a single queen (monogyne) while others harbor multiple queens (polygyne). We discovered a new supergene associated with similar social polymorphism in the desert ant Cataglyphis niger. Although Cataglyphis is more closely related to Formica than to Solenopsis, the social chromosome in C. niger is homologous to the Solenopsis social chromosome, with conservation of synteny in gene content as well as gene order. Therefore, this is an ancient chromosome dating back to the common ancestor of Solenopsis and Cataglyphis, at least 90 million years ago. Previous work dated the Solenopsis supergene to be only one million years old, therefore, we propose that the two supergenes have evolved independently in the two diverged lineages on this ancient social chromosome. We surveyed hymenopteran genomes to discover a bee chromosome homologous to the ants social chromosome. The conservation of the gene set on these homologous chromosomes in ants and bees suggests that this chromosome plays an important role in social behavior across social Hymenoptera. We hypothesize that the conserved gene set in the social chromosome was repeatedly used as a pre-adapted toolkit for the evolution of social traits in general and specifically in the evolution of polygyne social structure in ants.","NA","biorxiv",1733695755004

We find that {beta} cell ablation impedes PDAC development in mice, arguing that the endocrine pancreas is critical for exocrine tumorigenesis. Conversely, obesity induces {beta} cell hormone dysregulation, alters CCK-dependent peri-islet exocrine cell transcriptional states, and enhances islet proximal tumor formation.

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty. We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit. Based on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still undeniably demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1733695755004

MethodsProtocol expansions to PREVENT-19 included enrollment of adolescents (aged 12 to <18 years) and administration of 3rd and 4th doses of NVX-CoV2373 to adults and adolescents. Participants randomized 2:1 received NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 21 days apart; 3rd and 4th doses were administered [&ge;]6 months after the preceding dose. Secondary and additional assessments included post-3rd- and 4th-dose immune responses (neutralizing antibody [nAb], anti-rS IgG, human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-receptor binding inhibition [hACE2-RBI]) and response durability (post-3rd dose) to ancestral virus; cross-reactivity to Omicron subvariants; safety; and reactogenicity.

ResultsImmune responses were observed against ancestral virus after two doses of NVX-CoV2373 but not after placebo. In both adults and adolescents, additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 increased nAb titers, anti-rS IgG levels, and hACE2-RBI; durable responses were recorded 8 months post 3rd dose. nAb responses post 3rd dose were noninferior to those post primary series. Cross-reactivity to BA.5 and BQ.1.1 variants was also observed, with anti-rS IgG levels post 3rd or 4th dose exceeding previously reported correlates of protection. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated, with no new safety signals.

ConclusionsNVX-CoV2373 elicited robust and durable humoral immune responses to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 as a 3rd and 4th dose after the primary series in adults and adolescents. Cross-reactivity to relevant variants provides insight into potential protection against antigenically related, but shifted, viral strains. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated with no new safety signals.

From 2022, the national vaccination programme has been run twice per year, prioritising older age groups or those classified as clinically vulnerable. Here we assess the trends in COVID-19 outcomes between September 2023 and April 2024, using national-level data held by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

MethodsData linkage of national-level COVID-19 episode data, NHS emergency and hospital attendance data, and death registrations were used to analyse COVID-19 outcomes. Outcomes were defined as COVID-19 associated A&E attendances, hospital admissions, severe hospitalisations, and deaths.

The number and rate of each COVID-19 outcome category between September 2023 and April 2024 was calculated, stratified by clinical risk status and age and sex.

ResultsThe most common COVID-19 outcomes during this time-period were A&E attendance and hospital admission, with the rates highest among those aged 75 and over. Among this age group, all outcomes disproportionately affect those who have been identified as at clinical risk and those who were immunosuppressed.

High rates of A&E attendance and hospital admission were also observed among infants (under 6 months old) but were lower for more severe outcomes.

DiscussionGroups that were most affected by COVID-19 outcomes were currently prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination in England, which will help protect against more severe outcomes including admission to intensive care and death.

Immunity has been acquired through natural infection, primary and booster vaccination, while protection has been lost through waning immunity and viral mutation. During the height of the pandemic in England, the main aim was to rapidly protect the population and large supplies of vaccine were pre-purchased, eliminating the need for cost-effective calculations. As we move to an era where for the majority of the population SARS-CoV-2 infections cause relatively mild disease, and vaccine stocks need to be re-purchased, it is important we consider the cost-effectiveness and economic value of COVID-19 vaccination programmes.

MethodsHere using data from 2023 and 2024 in England on COVID-19 hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths, coupled with bespoke health economic costs, we consider the willingness to pay threshold for COVID-19 vaccines in different age and risk groups. We partition the population into sixteen 5-year age-groups and three risk groups (no-risk, at-risk and immunosuppressed) and calculate the health savings, in terms of costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), per vaccine dose. We adopt three different methodological approaches to estimate the level of vaccine protection leading to five different estimates of efficacy.

FindingsWillingness to pay thresholds vary from less than {pound}1 for younger age-groups without any risk factors, to over {pound}100 for older age-groups with comorbidities that place them at risk. This extreme non-linear dependence on age, means that despite the different method of estimating vaccine efficacy, there is considerable qualitative agreement on the willingness to pay threshold, and therefore which ages it is cost-effective to vaccinate. For pre-purchased vaccine, where the only cost is administration ({approx}{pound}10), a twice-yearly universal booster offer to all those aged 70 and over is cost-effective (the benefits outweigh the administration costs), while for the at-risk group this could be extended to those over 65. When the vaccine cost is included, the cost-effective ages reduce, such that at a total cost of {pound}30 (for vaccine and administration) universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 75; while at {pound}60 universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 80.

InterpretationThe historic offer of COVID-19 vaccination to those 65 and over for the autumn 2023 programme and those over 75 for the spring 2023 programme, aligns with our cost-effective threshold for pre-purchased vaccine when the only cost was administration. However, for future programmes, when vaccine costs are included, the age-thresholds slowly increase thereby demonstrating the continued importance of protecting the eldest and most vulnerable in the population.","NA","medrxiv",1733695755004

Genomic analysis has identified a lineage with limited internal diversity most closely related to a genome sequence from a sporadic case sampled in 2014 in Uganda, though the lineages have diverged from a common ancestor that was circulating for decades in the animal reservoir.

Notably, the data also provide evidence that the outbreak resulted from a single zoonotic transmission event with limited human-to-human transmission, rather than multiple independent zoonotic transmission events. The Rwandan MVD outbreak prompted a thorough investigation that included contact tracing, clinical assessment, travel history, sequencing, and serology testing, to trace the viruss origin. Results of investigations linked the index case to a mining cave inhabited by Rousettus aegyptiacus (the Egyptian fruit bat), where three individuals tested seropositive for IgG and IgM, further supporting the zoonotic origin of the outbreak through human-animal interactions.","NA","medrxiv",1733695755004
