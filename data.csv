So far, a well-known mammalian mutation PB2-E627K has not been maintained in AIV in poultry, which limits the spread of AIVs from avian to humans. Here, we discovered a variant, PB2-627V, which combines the properties of avian-like PB2-627E and human-like PB2-627K, overcoming host restrictions and posing a risk for human pandemics. Specifically, by screening the global PB2 sequences, we discovered a new independent cluster with PB2-627V emerged in the 2010s, which is prevalent in various avian, mammalian, and human isolates of AIVs, including H9N2, H7N9, H3N8, 2.3.4.4b H5N1, and other subtypes. And, the increasing prevalence of PB2-627V in poultry is accompanied by a rise in human infection cases with this variant. Then we systematically assessed its host adaptation, fitness, and transmissibility across three subtypes of AIVs (H9N2, H7N9, and H3N8) in different host models, including avian and human cells, chickens, mice, and ferrets where infections naturally occur. We found that PB2-627V facilitates AIVs to efficiently infect and replicate in chickens and mice by utilizing both avian- and human-origin ANP32A proteins. Importantly, and like PB2-627K, PB2-627V promotes efficient transmission between ferrets through respiratory droplets. Deep sequencing in passaged chicken samples and transmitted ferret samples indicates that PB2-627V remains stable across the two distinct hosts and has a high potential for long-term prevalence in avian species. Therefore, the mutation has the ability to continue spreading among poultry and can also overcome the barrier between birds and humans, greatly enhancing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, it is crucial to closely monitor influenza viruses carrying PB2-627V to prevent a pandemic.

Author summaryAvian influenza viruses (AIVs) play a critical role in the evolution of pandemic influenza viruses. Adaptive changes in AIVs enable them to infect mammalian species by altering viral interactions with host-specific factors, and one well-known example is the PB2-E627K mutation. Fortunately, this mutation is sporadic and rare in AIVs, usually occurring after infecting humans, and AIVs with PB2-627E, which is prevalent in poultry, cannot easily infect humans. However, if an AIV manages to overcome this species barrier, the risk of a pandemic originating from an AIV will significantly increase. In our study, we identified a dual adaptive variant called PB2-627V that combines avian-like properties of PB2-627E and human-like properties of PB2-627K. This variant not only maintains viral fitness in chickens but also facilitates aerosol transmission of AIVs between ferrets. Mechanistically, PB2-627V utilizes both avian and human host protein ANP32A to support viral polymerase function. The mutation exhibited good fitness in both birds and humans, thereby greatly increasing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. The PB2-627V polymorphism has been found in birds, humans, and mammals worldwide across more than ten AIV subtypes. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, we recommend considering PB2-627V as a new molecular marker to assess the pandemic potential of AIVs.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Using smLiveFISH, we tracked individual endogenous NOTCH2 and MAP1B mRNA transcripts in living cells and identified two distinct localization mechanisms: co-translational translocation of NOTCH2 mRNA at the endoplasmic reticulum, and directional transport of MAP1B mRNA toward the cell periphery. This method has the potential to unlock principles governing the spatiotemporal organization of native transcripts in health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Published studies in the life and health sciences often employ sample sizes that are too small to detect realistic effect sizes. This shortcoming increases the rate of false positives and false negatives, giving rise to a potentially misleading scientific record. To address this shortcoming, many researchers now use point-and-click software to run sample size calculations. Objective. We aimed to (1) estimate how many published articles report using the G*Power sample size calculation software; (2) assess whether these calculations are reproducible and (3) error-free; and (4) assess how often these calculations use G*Power's default option for mixed-design ANOVAs; which can be misleading and output sample sizes that are too small for a researcher's intended purpose. Method. We randomly sampled open access articles from PubMed Central published between 2017 and 2022 and used a coding form to manually assess 95 sample size calculations for reproducibility and errors. Results. We estimate that more than 48,000 articles published between 2017 and 2022 and indexed in PubMed Central or PubMed report using G*Power (i.e., 0.65% [95% CI: 0.62% - 0.67%] of articles). We could reproduce 2% (2/95) of the sample size calculations without making any assumptions, and likely reproduce another 28% (27/95) after making assumptions. Many calculations were not reported transparently enough to assess whether an error was present (75%; 71/95) or whether the sample size calculation was for a statistical test that appeared in the results section of the publication (48%; 46/95). Few articles that performed a calculation for a mixed-design ANOVA unambiguously selected the non-default option (8%; 3/36). Conclusion. Published sample size calculations that use G*Power are not transparently reported and may not be well-informed. Given the popularity of software packages like G*Power, they present an intervention point to increase the prevalence of informative sample size calculations.","NA","medrxiv",1721254151895

PhotoFiTT leverages machine learning and cell cycle dynamics to analyse mitotic timing, cell size changes, and overall cellular activity in response to controlled light exposure. Using adherent mammalian cells, we demonstrate PhotoFiTT's ability to detect wavelength- and dose-dependent effects, showcasing that near-UV light induces significant mitotic delays at doses as low as 0.6 J/cm2, while longer wavelengths require higher doses for comparable effects. PhotoFiTT enables researchers to establish quantitative benchmarks for acceptable levels of photodamage, facilitating the optimisation of imaging protocols that balance image quality with sample health.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Here we present Vesicle Picker, an open-source program built on the Segment Anything model. Vesicle Picker enables automatic identification of vesicles in cryo-EM micrographs with high recall and precision. It then exhaustively selects all potential particle locations, either at the perimeter or uniformly over the surface of the projection of the vesicle. The program is designed to interface with cryoSPARC, which performs both upstream micrograph processing and downstream single particle image analysis. We demonstrate Vesicle Picker's utility by determining a high-resolution map of the vacuolar-type ATPase from micrographs of native synaptic vesicles (SVs) and identifying an additional protein or protein complex in the SV membrane.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

The diazotrophic photoautotrophs also serve as a hub for specialized heterotrophic bacterial communities whose physiological contributions are poorly understood. By comparing the axenic strain Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 and the related strains Nostoc sp. KVJ2 and KVJ3, which still maintain their heterotrophic microbiome, we were able to demonstrate an almost obligate dependence of the cyanobacteria on the heterotrophic partners under carbon-limiting conditions. Detailed analysis of the intimate bilateral relationship between N. punctiforme and the isolate Agrobacterium tumefaciens Het4 using shotgun proteomics and microscopy uncovered a complex partnership characterized, among other traits, by competition for iron and facilitation for carbon. Although competitive interactions with A. tumefaciens Het4 compromise nitrogen fixation and stimulate the degradation of cyanophycin, mutualistic dependency prevails under inorganic carbon limitation. Both the absence of the high affinity bicarbonate uptake transporter SbtA and the prevalent extracarboxysomal localization of the carbon-fixing enzyme RubisCO, as detected by immunofluorescence microscopy, suggest that a weak carbon concentrating mechanism in N. punctiforme enforces a dependence on heterotrophic bacteria. Further, immunofluorescence, electron microscopic and proteomic analyses reveal a pronounced extracellular recycling of proteins under N- and C-limiting conditions. Our study shows that the pivotal influence of heterotrophic bacteria on symbiotic Nostoc strains should be considered when analyzing these cyanobacteria, especially in the free-living state. This work also sheds new light on how Nostoc benefits from the organic carbon provided by plant hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

However, a general methodology for targeting IDPs/IDRs has yet to be developed. Here, we show that starting only from the target sequence of the input, and freely sampling both target and binding protein conformation, RFdiffusion can generate binders to IDPs and IDRs in a wide range of conformations. We use this approach to generate binders to the IDPs Amylin, C-peptide and VP48 in a range of conformations with Kds in the 3 -100nM range. The Amylin binder inhibits amyloid fibril formation and dissociates existing fibers, and enables enrichment of amylin for mass spectrometry-based detection. For the IDRs G3bp1, common gamma chain (IL2RG) and prion, we diffused binders to beta strand conformations of the targets, obtaining 10 to 100 nM affinity. The IL2RG binder colocalizes with the receptor in cells, enabling new approaches to modulating IL2 signaling. Our approach should be widely useful for creating binders to flexible IDPs/IDRs spanning a wide range of intrinsic conformational preferences.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Here, we combine functional assays, super-resolution imaging, and 3D genomics with computational modelling to dissect SICC emergence. We establish that the competition between CTCF-bound and non-bound loci dictates clustering propensity. Upon senescence entry, cells repurpose SRRM2, a key component of nuclear speckles, and BANF1, a ""molecular glue"" for chromosomes, to cluster CTCF and rewire genome architecture. This CTCF-centric reorganization in reference to nuclear speckles functionally sustains the senescence splicing program, as SICC disruption fully reverts alternative splicing patterns. We therefore uncover a new paradigm, whereby cells translate changes in nuclear biochemistry into architectural changes directing splicing choices so as to commit to the fate of senescence.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Viruses that infect prokaryotes (phages) constitute the most abundant group of biological agents, playing pivotal roles in microbial systems. They are known to impact microbial community dynamics, microbial ecology, and evolution. Efforts to document the diversity, host range, infection dynamics, and effects of bacteriophage infection on host cell metabolism are extremely underexplored. Phages are classified as virulent or temperate based on their life cycles. Temperate phages adopt the lysogenic mode of infection, where the genome integrates into the host cell genome forming a prophage. Prophages enable viral genome replication without host cell lysis, and often contribute novel and beneficial traits to the host genome. Current phage research predominantly focuses on lytic phages, leaving a significant gap in knowledge regarding prophages, including their biology, diversity, and ecological roles. Results. Here we develop and describe Prophage-DB, a database of prophages, their proteins, and associated metadata that will serve as a resource for viral genomics and microbial ecology. To create the database, we identified and characterized prophages from genomes in three of the largest publicly available databases. We applied several state-of-the-art tools in our pipeline to annotate these viruses, cluster and taxonomically classify them, and detect their respective auxiliary metabolic genes. In total, we identify and characterize over 350,000 prophages and 35,000 auxiliary metabolic genes. Our prophage database is highly representative based on statistical results and contains prophages from a diverse set of archaeal and bacterial hosts which show a wide environmental distribution. Conclusion. Prophages are particularly overlooked in viral ecology and merit increased attention due to their vital implications for microbiomes and their hosts. Here, we created Prophage-DB to advance our comprehension of prophages in microbiomes through a comprehensive characterization of prophages in publicly available genomes. We propose that Prophage-DB will serve as a valuable resource for advancing phage research, offering insights into viral taxonomy, host relationships, auxiliary metabolic genes, and environmental distribution.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1721254151895

We can generalize by ignoring task-irrelevant features, report different features of a stimulus, and use different actions to report a perceptual judgment. These forms of flexible behavior are associated with small modulations of the responses of sensory neurons. While the existence of these response modulations is indisputable, efforts to understand their function have been largely relegated to theory, where they have been posited to change information coding or enable downstream neurons to read out different visual and cognitive information using flexible weights. Here, we tested these ideas using a rich, flexible behavioral paradigm, multi-neuron, multi-area recordings in primary visual cortex (V1) and mid-level visual area V4. We discovered that those response modulations in V4 (but not V1) contain the ingredients necessary to enable flexible behavior, but not via those previously hypothesized mechanisms. Instead, we demonstrated that these response modulations are precisely coordinated across the population such that downstream neurons have ready access to the correct information to flexibly guide behavior without making changes to information coding or synapses. Our results suggest a novel computational role for task-dependent response modulations: they enable flexible behavior by changing the information that gets out of a sensory area, not by changing information coding within it.

SignificanceNatural perceptual judgments are continuous, generalized, and flexible. We estimate the ripeness of a piece of fruit on a continuous scale, we generalize by judging the ripeness of either a mango or an avocado even though they look very different, we flexibly judge either the size or the ripeness of the same piece of fruit, and we can flexibly indicate the same perceptual judgment using a variety of behaviors such as by speaking or writing any of many languages. Here, we show that the response modulations in visual cortex long associated with cognitive processes, surround modulation, or motor planning are sufficient to guide all these aspects of natural perceptual decision-making. We find that across the population, these response modulations reorient and reformat visual representations so that the relevant information is used to guide behavior via communication with downstream neurons. Our results are an example of a general computational principle for flexible behavior that emerges from the coordinated activity of large populations of neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Traditionally, it relies on small molecules that induce proximity between a target protein and an E3 ubiquitin ligase to prompt target ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Sporadic reports indicated that ligands designed to inhibit a target can also induce its destabilization. Among others, this has repeatedly been observed for kinase inhibitors. However, we lack an understanding of frequency, generalizability, and mechanistic underpinnings of these phenomena. To address this knowledge gap, we established dynamic abundance profiles of 98 kinases after cellular perturbations with 1570 kinase inhibitors, revealing 160 selective instances of inhibitor-induced kinase destabilization. Kinases prone to degradation are frequently annotated as HSP90 clients, thus affirming chaperone deprivation as an important route of destabilization. However, detailed investigation of inhibitor-induced degradation of LYN, BLK and RIPK2 revealed a differentiated, common mechanistic logic where inhibitors function by inducing a kinase state that is more efficiently cleared by endogenous degradation mechanisms. Mechanistically, effects can manifest by ligand-induced changes in cellular activity, localization, or multimerization and can be prompted by direct target engagement or network effects. In sum, our data indicates that inhibitor-induced kinase degradation is a frequent event and positions supercharging of endogenous degradation circuits as an alternative to classical proximity-inducing degraders.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying auditory-olfactory integration using anatomical, electrophysiological, and optogenetic approaches, focusing on the auditory cortex as a key locus for cross-modal integration. First, retrograde and anterograde viral tracing strategies revealed a direct projection from the piriform cortex to the auditory cortex. Next, using in vivo electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activity in the auditory cortex of awake mice, we found that odor stimuli modulate auditory cortical responses to sound. Finally, we used in vivo optogenetic manipulations during electrophysiology to demonstrate that olfactory modulation in auditory cortex, specifically, odor-driven enhancement of sound responses, depends on direct input from the piriform cortex. Together, our results identify a novel cortical circuit shaping olfactory modulation in the auditory cortex, shedding new light on the neuronal mechanisms underlying auditory-olfactory integration.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

However, previous studies examining the mode in which species diversified, how diversification rates varied, and how ecological specialization affected these processes have found few different results across different taxa and geographic and ecological systems, showing how complex this process is. To gain a more complete picture of how species evolve, additional model systems that encompass alternative ecological requirements are needed. Here, we present the results of a study aimed to unravel the diversification mode and evolutionary drivers of the spider genus Dysdera, the red devil spiders, endemic to the Canary Islands. These species exhibit remarkable phenotypic variability in their mouthparts, which has been related to different levels of specialization in the predation of isopods. We explored patterns of linage diversification and assessed the role of trophic specialization as a driver of species diversification. Additionally, we used climatic variables, occurrence data and morphological information to unravel the underlying mode of speciation by means of joint species distribution models and age-range correlation methods. Our results reveal that red devil spiders underwent an early burst of diversification, followed by a slowdown of diversification rates, which is a hallmark of adaptive radiation. We also found evidence that the trophic morphology shaped diversification, with specialist species exhibiting higher rates of diversification. Finally, our analyses suggest that speciation occurred mostly in allopatry, with subsequent secondary sympatry following range expansion.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

The relationship between cell shape and forces has been extensively studied for cells seeded on flat 2-dimensional (2D) substrates, but not for cells in more physiological three-dimensional (3D) settings. Here, we demonstrate a technique called 3D micropatterned traction force microscopy (3D-TFM) to confine cells in three-dimensional wells of defined shape, while simultaneously measuring the forces transmitted between cells and their microenvironment. This technique is based on the 3D micropatterning of polyacrylamide wells and on the calculation of 3D traction force from their deformation. With 3D-TFM, we show that MCF10A breast epithelial cells exert defined, reproducible patterns of forces on their microenvironment, which can be both contractile and extensile. We further show that cells switch from a global contractile to extensile behaviour as their volume is reduced. Our technique enables the quantitative study of cell mechanobiology with full access to 3D cellular forces while having accurate control over cell morphology and the mechanical conditions of the microenvironment.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Wheat resistance breeding frequently relies on the use of resistance (R) genes that encode diverse immune receptors which detect specific avirulence (AVR) effectors and subsequently induce an immune response. While R gene cloning has accelerated recently, AVR identification in many pathogens including Bgt lags behind, preventing pathogen-informed deployment of resistance sources. Here we describe a new ''avirulence depletion (AD) assay'' for rapid identification of AVR genes in Bgt. This assay relies on the selection of a segregating, haploid F1 progeny population on a resistant host, followed by bulk sequencing, thereby allowing rapid avirulence candidate gene identification with high mapping resolution. In a proof-of-concept experiment we mapped the AVR component of the wheat immune receptor Pm3a to a 25kb genomic interval in Bgt harboring a single effector, the previously described AvrPm3a2/f2. Subsequently, we applied the AD assay to map the unknown AVR effector recognized by the Pm60 immune receptor. We show that AvrPm60 is encoded by three tandemly arrayed, nearly identical effector genes that trigger an immune response upon co-expression with Pm60 and its alleles Pm60a and Pm60b. We furthermore provide evidence that Pm60 outperforms Pm60a and Pm60b through more efficient recognition of AvrPm60 effectors, suggesting it should be prioritized for wheat breeding. Finally, we show that virulence towards Pm60 is caused by simultaneous deletion of all AvrPm60 gene paralogs and that isolates lacking AvrPm60 are especially prevalent in the US thereby limiting the potential of Pm60 in this region. The AD assay is a powerful new tool for rapid and inexpensive AVR identification in Bgt with the potential to contribute to pathogen-informed breeding decisions for the use of novel R genes and regionally tailored gene deployment.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

In our study, we investigated the case of Saccharolobus solfataricus, a crenarchaeon belonging to the TACK branch, which mainly uses leaderless mRNAs. We characterized the small ribosomal subunit of S. solfataricus bound to SD-leadered or leaderless mRNAs (lmRNAs). Cryo-EM structures show for the first time archaeal versions of eS25, eS26 and eS30 proteins bound to the small subunit. In addition, we identify two novel ribosomal proteins named aS33 and aS34 as well as a domain of eS6, that highlight the diversity of archaeal ribosomes. Leaderless mRNAs are bound to the small ribosomal subunit, and the 5'-triphosphate group contributes to their binding. Archaeal eS26 is in the mRNA exit channel wrapped around the 3' end of ribosomal RNA, as it is in eukaryotes. Its position is not compatible with an SD:antiSD duplex in the mRNA exit channel.

All participants underwent two weeks of left leg immobilization via the use of crutches and a locking leg brace. After this two-week period, all participants underwent eight weeks (3 d/week) of knee extensor focused progressive RT. Vastus lateralis (VL) ultrasound-derived thickness and muscle cross-sectional area were measured at baseline (PRE), immediately after disuse (MID), and after RT (POST) with VL muscle biopsies collected at these time points. T and UT presented lower ultrasound derived VL size (cross-sectional area and thickness) values at MID versus PRE (p[&le;]0.001), and values increased in both groups from MID to POST (p<0.05); however, VL size increased from PRE to POST in UT only (p<0.001). Mean and type II myofiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) values demonstrated a main effect of time where PRE and POST were greater than MID (p<0.05) and main effect of training status where T was greater than UT (P[&le;]0.012). In both groups, satellite cell number was not affected by leg immobilization but increased in response to RT (p[&le;]0.014), with T being greater than UT across all time points (p=0.004).

In conclusion, immobilization-induced muscle atrophy and recovery RT hypertrophy outcomes are similar between UT and T participants, and the lack of molecular signature differences between groups supports these findings. However, these data are limited to younger adults undergoing non-complicated disuse. Thus, further investigation to determine the impact of training status on prolonged leg immobilization models mirroring current medical protocols (e.g., following orthopedic injury and surgery) is warranted.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

In the absence of defined network junctions, the high conformational freedom of the molecules was previously theorized to confer unique mechanical properties to Olympic gels, such as non-linear elasticity and unconventional swelling characteristics. However, the synthesis of an Olympic gel exhibiting these intriguing features is challenging, since unintended crosslinking and polymerization processes are often favored over cyclization. Here, we report the successful assembly of a true Olympic gel from a library of DNA rings comprising more than 16,000 distinct molecules. Each of these rings contains a unique sequence domain that can be enzymatically activated to produce reactive termini that favor intramolecular cyclization. We characterized the genetic, mechanical, and structural characteristics of the material by next-generation sequencing, oscillatory rheology, large-scale computational simulations, atomic force microscopy, and cryogenic electron microscopy. Our results confirm the formation of a stable Olympic gel, which exhibits unique swelling behavior and an elastic response exclusively determined by entanglements, yet persists on long time scales. By combining concepts from polymer physics, synthetic biology, and DNA nanotechnology, this new material class provides a flexible experimental platform for future studies into the effects of network topology on macroscopic material properties and its function as a carrier of genetic information in biological and biomimetic systems. This work moreover demonstrates that exotic material properties can emerge in systems with a high compositional complexity that is more reminiscent of biological than synthetic matter.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Resistance training biased to active lengthening (eccentric) contractions increases SSN in young muscle, however, we showed maximal eccentric training in old rats did not alter SSN and further worsened performance. A submaximal eccentric training stimulus may be more conducive to adaptation for aged muscle. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess whether submaximal eccentric training can increase SSN and improve mechanical function in old rats. Twelve 32-month-old male F344/BN rats completed 4 weeks of submaximal (60% maximum) isokinetic eccentric plantar-flexion training 3 days/week. Pre- and post training, we assessed in-vivo maximum isometric torque at a stretched and neutral ankle angle, the passive torque-angle relationship, and the isotonic torque-angular velocity-power relationship.

SSN increased 11% and 8%, and muscle wet weight increased 14% and 13% in the soleus and MG, respectively. Maximum isometric torque and shortening velocity were unaltered, but there was a shift towards longer muscle lengths for the optimal angle of torque production, a 42% reduction of passive torque, and 23% increase in peak isotonic power.

Additionally, FSH at prepubertal (0.1 IU/L) and pubertal concentrations (10 IU/L) significantly enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and increased intracellular cAMP concentrations in intact human pancreatic islets. In children with obesity from the Beta-JUDO cohort (n=608), plasma FSH levels were positively associated with several insulin secretion indices, particularly in pubertal children. These findings suggest that FSH has significant metabolic roles beyond reproduction, involving insulin secretion and potentially contributing to puberty-related hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Obtaining targets at sufficient purity and scale typically requires the screening of several protein variants and expression hosts. Existing cloning strategies allow to produce constructs for co-expression of proteins, but are often time-consuming, labour-intensive, host-specific, or involving error-prone assembly steps. Here we present a unique set of vectors together with a novel assembly strategy designed to overcome these limitations. It allows for the generation of expression constructs for multi-subunit protein complexes for various hosts in a single cloning step. Its modular nature allows the system to be easily extended to target additional expression hosts or to include new tags or regulatory sequences. As a proof of principle, we present the parallel construction of expression vectors for several Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes, allowing us to devise strategies for the recombinant production of these targets in bacteria, insect cells, and human cells, respectively.

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

Here, we present an approach to achieve robust expansion of plant protoplasts, termed Expansion microscopy in plant PrOtoplast SystEms (ExPOSE). We demonstrate that coupling ExPOSE with other imaging techniques, immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization chain reaction to visualize proteins and mRNAs, respectively, greatly enhances the spatial resolution of endogenous biomolecules.

Existing RNA sequencing methods have significant limitations: short-read (SR) sequencing provides high depth but struggles with isoform deconvolution, whereas long-read (LR) sequencing offers isoform resolution at the cost of lower depth, higher noise, and technical biases. Addressing this gap, we introduce Multi-Platform Aggregation and Quantification of Transcripts (MPAQT), a generative model that combines the complementary strengths of different sequencing platforms to achieve state-of-the-art isoform-resolved transcript quantification, as demonstrated by extensive simulations and experimental benchmarks. By applying MPAQT to an in vitro model of human embryonic stem cell differentiation into cortical neurons, followed by machine learning-based modeling of transcript abundances, we show that untranslated regions (UTRs) are major determinants of isoform proportion and exon usage; this effect is mediated through isoform-specific sequence features embedded in UTRs, which likely interact with RNA-binding proteins that modulate mRNA stability. These findings highlight MPAQTs potential to enhance our understanding of transcriptomic complexity and underline the role of splicing-independent post-transcriptional mechanisms in shaping the isoform and exon usage landscape of the cell.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

The BIOME study (NCT06231706) was a 6-week, parallel design randomised controlled trial in 399 healthy adults in the UK, investigating a simple dietary intervention containing 30+ whole-food ingredients high in plant polyphenolic compounds, fibre and micronutrients. Participants were randomised to the primary intervention (prebiotic blend; 30g/d) or control (bread croutons; 28g/d; isocaloric functional equivalent) or a daily probiotic (L. rhamnosus). The primary outcome was change in  favourable and  unfavourable microbiome species compared to control, secondary outcomes included changes in blood metabolites, gut symptoms, stool output, anthropometric measures, subjective hunger, sleep, energy and mood. A crossover test meal challenge sub-study was conducted in 34 participants, investigating postprandial glucose responses, subjective hunger, satiety and mood.

In the 349 male and female participants (mean age 50yrs) included in the analysis (intention-to-treat), self-reported adherence was high (> 98% for all treatments). Following the prebiotic blend, significant improvements were seen in the change and ranking of  favourable and  unfavourable species as well as beta diversity (weighted-UniFrac measure), but not in the control or probiotic group. There were significantly greater improvements in self reported indigestion, constipation, heartburn, flatulence and energy, following the prebiotic vs control, and hunger following the prebiotic vs probiotic. Addition of the prebiotic to a high carbohydrate test meal challenge resulted in significant improvements in subjective hunger, fullness, and energy (3h incremental area under the curve). No other significant differences between groups were observed.

This prebiotic blend is a simple dietary strategy that benefits gut microbiome composition, gut symptoms and self-reported energy and hunger.

Some species exhibited an extraordinary tolerance against high-dose irradiation even in a hydrated state. Given that natural sources of high radiation are rare, the selective pressure to obtain such a high radiotolerance during evolution remains elusive. It has been postulated that high radiation tolerances could be derived from adaptation to dehydration, because both dehydration and radiation cause similar damage on biomolecules at least partly, e.g., DNA cleavage and oxidation of various biomolecules, and dehydration is a common environmental stress that terrestrial organisms should adapt to. Although tardigrades are known for high radiotolerance, the radiotolerance records have been reported only for desiccation-tolerant tardigrade species and nothing was known about the radio-tolerance in desiccation-sensitive tardigrade species. Hence, the relationship between desiccation-tolerance and radio-tolerance remained unexplored. To this end, we examined the radiotolerance of the desiccation-sensitive tardigrade, Grevenius myrops (formerly known as Isohypsibius myrops) in comparison to the well-characterized desiccation-tolerant tardigrade, Ramazzottius varieornatus. The median lethal dose (LD50) of G. myrops was approximately 2,240 Gy. This was much lower than those reported for desiccation tolerant eutardigrades. The effects of irradiation on the lifespan and the ovipositions were more severe in G. myrops compared to those in R. varieornatus. The present study provides the precise records on the radiotolerance of a desiccation-sensitive tardigrade and the current data supported the certain correlation between desiccation tolerance and radiotolerance at least in eutardigrades.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

ResultsOur study examined the shifts in the bacterial community within canine plaque as PD intensifies, analyzing plaque samples from 48 dogs at various PD stages. Additionally, we examined the impact of a tooth-brushing regimen using a dental gel on twelve dogs. We revealed a correlation between the age of the dogs and the severity of PD. As PD advanced, we noted a marked increase in Porphyromonas abundance, a key pathogenic genus. Conversely, Conchiformibius prevalence diminished in higher PD levels. Furthermore, a regimen of two week brushing with a dental gel resulted in a notable decrease in Porphyromonas levels and five of the twelve dogs improve severity.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest the potential efficacy of daily brushing with dental gels, incorporating compounds proven effective in humans, for managing PD in dogs. This study demonstrates a distinct disease progression in dogs compared to humans, underscoring the need for continued research and innovation in veterinary oral healthcare.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Current understanding indicates that NMD is often significantly suppressed during viral infections to protect the viral genome. In numerous viruses, this inhibition is achieved through direct or indirect interference with the RNA helicase UPF1, thereby promoting viral replication and enhancing pathogenesis. In this study, we employed biochemical, biophysical assays, and cellular investigations to explore the interplay between UPF1 and the Nucleocapsid (Np) protein of SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated their direct interaction and its impact on inhibiting cellular NMD. Furthermore, we characterized how this interaction affects UPF1's enzymatic function. Our findings demonstrate that Np inhibits the unwinding activity of UPF1 by physically obstructing its access to structured nucleic acid substrates. Additionally, we showed that Np binds directly to UPF2, disrupting the formation of the UPF1/UPF2 complex essential for NMD progression. Intriguingly, our research also uncovered a surprising pro-viral role of UPF1 and an antiviral function of UPF2. These results unveil a novel, multi-faceted mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 evades the host's defenses and manipulates cellular components.

However, the repetitive nature of TEs has hindered our understanding of their regulatory potential. Here, we demonstrate that long- read chromatin fiber sequencing (Fiber-seq) permits the comprehensive annotation of the regulatory potential of maize TEs. We uncover that only 94 LTR retrotransposons contain the functional epigenetic architecture required for mobilization within maize leaves. This epigenetic architecture degenerates with evolutionary age, resulting in solo TE enhancers being preferentially marked by simultaneous hyper-CpG methylation and chromatin accessibility, an architecture markedly divergent from canonical enhancers. We find that TEs shape maize gene regulation by creating novel promoters within the TE itself as well as through TE-mediated gene amplification. Lastly, we uncover a pervasive epigenetic code directing TEs to specific loci, including that locus that sparked McClintocks discovery of TEs.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

At the same time, improved computational models are capable of reproducing behavior and neural activity with increasing fidelity. Unfortunately, these advances have drastically increased the complexity of integrating different lines of research, resulting in the missed opportunities and untapped potential of suboptimal experiments. Experiment simulation can help bridge this gap, allowing model and experiment to better inform each other by providing a low-cost testbed for experiment design, model validation, and methods engineering. Specifically, this can be achieved by incorporating the simulation of the experimental interface into our models, but no existing tool integrates optogenetics, two-photon calcium imaging, electrode recording, and flexible closed-loop processing with neural population simulations. To address this need, we have developed Cleo: the Closed-Loop, Electrophysiology, and Optophysiology experiment simulation testbed. Cleo is a Python package enabling injection of recording and stimulation devices as well as closed-loop control with realistic latency into a Brian spiking neural network model. It is the only publicly available tool currently supporting two-photon and multi-opsin/wavelength optogenetics. To facilitate adoption and extension by the community, Cleo is open-source, modular, tested, and documented, and can export results to various data formats. Here we describe the design and features of Cleo, validate output of individual components and integrated experiments, and demonstrate its utility for advancing optogenetic techniques in prospective experiments using previously published systems neuroscience models.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

However, existing PRS construction methods rely on static summary statistics derived from genome-wide association studies (GWASs), which are often updated at lengthy intervals. As genetic data and health outcomes are continuously being generated at an ever-increasing pace, the current PRS training and deployment paradigm is suboptimal in maximizing the prediction accuracy of PRSs for incoming patients in healthcare settings. Here, we introduce real-time PRS-CS (rtPRS-CS), which enables online, dynamic refinement and calibration of PRS as each new sample is collected, without the need to perform intermediate GWASs. Through extensive simulation studies, we evaluate the performance of rtPRS-CS across various genetic architectures and training sample sizes. Leveraging quantitative traits from the Mass General Brigham Biobank and UK Biobank, we show that rtPRS-CS can integrate massive streaming data to enhance PRS prediction over time. We further apply rtPRS-CS to 22 schizophrenia cohorts in 7 Asian regions, demonstrating the clinical utility of rtPRS-CS in dynamically predicting and stratifying disease risk across diverse genetic ancestries.","NA","medrxiv",1721254151895

GPCRs can exhibit signal pleiotropy via formation of di/oligomers both with themselves and other GPCRs. A deeper understanding of the molecular basis and functional role of oligomerization would facilitate rational design of activity-selective ligands. A structural model of the D2 dopamine receptor (D2R) homomer identified distinct combinations of substitutions likely to stabilise protomer interactions. Molecular modelling of {beta}-arrestin-2 ({beta}arr2) bound to predicted dimer models suggests a 2:2 receptor:{beta}arr2 stoichiometry, with the dimer favouring {beta}arr2 over Gi coupling. A combination of biochemical, biophysical and super-resolution, single molecule imaging approaches demonstrated that the D2R mutant homomers exhibited greater stability. The mutant D2R homomers also exhibited bias towards recruitment of the GPCR adaptor protein {beta}arr2 with either faster or ligand-independent {beta}arr2 recruitment, increased internalization and reprogrammed ERK signaling compared to D2R WT. Through GPCR dimer-stabilisation, we demonstrate that D2R di/oligomerization has a role in {beta}arr2-biased signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

In addition to impacting poultry, these HPAI viruses caused mortality events in wild bird species and wild mammals. Transmission in multiple host species raises the concern for mammalian adaptation. On March 25, 2024, HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was confirmed in a dairy cow in Texas in response to a multi-state investigation into milk production losses. Over one hundred positive herds were rapidly identified in Texas and eleven other U.S. states. The case description included reduced feed intake and rumen motility in lactating cows, decreased milk production, and thick yellow milk. The diagnostic investigation revealed detections of viral RNA in milk and mammary tissue with alveolar epithelial degeneration and necrosis, and positive immunoreactivity of glandular epithelium by immunohistochemistry. A single transmission event, likely from avian species to dairy cattle, followed by limited local transmission preceded the onward lateral transmission of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13. We sought to experimentally reproduce infection with genotype B3.13 in Holstein yearling heifers and lactating cows. The heifers were inoculated by an aerosol respiratory route and the cows by an intramammary route. Clinical disease was mild in the heifers, but infection was confirmed by virus detection, lesions, and seroconversion. Clinical disease in lactating cows included decreased rumen motility, changes to milk appearance, and production losses consistent with field reports of viral mastitis. Infection was confirmed by high levels of viral RNA detected in milk, virus isolation, lesions in mammary tissue, and seroconversion. This study provides the foundation to investigate additional routes of infection, transmission, and intervention strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Fusion is mediated by the binding of the viral Spike protein to its receptor ACE2. Lipid rafts are dynamic nanodomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Rafts can act as platforms for entry of dierent viruses by localizing virus receptors, and attachment factors to the same membrane microdomains. Here, we first demonstrate that cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin inhibits Spike mediated fusion and entry. To further study the role of ACE2 lipid raft localization in SARS-CoV-2 fusion and entry, we design a GPI-anchored ACE2 construct. Both ACE2 and ACE2-GPI proteins are similarly expressed at the plasma membrane. Through membrane flotation assays, we show that in dierent cell lines, ACE2-GPI localises predominantly to raft domains of the plasma membrane while ACE2 is non-raft associated. We then compare the ability of ACE2 and ACE2-GPI to permit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry and syncytia formation and replication of dierent viral variants. We find little dierence in the two proteins. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 entry and fusion are a cholesterol dependent and raft-independent process.

IMPORTANCERafts are often exploited by viruses and used as platforms to enhance their entry into the cell or spread from cell-to-cell. The membrane localization of ACE2 and the role of lipid rafts in SARS-CoV-2 entry and cell-to-cell spread is poorly understood. The function of lipid rafts in viral fusion is often studied through their disruption by cholesterol-depleting agents. However, this process may have o-target impacts on viral fusion independently of lipid-raft disruption. Therefore, we created an ACE2 construct that localizes to lipid rafts using a GPI anchor. Conversely, wild-type ACE2 was non-raft associated. We find that the localization of ACE2 to lipid rafts does not modify the fusion dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Typical MINFLUX microscopes localize the target molecule by scanning a zero-intensity focus around the molecule in a circular trajectory, with smaller trajectory diameters yielding lower localization uncertainties for a given number of photons. Since this approach requires the molecule to be within the scanned trajectory, MINFLUX typically relies on a photon-demanding iterative scheme with decreasing trajectory diameters. Although the iterative procedure does not substantially reduce the photon efficiency of MINFLUX, this approach is prone to misplacements of the trajectory and increases the systems complexity. In this work, we introduce ISM-FLUX, a novel implementation of MINFLUX using image-scanning microscopy (ISM) with a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array detector. ISM-FLUX provides precise MINFLUX localization within the trajectory while maintaining conventional photon-limited uncertainty outside it. The robustness of ISM-FLUX localization results in a larger localization range and greatly simplifies the architecture, which may facilitate broader adoption of MIN-FLUX.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1721254151895

Here, we establish a PAX3::FOXO1 zebrafish injection model and semi-automated ChIP-seq normalization strategy to evaluate how PAX3::FOXO1 initially interfaces with chromatin in a developmental context. We investigated PAX3::FOXO1s recognition of chromatin and subsequent transcriptional consequences. We find that PAX3::FOXO1 interacts with inaccessible chromatin through partial/homeobox motif recognition consistent with pioneering activity. However, PAX3::FOXO1-genome binding through a composite paired-box/homeobox motif alters chromatin accessibility and redistributes H3K27ac to activate neural transcriptional programs. We uncover neural signatures that are highly representative of clinical rhabdomyosarcoma gene expression programs that are enriched following chemotherapy. Overall, we identify partial/homeobox motif recognition as a new mode for PAX3::FOXO1 pioneer function and identify neural signatures as a potentially critical PAX3::FOXO1 tumor initiation event.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Although rare in agricultural settings, field sampling of wild grasses in the Middle East revealed the disease persistence in wild barley. Identification of Z. passerinii in distinct wild barley species led us to investigate signatures of host specialization using genomics to address the mode of emergence by host tracking or host range expansion. Furthermore, we applied virulence assays and confocal laser microscopy to evaluate if the disease development differs between wild and domesticated barley. Wild- and domesticated-host infecting populations have diverged, and phylogenetic relationships support the emergence of sympatric host-specific lineages. Cross-virulence assays showed that Zymoseptoria passerinii from domesticated hosts infect domesticated barley and its wild ancestor, Hordeum spontaneum. However, wild isolates from Iran did not infect domesticated barley. Wild and domesticated pathosystems have similar disease timing and progression, suggesting its persistence in natural ecosystems might be tied to environmental conditions. The study supports that a wide range of hosts can foster the emergence of host-specific lineages in sympatry and provide novel insights into the evolution of understudied fungal pathogens on wild crop relatives.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Cryptic coral lineages-genetically distinct yet morphologically similar groups-are critically important as they often exhibit functional diversity relevant to thermal tolerance. Additionally, environmental parameters such as thermal variability may promote tolerance, but how variability interacts with holobiont partners to shape responses to thermal challenge remains unclear. Here, we identified three cryptic lineages of Siderastrea siderea in Bocas del Toro, Panama that differ in distributions across inshore and offshore reefs, microbial associations, holobiont phenomes, and skeleton morphologies. A thermal variability experiment failed to increase thermal tolerance, but subsequent thermal challenge and recovery revealed one lineage maintained elevated energetic reserves, photochemical efficiency, and growth. Lastly, coral cores highlighted that this lineage also exhibited faster growth historically. Functional variation among cryptic lineages highlights their importance in predicting coral reef responses to climate change.

Mimicking bursts of IS copies in host-restricted endosymbionts and pathogens, we evolved the bacteria under relaxed neutral conditions. Within ten weeks, we observed a median of 24.5 IS insertions per genome, comparable to a decade of wild-type evolution.

In many species, these regulatory domains are established during zygotic genome activation (ZGA). In Drosophila, ZGA occurs after 13 fast, reductive, syncytial nuclear divisions during which the nuclear to cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio grows exponentially. These divisions incorporate maternally-loaded, cytoplasmic pools of histones into chromatin. Previous work found that chromatin incorporation of replication-coupled histone H3 decreases while its variant H3.3 increases in the cell cycles leading up to ZGA. In other cell types, H3.3 is associated with sites of active transcription as well as heterochromatin, suggesting a link between H3.3 incorporation and ZGA. Here, we examine the factors that contribute to H3.3 incorporation at ZGA. We identify a more rapid decrease in the nuclear availability of H3 than H3.3 over the final pre-ZGA cycles. We also observe an N/C ratio-dependent increase in H3.3 incorporation in mutant embryos with non-uniform local N/C ratios. We find that chaperone binding, not gene expression, controls incorporation patterns using H3/H3.3 chimeric proteins at the endogenous H3.3A locus. We test the specificity of the H3.3 chaperone pathways for H3.3 incorporation using Hira (H3.3 chaperone) mutant embryos. Overall, we propose a model in which local N/C ratios and specific chaperone binding regulate differential incorporation of H3.3 during ZGA.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

This paper aimed to assess a multitude of cardiac signs, symptoms, and conditions, as well as focused on patients with and without congenital heart defects (CHDs), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the post-acute cardiovascular outcomes among children and adolescents after COVID-19.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 19 US childrens hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and September 2023. Every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry. Absolute risks of incident post-acute COVID-19 sequelae were reported. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by contrasting COVID-19-positive with COVID-19-negative groups using a Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through propensity scoring stratification.

ResultsA total of 1,213,322 individuals under 21 years old (mean[SD] age, 7.75[6.11] years; 623,806 male [51.4%]) were included. The absolute rate of any post-acute cardiovascular outcome in this study was 2.32% in COVID-19 positive and 1.38% in negative groups. Patients with CHD post-SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks of any cardiovascular outcome (RR, 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-1.80), including increased risks of 11 of 18 post-acute sequelae in hypertension, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias), myocarditis, other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest), thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain and palpitations). Those without CHDs also experienced heightened cardiovascular risks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57-1.69), covering 14 of 18 conditions in hypertension, arrhythmias (ventricular arrhythmias and premature atrial or ventricular contractions), inflammatory heart disease (pericarditis and myocarditis), other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock), thrombotic disorders (pulmonary embolism and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and syncope).

ConclusionsBoth children with and without CHDs showed increased risks for a variety of cardiovascular outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the need for targeted monitoring and management in the post-acute phase.

Clinical Perspective sectionO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIWe investigated the risks of 18 post-acute COVID-19 cardiovascular outcomes in the pediatric population without Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in over 1 million patients, stratified by congenital heart defects (CHD) status.
C_LIO_LIWe extended the follow-up period beyond previous pediatric studies, ensuring every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry.
C_LIO_LIWe included a comprehensive cross-section of the US pediatric population across various healthcare settings including primary, specialty, and emergency care, as well as testing and inpatient facilities.

Pathological prolonged beta bursts within the subthalamic nucleus (STN) are associated with both worse impairment and freezing behavior in PD, which are improved with deep brain stimulation (DBS). The goal of the current study was to investigate the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of beta burst-driven adaptive DBS (aDBS) for FOG in PD.

MethodsSeven individuals with PD were implanted with the investigational Summit RC+S DBS system (Medtronic, PLC) with leads placed bilaterally in the STN. A PC-in-the-loop architecture was used to adjust stimulation amplitude in real-time based on the observed beta burst durations in the STN. Participants performed either a harnessed stepping-in-place task or a free walking turning and barrier course, as well as clinical motor assessments and instrumented measures of bradykinesia, OFF stimulation, on aDBS, continuous DBS (cDBS), or random intermittent DBS (iDBS).

ResultsBeta burst driven aDBS was successfully implemented and deemed safe and tolerable in all seven participants. Gait metrics such as overall percent time freezing and mean peak shank angular velocity improved from OFF to aDBS and showed similar efficacy as cDBS. Similar improvements were also seen for overall clinical motor impairment, including tremor, as well as quantitative metrics of bradykinesia.

ConclusionBeta burst driven adaptive DBS was feasible, safe, and tolerable in individuals with PD with gait impairment and FOG.","NA","medrxiv",1721254151895

When selecting goals, people maximize  expected value by selecting actions that maximize potential reward while minimizing associated costs, including effort  costs and the opportunity cost of time. In MDD, differential weighing of costs and benefits are theorized mechanisms underlying changes in goal-directed cognition and may contribute to symptom heterogeneity. We used the Effort Foraging Task to quantify cognitive and physical effort costs, and patch leaving thresholds in low effort conditions (hypothesized to reflect perceived opportunity cost of time) and investigated their shared versus distinct relationships to clinical features in participants with MDD (N=52, 43 in-episode) and comparisons (N=27). Contrary to our predictions, none of the decision-making measures differed with MDD diagnosis. However, each of the measures were related to symptom severity, over and above effects of ability (i.e., performance). Greater anxiety symptoms were selectively associated with lower cognitive effort cost (i.e. greater willingness to exert effort). Anhedonia symptoms were associated with increased physical effort costs. Finally, greater physical anergia was related to decreased patch leaving thresholds. Markers of effort-based decision-making may inform understanding of MDD heterogeneity. Increased willingness to exert cognitive effort may contribute to anxiety symptoms such as rumination and worry. The association of decreased leaving thresholds with symptom severity is consistent with reward rate-based accounts of reduced vigor in MDD. Future research should address subtypes of depression with or without anxiety, which may relate differentially to cognitive effort decisions.","NA","medrxiv",1721254151895

If fighting was essential to get access to mates and territory, then why did fights rarely lead to serious injury? Maynard Smith and Price developed game theory to show that limited war can be selected at the individual level. Owing to the explanatory potential of this first paper, and enabled by the elegant and powerful machinery of the soon-to-be-developed replicator dynamics [2, 3], EGT took off at an accelerated pace and began to shape expectations across systems and scales. But, even as it expanded its reach from animals to microbes [4-8] and from microbes to cancer [9-11], the field did not revisit a fundamental assumption of that first paper, which subsequently got weaved into the very fabric of the framework--that individual differences in reproduction are determined only by payoff from the game (i.e. in isolation, all individuals, regardless of strategy, were assumed to have identical intrinsic growth rates). Here, we argue that this original assumption substantially limits the scope of EGT. But, because it is not explicitly presented as a caveat, predictions of EGT have been empirically tested broadly across real systems, where the intrinsic growth rates are generally not equal. That has, unsurprisingly, led to puzzling findings and contentious debates [7, 12-15]. Flagging the high potential for confusion to arise from applications of EGT to empirical systems that it is not designed to study and suggesting a way forward constitute our main motivation for this work. In the process, we reestablish a dialog with ecology that can be fruitful both ways, e.g., by providing a so-far-elusive explanation for how diverse ecological communities can assemble evolutionarily.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

While all immature and mature human NK cells co-express SYK and ZAP70, clonally driven memory or adaptive NK cells can methylate SYK genes and signaling is mediated exclusively using ZAP70. Here, we examined the role of SYK and ZAP70 in a clonal human NK cell line KHYG1 by CRISPR-based deletion using a combination of experiments and mechanistic computational modeling. Elimination of SYK resulted in more robust Ca++ influx after cross-linking of the CD16 and NKp30 receptors and enhanced phosphorylation of downstream proteins, whereas ZAP70 deletion diminished these responses. By contrast, ZAP70 depletion increased proliferation of the NK cells. As immature T cells express both SYK and ZAP70 but mature T cells often express only ZAP70, we transduced the human Jurkat cell line with SYK and found that expression of SYK increased proliferation but diminished TCR-induced Ca2+ flux and activation. We performed transcriptional analysis of the matched sets of variant Jurkat and KHYG1 cells and observed profound alterations caused by SYK expression. As depletion of SYK in NK cells increased their activation, primary human NK cells were transduced with a CD19-targeting CAR and were CRISPR edited to ablate SYK or ZAP70.

Vitellogenin forms part of yolk granules (also known as yolk organelles), as maternal contribution of nutrients that support the embryonic development of oviparous animals. In Caenorhabditis elegans, vitellogenin proteins (VIT-1 to VIT-6) are synthesized in the hermaphrodite intestine, secreted into the pseudocoelom and internalized by oocytes. Although a general route for inter-tissue vitellogenin transport has been described, the full mechanism that underlies its intracellular trafficking within the intestine remains obscure. In humans, transport and Golgi organization protein 1 (TANGO1) and TANGO1-like (TALI) proteins generate super-sized membrane carriers to accommodate bulky ApoB-containing lipoprotein particles for their export from ER exit sites. Transport facilitated by TANGO1 family of proteins is considered as an alternative, COPII-independent ER exit pathway. Thus far, TANGO1 orthologs have been discovered in most metazoans, except nematodes. Here, we report the C. elegans protein R148.3 (now Transport and Golgi organization 1-like or TNGL-1) as a mediator of vitellogenin export from the ER. TNGL-1 depletion triggers VIT-2 accumulation in the intestinal ER lumen. TNGL-1 requires its C-terminal unstructured domain for its localization to ER exit sites. Like TANGO1, it utilizes a luminal globular domain for cargo engagement. Our findings support TNGL-1 as a distant TANGO1 family member.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

However, the clinical adoption of such models remains challenging. Here we describe a proof-of-concept framework that, leveraging open-source DP software and Health Level 7 (HL7) standards, allows the integration of DL models in the clinical workflow. Development and testing of the workflow were carried out in a fully digitized Italian pathology department. A Python-based server-client architecture was implemented to interconnect the anatomic pathology laboratory information system (AP-LIS) with an external artificial intelligence decision support system (AI-DSS) containing 16 pre-trained DL models through HL7 messaging. Open-source toolboxes for DL model deployment, including WSInfer and WSInfer-MIL, were used to run DL model inference. Visualization of model predictions as colored heatmaps was performed in QuPath. As soon as a new slide is scanned, DL model inference is automatically run on the basis of the slide's tissue type and staining. In addition, pathologists can initiate the analysis on-demand by selecting a specific DL model from the virtual slides tray. In both cases the AP-LIS transmits an HL7 message to the AI-DSS, which processes the message, runs DL model inference, and creates the appropriate type of colored heatmap on the basis of the employed classification model. The AI-DSS transmits model inference results to the AP-LIS, where pathologists can visualize the output in QuPath and/or directly from the virtual slides tray. The developed framework supports multiple DL toolboxes and it is thus suitable for a broad range of applications. In addition, this integration workflow is a key step to enable the future widespread adoption of DL models in pathology diagnostics.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Here, we report that inhibition of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), which metabolizes tryptophan to kynurenine (KYN) in the first step of the kynurenine pathway, rescues hippocampal memory function and plasticity in preclinical models of amyloid and tau pathology by restoring astrocytic metabolic support of neurons. Activation of IDO1 in astrocytes by amyloid-beta42 and tau oligomers, two major pathological effectors in AD, increases KYN and suppresses glycolysis in an AhR-dependent manner. Conversely, pharmacological IDO1 inhibition restores glycolysis and lactate production. In amyloid-producing APPSwe-PS1{Delta}E9 and 5XFAD mice and in tau-producing P301S mice, IDO1 inhibition restores spatial memory and improves hippocampal glucose metabolism by metabolomic and MALDI-MS analyses. IDO1 blockade also rescues hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in a monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)-dependent manner, suggesting that IDO1 activity disrupts astrocytic metabolic support of neurons. Indeed, in vitro mass-labeling of human astrocytes demonstrates that IDO1 regulates astrocyte generation of lactate that is then taken up by human neurons. In co-cultures of astrocytes and neurons derived from AD subjects, deficient astrocyte lactate transfer to neurons was corrected by IDO1 inhibition, resulting in improved neuronal glucose metabolism. Thus, IDO1 activity disrupts astrocytic metabolic support of neurons across both amyloid and tau pathologies and in a model of AD iPSC-derived neurons. These findings also suggest that IDO1 inhibitors developed for adjunctive therapy in cancer could be repurposed for treatment of amyloid- and tau-mediated neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

To disentangle the contributions of mutational and selective processes, we derive a novel phylogenetic model and fit it to multi-species data from mammalian skin tissue. We find that over macroevolutionary time: 1) there has been strong stabilizing selection on protein abundances; 2) mutations impacting mRNA abundances have minimal influence on protein abundances; 3) mRNA abundances are under selection to track protein abundances, and 4) mRNA abundances adapt more quickly than protein abundances due to increased mutational opportunity. We find additional support for these findings by comparing gene-specific parameter estimates from our model to human functional genomic data. More broadly, our new phylogenetic approach provides a foundation for testing hypotheses about the processes that led to divergence in gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

One recent suggestion that could explain this mixed evidence is that different sleep stages have differential effects on insight. In addition, computational work has suggested that neural variability and regularisation play a role in increasing the likelihood of insight. To investigate the link between insight and different sleep stages as well as regularisation, we conducted a preregistered study in which N=90 participants performed a perceptual insight task before and after a 20 minute daytime. Sleep EEG data showed that N2 sleep, but not N1 sleep, increases the likelihood of insight after a nap, suggesting a specific role of deeper sleep. Exploratory analyses of EEG power spectra showed that spectral slopes could predict insight beyond sleep stages, which is broadly in line with theoretical suggestions of a link between insight and regularisation. In combination, our findings point towards a role of N2 sleep and aperiodic, but not oscillatory, neural activity for insight.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

We examined within-city social disparities in exposure to flooding in 276 Latin American cities and associated features of the neighborhood urban environment.

MethodsWe used a spatially granular dataset of historical flood events from 2000 to 2018 to describe neighborhood flooding within cities across eight Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico, and Panama). We estimated the percentage of the population living in flooded neighborhoods, described social disparities in flooding based on neighborhood educational attainment, and compared the magnitude of disparities across and within cities. We used multilevel models to examine how city- and neighborhood-level factors are related to neighborhood flooding.

ResultsWe examined 44,698 neighborhoods in 276 cities from eight countries with a total of 223 million residents and 117 distinct flood events from 2000-2018. One in four residents in neighborhoods in the lowest education quintile lived in neighborhoods with flooding, compared to one in 20 residents of the highest neighborhood education quintile. Greater neighborhood flooding was associated with lower neighborhood-level educational attainment and with neighborhoods that were coastal, less dense (population or intersection), further from the city center, greener, and had steeper slopes. There was no association between city-level educational attainment and flooding.

ConclusionThere are large social disparities in neighborhood flooding within Latin American cities. Residents of areas with lower education attainment face substantially higher risks of flooding. Policymakers must prioritize flood adaptation and recovery efforts in neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic position.","NA","medrxiv",1721254151895

These bacteria are vital players in the global carbon cycle, assimilating billions of tonnes of chitin for carbon (and nitrogen) metabolites. Many bacterial proteins involved in the process-including chitinases, sugar transporters, and modifying enzymes-have been well studied. However, the genetic functional interplay and key drivers of Vibrio competitive survival in the presence of chitin as the dominant carbon source is not understood. To address this question, we carried out transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) to determine the genetic fitness of Vibrio parahaemolyticus mutants grown on chitin as a sole carbon source. Along with validating known Vibrio genes associated with chitin metabolism, our data newly identified vital roles for an unclassified OprD-like import porin and a HexR family transcriptional regulator. Furthermore, we functionally implicated HexR in regulating multiple physiological processes involved in V. parahaemolyticus environmental survival including carbon assimilation and cell growth, biofilm formation, and cell motility. Notably, our data revealed a strict requirement for HexR in filamentous cell morphology, a critical trait for V. parahaemolyticus environmental fitness. Therefore, a vital import porin and genomic regulation mediated by HexR supports multiple physiological processes for Vibrio chitinolytic growth and environmental fitness.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Species with specialized ecological requirements or habitat preferences, like clownfishes (Amphiprioninae), may have been particularly vulnerable due to their intricate dependence on sea anemones. The diverse host specializations within this group likely contributed distinct responses to sea-level fluctuations, differentially shaping their recent evolutionary histories. Leveraging a comprehensive genomic dataset, we reveal demographic patterns and connectivity dynamics across multiple populations of ten clownfish species under different host specializations. Host-generalist species demonstrated strong resilience to habitat perturbations, while those specialized on single hosts suffered dramatic bottlenecks linked to sea-level fluctuations. Spatial analyses revealed the significant role of oceanic currents in shaping clownfish genetic diversity landscapes. Dispersal barriers were driven by environmental variables, with the Coral Triangle emerging as a hub of genetic diversity. Our results reveal how clownfish associative behavior influences their population dynamics, holding major implications for their conservation such as the need to consider their mutualism with sea anemones, particularly on host-specialists, to ensure their survival in the face of climate threats. These findings extend broader principles of conservation, improving our understanding of species responses to ecological constraints and environmental changes over evolutionary timescales.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

However, how exactly the PT invades the receptive synergid is unknown as the spatial relationship between these two cells is unclear. To better understand this process we performed 3D live imaging of PT reception in Arabidopsis thaliana. Upon arrival at the filiform apparatus (FA), a region rich in membrane folds at the micropylar pole of the synergids, the PT gradually deforms the FA before it rapidly grows into the receptive synergid. Upon penetration, the membrane of the receptive synergid invaginates and envelopes the PT. We termed this newly discovered structure the peri-tubular membrane (PRM). We show that, in feronia mutants disrupting PT reception, the PT still enters the receptive synergid, forming a normal PRM. This results in extensive invagination of the synergid membrane without sperm release. We show that PRM formation is associated with a cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) spike of high amplitude in the PT and flooding of [Ca2+]cyt in the synergids. In PTs lacking AUTOINHIBITED Ca2+ ATPASE9 activity, PTs have lower amplitude [Ca2+]cyt spiking and the PTs frequently fail to penetrate the synergid. Our findings suggest that synergid penetration and the non-cell autonomous control of PT rupture are distinct regulated processes required for fertilization in flowering plants.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Notably, certain choanoflagellate species can engage in facultative multicellular development resembling the early stages of embryogenesis. In the past few years, Salpingoeca rosetta has emerged as a tractable model for choanoflagellate cell biology and multicellular development, notably through mutant screens and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout (KO). However, existing KO pipelines have variable and sometimes low efficiency, frequently requiring isolation and genotyping of hundreds of clones without guarantee to obtain a KO strain. Here, we present a robust method for gene inactivation in S. rosetta that relies on insertion by CRISPR/Cas9 of a single 1.9 kb cassette encoding both a premature termination sequence and an antibiotic resistance gene. We show that this approach allows robust, fast and efficient isolation of KO clones after antibiotic selection. As a proof of principle, we first knocked out all three genes previously proposed to regulate S. rosetta multicellular development in a published mutant screen (rosetteless, couscous and jumble), and confirmed all three KOs abolished multicellular development. Whole genome sequencing revealed a unique specific insertion of the termination/resistance cassette in KO strains. To showcase the potential of this method for de novo characterization of candidate developmental genes, we then inactivated three genes encoding homologs of components of the Hippo pathway, which controls cell proliferation and multicellular size in animals: hippo, warts and yorkie. Interestingly, warts KO rosettes were consistently about twice larger than their wild-type counterparts, indicating that our KO pipeline has the potential to rapidly reveal novel loss-of-function phenotypes of biological interest. We propose that this method has the potential to accelerate choanoflagellate functional genetics.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

At the heart of gene regulation are promoters, yet their regulatory logic is still incompletely understood. Here, we report PARM, a cell-type specific deep learning model trained on specially designed massively parallel reporter assays that query human promoter sequences. PARM requires [~]1,000 times less computational power than state-of-the-art technology, and reliably predicts autonomous promoter activity throughout the genome from DNA sequence alone, in multiple cell types. PARM can even design purely synthetic strong promoters. We leveraged PARM to systematically identify binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) that are likely to contribute to the activity of each natural human promoter. We uncovered and experimentally confirmed striking positional preferences of TFs that differ between activating and repressive regulatory functions, as well as a complex grammar of motif-motif interactions. For example, many, but not all, TFs act as repressors when their binding motif is located near or just downstream of the transcription start site. Our approach lays the foundation towards a deep understanding of the regulation of human promoters by TFs.

Here we evaluate a proposed feedforward and modular mapping of this process in rats: evidence accumulated in anterodorsal striatum (ADS) is categorized in prefrontal cortex (frontal orienting fields, FOF). Contrary to this, we show that both regions appear to be indistinguishable in their encoding/decoding of accumulator value and communicate this information bidirectionally. Consistent with a role for FOF in accumulation, silencing FOF to ADS projections impacted behavior throughout the accumulation period, even while nonselective FOF silencing did not. We synthesize these findings into a multi-region recurrent neural network trained with a novel approach. In-silico experiments reveal that multiple scales of recurrence in the cortico-striatal circuit rescue computation upon nonselective FOF perturbations. These results suggest that ADS and FOF accumulate evidence in a recurrent and distributed manner, yielding redundant representations and robustness to certain perturbations.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Given a collection of reference sequences, a c-dBG can be essentially regarded as a map from k-mers to their color sets. The color set of a k-mer is the set of all identifiers, or colors, of the references that contain the k-mer. While these maps find countless applications in computational biology (e.g., basic query, reading mapping, abundance estimation, etc.), their memory usage represents a serious challenge for large-scale sequence indexing. Our solutions leverage on the intrinsic repetitiveness of the color sets when indexing large collections of related genomes. Hence, the described algorithms factorize the color sets into patterns that repeat across the entire collection and represent these patterns once, instead of redundantly replicating their representation as would happen if the sets were encoded as atomic lists of integers. Experimental results across a range of datasets and query workloads show that these representations substantially improve over the space effectiveness of the best previous solutions (sometimes, even dramatically, yielding indexes that are smaller by an order of magnitude). Despite the space reduction, these indexes only moderately impact the efficiency of the queries compared to the fastest indexes.

We leverage whole-genome sequencing of >2600 plants across six continents to investigate the relative roles of colonization history and adaptation during the worldwide invasion of Trifolium repens. Introduced populations contain high levels of genetic variation with independent colonization histories evident on different continents. Five large structural variants on three chromosomes exist as standing genetic variation within the native range, and exhibit strong signatures of parallel climate-associated adaptation across continents. Common gardens in the native and introduced ranges demonstrate that three structural variants exhibit patterns of selection consistent with local adaptation across each range. Our results provide strong evidence that rapid and parallel adaptation during invasion is caused by large-effect structural variants introduced throughout the world.

Significance StatementBiological invasions occur over short timescales and introductions are often hypothesized to include limited genetic diversity, making the role of adaptation in invasion success controversial. We demonstrate that the invasion of a human-commensal species, Trifolium repens, likely stems from multiple, diverse introductions with significant evidence of climate-associated adaptation following introduction. The genetic basis of adaptation is most strongly linked to five chromosomal rearrangements that each span hundreds of genes - matching theoretical predictions that large-effect variants are key to the initial stages of adaptation to novel environments. Chromosomal rearrangements have remarkably parallel signatures of adaptation across different introductions despite initial colonization from different areas of Europe. Our study highlights the impact of globalization and rapid adaptation for the invasion success of human commensal species.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Mitochondrial dysfunction is widely considered a key contributing mechanism to muscle aging. However, mounting evidence position physical activity as a confounding factor, making unclear whether muscle mitochondria accumulate bona fide defects with aging. To disentangle aging from physical activity-related mitochondrial adaptations, we functionally profiled skeletal muscle mitochondria in 51 inactive and 88 active men aged 20-93. Physical activity status conferred partial protection against age-related decline in physical performance. A trend for reduced muscle mitochondrial respiration with aging was observed in inactive but not in active participants, indicating that aging per se does not alter mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was unaffected by aging and active participants displayed higher ROS production. In contrast, mitochondrial calcium retention capacity decreased with aging regardless of physical activity status and correlated with muscle mass, performance and the stress-responsive metabokine GDF15. Targeting mitochondrial calcium handling may hold promise for treating aging-related muscle impairments.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

The key component of this system, ParB, loads and spreads along DNA to form a local protein-DNA condensate known as a partition complex. As bacterial chromosomes are heavily supercoiled due to the continuous action of RNA polymerases, gyrases, and nucleoid-associated proteins, it is important to study the impact of DNA supercoiling on the ParB-DNA partition complex formation. Here, we use an in vitro single- molecule assay to visualize ParB on supercoiled DNA. Unlike most DNA-binding proteins, individual ParB proteins are found to not pin plectonemes on supercoiled DNA, but freely diffuse along supercoiled DNA. We find that DNA supercoiling enhances ParB-DNA condensation which initiates at lower ParB concentrations than on DNA that is torsionally relaxed. ParB proteins induce a DNA- protein condensate that strikingly absorbs all supercoiling writhe. Our findings provide mechanistic insights that have important implications for our understanding of bacterial chromosome organization and segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Here we describe the rational conceptual design and test-case practical implementation of a photopharmacological paradigm to empower high-performance photomodulation studies in vivo. TRPC4/5 ion channels are involved in many spatiotemporally resolved circuits, from pain and anxiety, to reproductive signaling, digestion, and obesity. To unpick their biology requires spatiotemporally precise tools, which were lacking. We developed ""ideal efficacy photoswitch"" ligands to control their diverse functions in situ. These E{leftrightarrows}Z-photoswitchable ligands bias TRPC[4]/5 channel activity with exquisite photocontrol, from strong agonism under 360 nm, to low agonism at 385 nm, to strong antagonism at 410-460 nm. Cryo-EM structures of both TRPC4 and TRPC5 with both Z-agonists and E-antagonists support the rationale for efficacy switching through competitive E/Z isomer binding. Crucially, since the E/Z ratio is exclusively determined by the light wavelength applied, their channel photocontrol is exclusively wavelength-dependent, yet drug-concentration-independent: so is reproducible from cell culture to >millimetre-depth tissues. Indeed, we were able to photocontrol both direct and downstream TRPC4/5 biology in cell lines or primary cells in culture, from calcium flux, to primary neuron excitability and adrenaline release; and even in tissues, photoswitching small intestine motility and peristalsis. The TRPC4/5 ligands we develop will thus unlock a range of high-precision investigations in TRP biology. More broadly, we propose that the success of this efficacy photoswitch program, from concept to tissue level translation, is mainly a consequence of how biology has evolved proteins for efficacy control. We therefore foresee that a variety of functionally responsive protein targets, not only sensory and signaling ion channels and receptors, will be amenable to similarly high-performance photocontrol even in vivo, if a new generation of reagent development adopts this paradigm of ideal efficacy photoswitching.

They can learn to vocalize on command and the activity of single neurons from the crows associative telencephalic structure nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) is correlated with the execution of this vocal and many non-vocal skilled behaviors. However, it remains unknown if specific anatomical adaptations that directly link the crow NCL to any of the nuclei of the crows ""song system"" exist. To address this issue, we used fluorescent tracers along with histological staining methods (Nissl-, myelin-, and anti tyrosine hydroxylase) to characterize the connectivity of the crows NCL in relation to its song system nuclei. We found that the NCL sends dense projections into the dorsal intermediate arcopallium (AID) directly adjacent to and engulfing the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), which is the telencephalic motor output of the song system. Similarly, we demonstrate dense NCL projections into the striatum surrounding the basal ganglia song nucleus ""area X"". Both of these descending projections mirror the projections of the nidopallial song nucleus HVC (proper name) into RA and area X, with extremely sparse NCL fibers extending into area X. Furthermore, we characterized the distribution of cells projecting from the lateral part of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (MAN) to NCL. Notably, a separate medial population of MAN cells projects to HVC. These two sets of connections--MAN to NCL and MAN to HVC--run in parallel but do not overlap. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that the NCL is part of a ""general motor system"" that parallels the song system but exhibits only minimal monosynaptic interconnections with it.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Here, we identified 49,962 viruses from 52 globally distributed hydrothermal vent samples (10 plumes, 40 deposits, and 2 diffuse flow), and reconstructed 5,708 viral metagenome-assembled genomes (vMAGs), the majority of which were bacteriophages. Hydrothermal viruses were largely endemic. However, some viruses were shared between geographically separated vents, predominantly between the Lau Basin and Brothers Volcano in the Pacific Ocean. Geographically distant viruses often shared proteins related to core functions such as structural proteins, and rarely, proteins of auxiliary functions. Common microbial hosts of viruses included members of Campylobacterota, Alpha-, and Gammaproteobacteria in deposits, and Gammaproteobacteria in plumes. Campylobacterota- and Gammaproteobacteria-infecting viruses reflected variations in hydrothermal chemistry and functional redundancy in their predicted microbial hosts, suggesting that hydrothermal geology is a driver of viral ecology and coevolution of viruses and hosts. Our study indicates that viral ecology and evolution in globally distributed hydrothermal vents is shaped by endemism, and thus may have increased susceptibility to the negative impacts of deep-sea mining and anthropogenic change in ocean ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

As organisms age, the ability of neurons to maintain their axons declines; hence aged axons are more susceptible to damage or dysfunction. Understanding what causes axonal vulnerability is crucial for developing strategies to enhance overall resilience of neurons, and to prevent their deterioration during ageing or in age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes oxidative stress, a hallmark of ageing and age-related diseases. Despite this association, a causal relationship between oxidative stress and neuronal ageing remains unclear, particularly how subcellular physiology is affected by ROS.

By using Drosophila-derived primary neuronal cultures and a recently developed in vivo neuronal model of ageing, which involves the visualisation of Drosophila medulla neurons, we investigated the interplay between oxidative stress, neuronal ageing and the microtubule cytoskeleton. We find that oxidative stress as a key driver of axonal and synaptic decay, including the appearance of axonal swellings, microtubule alterations in both axons and synapses and the morphological transformation of axonal terminals during ageing. We demonstrate that increased ROS sensitises the microtubule plus end binding factor, end-binding protein 1 (EB1), leading to microtubule defects, affecting neuronal integrity. Furthermore, manipulating EB1 proved to be a valuable therapeutic strategy to prevent ageing hallmarks observed in conditions of elevated ROS. In summary, we demonstrate a mechanistic pathway linking cellular oxidative stress, the microtubule cytoskeleton and axonal deterioration during ageing and provide evidence of the therapeutic potential of enhancing microtubule plus end physiology to improve the resilience of axons.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

However, biologically contaminated pipette tips must undergo several washing and sterilization steps before being reused or recycled. Grenova Solutions provides such a decontamination station called TipNovus, which has been implemented by academic and government research labs to reuse pipette tips in sensitive biological assays. Despite this success, the high initial purchasing cost of these washing stations deter many laboratories from incorporating it into their workflow. Additionally, researchers are reluctant to reuse pipette tips due to concerns that the washing process may not thoroughly remove all contaminants. To mitigate these concerns, considering the University of Texas at Austin as an example, we performed a cost-benefit analysis of employing a university-wide washing station. We estimated that only single-time reuse of the pipette tips could result in a 100% return on investment from the equipment purchase cost within 3 months. Then, with our pilot experiments, we confirmed the TipNovus washing steps to be 100% efficient in sterilizing pipette tips contaminated with T7 bacteriophage, enabling their reuse in bacteriophage functionality assays. Finally, we proposed an alternative and more convenient autoclave-based sterilization method to decontaminate pipette tips.

However, freezer malfunctions can jeopardize data integrity. In this study, we investigated the effects of an unforeseen short-term thaw event ([~]1 week) resulting from a freezer malfunction on soil samples stored at -80{degrees}C and extracted uncompromised DNA stored long-term at -20{degrees}C. We compared these samples against previously sequenced Illumina MiSeq data to assess whether the process of thawing soil or multi-year extracted DNA storage affected the resilience of bacterial or fungal richness or community composition, thereby impacting our ability to accurately determine treatment effects. Our results reveal substantial resilience in fungal richness and both bacterial and fungal beta-diversity to soil sample thawing and extended frozen DNA storage. This resilience facilitated biological inferences that closely mirrored those observed in the original study. Notably, fungi exhibited greater resilience to short-term thawing compared to bacteria, which showed sensitivity to both thawing and long-term freezing. Moreover, taxonomic composition analysis revealed the persistence of dominant microbial taxa under thawing and prolonged freezing, suggesting that dominant microbes remain viable for tracking across temporal studies. In conclusion, our study highlights that beta-diversity is more robust than alpha-diversity and fungi are more resilient than bacteria. Furthermore, our findings underscore the effectiveness of soil storage at -80{degrees}C compared to storage of extracted DNA at -20{degrees}C, despite potential freezer failures, as the most robust method for long-term storage in microbiome studies.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Here, we seek to better understand properties of GRNs using a new approach to simulate their structure and model their function. We produce realistic network structures with a novel generating algorithm based on insights from small-world network theory, and we model gene expression regulation using stochastic differential equations formulated to accommodate modeling molecular perturbations. With these tools, we systematically describe the effects of gene knockouts within and across GRNs, finding a subset of networks that recapitulate features of a recent genome-scale perturbation study.

SARS-CoV-2 internalization occurs via S-protein-mediated cell binding followed either by direct fusion with the plasma membrane or endocytosis and subsequent fusion with the endosomal membrane. Despite the crucial role of virus internalization, the precise kinetics of the processes involved remains elusive. We developed a pipeline, which combines live-cell microscopy and advanced image analysis, for measuring the rates of multiple internalization-associated molecular events of single SARS-CoV-2-virus-like particles (VLPs), including endosome ingression, pH change, and nucleocapsid release. Our live-cell imaging experiments demonstrate that only a few minutes after binding to the plasma membrane, VLPs ingress into Rab5-negative endosomes via Dynamin-dependent scission. Less than two minutes later, the pH of VLPs drops below 5 followed by an increase in VLP speed, yet these two events are not interrelated. Nucleocapsid release from the VLPs occurs with similar kinetics to the pH drop, suggesting that VLP fusion occurs during endosome acidification. Neither Omicron mutations nor abrogation of the S protein polybasic cleavage site altered the rate of VLP internalization events, indicating that they do not affect these processes. Finally, we observe that VLP internalization occurs two to three times faster in VeroE6 than in A549 cells, which may contribute to the greater susceptibility of the former cell line to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, our precise measurements of the kinetics of VLP internalization-associated processes shed light on their contribution to the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cells. Time-lapse videos of the studied internalization events can be accessed in the dedicated COVIDynamics database.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

This inherent catalytic feature of condensates derives from the electrochemical environments and the electric fields at interfaces that are direct consequences of phase separation. The condensates we studied were capable of catalyzing diverse hydrolysis reactions, including hydrolysis and radical-dependent breakdown of ATP whereby ATP fully decomposes to adenine and multiple carbohydrates. This distinguishes condensates from naturally occurring ATPases, which can only catalyze the dephosphorylation of ATP. Interphase and interfacial properties of condensates can be tuned via sequence design, thus enabling control over catalysis through sequence-dependent electrochemical features of condensates. Incorporation of hydrolase-like synthetic condensates into live cells enables activation of transcriptional circuits that depend on products of hydrolysis reactions. Inherent catalytic functions of condensates, which are emergent consequences of phase separation, are likely to affect metabolic regulation in cells.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Here, we report the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle herds across several states in the U.S. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory distress, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state.

Fast subsecond fluctuations in neuronal population responses dominate the temporal dynamics of neural circuits. Traditional approaches have treated this activity as ""noise"" that can be averaged away by taking the mean spiking rate over wide time bins or over multiple trial repetitions, but this ignores much of the temporal dynamics that naturally occur in neural systems. We find that subsecond flares of increased population activity are layer- and cell-type specific, and large-scale computational modelling suggests they may serve as an inter-areal gating mechanism. Moreover, we find that most of the neural variability is restricted to a population-gain axis. This observation explains why neural systems can function in the presence of excessive variability: population-level spiking dynamics generate invariance to the majority of neural noise.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

To address this, we formed a multi-lab collaboration using a shared, open-source behavioral task and experimental apparatus. Experimenters in ten laboratories repeatedly targeted Neuropixels probes to the same location (spanning secondary visual areas, hippocampus, and thalamus) in mice making decisions; this generated a total of 121 experimental replicates, a unique dataset for evaluating reproducibility of electrophysiology experiments. Despite standardizing both behavioral and electrophysiological procedures, some experimental outcomes were highly variable. A closer analysis uncovered that variability in electrode targeting hindered reproducibility, as did the limited statistical power of some routinely used electrophysiological analyses, such as single-neuron tests of modulation by task parameters. Reproducibility was enhanced by histological and electrophysiological quality-control criteria. Our observations suggest that data from systems neuroscience is vulnerable to a lack of reproducibility, but that across-lab standardization, including metrics we propose, can serve to mitigate this.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

We have recently shown associations for CHIP with acute kidney injury and with kidney function decline in the general population, with stronger associations for CHIP driven by mutations in genes other than DNMT3A (non-DNMT3A CHIP). Longitudinal kidney function endpoints in individuals with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CHIP have been examined in two previous studies, which reported conflicting findings and were limited by small sample sizes.

MethodsIn this study, we examined the prospective associations between CHIP and CKD progression events in four cohorts of CKD patients (total N = 5,772). The primary outcome was a composite of 50% kidney function decline or kidney failure. The slope of eGFR decline was examined as a secondary outcome. Mendelian randomization techniques were then used to investigate potential causal effects of CHIP on eGFR decline. Finally, kidney function was assessed in adenine-fed CKD model mice having received a bone marrow transplant recapitulatingTet2-CHIP compared to controls transplanted wild-type bone marrow.

ResultsAcross all cohorts, the average age was 66.4 years, the average baseline eGFR was 42.6 ml/min/1.73m2, and 24% had CHIP. Upon meta-analysis, non-DNMT3A CHIP was associated with a 59% higher relative risk of incident CKD progression (HR 1.59, 95% CI: 1.02-2.47). This association was more pronounced among individuals with diabetes (HR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.03-1.62) and with baseline eGFR [&ge;] 30 ml/min/1.73m (HR 1.80, 95% CI: 1.11-2.90). Additionally, the annualized slope of eGFR decline was steeper among non-DNMT3A CHIP carriers, relative to non-carriers ({beta} -0.61 {+/-} 0.31 ml/min/1.73m2, p = 0.04). Mendelian randomization analyses suggested a causal role for CHIP in eGFR decline among individuals with diabetes. In a dietary adenine mouse model of CKD, Tet2-CHIP was associated with lower GFR as well as greater kidney inflammation, tubular injury, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.

ConclusionNon-DNMT3A CHIP is a potentially targetable novel risk factor for CKD progression.","NA","medrxiv",1721254151895

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3, which convergently acquired S protein substitutions such as S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Furthermore, JN.1 subvariants such as LB.1 and KP.2.3, which convergently acquired S:S31del in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. Here we investigated the virological properties of KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1721254151895

Recent studies have shown that some archaea and bacteria contain alternative histones that exhibit different DNA binding properties, in addition to highly divergent sequences. However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria.
