MethodsThis phase 3, double-blinded study randomised 12-<18-year-old participants, who received [&ge;]2 prior doses of an approved/authorised mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, 1:1 to receive NVX-CoV2601 (XBB.1.5) or a bivalent vaccine (NVX-CoV2373 [Wuhan] + NVX-CoV2601). The primary immunogenicity endpoint was day-28 neutralizing antibody (nAb) geometric mean titres (GMTs) against XBB.1.5. Safety endpoints were solicited reactogenicity [&le;]7 days and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) [&le;]28 days post vaccination and frequency/severity of predefined AEs of special interest through day 180.

ResultsOf 401 randomised participants, nAb GMTs against XBB.1.5 increased (GMFR [95% CI]) for both NVX-CoV2601 (12.2 [9.5-15.5]) and the bivalent vaccine (8.4 [6.8-10.3]); post-vaccination responses to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and the JN.1 variant were also observed. Increases in anti-spike IgG levels were comparable between the groups. Solicited and unsolicited AEs were mild to moderate, with similar occurrence among the groups. Severe and serious events were rare and unrelated to the study vaccines; no PIMMCs or myocarditis/pericarditis were reported.

ConclusionsNVX-CoV2601 elicited more robust antibody responses to XBB.1.5 and ancestral virus, compared with a bivalent formulation. The safety profile within each group was consistent with the prototype vaccine (NVX-CoV2373).","NA","medrxiv",1731794915972

MethodsThis phase 3, open-label study (2019nCoV-312/NCT05875701) enrolled participants who received one dose of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 protein-based vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) in an earlier study (2019nCoV-307/NCT05463068) after a primary series and possibly one additional dose of mRNA vaccine. In the current study, participants received an additional dose of protein-based vaccine (ancestral [n=104] or Omicron BA.5 [n=40]) at least 180 days after their previous study dose. The primary objective was demonstration of noninferiority of neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers induced by the dose in this study versus the first dose of NVX-CoV-2373 in the earlier study. Safety was also evaluated.

ResultsA total of 144 participants were enrolled. The ratio of anti-Wuhan nAbs (GMT, IU/mL [95% CI]) at Day 28 after this study dose (ancestral 393.2 [318.0-468.2]) versus previous study dose (396.6 [328.7-478.6]) was 1.0 (0.8, 1.2), meeting noninferiority. The seroresponse rate difference between doses was 7.4% (95% CI = -1.2%-16.5%), also meeting noninferiority. Omicron BA.5 nAb titers suggest cross-protection against emerging variants. The nAb ratio at Day 28 between Omicron dose in this study (835.0 [597.1-1167.6]) versus previous study ancestral dose (436.0 [305.6-622.2]) was 1.9 (1.5-2.5), exceeding superiority criterion. Local and systemic reactions were similar between doses and strains in both studies.

ConclusionsA heterologous regimen of two adjuvanted recombinant spike protein-based vaccine doses after mRNA vaccination produced robust immune responses, exhibiting cross-reactivity to newer variants.","NA","medrxiv",1731794915972

However, the specific mechanisms by which viral proteins influence cholesterol remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cholesterol sequestration within lysosomes, with the viral protein ORF3a identified as the primary driver of this effect. Mechanistically, we found that ORF3a interacts directly with the HOPS complex subunit VPS39 through a hydrophobic interface formed by residues W193 and Y184. A W193A mutation in ORF3a significantly rescues cholesterol egress and corrects the mislocalization of the lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC2, which is caused by defective trafficking of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) sorting receptor, the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). We further observed a marked reduction in bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a lipid essential for lysosomal cholesterol egress, in both SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and ORF3a-expressing cells, suggesting BMP reduction as an additional mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-caused cholesterol sequestration. Inhibition of lysosomal cholesterol egress using the compound U18666A significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting a potential viral strategy of manipulating lysosomal cholesterol to modulate host cell susceptibility. Our findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a disrupts cellular cholesterol transport by altering lysosomal protein trafficking and BMP levels, providing new insights into virus-host interactions that contribute to lipid dysregulation in infected cells.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

However, null space theory makes the counter-intuitive prediction that neurons often generate spikes not to cause behavior, but to prevent the effects that other neurons would have on behavior. What is missing is a direct way to test this theory in the brain. Here, we found that in the marmoset cerebellum, spike-triggered averaging identified a potent vector unique to each Purkinje cell (P-cell) along which the spikes of that cell displaced the eyes. Yet, the P-cells were active not just for saccades along their potent vector, but for all saccades. Simultaneous recordings revealed that two spikes in two different P-cells produced superposition of their potent vectors. The result was a population activity in which the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. But why was one neuron producing spikes that would be canceled by another neuron? To answer this question, we recorded from the mossy fiber inputs and the interneurons in the molecular layer. We found that the mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands as well as the sensory goal of the movement, then the interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P-cells as a population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped. Because this output had faster dynamics than was present in the individual neurons, the cerebellum placed the cells in subtractive competition with each other such that the downstream effects of spiking in one neuron were partially or completely eliminated because of the spiking in another neuron.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Human skin undergoes both chronological aging and environmental degradation, particularly UV-induced photoaging. Detrimental structural and physiological changes caused by aging include epidermal thinning due to stem cell depletion and dermal atrophy associated with decreased collagen production. Here, we present a comprehensive single-cell atlas of skin aging, analyzing samples from young, middle-aged, and elderly individuals, including both sun-exposed and sun-protected areas. This atlas reveals age-related cellular composition and function changes across various skin cell types, including epidermal stem cells, fibroblasts, hair follicles, and endothelial cells. Using our atlas, we have identified basal stem cells as a highly variable population across aging, more so than other skin cell populations such as fibroblasts. In basal stem cells, we identified ATF3 as a novel regulator of skin aging. ATF3 is a transcriptional factor for genes involved in the aging process, with its expression reduced by 20% during aging. Based on this discovery, we have developed an innovative mRNA-based treatment to mitigate the effects of skin aging. Cell senescence decreased 25% in skin cells treated with ATF3 mRNA, and we observed an over 20% increase in proliferation in treated basal stem cells. Importantly, we also found crosstalk between keratinocytes and fibroblasts as a critical component of therapeutic interventions, with ATF3 rescue of basal cells significantly enhancing fibroblast collagen production by approximately 200%. We conclude that ATF3-targeted mRNA treatment effectively reverses the effects of skin aging by modulating specific cellular mechanisms, offering a novel, targeted approach to human skin rejuvenation.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

We show here that the continued spread between farms could be explained by the rapid pace of pathogen spread reported within farms, which greatly limits the potential effectiveness of these recommendations. Under reasonable surveillance strategies, we show that the time farms have to mobilize interventions is extremely limited, as few as a couple days and typically less than a week. Our findings suggest that passive surveillance measures, such as detection of H5N1 via weekly bulk milk testing, comes too late such that most infections have already occurred.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US. It remains unclear, however, how medical and societal changes during this period affected national chronic pain prevalence, a key dimension of population health.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic and explore reasons driving the trends

MethodsWe use data from the 2019, 2021, and 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a multi-wave cross-sectional survey. Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian US population age 18 and older (n=88,469). Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; some models include additional 19 covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of COVID and long COVID. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP also increased from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019, to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023, after a decline to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021. The 2023 increases occurred in all examined body sites except for dental pain. COVID and long COVID had a modest role in the population-wide pain increases, the causes of which remain unclear.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before the pandemic but surged dramatically since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1731794915972

While many bacteria also have linear chromosomes and plasmids, no transposons were known to target bacterial telomeres. Here we show several families of independently evolved telomeric transposons in cyanobacteria and Streptomyces. While these elements have one specific transposon end sequence with the second boundary being the telomere, we can show they move using two transposon ends. Telomeres are transiently bridged by the telomere maintenance systems, providing a duplex substrate for mobilization of the element and the associated telomere. We identify multiple instances where telomeric transposons have replaced native telomeres, making the host cell dependent on the new telomere system for genome maintenance. This work indicates how telomeric transposons can promote gene transfer both between and within genomes, significantly influencing the evolutionary dynamics of linear genomes.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

To address this, we present a comprehensive assessment of tissue changes occurring during human aging, utilizing a vast array of whole slide histopathological images from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx). We analyzed 25,712 images from 40 distinct tissue types across 983 individuals, applying deep learning to quantify the nuanced morphological changes that tissues undergo with age. We developed 'tissue clocks' - predictors of biological age based on tissue images - which achieved a mean prediction error of 4.9 years and were associated with telomere attrition, the incidence of subclinical pathologies, and comorbidities. In a systematic assessment of biological age rates across organs, we identified pervasive non-uniform rates of aging across the human lifespan, with some organs exhibiting earlier changes (20-40 years old) and others showing bimodal patterns of age-related changes. We also uncovered several associations between demographic, lifestyle, and medical history factors and tissue-specific acceleration or deceleration of biological age, highlighting potential modifiable risk factors that influenced the aging process at the tissue level. Finally, by combining paired histological images and gene expression data, we developed a strategy to predict tissue-specific age gaps from blood samples. This approach was validated in external cohorts of both healthy individuals and those with chronic diseases, revealing the organs most differentially affected by aging in disease contexts. This work offers a new perspective on the aging process by positioning tissue structure as an integrator of cellular and molecular changes that reflect the physiological state of organs. These findings underscore the value of histopathological imaging as a tool for understanding human aging and provide a foundation for the exploration of tissue-specific aging processes in age-associated diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Here we developed IMMClock, a novel immune aging clock that uses gene expression data to predict the biological age of individual CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, and NK cells. The accuracy of IMMClock is first validated across multiple independent datasets, demonstrating its robustness. Second, utilizing the IMMClock, we find that intrinsic cellular aging processes are more strongly altered during immune aging than differentiation processes. Thirdly, our analysis confirms the strong associations between immune aging and established processes such as cellular senescence, exhaustion, and telomere length at the single cell level. Furthermore, immune aging is accelerated under several disease conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Finally, we apply IMMClock to analyze a perturb-seq gene activation screen of T cell functionality. We find that the post-perturbation immune age of individual T cells is strongly correlated with their pre-perturbation immune age. Furthermore, the immune age at resting state of individual T cells is strongly predictive of their post-stimulation activation state. Overall, IMMClock advances our understanding of immune aging by providing precise, single-cell level age estimations. Its future applications hold promise for identifying interventions that concomitantly rejuvenate and activate T cells, potentially enhancing efforts to counteract age-related immune decline.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Here, we examine whether GR condensates are involved in transcription regulation using Airyscan super-resolution microscopy and nano-antibodies targeting initiation and elongating states of RNA polymerase II (Pol2). We observed subpopulations of GR condensates colocalizing with initiating and, surprisingly, elongating Pol2 foci. The analysis of GR mutants with different transcriptional outputs suggests a correlation between condensate formation capability and transcription initiation. Moreover, the number of GR molecules within initiation and elongation condensates appears to be linked to transcriptional activity.

The transition from OPC to oligodendrocyte involves a complex cascade of molecular and morphological states that position the cell to make a fate decision to integrate as a myelinating oligodendrocyte or die through apoptosis. Oligodendrocyte maturation impacts the cell death mechanisms that occur in degenerative conditions, but it is unclear if and how the cell death machinery changes as OPCs transition into oligodendrocytes. Here, we discovered that differentiating oligodendrocytes transiently upregulate the zymogen procaspase-3, equipping these cells to make a survival decision during differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of caspase-3 decreases oligodendrocyte density, indicating that procaspase-3 upregulation promotes differentiation. Moreover, using procaspase-3 as a marker, we show that oligodendrocyte differentiation continues in the aging cortex and white matter. Taken together, our data establish procaspase-3 as a differentiating oligodendrocyte marker and provide insight into the underlying mechanisms occurring during the decision to integrate or die.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

However, the application of such annotation/manipulation systems to social behaviors, in which multiple individuals interact dynamically, remains challenging. Here, we applied an object detection algorithm to classify animal social behaviors. Our system, packaged as ""YORU"" (Your Optimal Recognition Utility), classifies animal behaviors, including social behaviors, based on the shape of the animal as a ""behavior object"". It successfully classified several types of social behaviors ranging from vertebrates to insects. We also integrated a closed-loop control system for operating optogenetic devices into the YORU package. YORU enables real-time delivery of photostimulation feedback to specific individuals during specific behaviors, even when multiple individuals are close together. We hope that the YORU system will accelerate the understanding of the neural basis of social behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Patients with IBD receive therapy to correct these imbalances and achieve remission. However, most patients relapse, suggesting that pathological mechanisms persist during remission. Here, we show that excess epithelial cell death is an underlying feature of IBD that arises in patients in remission and on advanced therapy. Mechanistically, nascent inflammation reprograms epithelial cells into a macrophage-like state that promotes RIPK1-independent necroptotic signaling, then triggers iNOS-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis of absorptive epithelial cells and PUMA-mediated intestinal stem cell death. These findings reveal aberrant epithelial cell death signaling as a hallmark of IBD that occurs early in mucosal lesion development and persists despite current therapeutic approaches.

While human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived organoids are valuable models for studying human organ function, they often lack critical tissue-resident immune cells. Here, we introduce an advanced human heart assembloid model, termed hHMA (human heart-macrophage assembloid), which fully integrates autologous cardiac tissue-resident macrophages (MPs) with pre-existing human heart organoids (hHOs). Through multi-omic analyses, we confirmed that these MPs are phenotypically similar to embryonic cardiac tissue-resident MPs and remain viable in the assembloids over time. The inclusion of MPs significantly impacts hHMA development, influencing cardiac cellular composition, boosting cellular communication, remodeling the extracellular matrix, promoting ventricular morphogenesis, and enhancing sarcomeric maturation. Our findings indicate that MPs contribute to homeostasis via efferocytosis, integrate into the cardiomyocyte electrical system, and support catabolic metabolism. To demonstrate the versatility of this model, we developed a platform to study cardiac arrhythmias by chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory factors linked to arrhythmogenesis in clinical settings, successfully replicating key features of inflammasome-mediated atrial fibrillation. Overall, this work introduces a robust platform for examining the role of immune cells in cardiac development, disease mechanisms, and drug discovery, bridging the gap between in vitro models and human physiology. These findings offer insights into cardiogenesis and inflammation-driven heart disease, positioning the hHMA system as an invaluable tool for future cardiovascular research and therapeutic development.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Since the release of the earliest model, the throughput and error rate of the platform have improved dramatically and it has become possible to consider sequencing and assembly of eukaryotic organisms using a single nanopore flow cell. Here, we present MinION sequence data, assembly and methylation analysis for the Columbia (Col-0) accession of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Further, we demonstrate the effect that recent developments (specifically the Q20+ chemistry and basecaller improvements) have had on read accuracy and assembly quality.

FindingsDNA extracted from leaves of A. thaliana Col-0 was sequenced on two MinION flow cells, together amounting to 115x coverage of the 135 Mb genome. Reads were assembled and polished using several bioinformatics pipelines for nanopore sequence data. We performed CpG methylation analysis directly from the nanopore data, and this correlated well with a previously published bisulfite dataset.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that a single MinION flow cell can generate sufficient data to assemble a genome of 135Mb, indicate functional elements, and unlock genomics for researchers of novel species from $600 in under 5 days. Here we release the full nanopore read sets for both flow cells, together with the nanopore-only assemblies.

MethodsRandomly selected individuals were invited to register and actively contacted to seek further information on the vaccines received and adverse events they experienced. Demographics of patients recruited, and summaries of reported data, are presented alongside detailed analyses of the sub-cohort of pregnant and breast-feeding patients and analyses conducted to support regulatory assessment of two safety signals, menstrual disorders, and tinnitus.

Results36,604 individuals registered, with 30,281 reporting vaccination. Median [IQR] follow-up was 184 days [14-367]. Demographics of the recruited cohort reflected the vaccinated population and timing of invitations. 15,764 (52.1%) of those reporting vaccination, reported experiencing at least one adverse reaction. However, nearly all were expected acute reactions and only 4,134 (13.7%) reported an event considered medically serious. The data raised no safety concerns in pregnant and breast-feeding patients. Reporting of menstrual disorders appeared stimulated by media interest, as seen in spontaneous reporting systems. Data on the incidence of tinnitus were used to support regulatory action on this signal.

DiscussionActive surveillance provided a complimentary data source for monitoring the safety of COVID- 19 vaccines. However, further efforts are needed to recruit ethnic minorities. The technology developed has enhanced regulatory vigilance options and could be valuable in the future for actively monitoring the safety of innovative products used in small populations.","NA","medrxiv",1731794915972

One of the most striking and well-known phenomena bearing on this question is inattentional blindness (IB; Neisser & Becklen, 1975; Mack & Rock, 1998; Most et al., 2001, 2005). In IB, naive observers fail to report clearly visible stimuli when their attention is otherwise engaged--famously even missing a gorilla parading before their eyes (Simons & Chabris, 1999). This phenomenon and the research programs it has motivated carry tremendous theoretical significance, both as crucial evidence that awareness requires attention (Cohen et al., 2012; Prinz, 2012; Noah & Mangun, 2020) and as a key tool in seeking the neural correlates of consciousness (Rees et al., 1999; Pitts et al., 2014; Hutchinson, 2019). However, these and other implications critically rest on a notoriously biased measure: asking participants whether they noticed anything unusual (and interpreting negative answers as reflecting a complete lack of perception). Here, in the largest ever set of IB studies, we show that, as a group, inattentionally blind participants can successfully report the location, color and shape of the stimuli they deny noticing. This residual visual sensitivity shows that perceptual information remains accessible in IB. We further show that subjective reports in IB are conservative, by introducing absent trials where no IB stimulus is presented; this approach allows us to show for the first time that observers collectively show a systematic bias to report not noticing in IB--essentially  playing it safe in reporting their sensitivity. This pair of results is consistent with an alternative hypothesis about IB, namely that inattentionally blind subjects retain some degree of awareness of the stimuli they fail to report. Overall, these data provide the strongest evidence to date of significant residual visual sensitivity in IB. They also challenge the use of inattentional blindness to argue that awareness requires attention.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Biofluorescence, which can be observed in living organisms, involves the absorption of light at one wavelength and re-emission at a longer wavelength due to fluorophores in specialized cells or structures. While initially studied in marine organisms, attention has shifted to exploring biofluorescence in terrestrial organisms, revealing roles in reproduction, camouflage, communication, and prey attraction across phyla.

Motif scans therefore produce many false-positive binding site predictions. By surveying 179 TFs across 25 families using >1,500 cyclic in vitro selection experiments with fragmented, naked, and unmodified genomic DNA - a method we term GHT-SELEX (Genomic HT-SELEX) - we find that many human TFs possess much higher sequence specificity than anticipated. Moreover, genomic binding regions from GHT-SELEX are often surprisingly similar to those obtained in vivo (i.e. ChIP-seq peaks). We find that comparable specificity can also be obtained from motif scans, but performance is highly dependent on derivation and use of the motifs, including accounting for multiple local matches in the scans. We also observe alternative engagement of multiple DNA-binding domains within the same protein: long C2H2 zinc finger proteins often utilize modular DNA recognition, engaging different subsets of their DNA binding domain (DBD) arrays to recognize multiple types of distinct target sites, frequently evolving via internal duplication and divergence of one or more DBDs. Thus, contrary to conventional wisdom, it is common for TFs to possess sufficient intrinsic specificity to independently delineate cellular targets.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Each step of this complex process has received extensive attention in the literature, and has been significantly streamlined over the years. Given the volume of publicly available genetic data, obtaining genomes for a wide selection of known species is straightforward. However, analyzing that same data in order to generate a phylogenetic tree is a multi-step process with legitimate scientific and technical challenges, and often requires a significant input from a domain-area scientist.

ResultsWe present Poplar, a new, streamlined computational pipeline, to address the computational logistical issues that arise when constructing phylogenetic trees. It provides a framework that runs state-of-the-art software for essential steps in the phylogenetic pipeline, beginning from a genome with or without an annotation, and resulting in a species tree. Running Poplar requires no external databases. In the execution, it enables parallelism for execution for clusters and cloud computing. The trees generated by Poplar match closely with state-of-the-art published trees. The usage and performance of Poplar is far simpler and quicker than manually running a phylogenetic pipeline.

The study of this process often requires quantifying abundances of specific RNAs at precise subcellular locations. To analyze subcellular transcriptomes, multiple proximity-based techniques have been developed in which RNAs near a localized bait protein are specifically labeled, facilitating their biotinylation and purification. However, these complex methods are often laborious and require expensive enrichment reagents. To streamline the analysis of localized RNA populations, we developed Oxidation-Induced Nucleotide Conversion sequencing (OINC-seq). In OINC-seq, RNAs near a genetically encoded, localized bait protein are specifically oxidized in a photo-controllable manner. These oxidation events are then directly detected and quantified using high-throughput sequencing and our software package, PIGPEN, without the need for biotin-mediated enrichment. We demonstrate that OINC-seq can induce and quantify RNA oxidation with high specificity in a dose- and light-dependent manner. We further show the spatial specificity of OINC-seq by using it to quantify subcellular transcriptomes associated with the cytoplasm, ER, nucleus, and the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria. Finally, using transgenic zebrafish, we demonstrate that OINC-seq allows proximity-mediated RNA labeling in live animals.

Immunity has been acquired through natural infection, primary and booster vaccination, while protection has been lost through waning immunity and viral mutation. During the height of the pandemic in England, the main aim was to rapidly protect the population and large supplies of vaccine were pre-purchased, eliminating the need for cost-effective calculations. As we move to an era where for the majority of the population SARS-CoV-2 infections cause relatively mild disease, and vaccine stocks need to be re-purchased, it is important we consider the cost-effectiveness and economic value of COVID-19 vaccination programmes.

MethodsHere using data from 2023 and 2024 in England on COVID-19 hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths, coupled with bespoke health economic costs, we consider the willingness to pay threshold for COVID-19 vaccines in different age and risk groups. We partition the population into sixteen 5-year age-groups and three risk groups (no-risk, at-risk and immunosuppressed) and calculate the health savings, in terms of costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), per vaccine dose. We adopt three different methodological approaches to estimate the level of vaccine protection leading to five different estimates of efficacy.

FindingsWillingness to pay thresholds vary from less than {pound}1 for younger age-groups without any risk factors, to over {pound}100 for older age-groups with comorbidities that place them at risk. This extreme non-linear dependence on age, means that despite the different method of estimating vaccine efficacy, there is considerable qualitative agreement on the willingness to pay threshold, and therefore which ages it is cost-effective to vaccinate. For pre-purchased vaccine, where the only cost is administration ({approx}{pound}10), a twice-yearly universal booster offer to all those aged 70 and over is cost-effective (the benefits outweigh the administration costs), while for the at-risk group this could be extended to those over 65. When the vaccine cost is included, the cost-effective ages reduce, such that at a total cost of {pound}30 (for vaccine and administration) universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 75; while at {pound}60 universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 80.

InterpretationThe historic offer of COVID-19 vaccination to those 65 and over for the autumn 2023 programme and those over 75 for the spring 2023 programme, aligns with our cost-effective threshold for pre-purchased vaccine when the only cost was administration. However, for future programmes, when vaccine costs are included, the age-thresholds slowly increase thereby demonstrating the continued importance of protecting the eldest and most vulnerable in the population.","NA","medrxiv",1731794915972

Centrosomes consist of a pair of centrioles surrounded by the pericentriolar material (PCM). In Caenorhabditis elegans, interactions between the PCM scaffold protein SPD-5 and the regulatory kinase PLK-1 are essential for PCM formation and disassembly. However, how PCM stability is established and maintained remains an open question. Here, we address this question by analyzing the function of PCMD-1, a protein that predominantly localizes to centrioles. Mutations in the predicted PLK-1 binding sites of PCMD-1 result in a reduction of centrosomal PLK-1 and PCMD-1 levels, leading to severe distortion of the PCM scaffold. The disorganization of the PCM is already evident during its formation and results in the assembly of a structurally unstable mitotic centrosome, which is unable to resist the microtubule pulling forces exerted on the spindle pole. As a consequence of a weakened PCM scaffold, the pulling forces are not effectively relayed to the entrapped centriole pair, resulting in delayed centriole separation in late anaphase. Together, these findings show that PCMD-1, which predominantly localizes to centrioles and tethers the PCM scaffold to them, is essential for stabilizing the entire PCM scaffold and ensuring timely centriole separation during PCM disassembly. We propose a model in which PCMD-1 initiates the ordered assembly of the PCM scaffold by biasing the PCM core to a certain intrinsic order around the centrioles. This intrinsic order acts as a seed that propagates throughout the surrounding micron-scale PCM scaffold, providing the necessary strength and structural integrity for the centrosome.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

These insights provide a comprehensive evaluation that will assist in selecting the most suitable peak caller for high-confidence identification of regions of interest in CUT&RUN experiments, ultimately enhancing the study of chromatin dynamics and transcriptional regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Despite divergence in ribosome structure over the course of evolution, the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), the catalytic site of the ribosome, has been thought to be nearly universally conserved. Here, we identify clades of archaea that have highly divergent ribosomal RNA sequences in the PTC. To understand how these PTC sequences fold, we determined cryo-EM structures of the Pyrobaculum calidifontis ribosome. We find that sequence variation leads to the rearrangement of key PTC base triples and differences between archaeal and bacterial ribosomal proteins also enable sequence variation in archaeal PTCs. Finally, we identify a novel archaeal ribosome hibernation factor that differs from known bacterial and eukaryotic hibernation factors and is found in multiple archaeal phyla. Overall, this work identifies factors that regulate ribosome function in archaea and reveals a larger diversity of the most ancient sequences in the ribosome.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

PSE feature densely packed elongated epithelial cells, with nuclei positioned along the apicobasal cell axis in a cell cycle-dependent manner. PSE serve as organ precursors in diverse developmental contexts across evolution. While the role of nuclear movements in PSE has been extensively studied, less is known about whether and how their nuclear packing arrangements and changes of packing state influence tissue morphogenesis. To address this, we analyzed nuclear shapes, sizes and neighborhood statistics by segmenting nuclei in 3D and over development in zebrafish retinal neuroepithelia (RNE). We find that in PSE nuclei exhibit orientational, nematic-like order but remain positionally disordered. This pattern is conserved in other, less packed, neuroepithelia, like the hindbrain, suggesting that nematic-like order is a hallmark of pseudostratification. Our analysis during retinal development also revealed that nuclear packing density increases, approaching theoretical packing limits for disordered monodisperse ellipsoids at stages when the tissue transitions to a laminated neuronal structure. As neurogenesis progresses, nuclear shapes are remodeled, enabling the RNE to shift to a crystalline, ordered structure, while maintaining orientational alignment. Failure to initiate neurogenesis results in severe tissue deformations due to increased buckling instability. Our results thus show an instance where nuclear shape and nuclear positioning and their changes are essential for proper retinal morphogenesis, a phenomenon most likely also found in other tissue arrangements.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Hunger increases exploration and risk-taking behavior, allowing an animal to forage for food despite risks; however, the neural circuitry underlying this change is unknown. Here, we characterize how hunger restructures an animals spontaneous behavior as well as its directed exploration of a novel object. We show that hunger-induced changes in exploration are accompanied by and result from modulation of dopamine signaling in the tail of the striatum (TOS). Dopamine signaling in the TOS is modulated by internal hunger state through the activity of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, putative ""hunger neurons"" in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. These AgRP neurons are poly-synaptically connected to TOS-projecting dopaminergic neurons through the lateral hypothalamus, the central amygdala, and the periaqueductal grey. We thus delineate a hypothalamic-midbrain circuit that coordinates changes in exploration behavior in the hungry state.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Nearly half of them associated strongly with known regulatory regions such as promoters and enhancers, often at conserved motif matches and co-localizing with each other. Surprisingly, the other half often associated with genomic dark matter, at largely unique sites, via intrinsic sequence recognition. Dozens of these, which we term ""Dark TFs"", mainly bind within regions of closed chromatin. Dark TF binding sites are enriched for transposable elements, and are rarely under purifying selection. Some Dark TFs are KZNFs, which contain the repressive KRAB domain, but many are not: the Dark TFs also include known or potential pioneer TFs. Compiled literature information supports that the Dark TFs exert diverse functions ranging from early development to tumor suppression.

The role of T lymphocytes interactions with IECs in the physiopathology of CD remains in question. Here, we use a three-dimensional human autologous coculture model between purified intestinal organoids derived from primary tissues of CD and non-inflammatory control patients, and mucosal T lymphocytes extracted from the same location.

However, weight regain occurs when treatment is discontinued. An increase in skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) efficiency upon diet-mediated weight loss has been described, which may contribute to reduced systemic energy expenditure and weight regain. We set out to determine the unknown effect of semaglutide on muscle OXPHOS efficiency. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks before receiving semaglutide or vehicle for 1 or 3 weeks. The rate of ATP production and O2 consumption were measured by a high-resolution respirometry and fluorometry to determine OXPHOS efficiency in skeletal muscle at these 2 timepoints. Results: Semaglutide treatment led to significant reductions in fat and lean mass. Semaglutide improved skeletal muscle OXPHOS efficiency, measured as ATP produced per O2 consumed (P/O) in permeabilized muscle fibers. Mitochondrial proteomic analysis revealed changes restricted to two proteins linked to complex III assembly (Lyrm7 and Ttc1, p < 0.05 without multiple corrections) without substantial changes in the abundance of OXPHOS subunits. Conclusions: These data indicate that weight loss with semaglutide treatment increases skeletal muscle mitochondrial efficiency. Future studies could test whether it contributes to weight regain.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

The Virtual Lab consists of an LLM principal investigator agent guiding a team of LLM agents with different scientific backgrounds (e.g., a chemist agent, a computer scientist agent, a critic agent), with a human researcher providing high-level feedback.

Gain-of-function research restrictions preclude assessing human adapting mutations of 2.3.4.4b H5N1. Here, we tracked the evolution of 2.3.4.4b H5N1 that infected non-human mammals and evaluated their ability to gain human adaptations. The non-human mammal 2.3.4.4b H5N1 partly acquired classical human adapting mutations, which are identical to the residues of H1N1pdm09 and seasonal human H3N2 infections while showing a few species-specific adaptations that might be potential barriers for successful human adaptations. Despite minimal changes in Hemagglutinin (HA), A160T and T199I mutations near the receptor binding site of HA in dairy cattle viruses indicate the rapid HA glycan surface evolution affecting virus entry and immune evasion. The quantitative assessment indicated that 2.3.4.4b H5N1 circulating in bears, cattle, dolphins, and foxes show higher human adaptive potential than other hosts. Also, H5N1 infections in mammals across time showed a unique set of adaptations in the 2.3.4.4b clade compared to previously circulating strains, especially the acquisition of Q591 adaptation in PB2 that enables human adaptation. Thus, 2.3.4.4b H5N1 acquires human adaptations due to natural selection pressure in non-human mammals.

Like other endosymbiotic organelles, 90% of the apicoplast proteome is encoded by the cell nucleus and transported to the organelle. Evidence suggests that the apicoplast has minimal control over the synthesis of its proteome and therefore it is unclear how organelle proteostasis is regulated. Here, we identified and investigated a large and conserved chaperonin (CPN) complex with a previously unknown function. Using genetic tools, we demonstrated that its main subunit, CPN60, localizes to the apicoplast and is essential for parasites asexual replication due to its organellar functions. Unlike its close orthologues in other prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, CPN60 is not upregulated during heat shock (HS) and does not affect HS response in the parasite. Instead, we found that it is directly involved in proteostasis through interaction with a proteolytic complex called Clp (caseinolytic protease) that degrades organellar proteins in a regulated manner. We showed that CPN60 physically binds both the active and inactive forms of the Clp complex, and manipulates its stability. Using computational prediction tools, we modeled the interaction between these two large complexes to understand how a stable interface is attained. Finally, we screened a library of inhibitors for the bacterial CPN60 orthologue GroEL, in order to test the potential of chaperonin inhibition as antimalarial. These inhibitors demonstrated an anti-Plasmodial activity that was not restricted to apicoplast function. Taken together, this work reveals how balanced activities of proteolysis and refolding safeguard the apicoplast proteome.

Significance StatementThe cell of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, has a unique organelle called the apicoplast that produces essential metabolites. Most apicoplast proteins are encoded by the nucleus and it is unclear how the organelle maintains a stable proteome. Here, we address the question of organelle proteostasis by investigating the function of a large chaperonin complex. We show that it is essential for parasites viability due to its role in apicoplast functions. We demonstrate that it binds and stabilizes another large proteolytic complex, and further explore its potential as a drug target. This study reveals how balanced refolding and proteolysis safeguard the apicoplast proteome and opens a new avenue for antimalarial drug discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Tools like AlphaMissense leverage AlphaFold2 to predict missense variant pathogenicity with state of the art performance. However, AlphaMissense is deep learning-based, and its process to predict pathogenicity is opaque and does not explicitly predict the impact of missense variants on additional biophysical properties. Additionally, AlphaMissense is not publicly available, limiting accessibility. Here, we present AlphaRING, a publicly available tool that leverages AlphaFold2 and captures real physico chemical properties of variant residues to predict the pathogenicity of both characterised and uncharacterised missense variants. AlphaRING models wild-type and variant proteins using AlphaFold2 and identifies atomic level non covalent interactions via residue interaction network analysis using RING4. Unlike deep learning models, our scoring captures real physico chemical properties of mutated residues, providing interpretable insights into mutation effects. We developed novel formulas for each non-covalent bond type (hydrogen, ionic, {pi}-cation, {pi}-{pi} stacking, and {pi}-hydrogen), incorporating bond-specific energy and geometry values to calculate unique weighting scores per residue. The absolute log2 fold change between wild type and variant residue scores yields a non-negative AlphaRING score--the higher the score, the greater the predicted pathogenicity. Evaluating AlphaRING on over 1,300 human gold-standard missense variants curated by ClinVar expert panels, our results show effective distinction between benign and pathogenic variants, with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.79. This strong performance suggests that AlphaRING is a reliable, open-source tool suitable for high throughput structural predictions and large scale variant characterisation, accessible to non experts. By enabling detailed exploration of the relationship between genetic variation and protein structure, AlphaRING addresses key limitations of previous models and paves the way for broader applications in genetic research and precision medicine.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have excellent optical properties for sensing applications, which provide the possibility for designing a new generation of glucose sensors. In this study, we describe a method for covalently conjugate glucose oxidase (GOx) on SWCNTs as an optical glucose sensor. The functional groups are introduced by a photocatalytic reaction which acts as the handle for protein loading on SWCNTs. In this sp3 defect reaction, the optical properties of SWCNTs can be maintained. With a convenient bioconjugation reaction, the GOx could be covalently linked with SWCNTs. Compared to the non-covalent immobilization conjugates, the covalent conjugate sensor exhibits a much stronger optical response toward glucose, and the stability of the biosensor also increases in harsh conditions. At the same time, we also report the changing ratio of the original E11 and defected E11* peak during the bioconjugation reaction, which is also inspiring for reaction monitoring on SWCNTs.

Acute inhibition of ATR with ATR inhibitor (ATRi) triggers a surge in origin firing, leading to increased levels of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that rapidly deplete all available RPA. This leaves ssDNA unprotected and susceptible to breakage, a phenomenon known as replication catastrophe. However, the mechanism by which unprotected ssDNA breaks remains unclear. Here, we reveal that APOBEC3B is the key enzyme targeting unprotected ssDNA at replication forks, triggering a reaction cascade that induces fork collapse and PARP1 hyperactivation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that uracils generated by APOBEC3B at replication forks are removed by UNG2, creating abasic sites that are subsequently cleaved by APE1 endonuclease. Moreover, we demonstrate that APE1-mediated DNA cleavage is the critical enzymatic step for PARP1 trapping and hyperactivation in cells, regardless of how abasic sites are generated on DNA. Finally, we show that APOBEC3B-induced toxic PARP1 trapping in response to ATRi drives cell sensitivity to ATR inhibition, creating to a context of synthetic lethality when combined with PARP inhibitors. Together, these findings reveal the mechanisms that cause replication forks to break during replication catastrophe and explain why ATRi-treated cells are particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitors.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Any particular motif model has potential flaws due to shortcomings of the underlying experimental data and computational motif discovery algorithm. As a part of the Codebook/GRECO-BIT initiative, here we evaluated at large scale the cross-platform recognition performance of positional weight matrices (PWMs), which remain popular motif models in many practical applications. We applied ten different DNA motif discovery tools to generate PWMs from the ""Codebook"" data comprised of 4,237 experiments from five different platforms profiling the DNA-binding specificity of 394 human proteins, focusing on understudied transcription factors of different structural families. For many of the proteins, there was no prior knowledge of a genuine motif. By benchmarking-supported human curation, we constructed an approved subset of experiments comprising about 30% of all experiments and 50% of tested TFs which displayed consistent motifs across platforms and replicates. We present the Codebook Motif Explorer (https://mex.autosome.org), a detailed online catalog of DNA motifs, including the top-ranked PWMs, and the underlying source and benchmarking data. We demonstrate that in the case of high-quality experimental data, most of the popular motif discovery tools detect valid motifs and generate PWMs, which perform well both on genomic and synthetic data. Yet, for each of the algorithms, there were problematic combinations of proteins and platforms, and the basic motif properties such as nucleotide composition and information content offered little help in detecting such pitfalls. By combining multiple PMWs in decision trees, we demonstrate how our setup can be readily adapted to train and test binding specificity models more complex than PWMs. Overall, our study provides a rich motif catalog as a solid baseline for advanced models and highlights the power of the multi-platform multi-tool approach for reliable mapping of DNA binding specificities.

Using this method - Proximity Copy Paste (PCP) - we mapped the connectivity of individual nucleosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that chromatin is predominantly organized into regularly spaced nucleosome arrays whose properties differ according to transcriptional activity. Additionally, by mapping long-range, multi-way interactions we provide evidence that metaphase chromosomes are compacted by arrayed cohesin hubs. Using single-molecule nuclease footprinting data we define distinct chromatin states within a mixed population to show that noncanonical nucleosomes are a stable feature of chromatin. PCP is a versatile method allowing the connectivity of individual molecules to be mapped at high-resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

This problem often has multiple solutions that cannot be distinguished based on current maximum parsimony principles alone. Current algorithms use ad hoc criteria to select among these solutions, and decide, a priori, what patterns of metastatic spread are more likely, which is itself a key question posed by studies of metastasis seeking to use these tools. Here we introduce Metient, a freely available open-source tool which proposes multiple possible hypotheses of metastatic spread in a cohort of patients and rescores these hypotheses using independent data on genetic distance of metastasizing clones and organotropism. Metient is more accurate and is up to 50x faster than current state-of-the-art. Given a cohort of patients, Metient can calibrate its parsimony criteria, thereby identifying shared patterns of metastatic dissemination in the cohort. Reanalyzing metastasis in 169 patients based on 490 tumors, Metient automatically identifies cancer type-specific trends of metastatic dissemination in melanoma, high-risk neuroblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Metients reconstructions usually agree with semi-manual expert analysis, however, in many patients, Metient identifies more plausible migration histories than experts, and further finds that polyclonal seeding of metastases is more common than previously reported. By removing the need for hard constraints on what patterns of metastatic spread are most likely, Metient introduces a way to further our understanding of cancer type-specific metastatic spread.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

This dark-specific process, known as skotomorphogenesis, relies primarily on mitochondria and eventually etioplasts for energy. Our previous research shows that skotomorphogenesis is reprogrammed in response to mitochondrial and plastidial dysfunction. Even though the direct link between mitochondria and skotomorphogenesis was described, the impact of plastid dysfunction on early development could not be separated from mitochondrial stress. In this study, we aim to determine the direct connection between plastid functionality and skotomorphogenic response. In this situation, we analyze the phenotypic, molecular, and metabolic effects of treating etiolated seedlings using lincomycin and spectinomycin, which target plastid translation. Our results with the lincomycin treatment highlight the direct role of plastids in the control of early development, even in dark growth conditions, in the absence of any photosynthetic activity, and without the involvement of mitochondrial intermediates. Additionally, our findings suggest that GUN1 plays a regulatory role in regulating nuclear gene expression in response to plastid translation inhibition. Thanks to our study, we can now build a more precise model proposing a straight link between the reprogramming of early development and the dysfunction of plastids in dark-growth conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Furthermore, the detergent-mediated reconstitution of NDs is unlikely to recapitulate the precise composition or asymmetry of native membranes. To circumvent this fundamental limitation of traditional ND technology, we herein describe the development of membrane-solubilizing peptides to directly extract membrane proteins from native cell membranes into nanoscale discoids. By systematically protein engineering and screening, we created a new class of chemically modified Apolipoprotein-A1 mimetic peptides to enable the formation of detergent-free NDs (DeFrNDs) with high efficiency. NDs generated with these engineered membrane scaffold peptides are suitable for obtaining high-resolution structures using single-particle cryo-EM with native lipids. To further highlight the versatility of DeFrNDs, we directly extract a sampling of membrane signaling proteins with their surrounding native membranes for biochemical and biophysical interrogations.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Building on this framework, our study introduces a novel approach to understanding schizophrenia and exploring potential ways to adjust neural activity through synaptic restoration. Using a combination of magnetoencephalography data and dynamic causal modeling, we identified specific synaptic disturbances in schizophrenia patients, including increased NMDA receptor-mediated excitation in superficial pyramidal neurons and reduced GABA-B receptor-mediated inhibition between interneurons and pyramidal cells. These findings reveal a critical imbalance in excitation and inhibition within thalamo-cortical circuits, manifesting as altered gamma and alpha oscillations. The cornerstone of our research is an in silico synaptic restoration analysis, which demonstrates that targeted modifications to AMPA, NMDA, GABA-A, and GABA-B receptor-mediated connections can recalibrate altered neural activity in schizophrenia, aligning it with healthy control patterns. This restoration approach not only highlights the complex nature of synaptic dysfunction in the disorder but also identifies specific pathways as potential therapeutic targets, offering new avenues for investigating schizophrenia's diverse symptomatology.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

The use of sequence similarity networks (SSNs) is a standard method for exploring large sequence datasets, but is currently limited when scaling to very large datasets and when viewing more than one level (hierarchy) of homology. Here, we present a sequence analysis pipeline with a number of innovations that address some limitations of traditional SSNs. First, we develop a hierarchical visualization approach that captures the full range of homologies across protein superfamilies. Second, we leverage representations embedded by protein language models as an alternative homology metric to the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), showing that they produce comparable results when identifying isofunctional protein families. Finally, we demonstrate that unbiased representative sampling of sequences from genetic neighborhoods can be achieved through the use of hidden Markov models (HMMs) or vector representations. The utility of these methods is exemplified by updating the sequence-function analysis of the FMN/F420-binding split barrel superfamily and improving phylogenetic analyses. We provide our sequence exploration pipeline as publicly available code (ProteinClusterTools) and show it to be scalable to large datasets ([~]300k sequences) using desktop computers.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Here, we revisit an unresolved debate on whether browse is more nutritious than grasses for elephants, as browse is thought to have greater crude protein content. We first analyzed carbon isotopes in 102 fecal samples of Asian elephants to quantify the contribution of browsing and grazing to their diet in Nagarahole National Park, southern India. We show that elephants are predominantly browsers in the grass-scarce Nagarahole forests, in contrast with predominant grazing reported in the nearby grass-abundant savannas of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. We then compared the forage quality of high-browsing and high-grazing diets by analyzing these samples for two proxies of crude protein content (CP): nitrogen content (N%) and Carbon-to-Nitrogen ratio (C:N). Interestingly, high-browsing diets did not have higher N% or lower C:N (proxies for high CP) than low-browsing (high-grazing) diets. To explore the generality of this finding, we analyzed nutritional differences (i.e., CP and fibre content values) between browse and grass across 141 plant species consumed by Asian elephants. We show that woody browse and non-legume browse, which are major components of elephant browse, do not have appreciably higher CP than grasses. Our findings suggest that browsing and grazing broadly have similar nutritional value for such bulk-feeding mixed feeders. Finally, based on the observed habitat-wide variation in browsing, we provide a new framework for assessing how elephants shape woody vegetation across the forests and savannas of Asia, with important implications for conservation and carbon cycling.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Small molecules termed chemical chaperones can promote protein folding to alleviate ER stress. The bile acid tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), has been described as a chemical chaperone. While promising in models of protein folding diseases, TUDCA's mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we found TUDCA can rescue growth of yeast treated with the ER stressor tunicamycin (Tm), even in the absence of a functional UPR. In contrast, TUDCA failed to rescue growth on other ER stressors. Nor could TUDCA attenuate chronic UPR associated with specific gene deletions or over-expression of a misfolded mutant secretory protein. Neither pretreatment with or delayed addition of TUDCA conferred protection against Tm. Importantly, attenuation of Tm-induced toxicity required TUDCA's critical micelle forming concentration, suggesting a mechanism where TUDCA directly sequesters drugs. Indeed, in several assays, TUDCA treated cells closely resembled cells treated with lower doses of Tm. In addition, we found TUDCA can inhibit dyes from labeling intracellular compartments. Thus, our study challenges the model of TUDCA as a chemical chaperone and suggests that TUDCA decreases drug bioavailability, allowing cells to adapt to ER stress.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Here, we performed paired single nucleus gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiling from 44 human coronary arteries. To link disease variants to molecular traits, we developed a meta-map of 88 samples and discovered 11,182 single-cell chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTLs). Heritability enrichment analysis and disease variant mapping demonstrated that smooth muscle cells (SMCs) harbor the greatest genetic risk for CAD. To capture the continuum of SMC cell states in disease, we used dynamic single cell caQTL modeling for the first time in tissue to uncover QTLs whose effects are modified by cell state and expand our insight into genetic regulation of heterogenous cell populations. Notably, we identified a variant in the COL4A1/COL4A2 CAD GWAS locus which becomes a caQTL as SMCs de-differentiate by changing a transcription factor binding site for EGR1/2. To unbiasedly prioritize functional candidate genes, we built a genome-wide single cell variant to enhancer to gene (scV2E2G) map for human CAD to link disease variants to causal genes in cell types. Using this approach, we found several hundred genes predicted to be linked to disease variants in different cell types. Next, we performed genome-wide Hi-C in 16 human coronary arteries to build tissue specific maps of chromatin conformation and link disease variants to integrated chromatin hubs and distal target genes. Using this approach, we show that rs4887091 within the ADAMTS7 CAD GWAS locus modulates function of a super chromatin interactome through a change in a CTCF binding site. Finally, we used CRISPR interference to validate a distal gene, AMOTL2, liked to a CAD GWAS locus. Collectively we provide a disease-agnostic framework to translate human genetic findings to identify pathologic cell states and genes driving disease, producing a comprehensive scV2E2G map with genetic and tissue level convergence for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies.","NA","medrxiv",1731794915972

SOX2 is one of the key pluripotency transcription factors, expressed during embryonic development and active in adult stem cells. In cancer, SOX2 is frequently dysregulated and associated with tumor stemness and poor patient survival. SOX2 expression is suppressed in differentiated cells by tumor suppressor proteins that form a transcriptional repressive complex. We previously identified some of these proteins and found that their absence combined with deficiency in Trp53, leads to maximal dysregulated expression of Sox2. Using cancer cell lines of different origin and with different p53 status, we show here that manipulating TP53 to restore or decrease its activity results in repression or induction of SOX2, respectively. Mechanistically, we observed that the regulation of SOX2 expression by TP53 is transcriptional and identified Trp53 bound to the promoter region and the SRR2 enhancer of Sox2. Forcing high levels of SOX2 in cancer cells leads to morphological changes that molecularly correspond to the acquisition of a more mesenchymal phenotype correlating with an increased migratory capacity. Finally, the analysis of human breast cancer samples shows that this correlation between TP53 status, levels of expression of SOX2 and a more metastatic phenotype is also observed in cancer patients. Our results support the notion that lack of TP53 in tumor cells results in deregulated expression of developmental gene SOX2 with phenotypic consequences related with increased malignization.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Here we propose scCompass, which provides a data quality solution to build a large-scale, cross-species and model-friendly single-cell data collection. By applying standardized data pre-processing, scCompass integrates and curates transcriptomic data from 13 species and nearly 105 million single cells. Using this extensive dataset, we are able to archieve stable expression genes (SEGs) and organ-specific expression genes (OSGs) in human and mouse. We provide different scalable datasets that can be easily adapted for AI model training and the pretrained checkpoints with state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-cell foundataion models. In summary, the AI-readiness of scCompass, which combined with user-friendly data sharing, visualization and online analysis, greatly simplifies data access and exploitation for researchers in single cell biology(http://www.bdbe.cn/kun).","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Actinonin is the most potent natural inhibitor of peptide deformylase (PDF) and exerts antimicrobial and herbicidal bioactivity by disrupting protein synthesis. Here, we used a genomics-led approach to identify candidate biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) hypothesised to produce novel HPS-containing natural products. We show that one of these BGCs is on the pathogenicity megaplasmid of the plant pathogen Rhodococcus fascians and produces lydiamycin A, a macrocyclic pentapeptide. The presence of genes predicted to make a HPS-like chemophore informed the structural recharacterisation of lydiamycin via NMR and crystallography to show it features a rare 2-pentyl-succinyl chemophore. We demonstrate that lydiamycin A inhibits bacterial PDF in vitro and show that a cluster-situated PDF gene confers resistance to lydiamycin A, representing a novel self-immunity mechanism associated with the production of a PDF inhibitor. In planta competition assays showed that lydiamycin enhances the fitness of R. fascians during plant colonisation.

Yet, the repertoire of synthetic biocompatible wet adhesive materials is still limited. In most marine bioadhesive proteins, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) plays a significant role in strong interfacial interactions. The bioadhesive proteins in freshwater organisms are less well understood. The quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis) is a notorious freshwater invasive species in the Great Lakes that attaches to a plethora of surfaces via a byssus. To determine the adhesive proteins in the quagga mussel byssus, we utilized quantitative proteomics to identify the proteins enriched at the byssus-substrate interface. Among the identified proteins was the Dbfp7 protein family. Dbfp7 is a small, polymorphic, and mostly disordered protein that lacks significant amounts of DOPA. Atomic force microscopy measurements of Dbfp7 confirm that this protein has similar adhesion energy to marine mussel adhesive proteins in aqueous conditions despite lacking DOPA. These results suggest that freshwater mussels may employ different mechanisms of adhesion compared to marine byssates. The inclusion of Dbfp7 to the library of known wet bioadhesive proteins - the first functionally characterized freshwater bioadhesive protein to our knowledge - will allow for a better understanding of the fundamental properties required to achieve biocompatible wet adhesion, a crucial step for the development of bio-inspired wet adhesive materials, such as improved medical adhesives.

Significance StatementWhile many aquatic organisms evolved strategies to adhere to surfaces underwater, current synthetic biocompatible adhesives lack reliable adhesive strength in varying aqueous conditions. Investigating freshwater mussel adhesive proteins expands the current understanding of aquatic bioadhesion and offers potential advancements in wet adhesive technology. The discovery of a DOPA-deficient wet adhesive protein derived from the invasive quagga mussels presents a paradigm shift to the currently known mechanisms of byssal bioadhesion, thereby expanding the repertoire of wet adhesive strategies. Further, understanding the mechanism of adhesion employed by this biofouling species can help with the design of anti-fouling strategies to mitigate the impacts of these animals on the infrastructure and ecosystems in the Great Lakes and connected freshwater systems in North America.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

The data highlight the extensive contribution of transposable elements to TF evolution, both in cis and trans, and identify tens of thousands of conserved, base-level binding sites in the human genome. The use of multiple assays provides an unprecedented opportunity to benchmark and analyze TF sequence specificity, function, and evolution, as further explored in accompanying manuscripts. 1,421 human TFs are now associated with a DNA binding motif.

Recent work showed that multiple components of integrin-mediated focal adhesions including p130Cas can form LLPS, which govern adhesion dynamics and related cell behaviors. In this study, we found that the focal adhesion protein p130Cas drives formation of structures with the characteristics of LLPS that bud from focal adhesions into the cytoplasm. Condensing concentrated cytoplasm around p130Cas-coated beads allowed their isolation, which were enriched in a subset of focal adhesion proteins, mRNAs and RNA binding proteins, including those implicated in inhibiting mRNA translation. Plating cells on very high concentrations of fibronectin to induce large focal adhesions inhibited message translation which required p130Cas and correlated with droplet formation. Photo-induction of p130Cas condensates using the Cry2 system also reduced translation. These results identify a novel regulatory mechanism in which high adhesion limits message translation via induction of p130Cas-dependent cytoplasmic LLPS. This mechanism may contribute to the quiescent state of very strongly adhesive myofibroblasts and senescent cells.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Here we introduce DEGU (Distilling Ensembles for Genomic Uncertainty-aware models), a method that integrates ensemble learning and knowledge distillation to improve the robustness and explainability of DNN predictions. DEGU distills the predictions of an ensemble of DNNs into a single model, capturing both the average of the ensemble's predictions and the variability across them, with the latter representing epistemic (or model-based) uncertainty. DEGU also includes an optional auxiliary task to estimate aleatoric, or data-based, uncertainty by modeling variability across experimental replicates. By applying DEGU across various functional genomic prediction tasks, we demonstrate that DEGU-trained models inherit the performance benefits of ensembles in a single model, with improved generalization to out-of-distribution sequences and more consistent explanations of cis-regulatory mechanisms through attribution analysis. Moreover, DEGU-trained models provide calibrated uncertainty estimates, with conformal prediction offering coverage guarantees under minimal assumptions. Overall, DEGU paves the way for robust and trustworthy applications of deep learning in genomics research.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Due to limited understanding of its pathophysiology, early detection and the development of targeted therapies remain challenging. Definitive ante-mortem diagnosis is often unfeasible, and dogs with NME are frequently grouped under the broader MUO category. Our long-term objective is to identify distinct disease mechanisms within each MUO subtype to improve diagnostic accuracy, therapeutic approaches, and prognostic outcomes. To establish unique inflammatory patterns as they relate to neuropathologic changes in NME, we studied we studied the degree of immune cell infiltration, astrogliosis, demyelination, and microglial activation, comparing these factors with granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis (GME), a closely related MUO subtype. We found that in the leptomeninges, NME is characterized by mild immune cell infiltration, in contrast to the prominent, B cell-rich aggregates seen in GME. In the neuroparenchyma, both diseases exhibit a comparable degree of lymphocyte infiltration; however, demyelination is more pronounced in NME, particularly within the subcortical white matter. Notably, areas of the brain affected by NME display a reduction in astrogliosis, which is associated with a marked decrease in the expression of the water channel protein aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a reduction not observed in GME. Additionally, we found that AQP4 expression levels correlate with the extent of microglial and macrophage activation. These findings suggest that astrocyte dysfunction in regions of microglial inflammation is a driver of NME and with adaptive immune responses likely playing a supportive role.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

This study evaluates the perceived effectiveness of the Ifakara-Lupiro-Mang'ula (ILUMA) WMA in southern Tanzania among various stakeholders, focusing on its conservation, livelihoods and community development functions. Based on thematic analysis of perspectives shared by stakeholders at national, regional, district and village levels through in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and a public stakeholders meeting, the WMA was considered to have succeeded to only a very modest extent in achieving its intended goals. Essentially all participants narrated that the area is heavily encroached by human activities, including livestock grazing, agriculture, illegal fishing, meat poaching, deforestation, charcoal burning, timber harvesting and even permanent settlements. Contributing factors include a recently growing influx of agro-pastoralist immigrants, top-down political interference, financial constraints, financial mismanagement, limited resources for operations, lack of conservation education, investors or government support, and recent displacement of encroachment pressure from newly upgraded, centrally-managed protected areas nearby. To ensure future success and sustainability of the WMA, participants recommended enhancing stakeholder involvement and community participation in WMA management, improved collaboration with nearby centrally-managed protected areas for implementing operations, overhaul of the WMA constitution to reflect current best practices, building capacity among relevant village leaders and elected WMA representatives and initiating conservation education initiatives for the local community. Overall, the WMA should explore alternative income sources beyond tourism, to ensure direct benefits for the community member through sustainable, carefully-regulated access to natural resources, and resolve ongoing conflict over land use between the long-established villages that govern ILUMA and agro-pastoralists immigrants who have moved into the area more recently.

Further, in silico knockout analyses suggested that supplementation with aspartate (ASP) or asparagine (ASN) could potentially ameliorate these metabolic deficiencies.

From 2022, the national vaccination programme has been run twice per year, prioritising older age groups or those classified as clinically vulnerable. Here we assess the trends in COVID-19 outcomes between September 2023 and April 2024, using national-level data held by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

MethodsData linkage of national-level COVID-19 episode data, NHS emergency and hospital attendance data, and death registrations were used to analyse COVID-19 outcomes. Outcomes were defined as COVID-19 associated A&E attendances, hospital admissions, severe hospitalisations, and deaths.

The number and rate of each COVID-19 outcome category between September 2023 and April 2024 was calculated, stratified by clinical risk status and age and sex.

ResultsThe most common COVID-19 outcomes during this time-period were A&E attendance and hospital admission, with the rates highest among those aged 75 and over. Among this age group, all outcomes disproportionately affect those who have been identified as at clinical risk and those who were immunosuppressed.

High rates of A&E attendance and hospital admission were also observed among infants (under 6 months old) but were lower for more severe outcomes.

DiscussionGroups that were most affected by COVID-19 outcomes were currently prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination in England, which will help protect against more severe outcomes including admission to intensive care and death.

Routine national levels surveillance of COVID-19 outcomes is essential to monitor populations most of severe disease and informing vaccination policy.","NA","medrxiv",1731794915972

Through cytokine screening, we identified that interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}), a key mediator of inflammation, inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains. Mechanistically, IL-1{beta} activates RhoA/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway, which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at the cell-cell junctions, thus prevents syncytia formation.

Here we show that diagnosis and relapsed AML samples display similar clonal architecture patterns, but signaling mutations can drive increased clonal diversity specifically at relapse. We uncovered unique genotype-immunophenotype relationships regardless of disease state, suggesting leukemic lineage trajectories can be hard-wired by the mutations present. Analysis of longitudinal samples from patients on therapy identified dynamic clonal, transcriptomic, and immunophenotypic changes. Our studies provide resolved understanding of leukemic clonal evolution and the relationships between genotype and cell state in leukemia biology.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

However, the computational analysis required for scRNA-seq data interpretation remains a significant barrier for many researchers. We present scExplorer, an interactive web application that streamlines the analysis workflow from preprocessing through dimensional reduction to differential expression analysis. The platform provides an intuitive interface for real-time data exploration and visualization while maintaining compatibility with established analysis frameworks in both R and Python environments. scExplorer significantly reduces the technical knowledge and computational requirements needed to perform scRNA-seq analysis, enabling researchers to focus on biological insights rather than computational complexity. The application modular design ensures scalability and robust performance, making it a valuable tool for both small-scale and large-scale single-cell studies.

Advanced spatial transcriptomics has enabled biologists to break new ground in studies of molecular dynamics and cellular patterning during embryonic development with spatiotemporal resolution. To construct a comprehensive developmental trajectory, current three-dimensional (3D) spatial transcriptomic profiling leverages mouse embryos from gastrulation (E5.5) to organogenesis (E13.5) in continuity. However, a crucial phase for early organogenesis between E9.5 and E11.5 was deficient. To unveil the mystery of this stage, we present the 3D transcriptomics of mouse embryos at E9.5 and E11.5, with a widely applicable reconstruction workflow that bypasses sophisticated bioinformatic calculations. As our 3D atlas is generated at single-cell resolution, we demonstrate how organogenetic processes can be interpreted at different levels of granularity, from local cellular interactions to whole embryonic regionalization. We release the open-access database MOSTA3D (Mouse Organogenesis Spatiotemporal Transcriptomic Atlas in Three-dimensional) and hope a broader community will contribute to extending this framework from conception to senility in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

This extensive pleiotropy implies that multi-phenotype analyses are informative for characterizing genetic variation, as they facilitate the discovery of trait-specific and trait-shared variants and pathways ('genetic factors'). Previous efforts have estimated genetic factors using matrix factorization (MF) applied to numerous GWAS. However, existing methods are susceptible to spurious factors arising from residual confounding due to sample-sharing in biobank GWAS. Furthermore, MF approaches have historically estimated dense factors, loaded on most traits and variants, that are challenging to map onto interpretable biological pathways. To address these shortcomings, we introduce 'GWAS latent embeddings accounting for noise and regularization' (GLEANR), a MF method for detection of sparse genetic factors from summary statistics. GLEANR accounts for sample sharing between studies and uses regularization to estimate a data-driven number of interpretable factors. GLEANR is robust to confounding induced by shared samples and improves the replication of genetic factors derived from distinct biobanks. We used GLEANR to evaluate 137 diverse GWAS, identifying 58 factors that decompose the genetic architecture of input traits and have distinct signatures of negative selection and degrees of polygenicity. These sparse factors can be interpreted with respect to disease, cell-type, and pathway enrichment, such as three factors capturing platelet measure phenotypes enriched for disease-relevant markers corresponding to distinct stages of platelet differentiation. Overall, GLEANR is a powerful tool for discovering both trait-specific and shared pathways underlying complex traits from GWAS summary statistics.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Here, we assayed 284 mostly poorly characterized, putative human TFs using selective microfluidics-based ligand enrichment followed by sequencing (SMiLE-seq), revealing 72 new DNA binding motifs. To investigate whether some of the 158 TFs for which we did not find motifs preferably bind epigenetically modified DNA (i.e. methylated CG dinucleotides), we developed methylation-sensitive SMiLE-seq (meSMiLE-seq). This microfluidic assay simultaneously probes the affinity of a protein to methylated and unmethylated DNA, augmenting the capabilities of the original method to infer methylation-aware binding sites. We assayed 114 TFs with meSMiLE-seq and identified DNA-binding models for 48 proteins, including the known methylation-sensitive binding modes for POU5F1 and RFX5. For 11 TFs, binding to methylated DNA was preferred or resulted in the discovery of alternative, methylation-dependent motifs (e.g. PRDM13), while aversion towards methylated sequences was found for 13 TFs (e.g. USF3). Finally, we uncovered a potential role for ZHX2 as a putative binder of Z-DNA, a left-handed helical DNA structure which is adopted more frequently upon CpG methylation. Altogether, our study significantly expands the human TF codebook by identifying DNA binding motifs for 98 TFs, while providing a versatile platform to quantitatively assay the impact of DNA modifications on TF binding.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Here, we found that both KP.3.1.1 and XEC maintained the high ACE2-Spike binding affinity and pseudovirus infectivity of KP.3. Importantly, compared to KP.3, KP.3.1.1, and especially XEC, could further evade the neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma, even those elicited by KP.2-like breakthrough infections. Interestingly, both variants demonstrated increased resistance against monoclonal neutralizing antibodies targeting various epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD).

Early-life disruptions in these circuits are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting the importance of understanding their development. Our study uncovers that transcription factors SOX4, SOX11, and TFAP2D play a pivotal role in the development, identity, and PFC connectivity of these neurons. Using mouse models, we demonstrate that the absence of transcription factors SOX4 and SOX11 in post-mitotic ExNs dramatically reduces the size of the basolateral amygdala complex (BLC), claustrum, and PIR. SOX4 and SOX11 control BLC formation through direct regulation of Tfap2d expression. Cross-species analyses, including humans, identified conserved Tfap2d expression in developing ExNs of BLC, claustrum, paleocortex including PIR, and the associated transitional areas of the frontal, insular and temporal cortex. While the loss and haploinsufficiency of Tfap2d yield similar alterations in learned threat behaviors, differences emerge in the manifestation of Tfap2d dosage, particularly in terms of changes observed in BLC size and the connectivity pattern between the BLC and PFC. This underscores the significance of Tfap2d dosage in orchestrating developmental shifts in BLC-PFC connectivity and behavioral modifications reminiscent of symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Together, these findings reveal key elements of a conserved gene regulatory network that shapes the development and function of crucial ventropallial ExNs and their PFC connectivity and offer insights into their evolution and alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Fifty elderly subjects with a frailty score [&ge;]7 based on Frailty Assessment and Screening Tool (FAST) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Ashwagandha (ARE, n=25) or placebo (PL, n=25). Improvement in frailty after 8 weeks was assessed by FAST, 6-minute Walk Test (6MWT), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Short Form Survey (SF-12) scores. Blood samples were collected at baseline and week 8 for estimation of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), cortisol and Creatinine Kinase (CK). Significant improvement (p<0.01) in scores for FAST, 6MWTs, PSQI, MMSE, and SF-12 were seen with ARE after 8 weeks. Also, significant improvements (p<0.05) were observed in CK and in CRP with ARE.

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

However, it has also been suggested that innate immune responses may be triggered by viral transcription. In this study, we investigated whether an immunostimulatory RNA is produced during IAV transcription. We show that the IAV RNA polymerase can read though the polyadenylation signal during transcription termination, generating a capped complementary RNA (ccRNA), which contains the 5 cap of an IAV mRNA and the 3 terminus of a cRNA instead of a poly(A) tail. ccRNAs are detectable in vitro and in both ribonucleoprotein reconstitution assays and IAV infections. Mutations that disrupt polyadenylation enhance ccRNA synthesis and increase RIG-I-dependent innate immune activation. Notably, while ccRNA itself is not immunostimulatory, it forms a RIG-I agonist by hybridizing with a complementary negative-sense viral RNA. These findings thus identify a novel non-canonical IAV RNA species and suggest an alternative mechanism for RIG-I activation during IAV infection.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

The Metagenomics-Toolkit offers not only standard features expected in a metagenome workflow, such as quality control, assembly, binning, and annotation, but also distinctive features, such as plasmid identification based on various tools, the recovery of unassembled microbial community members and the discovery of microbial interdependencies through a combination of dereplication, co-occurrence, and genome-scale metabolic modeling. Furthermore, the Metagenomics-Toolkit includes a machine learning-optimized assembly step that tailors the peak RAM value requested by a metagenome assembler to match actual requirements, thereby minimizing the dependency on dedicated high-memory hardware. While the Metagenomics-Toolkit can be executed on user workstations, it also offers several optimizations for an efficient cloud-based cluster execution. We compare the Metagenomics-Toolkit to five commonly used metagenomics workflows and demonstrate the capabilities of the Metagenomics-Toolkit by executing it on 757 metagenome datasets from sewage samples for an investigation of a possible sewage core microbiome. The Metagenomics-Toolkit is open source and available at https://github.com/metagenomics/metagenomics-tk.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Prior to testing whether aging biomarkers may be useful as surrogate endpoints, it is first necessary to determine whether they are responsive to interventions that target aging. Epigenetic clocks are aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation with prognostic value for many aging outcomes. Many individual studies are beginning to explore whether epigenetic clocks are responsive to interventions. However, the diversity of both interventions and epigenetic clocks in different studies make them difficult to compare systematically. Here, we curate TranslAGE-Response, a harmonized database of 51 public and private longitudinal interventional studies and calculate a consistent set of 16 prominent epigenetic clocks for each study, along with 95 other DNAm biomarkers that help explain changes in each clock. With this database, we discover patterns of responsiveness across a variety of interventions and DNAm biomarkers. For example, clocks trained to predict mortality or pace of aging have the strongest response across all interventions and show consistent agreement with each other, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions drive the strongest response from DNAm biomarkers, and study population and study duration are key factors in driving responsiveness of DNAm biomarkers in an intervention. Some classes of interventions such as TNF-alpha inhibitors have strong, consistent effects across multiple studies, while others such as senolytic drugs have inconsistent effects. Clocks with multiple sub-scores (i.e. ""explainable clocks"") provide specificity and greater mechanistic insight into responsiveness of interventions than single-score clocks. Our work can help the geroscience field design future clinical trials, by guiding the choice of interventions, specific subsets of epigenetic clocks to minimize multiple testing, study duration, study population, and sample size, with the eventual aim of determining whether epigenetic clocks can be used as surrogate endpoints.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1731794915972

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.
